After announcing the latest surge of 30,000 new soldiers in a speech at West Point, it is clear that he is a president actively prosecuting a war, not merely tending to one that was left to him. The rest, though, is a bit blurry. According to his speech, Obama is escalating while retreating, adding more troops while also setting a date for their departure. Obama said he was putting pressure on the Afghan government, but he didn't suggest how. Some of the blurring was by design. He smudged the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, explaining that while he was sending troops to Afghanistan, the struggle was now more regional than it was when the war started eight years ago. The president's critics will complain about the 18-month deadline Obama set for starting the troop withdrawal. The president says he set a deadline to focus the minds of our partners in Afghanistan, but he also said the departure decision would be based on the recommendations of his field commanders. This is a version of the debate we had during the presidential campaign, when Obama set a 16-month deadline for withdrawal from Iraq. His advisers will no doubt admit--as they did during the campaign--that if military advisers say a withdrawal from Afghanistan in 18 months is inadvisable, then the troops won't leave. His Republican critics will also presumably agree, as John McCain did during the campaign, that if the commanders say it's OK to start leaving in 18 months, then that's just fine with them. Obama insisted that his deadline-that-isn't-a-deadline would put pressure on the Afghan government. ""The absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan."" But Obama said nothing in the speech that put actual pressure on the government. The surge can succeed militarily but won't be worth anything if Hamid Karzai doesn't change his behavior and the Afghan army doesn't improve. Obama knows the government in Kabul is corrupt or, more benignly, that Karzai's goals don't match America's. President Obama wants to pressure Kabul but can't be seen to be doing so too openly, or it will undermine Karzai with his own people. So President Obama announced no verifiable set of benchmarks or penalties for Afghanistan--the very requirements that Sen. Obama said were necessary for for Bush's Iraq troop surge in 2007. The president's strategy, according to administration officials, is to circumvent the Karzai government, inspiring regional agencies through financial incentives and basically avoiding the Kabul government altogether. Expectations for Afghanistan have dwindled considerably since May, when Obama talked about the United States and Afghanistan being linked by ""shared peace and prosperity."" Administration aides say the goal today is simply a country that won't fall to the Taliban and that will allow the United States to fight al-Qaida in Pakistan. Obama was clear tonight that nation-building is not an option. ""Some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort--one that would commit us to a nation-building project of up to a decade. I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests."" Obama's escalation despite such a weak partner in Kabul marks the final stage of Obama's evolution of opinion about the relationship between troop increases and the behavior of client states. In 2007, he faulted Bush's surge in part because the escalation would weaken Iraq's ability to take responsibility for its own future. The corruption and weakness of the Afghanistan government have only grown more apparent since Obama sent troops in March, and yet he is sending more. Obama's tone was methodical and emotionless. He often sounded like a reluctant warrior. He told the West Point students about signing condolence letters and greeting coffins arriving at Dover. ""As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service,"" said Obama. There were repeated references in the speech to the honor of their service. The president said twice that he didn't take his decision ""lightly."" This seemed like an obvious shot at Dick Cheney and other critics who had complained that he had taken too long to make his final decision. (On the day of the speech, the former vice president claimed that Obama had shown ""weakness."") Obama also spent considerable time reminding his audience about the troubled history of the Afghan war since the attacks of 9/11, implying that if Bush and Cheney had taken a little more time during the first seven years of the war, there would be no need for him to be giving the speech--or sending more troops into danger.

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/selfexamination.html	"For the last several months, President Obama has been trying to answer Sen. Obama's questions. The president's Afghanistan strategy review has been focused on the same issues Obama raised with Condoleezza Rice in January 2007, when he was on the Senate foreign relations committee and she was testifying about the troop surge in Iraq. Sen. Obama wanted to know how the president was going to force a reluctant partner to perform and when the president would say ""enough is enough"" if progress wasn't made. Obama focused then on the three C's (he didn't call them that because he doesn't like gimmicks): contract, conditions, and consequences. Was there a contract between the American and Iraqi governments that included agreed-upon benchmarks the Iraqis promised to meet to show they were building a sustainable government? Would the sending of future troops and money be conditioned on the Iraqis meeting those benchmarks? And what were the consequences if those benchmarks were not met? The question for President Obama's Tuesday night address at West Point is whether he will be able to meet his own test. It's clear he's been trying to. That's why his deliberations have been so careful, say aides. He's pressed the Pentagon to come up with clear guidelines for an exit strategy and measures to ensure that Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government reduces corruption and is able to build a viable military. In recent interviews, President Obama has promised that he will give the American people exactly what Sen. Obama was asking for from Condoleezza Rice. ""We will be able to present to the American people in very clear terms what exactly is at stake, what we intend to do, how we're going to succeed, how much it's going to cost, how long it's going to take,"" he told NBC News. But can Obama really do this? He seems to be promising a kind of antiseptic blueprint, measuring inputs and outputs and signaling points along the way where a little calibration will keep everything on track. The political benefit of this is that the more clearly the president draws the exit, the more easily he will be able to convince people that a troop increase is needed to reach it. But as the Illinois state senator pointed out in his famous 2002 speech opposing the Iraq war, even successful engagements are of undetermined length and cost. Or, to put it another way: Obama needs to get pretty specific on Tuesday in order to win support for his strategy (that's if Americans who have heard war promises before are still able to be convinced by them). Yet the more specific his claims, the more he boxes himself in down the road if things don't turn out as he pledges. Will Obama be able to provide precision about the U.S. arrangement with the Karzai government? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called the Afghan government ""an unworthy partner."" If that's true, all the more reason to get its commitments in writing--and attach them to automatic punishments. Not only would this keep Karzai in line it would help build domestic political support for the operation. What President Obama knows that Sen. Obama didn't talk about much is that public pressure on a client state can have the opposite of the intended effect. Karzai can't be seen as a mere puppet. If he is, he will lose legitimacy among his constituents, which in turn will weaken his ability to lead, which will make it more difficult for the United States to leave. In the end, it may not be in President Obama's interest to be as specific as Sen. Obama might have liked. The last question Sen. Obama asked in the hearing about Iraq is President Obama's greatest challenge in Afghanistan: Under what circumstances is the United States prepared to withdraw its troops? What are the consequences if the Karzai government doesn't perform as the president asks? This week president Obama said he is going to ""finish the job"" in Afghanistan. He made that commitment because a secure Afghanistan is vital to America's national security. At the same time, however, the claim undermines the idea of serious consequences for a government that doesn't perform. If I know you're going to finish the job no matter what, what's my incentive to make interim payments? In January 2007, Sen. Obama ran out of time before he could get real answers from the secretary of state. On Tuesday night, he'll have as much time as he needs to answer all of his own questions. Become a fan of John Dickerson on Facebook."	On Afghanistan, President Obama will have to answer Sen. Obama's questions.	['Pelosi', 'Obama']	[]
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/breast_practices.html	"If Americans were concerned about Congress getting its grubby hands on their Medicare, wait till it touches their breast implants. Among the ways the Senate health care bill pays for itself is a 5 percent tax on elective cosmetic surgery like tummy tucks, face lifts, hair plugs, collagen injections, and any other nonrequired procedures--a proposal known as the ""Botax."" Plastic surgeons, like many of their patients, aren't smiling. Industry groups like the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons have launched campaigns against the tax, arguing not only that it would hurt business during a recession--elective surgeries are  down already--but that it doesn't target the high rollers Congress is aiming for. Furthermore, says Big Knife, taxing cosmetic surgery could sag the economy as a whole, just when it needs a lift most. (The tax would raise an estimated $6 billion.) The tax seems like an easy populist sell. One imagines the main clientele of plastic surgeons as the cast of the Real Housewives of New Jersey. But the tax isn't as progressive as it sounds, say surgeons. According to a 2005 survey by the ASPS, one-third of people who get plastic surgery make less than $30,000 a year, 70 percent of clients make less than $60,000, 86 percent make less than $90,000, and only 13 percent make more than $90,000. (Of course, that survey was based on people planning to get elective surgery, not those who actually got it.) Indeed, cosmetic surgery is an industry supported largely by people who can't afford it--a full 85 percent of operations are paid for using credit, according to Middlebury sociology professor Laurie Essig. As a result, the tax would hit low-income consumers especially hard. But the argument isn't just that taxing plastic surgery is bad for the economy. It's also that plastic surgery itself is good for the economy. Call it a ... (rimshot, please) stimulus package. It's well established that attractive people have relatively high incomes. A 2005 study by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis found that good-looking people make about 5 percent more money than their average-looking counterparts, who in turn make 9 percent more than people with below-average looks. Daniel Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, found similar results in a new study. Assuming that cosmetic surgery on the whole improves one's physical appearance, which in turn correlates with higher income, it's not a stretch to conclude that going under the knife could make individual Americans better off, says Gordon Patzer, author of Looks: Why They Matter More Than You Ever Imagined. ""Cosmetic surgery makes you more attractive, and it also increases self esteem, confidence, and persuasiveness,"" all of which make you a more productive and valuable employee, says Patzer. Unfortunately--or maybe fortunately, for surgeons--numbers are hard to come by. No one really measures income levels before and after plastic surgery. But surgeons say there's plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that a larger cup size (or smoother nasal curvature or tighter buttocks) leads to a higher tax bracket. ""People come to us between jobs or after losing their jobs to freshen up, look fresh, look alert--to be or at least feel more competitive, which makes them more competitive,"" says Steven Hopping, past president of the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery who now runs the Center for Cosmetic Surgery in Washington. Renato Saltz, president of the ASAPS, says he sees job improvements all the time: ""A lot of these women are in their early 30s, have lost their self esteem, lost their spouse, they feel very insecure, they come in, have these procedures, and they immediately start losing weight, exercising, they are very proactive, many go back and get a job and become functional in society."" Hamermesh, who conducted the most-cited study on beauty and income, disagrees. Yes, his survey found that beauty does lead to higher wages. But he also says that attempts to improve one's attractiveness, whether with clothing, Brylcreem, or surgical intervention, make no difference when it comes to income. The reason, he says, is that people can tell the difference between natural beauty and artificial beauty. If you had a convincing facial overhaul, like John Travolta in Face/Off, you might get a raise. Otherwise, probably not. Hamermesh also disputes the notion that better looks lead to better productivity: ""Are they truly more productive, or just being favored relative to somebody else?"" Of course, if the surgeons are right that nips and tucks boost confidence, perhaps their patients will become more productive. After all, Hamermesh's own research found that good-looking executives bring in about 10 percent in extra sales relative to their average-looking colleagues. Big Knife would add that the only plan to tax cosmetic surgery so far, in New Jersey, has been a failure, costing $3 in administrative spending for every dollar of revenue. The main problem, apparently, has been the difficulty in defining ""elective"" versus ""reconstructive"" surgery. Who decides whether an operation to fix your nasal breathing, which also happens to make your nose look straighter, is functional or aesthetic? If Congress really wants to learn about the economics of cosmetic surgery, they should commission a study. If it turns out there's no connection between surgery and increased productivity, the case for a tax might be slightly stronger. But if there is a connection, then taxing cosmetic surgery could turn out to be like the surgery itself: a superficial fix for a deeper problem."	"The Senate wants to put a ""botax"" on cosmetic surgery. That's a bad idea."	[]	[]
4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/and_a_governor_shall_lead_them.html	"The future of the Republican Party will be shaped by a governor--but it's not likely to be Sarah Palin. The twin poles of the Republican Party were on display this week. One was at a Republican Governors Association meeting in Texas. The other was on the airwaves across the country as Palin methodically went rogue. Palin was certainly the bigger sensation. News about the meeting of Republican governors was lucky to make it to Page A13 (or, alternatively, sites like this). But the less-flashy bunch has more of what the party needs if it wants to remake its national image. At the RGA they were stressing their pragmatic, results-oriented approach to governing and ducking the chance to beat up on the president. These are the qualities required of a majority party trying to attract suburban women, young voters, and independents. Republicans have to look to their governors by default. Republicans in Congress have a roughly 60 percent disapproval rating. Governors also have a natural advantage because they have to actually, you know, govern, as opposed to Republicans in the House and Senate, who struggle in the minority. This means they might have actual results they can run on. Regardless of whether a governor becomes the national standard-bearer, governors can help the brand. If Republicans can point to electoral success and progress in statehouses, it helps beat back the notion, conveyed by many Republican congressional leaders, that the party is only about obstruction--or worse, obfuscation. Which brings us to Sarah Palin. For all of the hoopla, she is a limited politician. She's a force among a group of conservatives, but so is Rush Limbaugh. (And even Rush couldn't get John McCain defeated in the Republican primaries despite his best efforts.) Speculation about her political future has to be put in perspective. First, we're a long way off. Anything can happen. Most of the 2012 landscape will be determined by what Barack Obama does. But everyone's speculating about 2012--and Palin is being coy--so we'll briefly join in. Of course Palin says she's keeping her options open about running in the future. It helps keep her speaking fees high and keeps her supporters excited. She's shrewd. Why close off any options? Besides, she appears to be enjoying finally doing things her way after a campaign where she felt cooped up. Her abettors in this speculation are the Democratic National Committee and the media. The DNC wants Palin to be the face of the Republican future because Democrats think she's a clown. The media has an interest in portraying Palin as a viable political candidate because that justifies endless coverage. She'd still be worth covering if she were just a political personality, but at some point the coverage would wane. Considering her as a serious contender gives a pretext for more coverage--which is good for ratings. Just ask Oprah: Her show with Palin was Oprah's highest-rated since 2007, when 100 members of the Osmond family appeared. (For numerologists, that's 1 Palin = 100 Osmonds.) But popularity has its limits. According to Pollster.com's average, 38 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of her, while 49.2 percent view her unfavorably. When Hillary Clinton had similar (but better) numbers, Karl Rove argued that it made her a ""fatally flawed"" national candidate. Palin certainly taps into frustration with the federal government, a frustration that goes beyond the ""wing-nut base,"" as some liberals might like to call it. She's also anti-media and anti-smarty-pants elitists, which are also appealing qualities. But it takes more than tapping into frustration, and even channeling it, to win elections. To win a national election, a politician needs to appeal to voters beyond her base and offer more than paeans to family and the military. Couldn't Palin grow her support? She's limited there, too. Since she's no longer a governor, she's traded away her ability to attract non-base voters by pointing to accomplishments. This is why it was so hard for Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi to answer when asked if she was qualified to be president. One of the smoothest talkers in politics, he said he didn't know anything that ""disqualified"" her from office. Barack Obama didn't have a lot of bread-and-butter accomplishments to point to, either. He had, in fact, less governing experience than Palin already has. So experience can be gotten around. But to win the middle-class and suburban independent voters who were attracted by Barack Obama's promise to change the partisan ways of Washington would presumably require a softer tone. Palin shows no sign of going that route. Her most recent remarks about health care rationing may appeal to her base, but they're full of the jargon of talk radio. It gets people heated up, sure, but it's not the kind of language that national candidates usually use in order to court swing voters. Then there's the baggage. Palin already has to fight the quitter rap. The book has also created a long list of questions about her credibility. It's not just that former McCain staffers challenge her accounts--that can be written off as the he-said/she-said that attends any campaign--Palin has credibility problems, at times, with her own version of events. These are liabilities that will be exploited not by the ""lamestream media,"" as she calls it, but by any opponent she would have in a Republican primary. In the end, the Republican Party does not face a binary choice between Palin or Not Palin: There are ways to appeal to her voters and also show the qualities of day-to-day governing the Republican governors are trying to highlight. Now all the Republican Party has to do is figure out who that person is going to be. Become a fan of John Dickerson on  Facebook."

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/obamas_muslim_problem.html	"When it comes to any issue that involves Islam, President Obama starts with an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that he's seen as sympathetic to Muslims. The disadvantage is also that he's seen as sympathetic to Muslims. With a Muslim name, African Muslim ancestry on his father's side, and the experience of growing up in Indonesia for part of his childhood, Obama understands Islam better than any previous American president. This gives him an opportunity, which he has seized, to try to defuse Muslim hostility and pursue a less acrimonious relationship with Muslim nations. But 11 percent of the public continues to believe that the president is himself a Muslim. Though this is untrue and raises the question Colin Powell asked--so what if he were?--the president's heritage feeds a broader suspicion that he is too casual about the threat from America's Islamist enemies. Obama's challenge has always been to get the benefit of his special relationship with Islam while containing the political hazards it brings. With Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan's murdering rampage at Fort Hood, that balancing act just got a lot harder. Before Fort Hood, the president had mainly called for conciliation. In his first official interview as president, with the Arabic news network Al Arabiya, Obama said: ""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy."" He subsequently developed that theme in several speeches, including his June address at Cairo University, when he asked for ""a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world."" With the toll of Americans killed in Iraq dropping and the domestic fear of terrorism in decline, such sentiments played reasonably well at home. But the context of Obama's Islamic rapprochement was shifting even before Fort Hood. American casualties in Afghanistan have more than doubled over the past year. In the past several months, officials have also interrupted a rash of domestic terror plots. These include four men accused of planning to attack synagogues and shoot down military aircraft in Newburgh, N.Y.; an Afghan man charged with making bombs in Colorado; an alleged attempt by a Jordanian teenager to blow up a 60-story skyscraper in Dallas; and a Boston-area man's alleged plot to attack a shopping mall. Obama's olive-branch strategy may make America safer over the long term. In the short term, there's no empirical evidence that it has done so. With the massacre in Texas, Obama now confronts something that Bush did not face in the years after Sept. 11--not just a major act of domestic terrorism but one struck from inside our security apparatus. Fort Hood does much more serious damage to Obama's premise that greater friendliness toward Islam is a viable strategy for countering the Islamist threat. If the warning signs flashing from Nidal Hasan were ignored, the desire to avoid appearing prejudiced or unfair to Muslims may have been partly to blame. And this points to Obama's Muslim disadvantage. Almost immediately after the shooting, he began facing renewed accusations that he didn't take the radical Islamist threat to American security--at home or in Afghanistan--seriously enough. In his artful eulogy at the Nov. 10 memorial service at Fort Hood, Obama managed to balance the pressure to show toughness with his conciliatory approach. Without using the words Islam or Muslim, the president made clear what kind of fanaticism he was talking about. After stating that ""no faith justifies"" murder, he distinguished between America's tradition of religious tolerance and the religious extremism implicated in the killings. ""We're a nation that guarantees the freedom to worship as one chooses,"" he said. ""And instead of claiming God for our side, we remember Lincoln's words, and always pray to be on the side of God."" Obama is right to continue emphasizing the all-important distinction between religious views compatible with democratic pluralism and those that aren't. As he deals with the fallout of the attack, he must continue to separate Islamic extremism from Islam as a whole. But his words at Fort Hood, while comforting, do not really come to grips with the problem. America does not face a threat from the perversion of faith in general. We face a threat from the perversion of one faith in particular. The president needs to dip into his reservoir of good will to remind mainstream Muslims of their special responsibility. If militant Islamism is a distortion of their moderate beliefs, only their beliefs can defeat it. A version of this article also appears in this week's issue of Newsweek."	Does Obama need to speak more harshly about Islam?	['Obama']	['god']
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/obamas_real_afghanistan_decision.html	"Eight months and eight national-security meetings after announcing a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan and sending the first wave of additional troops, President Barack Obama stands on the verge of deciding whether that strategy was right and how many, if any, more soldiers to send. Why has he taken so long, and what did he and his advisers discuss in all those meetings that each went on for hours? Obama hinted at some of the answers in an interview this week with ABC News' Jake Tapper. Tapper asked the president why he didn't simply accept the recommendation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, to deploy 40,000 more troops. Obama replied that he'd asked McChrystal, other commanders, and civilian specialists ""a lot of questions"" in order to avoid ""a situation in which we resource something based on faulty premises."" He added, ""I wanted to make sure that we have tested all the assumptions that we're making before we send young men and women into harm's way."" The first of these assumptions, he said, is that sending more troops really would reduce al-Qaida's ability ""to attack the U.S. homeland."" It is, of course, this assumption that makes Americans at all interested in the fate of Afghanistan. The main rationale for staying in the war has always been that if Kabul fell to the Taliban, al-Qaida terrorists would once again move in and use the country as a ""sanctuary"" or ""safe haven"" from which to plan attacks on the United States, as they did on Sept. 11, 2001. However, this theory isn't as airtight as it may seem. Andrew Exum, a counterinsurgency specialist at the Center for a New American Security--as well as a former special-operations officer and an ambivalent advocate of sending more troops to Afghanistan--doubts the whole concept of a ""safe haven."" Al-Qaida or other anti-American terrorists could organize attacks right now in Somalia, Sudan, the northwestern frontier of Pakistan--or, for that matter, in certain neighborhoods of Paris, London, or New York City--so, it's worth asking, does securing Afghanistan make us any safer? Similarly, Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations, who ""only barely"" supports escalating the war, argues that 9/11 is the weakest rationale for such a policy; that the real threat is the impact that a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan might have on the security of nuclear-armed Pakistan. One could make a case that this concern alone justifies sending more troops, but it's a tough case to make politically. Could, or should, any president argue for escalating a war--spending hundreds of billions of dollars and losing possibly thousands of American lives--on a hunch about a hypothesis? (Even Biddle acknowledges that the causal link between Afghanistan falling and al-Qaida taking over Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is far from direct or certain.) But if Obama sends fewer troops than his commanders want, and if we're then attacked by terrorists again, he will be blamed--perhaps appropriately, perhaps not. Another assumption Obama said he wanted to test is that sending more troops would enhance ""the prospects of a functioning Afghan government"" and that the Afghan military and police wind up ""carrying the burden of their own security."" This test strikes at the core of counterinsurgency strategy, which Obama endorsed (sort of, in theory) last March and which McChrystal now says he needs 40,000 more troops to implement. Counterinsurgency involves protecting the local population from insurgency groups, so that the national government is better able to provide basic services, thus winning popular support and undermining the insurgents' appeal. If the government is particularly corrupt or incompetent, it won't be able to build on the security wrought by a good counterinsurgency campaign, thus nullifying our success and sacrifice. For this reason, Obama has expressed deep concerns over the fact that Afghan President Hamid Karzai's regime is riddled with corruption. So, to varying degrees, have Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, as well as McChrystal and Gen. David Petraeus, the head of U.S. Central Command. In the past week, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, retired Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, sent two classified cables to Obama, urging him not to send more troops until Karzai has cleaned up his act. Eikenberry's views were debated at this week's national security meeting and may have prodded Obama to demand that his commanders re- gauge their memo on military options to include estimates not only on how many troops and how much money each option would require but also on an exit strategy--how long it might take for the Afghan forces to provide security on their own. It may be impossible to make such a prediction, but that might only heighten suspicions that counterinsurgency is futile from the get-go. Some advocates of the strategy have cautioned that counterinsurgency campaigns take years, even decades, to bear fruit. In his interview with ABC's Tapper, Obama emphasized that he has no interest in buying into that sort of campaign. We are not looking ""at an indefinite stay"" or a ""permanent protectorate,"" he said. ""That, I think, would be unsustainable."" And earlier in the interview he said that, ""whatever investments we make,"" he's obligated to make sure that they are ""sustainable."" In the meantime, Obama told Tapper that he and his advisers ""are identifying not just a national government in Kabul but provincial government actors that have legitimacy in the right now."" This suggests that Obama is seeking ways to go around the central government--striking separate deals with provincial leaders or providing more or less intensive levels of support--if Karzai proves to be a feeble partner in our counterinsurgency campaign. Or it might suggest one way to exert leverage over Karzai--to make clear that we will empower regional players, and thus weaken his own standing, if he doesn't clean up his act, thus making his regime more legitimate in the eyes of his people and therefore better able to beat the Taliban in the competition for hearts and minds. None of Obama's remarks foretell what he will decide. His aides insist that he hasn't yet made up his mind on the big questions about Afghanistan and that all news reports to the contrary are untrue. The point, though, is that, contrary to the media's incessant focus on numbers, this has never been a decision primarily about troop levels. Last summer, retired Gen. Colin Powell advised Obama that the key question was not how many troops to send but what those troops should do--and that this was primarily his decision, not some general's. Obama seems to be following that advice. The military commanders have reportedly put four options on the table. News stories have emphasized how many more troops each option entails, ranging from 10,000 to 40,000. (Some accounts have put the highest requests at 44,000 or even 80,000, though it's widely assumed that those numbers are way out of line and may, in fact, have been put there simply to make 40,000--McChrystal's real desire--seem like a middle course.) But all these numbers merely reflect the real, underlying set of options, which concern, as Powell put it, what we should be doing in Afghanistan--what we can do, what we can't, what we should try, what we shouldn't bother trying, and the risks of doing or not doing each one. That's what the drawn-out discussions have been about, that's (in part) why it's taken so much time. According to some officials, after each of the eight sessions, Obama has been dissatisfied with the answers at some level and has hammered them to bring back more detail the next time--on the state of the Afghan army, on the impact that various deployments would have on the state of the U.S. Army, on a province-by-province breakdown of Afghan politics and security. All these questions directly, even crucially, affect calculations of acceptable risk or clear futility--the chances of success or failure. In his ABC interview, the president said he's now satisfied ""there's not an important question out there that has not been asked and that we haven't answered to the best of our abilities,"" and, as a result of this process, he will feel ""much more confident"" about whatever orders he ends up issuing. Obama may have inherited this war, but it's about to become his war and his alone. The least we can allow him is a sense of confidence in his first crucial judgment. Then, as he must know, the fight on all fronts begins."	What do they talk about in all those Afghanistan strategy sessions?	['Obama']	[]
8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/win_some_lose_some.html	"President Obama on Sunday celebrated the House's passage of health care reform with a vivid metaphorical message to the other side of the Capitol. ""Now it falls on the United States Senate,"" he said, ""to take the baton and bring this effort to the finish line on behalf of the American people."" He wishes this were as simple as a relay race. The legislative process does work in stages, it's true, but in other ways, the president's metaphor falls apart. First, the competitors aren't running in the next lane. They're rolling out hurdles (or gurneys, as the case may be). Second, the runner who just finished the first leg is now trying to tackle the guy with the baton. On Monday, less than 48 hours after the House passed the historic universal health care bill in a squeaker, 40 House Democrats pledged to reverse their support for reform if language restricting abortion rights was not removed. That'll be tricky. House leadership aides say the abortion measure, known as the Stupak-Pitts amendment, was crucial to the 220-215 victory. Without it, Speaker Nancy Pelosi would have lost as many as 40 votes. Perhaps the better metaphor for the process is the old one about a bump in the rug: When you push down one bump another appears somewhere else (often on cable TV). ""There are members on the right who will peel off if we do too much to satisfy people like me,"" says Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York, ""and there are those on the left who will peel off if we do too much to accommodate the likes of Joe Lieberman."" The bumps related to abortion aren't the only ones in the process. The Senate must now pass its own bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will have to build the kind of coalition Pelosi just did (except unlike in the House, where the parents can discipline the children, in the Senate there are no parents). Then, the two bills are melded in a conference committee and both chambers must vote on the final melange. That leaves lots of time for mischief. Herewith, a guide to some of the shifting factions in the health care debate: House pro-choice caucus: Forty members wrote to Pelosi arguing that the Stupak amendment ""represents an unprecedented and unacceptable restriction on women's ability to access the full range of reproductive health services to which they are lawfully entitled. We will not vote for a conference report that contains language that restricts women's right to choose any further than current law.""House supporters of the Stupak-Pitts amendment: 41 House Democrats voted to support the Stupak amendment, restricting abortion funding, who also voted to support the ultimate legislation.House public option holdouts: Dennis Kucinich is the most notable person in this category. He voted against the House health care bill because it did not include a sufficiently large government component. Weiner says that he has talked to other Democrats who say that while they voted for the House bill, they will not vote for the final conference bill if the public option is not included. The public option is likely to get weaker coming out of conference (in order to win Senate approval), but House leadership aides don't take the public option threats as seriously as they take the threats from those who have objections over abortion.House Democratic ""no"" votes: Thirty-nine Democrats voted against health care reform in the House. The vast majority did so because they had concerns about the bill's cost or the public option. If and/or when the House bill is melded with the Senate version and it contains greater cost saving measures or a weaker public option, then Pelosi might be able to pick up some of these votes. The downside is that doing so would almost certainly cause defections among liberals.Hispanic caucus: The Senate health care bill includes a provision barring illegal immigrants from purchasing insurance through the government insurance exchanges created by the legislation. The House bill does not include such a provision. If the bill that emerges from conference is too close to the Senate measure, Democratic leaders expect to see threats of defection from Hispanic members.Senate moderate Democrats: Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana are worried about cost and don't like the public option that Reid has included in the Senate version of health care reform. Nelson is strongly pro-life and is likely to offer his own version of the Stupak amendment. Unless Reid can find a few Republicans, he'll need these Senators to get to 60 votes. Senate liberals: If Reid accommodates moderates on abortion or the public option, will he lose Sen. Jay Rockefeller or Bernie Sanders, an independent?Joe Lieberman: An island unto himself. He will vote with Democrats to start debate but has promised to filibuster any public option.Senate Republicans: Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins. They are ""no"" votes for the moment but say they are still open to compromise.The anti-tax senators: ""We don't tax rich people,"" joked one Senate veteran when discussing the House provision for funding reform through a surtax on incomes of $500,000 or more. One reason: Senate campaigns are expensive and require donations from lots of people who make $500,000 or more.Anti-tax House members: The Senate plan to put a 40 percent tax on high-cost, ""Cadillac"" insurance plans has very little support among House Democrats, in large part because it is unacceptable to their union supporters. Before the House vote last Saturday, Obama made two key political points to Democratic House members. First, they needed to vote for health care because it would motivate the party base in 2010. Second, those who think they can run away from the president by voting against his signature legislative effort are kidding themselves. The president believes that a key lesson of the Republican rout of Democrats in 1994 was that Democrats who oppose their president can never get far enough away to survive politically. So if you're going to get stuck defending the president, you should get behind his plan and benefit from the political cover he'll work to give those who support him. That argument worked well enough to get through this leg of the race. But it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to keep a coalition together through the end of this process--whether it resembles a relay, a three-legged race, or an egg toss.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/bachmania.html	"Whether it was billing the event as a ""Super Bowl of Freedom"" or challenging conservatives to ""scare"" members of Congress, it worked. Rep. Michele Bachmann got thousands of protesters to flood the lawn in front of the Capitol building Thursday afternoon, joining her for what was originally described as a ""press conference"" but turned out to be a full-blown rally against health care reform--a mini-sequel to the 9/12 protest of two months ago. ""Hi everyone!"" Bachmann said to the cheering crowd. ""You came!"" On short notice, too. Bachmann planted the seed only last week when she told Sean Hannity of Fox News that she hoped viewers would come to her press conference and then walk through the congressional office buildings, ""up and down through the halls, find members of Congress, look at the whites of their eyes and say, 'Don't take away my health care.' "" That's essentially what happened. After  a brief introduction by Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri *, who led the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance--""It drives the liberals crazy""--and the National Anthem, Bachmann spoke of the protesters' place in history. ""Thomas Jefferson said revolution every now and then is a good thing,"" she said. It reminded her of what Abigail Adams wrote to John Adams: "" 'After all we've done, I wonder if generations unborn will know what was done for them.' ... We are that privileged generation,"" Bachmann said. Bachmann soon turned over the podium to actor Jon Voight, who in addition to starringin  National Treasure, she said, is ""a national treasure."" Voight played the role of pundit admirably. ""President Obama has his own obsession with trying to ram this health bill through and create a socialist America,"" he said. ""We as freedom-loving Americans must not be scared into Obama's radical Chicago tactics. His agenda is not for the poor. It's solely for his political gain. His lies and propaganda are all very blatant, shown to us by those who exposed ACORN, which is as corrupt as all the president's czars."" Republican leaders took turns riling up the crowd as well. ""I do think there is a rebellion going on in this country,"" said House Minority Leader John Boehner. ""How else could you get 10,000 people to show up with only a few days notice?"" Minority Whip Eric Cantor assured the audience that ""your efforts to stop this bill are being heard loud and clear."" Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee noted the number of women in the crowd and said the summer's town halls were ""like an inoculation to prevent the illness that is Pelosi care. ... So this is our booster shot!"" ""As a physician,"" said Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, ""I've got a diagnosis. ... Legislative malpractice!"" (Best metaphor of the day went to Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia, who told the audience, ""Go tell your Congress member that you're not going to eat this rotten, stinking fish that is Pelosi health care."") Many protesters measured their anger in miles. A woman named Lisa drove all the way from Dayton, Ohio, on Wednesday, even though she has to be in Michigan for a wedding Friday afternoon. ""That shows how angry we are,"" she said. Others came from West Virginia, Florida, and Texas. Ruth McCormick drove in from Ridgeville, Ind., just to let Democrats know that ""We're not going away."" Some of them dressed for the occasion. Before the speeches started, a man in a death costume grabbed a bullhorn and introduced two protesters dressed up as Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. Each was bound in chains and their clothes were spattered in blood. Baby dolls hung upside down from their chains. Around each wrist they wore bracelets made of what looked like small plastic fetuses. ""Whyyyy?"" moaned the Pelosi character. ""Why did I kill the babies?"" Nearby, Nancy Murphy of Annapolis, Md., complained that they were making the rally look bad. ""We want you to write about this,"" she said, indicating the rest of the protest. ""Not about that."" Indeed, many protesters were still livid over media coverage of the 9/12 protest, particularly the phrase teabagger. ""Do you see anyone here with nutsacks on their face?"" said one man to me. Their main grievance was health care reform--some periodically broke out into chants of ""Kill the bill!""--but many protesters saw reform as a part of a larger problem of government overreach: the stimulus, bailouts, and proposed cap-and-trade legislation. Dolores, a woman from the Dayton area, objected to the lies she saw coming out of the White House. The last time she came to Washington to protest, it was during the bombing of Cambodia in 1970. ""They were lying to us then, they're lying to us now,"" she said. Another woman went on about health care for a good five minutes before she asked whether I was aware that Obama showed ""signs of the Antichrist."" As the speeches wrapped up, the day entered phase two: confrontation. The destination was Pelosi's office. When I arrived, staffers were politely greeting people and inviting them to sign the guest book. (""Kill the bill!!!""--again, popular.) Someone soon brought copies of the 2,000-page legislation, which protesters proceeded to rip up and scatter across the floor. Police intervened, and about a dozen people were arrested to cries of ""Martin Luther King!"" and ""Letter From Birmingham Jail!"" (They weren't the only peaceful resistors of the day. Nine pro-health care reform protesters were jailed after a sit-in in front of Sen. Joe Lieberman's office.) Republican offices, meanwhile, were delighted. Frank Wolf of Virginia posted a sign on his office door: ""We are here. Please come in. Thanks."" Joe Wilson of South Carolina had a good 50 signatures in his guest book. (""He DID lie!"") Blackburn, who had spoken at the protest, was receiving well-wishers and posing for photos. Scott Garrett of New Jersey was holding court before a crowd of 40 people mesmerized by his remarks on the powers enumerated in the Constitution. That was the main difference between the 9/12 protests and Thursday's rally. While congressional Republicans largely responded to the September event, they spearheaded this one. Boehner stood alongside Jon Voight as he called Obama a liar and propagandist. (There were no calls for a Joe Wilson-style apology.) Cantor stood there while protesters raised signs suggesting that Obama ""takes his orders from the Rothschilds,"" the family that was once central to theories of Jewish world dominance. Thus did members of the GOP leadership court a subspecies of Republican that, as recently as a year ago, many would have ignored. (Many still do: Gov.-elect Chris Christie of New Jersey distanced himself from the tea parties during his campaign, and RNC Chairman Michael Steele was notably absent today.) Now, these fringe Republicans--with an assist by Bachmann, who first rose to prominence by suggesting that Obama wanted to round up young people up and send them to ""re-education camps""--are taking over Congress. Or, for a day anyway, the Capitol. Correction, Nov. 6:This article originally identified the speaker as Rep. Tom Price of Georgia. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

In Virginia and New Jersey, they dropped the incumbent Democratic Party and went with the Republican candidates. In New Jersey, voters said change was the quality that mattered most in their vote for governor, and among those voters, Chris Christie won by a margin of more than two to one. (The closely watched special election in New York's 23rd congressional district, where independent Douglas Hoffman ran as an agent of change, was too close to call.) It was a good evening for Republicans. Their candidates won, but they also picked up some good talking points--and, boy, do they need them. Voters have a low opinion of the Republican Party. In a variety of polls, the number of people willing to admit to pollsters that they belong to the GOP has been at its lowest level in 25 years. Washington Republicans have been trying to nationalize these gubernatorial elections: Voters were reacting to Obama's policies, they say. That's a stretch. Neither Republican candidate tried to run against Obama. (In Virginia, Bob McDonnell actually praised Obama when he won the Nobel Peace Prize.) But all this talk about Obama also obscures a better message: For the GOP, the stronger argument coming out of the 2009 elections is that voters are embracing Republican ideas. The GOP won in a purple state and in a solidly Democratic state. The Republican candidates killed among independents. In both New Jersey and Virginia, they won by two to one. Independent voters make up their largest share of the electorate since pollsters have been counting them. In 2006 and 2008, these voters backed Congressional Democrats, and in the 2008 presidential race, they went for Obama 51 percent to 47 percent over John McCain. They've been souring on his presidency, though, and now more disapprove of his performance than approve. In Virginia, Obama won 48 percent of independents. The Republican Bob McDonnell won 68 percent of those voters this time around. In New Jersey, Christie carried independents 58 percent to 31 percent, which helped him overcome the fact that there are 700,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans in that state. Winning independents is important because Democrats are trying to paint Republicans as captive to the most extreme wing of the party. Independents, who tend to dislike extremism of any sort, wouldn't be voting for Republicans if that were the case. The GOP just has to hope that the congressional race in New York's 23rd district gets less attention, regardless of the outcome. Of course, that's not what populist conservatives want. For them, a victory of the independent conservative candidate Hoffman would be a spark to light the bigger fire of a Grand National Realignment. Maybe. But it's going to be ugly getting from here to there, as conservatives bicker with moderates and party insiders bicker with self-styled outsiders. Indeed, fights are breaking out all over in the GOP. The latest is Sen. Olympia Snowe vs. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty over how the party should proceed on health care reform. The New York race already split the party--pitting Sarah Palin and Fred Thompson against Newt Gingrich and the Republican National Committee. A victory would probably spur more purity tests as conservatives seek to repeat their success. Any presidential candidate who wants to show his conservative credentials will seek out opportunities in future races like New York's 23rd district to call out ideologically impure candidates. That may have worked in the northernmost district of New York, where Palin could successfully weigh in. But it might not work elsewhere. In Virginia, for example, McDonnell resisted Palin's help. The evening was not a referendum on Obama. Each race had local issues--taxes in New Jersey and transportation in Virginia--and flawed candidates. By clear majorities, voters in New Jersey and Virginia said they weren't basing their decisions on the president. The 60 percent who said so in New Jersey almost matched the same number who gave a similar answer to the New York Times about George Bush on the eve of the 2005 gubernatorial elections. Thirty-nine percent said they were voting to oppose the president (though Bush's approval rating at the time was 39 percent, 12 points lower than Obama's is now). But that's not to say it was a good night for Obama. Voters are very jittery about the economy. In both New Jersey and Virginia, voters listed it as their top priority. Those voters overwhelmingly voted for Republicans. That's not good for Obama or his party going into the 2010 elections--unless, of course, the jobs picture turns around. A Democracy Corps poll sounded a warning on Election Day. In the 60 closest congressional districts, Republicans scored somewhat better than Democrats on the economy, particularly with messages that focused on the deficit. Here's more bad news for Obama and Democrats in 2010. Turnout for Democrats wasn't very good. Everyone knew that the Obama Democrats of 2008 wouldn't turn out. But the president visited both New Jersey and Virginia at least in part to help turn out the Democratic base. The number of young voters and African-American voters, both of whom were such a strong part of Obama's coalition, were down in both contests. In Virginia, African-American turnout was 15 percent, down from 20 percent in 2008. Voters aged 18 to 29 made up only 10 percent of the vote, down over 50 percent from last year. And here's why turnout matters to the unfinished health care debate. If Democrats start to think that Obama can't help them--or at least protect them--in next year's election, they'll feel less compelled to vote with him. They won't take his promises to give them cover if they have to take a hard vote. They'll pay particular attention to the New Jersey experience. As Corzine told Politico: ""One of the reasons that President Obama came in, was to excite the base."" Obama made five campaign stops for Corzine in the last few months. This past Sunday, he made two stops to bring out his most ardent supporters. The president can explain that he has more influence over issues in the national conversation that will be part of the 2010 races--and that he wasn't on the ballot anywhere in 2009. But members of Congress are a nervous bunch. This will make them more so. Any partisan who wanted to turn away from the election results could find solace in the By the People, which aired last night on HBO. It told the story of Obama's historic election one year ago (almost to the day). But the images of Obama's promises of change seemed disconnected from the familiar small politics of this year's election cycle--and the big one to come next year. The change hasn't come. Perhaps the more helpful message was playing just a few channels away on PBS. On Nova, a program traced the story of the evolution of man more than 3.2 million years ago. The message: Change takes time. Update, Nov. 4: Democrat Bill Owens won in New York's 23rd district, becoming the first of his party to hold that seat since the Civil War. This was a defeat for populist conservatives who had backed independent conservative Doug Hoffman but perhaps good news for Republicans who want to keep the party broad by allowing candidates who match their constituencies rather than the ideological tests of movement conservatives. Newt Gingrich argued that by purging the party of candidates who didn't agree (as ultimately happened with the Republican in this race), it would guarantee Obama's re-election and make Nancy Pelosi speaker for life because the pure conservative candidate wouldn't be able to win in more moderate districts. The win was also good news for Joe Biden. He made a last-minute trip to the district to campaign for Owens. Some thought it was risky. The opposition mocked him. Former Sen. Fred Thompson cracked: ""You know, the vice president's job is to attend funerals. Maybe he came a day early."" Biden mocked right back, taking on Hoffman-backer Sarah Palin during his visit. Talking about energy policy, he said, ""The fact of the matter is, Sarah Palin thinks the answer to energy is 'drill, baby, drill.' It's a lot more complicated, Sarah."" Palin was undaunted. On her Facebook page she wrote: ""The race for New York's 23rd District is not over, just postponed until 2010.  ... To the tireless grassroots patriots who worked so hard in that race and to future citizen-candidates like Doug, please remember Reagan's words of encouragement after his defeat in 1976: 'The cause goes on. Don't get cynical because look at yourselves and what you were willing to do, and recognize that there are millions and millions of Americans out there that want what you want, that want it to be that way, that want it to be a shining city on a hill.' The cause goes on."""	How last night's election results were bad for Obama.	['Obama', 'Pelosi', 'Christie', 'McCain']	[]
11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/pants_still_on_fire.html	"As soon as the words ""You lie!"" left Rep. Joe Wilson's lips during the president's September address to the joint session of Congress, the question was not so much, Will this hurt Joe Wilson? It was, How  much will this hurt Joe Wilson? Two months later, the answer is decisive: not at all. If anything, it's helping him. Wilson has been enjoying the fruits of his outburst--namely cash, respect, and a glut of attention as a spokesman for the not-gonna-take-it-anymore wing of the Republican Party. The question has now become, Is this helping or hurting the party? The South Carolina congressman pulled in nearly $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2009 in the wake of the scandal, his apology to President Obama, and his congressional wrist slap. (More than 75 percent of the cash came from out of state.) His opponent for 2010, Rob Miller, reaped a solid $1.7 million and eked out Wilson in the post-explosion polls. But since then, we've heard little from Miller and a lot from Wilson. Exhibit A, his recent comments on health care. Wilson described last Thursday, when House Democrats released their health care bill, as the ""darkest day in Congress."" Instead, he has been touting the Republicans' alternative bill, which would help protect doctors from lawsuits, prohibit the use of funds for abortions, and give people tax credits to buy health insurance on their own. He's also been vocal on the topic of swine flu. In an interview with CNS News, he said that President Obama should be held ""solely responsible"" for the national shortage of H1N1 vaccines. (Wilson's wife was diagnosed with swine flu in mid-October.) Meanwhile, Wilson has been on the road. Over the weekend, he stumped for New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Chris Christie in Morristown, N.J., at an event organized by the group NJTeaParty. Wilson didn't accept a speaking fee, the organizer told me in an e-mail. Rather, he came ""because he is a Patriot and a Hell of a decent guy!"" The only problem: Christie wasn't there. The Republican candidate was holding a separate event two miles away. When asked why he didn't stop by the Wilson event, Christie joked that he didn't want to give Democrats a photo-op. ""I had people waiting for me here,"" he said. Christie distanced himself from Wilson again Monday on Fox News: ""No, there was no campaigning with Joe Wilson,"" he said. ""I didn't see him. I heard he was in Morristown--we had a separate event in another part of Morristown. There was no campaigning with Joe Wilson yesterday."" Christie has not explicitly rejected Wilson's endorsement. But his reluctance to accept it is a sign of just how radioactive Wilson still is to moderate Republicans. (Christie isn't exactly a centrist, but he did beat out conservative Steve Lonegan in the primary.) While Wilson's become a symbol of the revolution on the right, the mainline GOP sees him as a crank. (Remember how quickly the leadership pushed him to apologize for his outcry?) Wilson's in good company, to be sure. He's just one of many members of Congress to flame their way to fame, including Rep. Michelle Bachmann, R-Minn.; Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla.; and Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif. But his personal success--and that of his vocal compatriots on the right--does not necessarily reflect good times for his party as a whole. While an increasing number of Americans identify as conservative, the portion who consider themselves Republicans has decreased to 20 percent--the lowest percentage in more than two decades. The reason for the slippage among GOP identification is up for debate. Moderates argue it's because the party is too conservative. Conservatives hold that it's because the party isn't conservative enough. It's impossible to say whether the success of firebrands like Wilson is causing the party's declining popularity. But the correlation is clearly strong enough to make vulnerable Republican candidates keep their distance."	Calling the president a liar has been good for Joe Wilson's career.

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/defining_afghanistan_down.html	"What will Afghanistan look like when American troops leave? President Obama will have to answer that question in the coming weeks at the same time he announces whether he'll be sending new troops into the fight. The answer will help define success for the military--and it's also key to selling Obama's new strategy to the public. Obama probably will manage expectations by setting them very low. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has said that no one should expect Afghanistan to be a paradise. That's an understatement of an understatement, given the level of government corruption and widespread instability. The country likely to emerge from U.S. occupation may well look like Bangladesh. Once described by Kissinger as an international basket case, it is now stable enough to keep from collapsing and is run by a government working to keep terrorists from setting up camps. (From basket case to best case!) George Bush talked of creating flowering democracies in the heart of the Middle East. During the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the deeper the commitment, the larger Bush's promises grew that once conflict ended, the country now at peace would lead a pleasant domino effect. Democracy and liberalism would spread quickly throughout the region. As Bush said on the eve of the Iraq war: ""A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to transform that vital region, by bringing hope and progress into the lives of millions."" Barack Obama came into office with a more realist view of the relationship between the democratic process and free societies. ""Elections aren't democracy, as we understand it,"" Obama told the Washington Post on the eve of his inauguration. With experience, President Obama has had to whittle that realism down further. ""The definition of what's possible in Afghanistan narrowed in March and it's going to narrow again,"" says a senior Pentagon official, referring to Obama's last big policy announcement on Afghanistan in March. How can the president justify new troops while refusing to oversell the good they can do? Obama is likely to pitch a vision of Afghanistan like the one John Kerry offered in his recent speech to the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Achieving our goals, my friends, does not require us to build a flawless democracy. It doesn't require us to defeat the Taliban in every corner of the country, or create a modern economy. What we're talking about is 'good enough' governance, basic sustainable development, and Afghan security forces capable enough that we can draw down our forces. "" So while everyone agrees that it's crucial for U.S. goals for the Afghan government to function, that's about where ambition stops. Anything better would be nice but not necessary. Afghanistan is 176th out of 180 on corruption perceptions Index. The Obama administration is not seeking to put it in the top half. (Bangladesh is ranked at 147. Another marker of good enough.) If the president doesn't decide to send tens of thousands of new troops, defining Afghanistan down helps explain why it's OK to send the limited number. If he decides to send no more troops, or a number closer to the low end of the range he's considering (say 10,000 to 15,000), lowering expectations will be necessary so that it won't look like he's underestimated the resources needed to do the job. That's been Obama's consistent claim about the Bush war effort. By contrast, he'll be able to argue that he didn't fail to remake Afghanistan because he didn't send enough troops, because he never promised a makeover. If the president commits to a number toward the middle of his commander's request (40,000 troops) then he will be committing to a solid counterinsurgency campaign. In that case, he'll need to lower expectations about the nature of Afghanistan to make it clear that he has not just committed the country to a new endless engagement that includes a flourishing society. ""Counterinsurgency has become synonymous with nation building,"" says a senior Pentagon official. ""We have to change that."" One way is to redefine the kind of nation that's being built."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/the_lieberman_option.html	"From now until health care reform either passes or dies, there will be a series of daily eruptions that will rival the ones from August for passion, confusion, and mischief. Today's installment was Sen. Joe Lieberman's announcement that he will filibuster the health care reform bill in the Senate because it includes a government-run insurance program, even though it's designed to allow states to ""opt out."" Because Democrats need 60 votes to end a filibuster, they need all 58 Democrats, plus independents Lieberman and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, to fight a unified Republican side. Without Joe, in other words, health care reform dies. This announcement caused a stir among certain kinds of liberals for two reasons. First, they hate Joe Lieberman with a pore-cleansing passion. The bill of particulars is long, but the primary inflammation comes from Lieberman's support of George Bush's Iraq policy and the senator's suggestion that Democrats who opposed Bush were unpatriotic. He also suggested, during the campaign, that Barack Obama did not always ""put his country first."" Second, Lieberman saw fit to announce his effort to kill one form of the public option just as the idea was rising from the table at the morgue. Senate majority leader Harry Reid, after spending weeks privately saying the public option was dead, decided to include a version of it in the Senate bill. Polls were also adding to the momentum. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll showed that 72 percent of Americans support a public option, the highest proportion yet. Republicans have been arguing for months that the public option is the root of all evil, yet it has only gotten more popular. Perhaps this latest poll would help frightened lawmakers get onboard. Then Joe happened. Lieberman's move was not news to Reid. Despite the recent fanfare over the majority leader's decision to include the public option in the bill he brings to the Senate floor, Reid has always assumed that the bill he brings to the floor would have to change before it could get 60 votes or more. That's why Reid reacted to the news with a shrug. ""Joe Lieberman is the least of Harry Reid's problems,"" said Reid at his weekly press conference, demonstrating, as Bob Dole did, that referring to yourself in the third person comes with the fancy title. Reid not only has to get Lieberman's vote but also can't afford to lose any of the handful of moderate Senate Democrats like Ben Nelson, Mary Landrieu, Evan Bayh, and Mark Pryor, all of whom have reservations about the public option. Most have been noncommittal, except Bayh who has taken a similar position to Lieberman's--supporting a filibuster on the final bill--if fees placed on the medical-device industry are not removed. The White House shares Reid's view of Lieberman. Aides have always assumed that the Senate legislation will change to get those Democratic votes, and perhaps win back Sen. Olympia Snowe and maybe even another Republican or two. Lieberman's move highlights how confusing the final health care slog is going to be and why there's so much room for misinterpretation. The obstacles to reform shift quickly. As recently as a few days ago it was unclear whether Reid would have 60 votes even to bring a health care bill to the floor of the Senate for a vote. When that was an issue, Lieberman's decision to support the Democratic leader was seen as good news for the public option. With that hurdle cleared though, now Lieberman is an impediment. The distinctions between the different public options under discussion also gets lost in the debate. As of now, there are many options on the public option. They range from a ""robust"" House version (basically an expansion of Medicare) to the ""trigger"" proposal favored by Olympia Snowe (the government gets involved only under limited conditions). In between are plans that would allow states to ""opt out"" of a public plan (they're part of it unless they say no) or ""opt in"" (they're not part of it unless they say yes). Just because a senator says he or she is open to a ""compromise"" on the public option does not mean that senator backs the Reid ""opt out"" plan. It could mean he or she will support a ""trigger,"" which those who back a ""robust public option"" don't consider a public option at all. It might be helpful to come to an agreement about what we mean by ""public option"" before determining how much support there is in the Senate for the measure. If public option is defined as any of the various plans described in the previous paragraph, then Harry Reid might have 60 votes for it. If it is defined as the specific public option now in the bill he has proposed, then he doesn't. Viewed in this context, Lieberman's announcement is not so much surprising as clarifying: It brings a vague situation into relief. Still, what's a Lieberman critic to think at the end of this episode? Genuine detractors don't need advice. They know what to think. Lieberman certainly can be accused of being a senator. He wants to be the one courted. Think of him as the new Olympia Snowe. The bazaar is open in the Senate, and moderate senators who want to be wooed by the White House can do so by expressing their ""concerns."" This can either be an act of ego or a legitimate use of power to get policy changes. In a sense, Lieberman is playing exactly the kind of hardball politics that public option advocates have been asking Obama to use against moderate senators. There are also grounds to question Lieberman's reasoning. In announcing his position, he said he's worried about the budget implications of the public plan. But the Congressional Budget Office has said the stronger versions of the public plan actually save money, which means Lieberman doesn't have much of a case. If you're going to hate Lieberman for this, however, you'll also have to lump in those other moderate Democrats who have also expressed concerns about the budget. For now, the Senate process is in a bit of a pause. In a week, the Congressional Budget Office economists and policy experts will deliver a verdict on the health care plan that includes Reid's version of the public option. That will flush out some of the moderate Democrats who have said they want to see that assessment before rendering a verdict of the kind Lieberman did today. Then it will be clearer whether Joe is really the only one standing in the way."	Joe Lieberman's stance on health care reform makes him even less popular among Democrats.

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/soul_search.html	"Odd-numbered election years are like panda bears: They take on special significance mainly because there are so few of them. Hence the attention being paid to the 2009 races in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York, all of which are being imbued with national import. The Virginia governor's race is seen as a referendum on President Barack Obama, who last year swung the state blue for the first time since 1964. The New Jersey election is being interpreted as a response to the financial bailout, which Gov. Jon Corzine supported. And the special election in New York's 23rd Congressional District to replace Rep. John McHugh, Obama's new Army secretary, is being treated as battle for the soul of the Republican Party. Overinterpreting off-year elections is a biennial tradition, and none of these elections has true national consequences. But the New York congressional race is especially ripe for overanalysis. There's conservative Democrat Bill Owens, who had to switch his party registration to run. The local Republican Party nominated Dede Scozzafava, a moderate assemblywoman who backs abortion rights and has voiced support for gay rights. And then there's Doug Hoffman, a runner-up for the GOP nomination who has now launched a third-party challenge as the nominee of the Conservative Party. Seizing on the election as a bellwether, Republican leaders everywhere have been endorsing candidates right and, well, more right. Scozzafava has Newt Gingrich and Susan Collins. Hoffman has racked up Sarah Palin, Fred Thompson, Rick Santorum, Michelle Bachman, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Dick Armey, and, after some hesitation, Tim Pawlenty. Michael Steele, head of the Republican National Committee, has been notably silent, neither speaking about the race nor directing any GOP money to Scozzafava's campaign. Polls, while few and vague, paint an overall picture of Hoffman eating into Scozzafava's initial lead. The most recent survey, commissioned by the conservative Club for Growth (which has generously funded Hoffman's campaign), has Hoffman leading both other candidates by 7 points. Two polls before that, by Daily Kos and Siena, had Owens leading Scozzafava by 5 points and 4 points, respectively, with Hoffman trailing behind. The fact is, no matter what happens, there's very little we can learn from this election. Here's a quick rundown of the inevitable interpretations in each victory scenario--and why they're wrong. What it means if Owens wins:Obama can get anyone elected! The Democratic machine cranked into high gear for Owens. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent more than $420,000 on TV advertising in the region. Bill Clinton put his name on a fundraising e-mail. Obama held a fundraiser in New York City. An Owens victory would show that the Democratic brand has not taken significant damage in the past year. Why that's wrong: An Owens victory would almost certainly show that Obama's appeal is limited to Obama himself. The district was long Republican until Obama won 52 percent of the vote in 2008. But Bill Owens is no Barack Obama, as he shows no signs of winning a majority of votes on Nov. 3. An Owens victory wouldn't mean that Obama has magically turned a red district permanently blue. Rather, it would mean that the conservative Hoffman had taken enough votes to keep moderate Scozzafava from winning--but not enough to win it himself. Assuming that Hoffman draws many of his votes from conservatives who are angry about the GOP's tepid response to a Democratic takeover, an Owens win wouldn't be a show of support for Democratic policies--it could plausibly be seen as a repudiation of them. What it means if Scozzafava wins: Moderate Republicans are back!If Scozzafava pulls this off--and it's unlikely, given her declining numbers and ailing finances--it would be treated as a signal that RINOs win and that the GOP should run more moderates in 2010. Tea parties, the groups that have protested Obama's fiscal policies, would remain in the category of ""vocal but ineffectual."" And Michael Steele, who has declined to send cash to Scozzafava as he did to the failed New York congressional candidate Jim Tedisco during the special election in March, would have some answering to do. Why that's wrong: New York's 23rd is where Republicans win. A Sozzafava win is no more an upset there than a Barney Frank victory in Massachusetts the year after Mitt Romney was voted in as governor. Nor would Hoffman's loss discredit the tea parties. As Republican districts go, this one is fairly moderate: It's only a ""R+1"" on Charlie Cook's Partisan Voting Index. Just because a moderate GOPer can win here doesn't mean she can do it in redder districts. Plus, tea parties may carry more weight in 2010, after another year of Democratic domination. What it means if Hoffman wins.Tea partay! A Hoffman victory would mean vindication for all the conservative Republicans--including his endorsers--who have been arguing for a return to the GOP's core values, i.e., social and fiscal conservatism. The conclusion: Republicans made a terrible error in assuming that running moderate candidates is the only way to defeat Democrats in the Obama era. Instead, they should double down and run right-wingers anywhere they can. In the revolution of 2010, Hoffman's win would be the shot heard round the world. Why that's wrong. There are 435 congressional districts. New York's 23rd is one of them. Yes, winning in a moderate area may signal a rightward drift in upstate New York. But it doesn't necessarily mean such a drift has occurred anywhere else. Moreover, Scozzafava has made some serious errors. Her fundraising has been weak, and the RNC's contributions nil. (Meanwhile, the Club for Growth has spent more than $250,000 backing Hoffman.) She has been widely mocked after calling the cops on a Weekly Standard reporter. And photos like this one suggest she has little in the way of image control. Finally, even if Hoffman wins, he almost certainly won't get a majority--most New Yorkers in the 23rd District will have voted for pro-life, pro-labor, pro-gay marriage candidates. Think this is all knee-jerk contrarianism? Not necessarily. Call it anti-conclusivity. Despite the temptation in politics to extrapolate from a single race, there's little one can honestly say. We might learn a quite a bit about New York's 23rd District on Nov. 3. But we won't learn much about 2010."

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/obamas_war_begins.html	"The war that President Barack Obama laid out at West Point Tuesday night--its rationale, strategy, tactics, and resources--is different, in ways large and small, from the war that George W. Bush fought (and didn't fight) in Afghanistan. Obama is sending 30,000 additional U.S. troops (beyond the 21,000 extra he sent in March, more than doubling our commitment overall). He is shifting their approach from strictly shooting and shelling bad guys to protecting the population and building up Afghan forces. And he is declaring a finite limit to our involvement. Some of his policies he explained well. On others, he left many questions open and raised a few new doubts. The issue that has caused the most controversy is his statement that our troops will begin to come home in July 2011. Critics say that this sends the wrong signal to the Afghan people; that if they think we're leaving in less than two years, they won't trust us to protect them in the first place; and that, in any case, the Taliban will simply lie low and ""wait us out."" This complaint misreads the policy. The key word in Obama's speech was that in July 2011, the United States will ""begin"" to transfer responsibility for security to the Afghan forces. The pace of this transfer--how quickly we will continue to withdraw and at what point we'll get out altogether--will be determined by ""conditions on the ground."" (Obama may not have underscored this phrase, but in a background press briefing earlier in the day, ""senior officials"" emphasized it strongly; one predicted that it would be the most misunderstood and misreported part of the speech.) In a telephone briefing after the speech for online journalists, Brig. Gen. John Nicholson, director of the Joint Staff's Pakistan-Afghanistan Coordination Cell, said that this determination of whether it's safe to withdraw further will be made district-by-district, province-by-province, and in coordination with the Afghans. He also said that the Afghan officers want this assurance that we'll leave when they're ready. Nonetheless, the critics do have a point. Why announce a date for when this process will begin? And why put it at July 2011, barely a year after the extra 30,000 troops are scheduled to arrive in the country? Is a year enough time to make the new strategy work? Won't there be pressure to declare that all is well, even if it isn't? Or if Obama decides to stay longer because things haven't gone as well as expected, won't impatience intensify among his party base, especially if the war hasn't picked up popular support? Clearly, the president was in a tight spot when writing this speech. He had to assure the American people that the war is not an ""open-ended"" commitment; yet at the same time, he had to assure the Afghans and Pakistanis that he'll be with them for as long as necessary. He handled the tension as agilely as anyone might have; but the resulting suspicions, on both sides, suggest that there may be no real way to resolve the contradiction. The politics of this war will be a balancing act from start to finish. Obama said that without such a deadline (or ""transition date,"" as one official called it), nobody--neither the United States, the NATO allies, the Afghans, nor the Pakistanis--would feel any sense of urgency about getting this mission accomplished. He's right about that. But given his hedging of the date--that July 2011 will mark only the beginning of a withdrawal and that whether it continues is an open question--some of these parties may treat it as a bluff. There is also good reason to doubt Obama's assurances that this is an international war and that the NATO allies, as well as some of the other nations supporting this effort, will be adding 5,000 more troops as well. This argument is disturbingly reminiscent of Bush's claims about the ""coalition of the willing"" during the Iraq war. Yes, 41 countries have troops in Afghanistan. But only nine of them have more than 1,000 (the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain), and only two of those (the United States and Britain) have more than 5,000. Seven of the allies have sent a mere 10 troops or fewer. When Bush left office, the United States contributed slightly less than half of the allied troops in Afghanistan. By the time Obama's escalation takes hold, this share will have risen to 70 percent. This is becoming more, not less, of an American war. It is also not yet clear why President Obama picked 30,000 as the magic number of troops. Was it a compromise between the 40,000 recommended by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and some lower number reportedly suggested by Vice President Joe Biden? Was it driven, at least in part, by budgetary factors? More to the point, what will they do once they get there? Gen. Nicholson said that the troops arriving soonest--7,000 Marines--will shore up the fight in central Helmand province. As others arrive, they'll be used for counterinsurgency campaigns in the eastern provinces, as trainers, or to provide a ""quick counter punch"" against the Taliban. We will presumably learn more when McChrystal and others begin their rounds of congressional hearings in the coming days and weeks. That said, there were some very good things in tonight's speech. Obama put the conflict in the context of the terrorist threat generally, not just to the United States but in a region seething with conflict and nuclear weapons. His rationale is unapologetically reminiscent of Bush's justification for the 2007 ""surge"" in Iraq. (In fact, the ""senior official"" referred to Obama's buildup as a ""surge."") These troops, Obama said in his speech, will ""help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans."" Remember Bush's ""As they stand up, we will stand down""? The similarity is, in one sense, a bit creepy. On the other hand, maybe Obama really will link our tactical-military achievements with local-political gains. This line in the speech was particularly encouraging: ""We will support Afghan ministries, governors, and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people""--suggesting that if President Hamid Karzai doesn't come through on his recent promises, we will cultivate tribal or community centers of power, which, given the nature of Afghan society, are crucial to fending off insurgents in any case. I also liked this statement: ""As president, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, or our interests, and I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces."" It outraged some TV commentators: How can Obama ask West Point's cadets for the ultimate sacrifice while shrugging that he can't afford to do everything on their behalf? Well, the answer is that we can't afford to do everything for this particular battle; there are limits to our patience, stamina, and physical abilities; and it's good to acknowledge this up front. Maybe it will spur the Afghan leaders to get serious about their responsibilities; maybe it will spur Pakistan's leaders to get still more serious about the threat that the Taliban pose to their own survival. If they don't get serious, none of this matters, anyway. Slate V: More Troops to Afghanistan"	Obama's war begins--but where does it end?	['Obama']	[]
16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/guarding_obama.html	"Polo-playing socialites Tareq and Michaele Salahi crashed a state dinner at the White House last week. The Secret Service assumed responsibility for the security breach, admitting that they hadn't checked to see if the Salahis were on the party's guest list. As Scout Tufankjian's slide show from January 2009 demonstrates, for all of its resources and sophistication, the Secret Service is still a corps of ordinary men who are perhaps better suited to spotting snipers than checking names against a guest list. Click here for a slide show on Obama's Secret Service detail. When people find out that I spent 23 months covering the Obama campaign, one of the first questions they ask (right after ""Is Obama still smoking?"") is about the Secret Service. Are the agents scary? Are they mean? What is it like working alongside them? Most people know very little about the Secret Service; they just picture the instantly recognizable image of a man in a suit with an earpiece. The one thing we do know about them--the fact that they are (in theory, at least) willing to sacrifice their lives for their protectees'--does little to dispel the mystery. And so, in addition to photographing the candidate and his crowds of supporters, I began to photograph Obama's Secret Service detail, fascinated by what it represented and what could be communicated through its image. Barack Obama received Secret Service protection earlier than any other candidate in history because of what is euphemistically referred to as ""the historic nature of the campaign"" (i.e., the fact that he is a black guy). RFK, as the agents liked to remind me, did not have Secret Service protection. He had only three bodyguards when he was killed in that hotel kitchen: a former FBI agent, a gold-medal decathlete, and an ex-NFL lineman. Obama, however, was surrounded by a 24/7 Secret Service detail beginning in the spring of 2007, mere months after he announced his run. Obviously, over of the course of the campaign, I got to know many of the agents quite well. In fact, it sometimes felt like traveling with the 40 or so older brothers and sisters I had never wanted: They were nosy and overprotective and fun to be around. Best of all, they almost never wanted to talk politics, a quality so rare on the campaign trail that it immediately elevates those who possess it to most-favored-interlocutor status. The only thing worse than hearing the same speech over and over is hearing people talk about it endlessly at bars afterward. I remember a long night in Pennsylvania when a Fox producer and I tried to figure out exactly what we would have to do to get them to shoot us. (Answer: nothing. They would never need to. We were pathetic, and they could take us out without firing a shot.) Rather than being impressed by them, we would tease them about the boring aspects of the job, asking them how many tiles were in the ceiling outside of Obama's room and laughing at them as they stood guard next to a steaming dumpster. Despite the teasing, however, I came away from this experience deeply impressed by their skill and professionalism. People would come up to Obama as he was shaking hands and express their concerns, nakedly expressing the fear that he might be assassinated. He would always brush their words aside, saying that he had the best security in the world. And he is right. As I photographed his Secret Service agents, I found myself becoming more aware of their attentiveness as we both scanned the crowds--they looking for threats and me looking for a particularly excited supporter. Often we would find ourselves focused on the same person. In addition, I also began to realize how respectful, grateful, and protective Americans feel toward the Secret Service. I was often berated by Obama supporters telling me I was putting the agents in harm's way by photographing them, even though I most certainly was not. They aren't really ""secret,"" and as long as I stayed out of Obama's exit paths and did not block their field of vision, I could take as many pictures as I wanted. The thing I really enjoyed about photographing them, though, was the surreality of it all. I saw agents high on lighted staircases, agents standing alone on cold airfields, wearing blue plastic booties at research facilities, protective eyewear in factories, hands folded, earpieces in. They often seemed invisible in plain sight, but they were always there and always watching.."	Photos of Obama's Secret Service detail.	['Obama']	[]
17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/poll_dance.html	"According to the latest poll numbers, Sarah Palin is nearly as popular as Barack Obama. Or maybe it's that Barack Obama is nearly as unpopular as Sarah Palin. At least that's how some commentators see it: As the Los Angeles Times' Andrew Malcolm noted Monday, ""Sarah Palin's poll numbers are strengthening. And President Obama's are sliding."" In Tuesday's Washington Post, former Bush strategist Matthew Dowd wrote that""Palin's favorability numbers are a mirror image of those of Obama."" The problem is, they're comparing apples to oranges. Both columns refer to polls that show Palin's favorability rating at around 43 percent--mere points away from Obama's job-approval rating of 49 percent. But as Media Matters has pointed out, favorability and job approval aren't the same thing. A politician's favorability rating is a general sense of the public's feeling about him. His job-approval rating is an evaluation of the work he's doing. When you compare favorability ratings--apples to apples--Obama still leads Palin by a distance. The latest Gallup poll puts Obama's favorability 16 points ahead of Palin's, ABC puts his lead at 18 points, and CNN says it's 18 points higher. (Only Fox has the gap in single digits, with a seven-point spread.) It's impossible to compare their job-approval numbers because, well, Palin doesn't have a job. You'd think the two measurements would be roughly the same--but they're not. In general, politicians tend to have better favorability ratings than job-approval ratings. That has been the case with Obama since January, as it was with George W. Bush, who maintained high favorability (some might call it likeability) even when the public disapproved of what he was doing in office. There are exceptions: During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Bill Clinton had a lower favorability than job-approval rating. Many people who despised him personally liked where he was steering the country. Still, the two numbers get conflated all the time. The problem is the fuzzy ways pollsters word their questions. ""Pollsters love vague questions because they're easy to make comparable,"" says Mark Blumenthal of Pollster.com. The more specific the questions' wording, the bigger the disparity. For example, a recent Quinnipiac poll explicitly distinguished between liking Obama ""as a person"" and liking ""his policies."" A full 74 percent of respondents said they liked him as a person. But of that group, a third said they didn't like his policies. The gap owes partly to the realities of governing: If you ask people how Obama is doing at his job, they're more likely to think of the 10 percent unemployment rate than if you ask about Obama in general. So when it comes to approval ratings, someone who doesn't hold office often has a built-in advantage over someone who does. The job-approval rating also predates the favorability rating. Since the 1940s, Gallup has asked Americans how presidents are doing at their job. It wasn't until the 1970s and '80s that favorability ratings became popular. Favorability is especially useful for campaign pollsters, since it allows them to compare candidates who already hold office with those who don't. Nor is favorability/job approval the only common conflation. People also tend to compare different types of job-approval questions--even when the questions yield very different types of answers. For example, some pollsters ask simply, Do you approve or disapprove of how Person X is doing? Others ask respondents to rate a politician's job as excellent, good, fair, or poor. The latter type of question tends to elicit a more negative response, because many people think of ""fair"" as a neutral, or even mildly positive, response. Same goes for favorability polls. The Gallup poll goes for the simple binary: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the president? Others, like the CBS/New York Times poll, reflect more nuance: ""Is your opinion of Barack Obama favorable, not favorable, undecided, or haven't you heard enough about Barack Obama yet to have an opinion?"" The latter formulation produces lower favorability ratings. The reason, says Blumenthal, is a positivity bias. When respondents don't really have an opinion but aren't presented with a ""don't know"" option, they tend to answer positively--a phenomenon that's been dubbed  satisficing. Hence the disparity between Obama's approval rating when respondents are given the option to say they don't know enough to decide (Quinnipiac and CBS News both put him at 50 percent) and when they aren't (Daily Kos, ABC News, and Fox News put him at 55 percent, 61 percent, and 54 percent, respectively). Things get even murkier when you get into issue-based polls. A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll caused a stir over the summer when it changed the formulation of a question about the public option. Initially, the poll asked, ""How important do you feel it is to give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance?"" When 76 percent of respondents said it was ""extremely"" or ""quite"" important, supporters of the public plan celebrated. Three-quarters of Americans want a public option! But when the pollsters reworded the question to be more straightforward--""Would you favor or oppose creating a public health care plan administered by the federal government that would compete directly with private health insurance companies?""--only 46 percent of respondents said they supported the public option. Liberals cried foul. But, of course, they are different questions. ""It was silly to conflate them as if they had same meaning,"" says Blumenthal. ""One was about the importance of having a choice. The other was asking them to react to a description of what the public option is."" Add on the fact that only a bare majority of Americans even knows that a public option has something to do with health care, and it's easy to see why broad statements about public opinion on reform are so often misleading. To make things even more confusing, Palin has her own ratings gap. Only 28 percent of Americans think she's qualified to be president, according to a CNN poll. But people admire her personal qualities. A majority of Americans thinks she's ""honest and trustworthy"" and ""care[s] about the needs of people like you,"" and 64 percent believe she's ""a good role model for women."" It's this sort of disparity of views--hard to capture in a single number--that makes blanket dualities like favorable/unfavorable, popular/unpopular, and approve/disapprove, so limited."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/the_deadline_presidency.html	"As a professor of constitutional law, Barack Obama gave his students eight hours to complete his exam --even though the exam was designed, he wrote in the instructions, ""to be completed in three hours."" Now that he's president, Obama could use that kind of cushion. Upon taking office, the president promised that the prison at Guantanamo Bay would close in a year. He now says it will not. He demanded that Congress pass a health care bill by August. It still hasn't. The president's promise to sign a health care bill this year has now been pushed into 2010. Obama was also going to announce his new Afghanistan strategy in early November. It may now come as much as a month later. There are also delays--some, of course, beyond his control--in seating judicial nominations and passing climate-change legislation. Whether you think this is a big deal depends on what you think of deadlines. (I'm on deadline right now, so you know where I stand.) The president has a professor's fondness for deadlines and a writer's lack of respect for them. ""If you don't set a deadline in this town, nothing happens,"" he said last July before Congress sailed past his August deadline on the way to the beach for recess. His aides share the boss's view. When White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel heard Senate Majority Harry Reid suggest that a vote on the health care bill may not take place until next year, he immediately contacted Reid to voice his displeasure. Yet Obama doesn't like it when people point out that he's missing deadlines. He warns against judging him out of context. Obama rails against the media's and his critics' artificial deadlines--why haven't you ended the wars yet, he asks, mockingly. Indeed he has been busy. The problem with all of this is that it is Obama himself who set the deadlines in the first place. Even now, he's setting suspiciously deadline-like expectations on Afghanistan policy as other deadlines on other issues pass. Deadlines matter for several reasons. First, as a tactical matter, a deadline creates a momentum that can work in the deadline setter's favor: The person who makes the deadline limits the options of the person who has to meet the deadline while simultaneously putting pressure on him to make a choice. This motivates people to accept limited options they might not otherwise find attractive. Explaining this principle in  Managing With Power, professor Jeffrey Pfeffer quotes the country music song ""The Girls All Look Prettier at Closing Time."" (See also: getting the bum's rush.) In the Senate, recalcitrant Democrats who do not agree with the president's health care program know how this works. That's why they're threatening to block debate on reform before it even starts. They have more leverage now, before debate begins, than they would after the bill has been debated and the looming deadline of a final vote would pressure them not to be the one person standing in the way. With homework as with health care, when deadlines are blown, it gives people who have had a deadline imposed on them a chance to make mischief. This is what happened in August with Republicans. If you delay long enough, you can get negotiations started afresh on more favorable terms. Missed deadlines also give a president's opponents quotes they can use to make him look out of touch, like this one from Raleigh, N.C., in late July: ""First of all, this [health care] bill, even in the best-case scenario, will not be signed--we won't even vote on it probably until the end of September or the middle of October."" Deadlines also matter in measuring the hard-to-measure but crucial quality of presidential prestige and credibility. If a president's deadlines are meaningless, then he is less able to get other politicians to do what he wants. Voters may simply view him as ineffective. Blowing a deadline isn't all downside, of course. Even if you buy the downsides to delaying a decision on Afghanistan--confusing allies, irritating the military and inspiring insurgents about America's lack of will--rash decision-making has also been pretty thoroughly debunked in the last eight years of war. Politically, letting a deadline slip can also give your supporters more time to build support for your program. (It's the flip side of allowing your opponents more time to make mischief.) There's some evidence that Obama's supporters wanted him to slow down in August. Experience has not cured Obama of the deadline habit. If there's anything that has upset presidential deadline setting in recent years, it is war. And yet when describing his coming Afghanistan policy, the president is full of clarity and deadline talk. ""I'm going to be able to present to the American people, in very clear terms, what exactly is at stake, what we intend to do, how we're going to succeed, how much it's going to cost, how long it's going to take,"" Obama told NBC's Chuck Todd. Those may be the things he says when he announces his new plan. But given the uncertainty of war, he's not going to be able to keep all of his promises. Obama also made another declaration he can't really mean. Asked if the press leaks about his Afghanistan strategy sessions upset him as much as they do Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Obama said they bother him even more. He went on to tell CBS's Chip Reid that leaking was a firing offense. Does he really mean that? Not only did a similar policy trip up his predecessor, but when Gates complained about the leaking, he wasn't just talking about members of the military. He was also talking about White House aides. If Obama enforced his rule, he wouldn't have much staff left, joked one Pentagon aide. Fortunately, the definition of leaking is pretty flexible. It's sort of like a deadline that way.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/sarahs_book_club.html	"Sarah Palin has always enjoyed complaining about the ""media filter."" But that was before she met Oprah Winfrey. Palin's appearance on Oprah on Monday afternoon, the first big interview on the tour for her book  Going Rogue: An American Life, is not likely to relaunch Palin's career. It will take more than a single sit-down, no matter how successful, to change the minds of the six in 10 Americans who think she's unqualified to be president. The Oprah appearancedid, however, play to Palin's strengths in a way that no major interview has, save her occasional T-ball practice session with Sean Hannity. Most of Palin's flubs during the 2008 campaign resulted from a lack of preparation. She stumbled on Katie Couric's question about Supreme Court cases because she simply wasn't expecting it. She couldn't name any publications she read because she was shocked, she says, by the condescension of the question. When she said she was disappointed the McCain camp was pulling out of Michigan, it was because she hadn't been briefed on the campaign's official response. When handed a great script--at the Republican National Convention, for example--she killed. This time, the interview was on Palin's terms. Oprah did stray from the Palin-approved script here and there, peppering the former governor with questions about her abrupt resignation and Levi Johnston and possible presidential ambitions. But the interview was fundamentally about Palin's book. These were questions she has had plenty of time to mull. As a result, the interview, like her book, felt like a methodical refutation of her critics. You thought Palin doesn't read much? ""Obviously ... I am a lover of books and magazines,"" she said. (As if to prove it, her book name checks C.S. Lewis, National Geographic, Ogden Nash,  Animal Farm, Sports Illustrated, and John Steinbeck--all within the first 30 pages.) You thought she hated Levi? Not at all; she's just very sad for him. You heard that she had seriously thought about aborting Trig, her child with Down syndrome? No, she'd merely considered the possibility that other women might do something like that. Palin gave some of the most cogent answers of her short life on the national stage. Why didn't she just tell Katie Couric what newspapers she read?  Could she really not think of any? ""No, it was more like, are you kidding me?"" says Palin. ""Are you really asking me? To me, it was in the context of, Do you read? How do you stay informed? You're way up there. It seems like she was discovering some nomadic tribe, this member of a tribe from some Neanderthal cave in Alaska, asking me how do you stay in touch with the real world."" Other answers were clear--you could understand what she was saying--but the underlying ideas were not. Palin has yet to come up with a convincing story for why she quit her job as governor of Alaska in June, with two years to go in her term. ""I came back from those 10 weeks on the road to a new normal in Alaska,"" she explained to Oprah. ""Everything had so changed from my administration. There were so many opposition researchers up there"" that she felt her presence was ""hampering"" the state rather than helping it. ""I wasn't able to get up there and talk about issues that were important to me, or an ethics violation would be filed."" If victimization is a common tool in the Palin tool kit--she gave a special shout out to ""the haters and the critics""--so is the noncriticism criticism. When Oprah brought up Levi Johnston, who has said some ""unflattering things"" (Oprah's words) about the governor, Palin lurched in two directions at once: ""I don't think a national television show is the place to discuss some of the things he's doing and saying,"" she said, before doing just that: ""And by the way, I don't know if we call him Levi. I hear he goes by the name Ricky Hollywood now. So if that's the case, we don't want to mess up the gig he's got going, kind of this aspiring--aspiring--porn, some of the things that he's doing. ... It's a bit heartbreaking to see the road he's on right now."" Oprah asked if he spends time with his baby, Tripp. ""He's quite busy with his media tours, and he hasn't seen the baby for a while,"" Palin responded. ""But we will let that be the discussion between Bristol and Levi as they work out their relationship."" Yes, we will. For her part, Oprah avoided going into full Oprah mode. She didn't start every question with ""How did you feel when ..."" It was more like every fourth question. But because she's Oprah, she can ask questions that would elicit scoffs in other contexts, like whether Palin could have handled being a mother of five and a vice president at the same time. ""It's a fair question,"" Oprah said, given that in the vast majority of cases, the burden of raising children falls disproportionately on the mother. (Palin said she would have relied on her ""support network."") She also pushed Palin back on track when she sensed a dodge. At one point, she got a reluctant Palin to issue an ""open invitation for Levi to come to Aunt Katie's house for Thanksgiving dinner in Washington. There!"" She also corrected Palin when Palin suggested that reporters honored Obama's request not to write about his children but didn't honor hers. In fact, Oprah pointed out, it was in the context of a question about Palin's children that Obama had declared kids off-limits. Oprah closed the interview by asking whether it was true that Palin might be getting her own talk show. Instead of an answer, Palin reached for the butter. ""Oprah, you're the queen,"" Palin said. ""You have nothing to worry about."" That may be so. But for Palin, a talk show would be a best-case scenario: Top billing. Pre-set conversation topics. A favorable audience. And once and for all, a media filter of her own."	Sarah Palin goes on Oprah to discuss her new book, Going Rogue.	['Obama', 'McCain']	[]

Palin, whose book is officially out Tuesday, has set off a new round of fighting with former McCain aides. Dede Scozzafava, the Republican who Palin refused to endorse in the race for a New York congressional seat, is firing back. Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, who once worked for Mitt Romney, is the latest to question Charlie Crist, the Republican governor of Florida, who is in a primary fight against conservative Marco Rubio. Yes, the Democratic Party is still dysfunctional--just ask Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid or White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, both of whom have recently had to intervene to calm squabbling Democrats. There's bickering in the administration, too. But now Republicans are starting to rival their opponents in their chronic condition of family strife. For sheer disruptive value, no uncle who hogs the gravy can match Palin. She is wildly popular among conservatives, but her book--which will explode in full flower next week--will re-open old wounds. After being attacked anonymously by former McCain aides for months, she is pushing back. Charges and counter-charges will fly, and the bickering is likely to occasion a new round in the GOP debate among moderates, conservatives, insiders, outsiders, and self-styled outsiders over how the Republican Party should proceed. In response to the leaks about her book, Palin has posted on her Facebook page. ""As is expected, the AP and a number of subsequent media outlets are erroneously reporting the contents of the book."" It's not clear whether she means the media has gotten the facts wrong or merely presented them in a way that she does not like. She tells her committed supporters to ""keep their powder dry"" and wait for the actual book. The press's failings are a recurring theme with the former governor: She says we make stuff up. It's a serious charge. It's one thing to get the facts wrong--to ""erroneously report,"" in her words--and it's quite another to consciously bend the material to meet your own ends. Does Palin meet her own rigorous standards? The Associated Press suggests she does not.

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/what_he_said.html	"President Obama's speech at Fort Hood, Texas, was a small masterpiece--less than 15 minutes--in part because it was so modest. The president had great material and he knew not to get in its way. Less than three minutes into the speech, the president was telling the story of each of the 13 people who had died. The news has been full of every last detail about the shooter. Obama corrected that balance. If the shooter committed the ultimate act of selfishness, then the president took it as his task to bear witness to the selflessness and hard work of the shooter's victims. The stories of the dead and those who tried to save them take up almost half of the text. Storytelling is Obama's best talent. It's what worked for him so well in the campaign. Telling stories is effective because it follows the simple rule of good writing: Show, don't tell. You can talk about dedication and selflessness; or you can tell the story of Amber Bahr, who ""was so intent on helping others that she did not realize for some time that she, herself, had been shot in the back,"" or the story of Francisco de la Serna, who treated the police officer who ran toward the gunfire as well as the gunman who was trying to kill her. The president only briefly referred to the killer's faith. He did not take the opportunity to deliver a politically correct lesson about grouping people or about religion. He did not, as David Brooks wrote today, ""rush to therapy."" Instead the president delivered the opposite of that: judgment. ""This much we do know--no faith justifies these murderous and craven acts; no just and loving God looks upon them with favor. For what he has done, we know that the killer will be met with justice--in this world, and the next."" Obama knew this wasn't the moment to defend Islam. He also knew to keep out of the speech any lessons about reacting in anger--the kind of lessons Bill Clinton sought to convey in his speech after the bombing of Oklahoma City. He left these things out because they were beside the point. The speech was relentlessly focused on celebrating the fallen and what they represent--not just in their reaction to the shooting but on the sacrifices they had willingly endured. ""In an age of selfishness, they embody responsibility. In an era of division, they call upon us to come together. In a time of cynicism, they remind us of who we are as Americans."" In a sense, the president was addressing his remarks to more than just the assembled crowd. His speech was a song to an entire generation: his generation. The first president of the post-Baby Boomer generation was making the claim for the men and women he commands, a host of whom he will send into Afghanistan in the coming weeks. ""We need not look to the past for greatness, because it is before our very eyes."" It was a song of America's values, sung by a man who has been questioned, since the Democratic primaries, for being, as Hillary Clinton's strategist Mark Penn put it, ""not fundamentally American."" During the campaign, he had to make television ads insisting he shared American values. As president, he has contended with opponents who compare him with Hitler because of his ... health care plan. Today's speech is unlikely to mollify his most ardent foes, and it won't make health care reform any easier. But it should make it harder for anyone to question his patriotism.

Oppose it and we'll make it hell. Sometimes groups take a moment to just pause and say, ""Thank you."" But what looks and sounds like gratitude is just another form of persuasion. When Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., arrived at the airport in Las Vegas on Sunday, the morning after voting for the House health care reform bill, she was greeted by a dozen or so people waving giant ""Thank You"" signs (as well as a few less friendly opponents of reform). Starting Tuesday, Titus will also have her own personal ""thank you"" ad, produced by Health Care for America Now!, running in her district for a week. She may also get a ""thank you"" rally held in front of her office by MoveOn later this week. In other words, liberal groups will be drawing as much attention to her controversial, potentially damaging vote as possible. Titus' district is considered one of the most vulnerable in the state--both she and Obama won there in 2008 by only a few points. It's a divided district. Is broadcasting her vote really the best way to thank someone for taking a tough stance on an issue equally likely to mobilize her opponents as motivate her supporters? Health reform advocates recognize there's some risk. ""That is a consideration,"" said Mike Ginsburg, whose group, Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, organized the Titus airport rally. For example, a group of protesters caught wind of the airport event and showed up bearing anti-reform signs. But, says Ginsburg, pro-reform groups shouldn't muzzle themselves just because there's going to be some opposition: ""They're going to show up one way or the other."" That seems to be the logic behind the latest campaign by MoveOn and HCAN: Positive reinforcement works. HCAN is running ads in 20 congressional districts across the country thanking Democrats for supporting the bill, and Americans United for Change will run spots in an additional 10 districts. (Watch the first batch here.) The total ad buy is about $1 million--a good chunk of the $8 million HCAN has spent on TV ads so far this year. MoveOn, meanwhile, is holding ""thank you"" rallies for at least 60 members. And while broadcasting a member's vote might hurt her among a small segment of voters, it's not like her vote is going to be a secret. ""Let's be honest, Republicans are gonna raise hell in these districts anyways,"" said an official at a progressive organization who preferred not to be named. ""There's no way they're gonna let it go quietly."" Indeed, Republicans are already gearing up to smack down the couple dozen moderate Blue Dog Democrats who voted for the bill. Independent groups like Americans for Prosperity are asking members to thank their congressmen for opposing it. Reformers would rather broadcast their support, therefore, than keep quiet from fear that they'll alienate constituents. Members of Congress don't seem to mind. ""It helps us for sure,"" said Jamie Radice, a spokeswoman for Carol Shea-Porter, a New Hampshire Democrat who voted for health care. Andrew Stoddard, a spokesman for Rep. Titus, agreed: ""People know what's going on with this [health care] more than in the past."" If a voter opposes a member of Congress because of these ads, they were probably going to oppose her anyway. ""Thank you"" is a friendly sentiment, but it's really saying three things: Thank you for voting for the House bill, even though it might hurt you politically. Heads up to your constituents that health care reform is going to help them, not hurt them. And don't you dare consider backing down the second time around. ""We're definitely encouraging them to vote this way again,"" says Jacki Schechner of HCAN. In classic carrot/stick form, MoveOn is stimultaneously threatening to take down any Senate Democrats who oppose health care reform. They're already running ads criticizing Democrats who voted against the bill. Meanwhile, members of MoveOn have pledged a total of $3.5 million to fund primary challenges against any dissident Dems. If a promise to thank you for supporting health care reform doesn't work, maybe a threat to punish you for opposing it will."

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/11/national_awareness_month_awareness_month.html	"Did you realize that last month was National Information Literacy Awareness Month? No? Perhaps that's because it was also National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, National Disability Employment Awareness Month, National Cybersecruity Awareness Month, National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, National Arts and Humanities Month, and National Energy Awareness Month. Navigating all of which is a challenge for even the most information-literate Americans. Not according to the White House, which churns out a slew of presidential proclamations at the beginning of every month recognizing special months, weeks, or days in honor of some cause or another. (So far, no cause has received less than a day.) Some proclamations have policy consequences--for instance, President Obama's Oct. 23 declaration of a national swine-flu emergency, which gave hospitals flexibility to house and treat the sick. But the vast majority are symbolic statements--shout-outs on West Wing stationery--that highlight causes, interest groups, and, yes, diseases that the administration thinks deserve attention. (See a complete list here.) How do official awareness months, weeks, or days come to be? Many of them date back decades, such as National Diabetes Month or Law Day, which President Eisenhower established as ""a day of national dedication to the principles of government under law."" To get your own, you simply have to ask. Requests usually go through the Office of the Public Liaison, and the proclamations themselves are written by the office of the staff secretary. It helps to have a cause that fits snugly into the president's worldview. Last spring, Lana Jackman of the National Forum on Information Literacy wrote letters to her two senators, John Kerry and Ted Kennedy, explaining the cause of information literacy and suggesting the president issue a proclamation. It seemed like a natural fit for Obama: Jackman describes information literacy as ""the ability to find, access, evaluate, and use information effectively."" During his campaign, Obama had dealt with misinformation about his background, leading his campaign to create a myth-busting ""Fight the Smears"" Web site. Information literacy is, in part, learning to separate truth from bull. Obama's final proclamation was a summation of how this ""new type of literacy"" can help Americans deal with the ""crisis of authenticity"" that comes from information overload. It also helps to have some connection in the government. Many proclamations simply recognize pet causes of one agency or another. For example, National Adoption Month is coordinated by the federal Children's Bureau, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. National Safe Boating Week is celebrated and sponsored by the Coast Guard. The National Eye Institute, a part of the National Institutes of Health, brings us Save Your Vision Week every February. Other special weeks or months are vestiges of old special-interest groups that one president or another wanted to please. Why do we have a National Forest Products Week, celebrating the role of timber and paper in our lives, but not a National Plastic Products Week or National Cotton Products Week? You'd have to ask President Eisenhower, who signed the legislation creating National Forest Products Week. Indeed, sometimes the proclamations read like a checklist of potential voter groups: National Hispanic Heritage Month; National Caribbean-American Heritage Month; Irish-American Heritage Month; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month; Small Business Week--not to be confused with this magazine--and, of course, Leif Erikson Day. ""I find it strange we don't see more of that,"" says Brandon Rottinghaus of University of Houston, who created a searchable database of presidential proclamations. ""It's a low-cost way for a president to acknowledge these groups."" In fact, presidents often update the proclamations to fit their own perspectives. For example, Eisenhower's original proclamation for Forest Products Week called on ""the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities."" (Read a book? Stab someone with a pencil?) President Obama's 2009 proclamation instead emphasizes the benefits of wood as ""a renewable and recyclable resource"" that is ""one of our Nation's most environmentally friendly building materials."" Presidents can also tweak their predecessors in their proclamations and observations. Obama caused a minor fuss when he proclaimed May 7 the National Day of Prayer but declined to hold the traditional religious service at the White House. The best bet for would-be awareness month boosters would be to find someone in the government who supports your cause and who has the West Wing's ear. Character Counts Week started in the early '90s, when a group of senators decided that character was an important quality in America's youth. They enlisted Michael Josephson and his nonprofit Character Counts to organize the annual activities, like honoring students with exceptional character, and got the president to spread the word. The result is a week that actually matters, says Josephson: ""I don't want to be lumped in with National Laundry Week or Pickle Week. ... It isn't an earmark or a political favor."" (Josephson has little to worry about, since neither actually exists.) Groups aren't especially particular about which month they get. But October and November are the most popular, with seven and six annual awareness campaigns, respectively. ""It's the beginning of holiday season, when families get together,"" explains Deborah Halpern of the National Family Caregivers Association, which organizes National Family Caregivers Month. As for whether they get a month, week, or day, it's usually up to the group. ""We really thought about it,"" says Josephson, who organized Character Counts Week. ""With a day, you wouldn't have enough opportunity to mobilize people. And a month is just too long."" National Wilderness Month thus isn't necessarily more important than Fire Prevention Week, which, in turn, doesn't necessarily trump White Cane Safety Day, recognizing the blind. Nor does there seem to be much competition for attention among the different groups. ""It's a lot to be aware of,"" says Halpern of the caregivers organization. ""But the reality is, the people we want to reach are not being approached by these other groups."" All of this begs the question: Do awareness days, weeks, and months actually help the causes they promote? The biggest ones do. Breast Cancer Awareness Week, for example, reaps millions annually for cancer research and has enough to clout to convince NFL players to wear hot-pink cleats in solidarity. Other awareness-raising months make a difference, according to their proponents, but not always in a measurable way. During National Adoption Month, for example, adoption groups actively recruit families to take children out of foster care. But the adoptions don't always occur during that month, and stats aren't precise enough to show an annual spike. A presidential proclamation can help. ""But I think it's really up to the organization and the groups that care about a particular day or month to raise awareness about it,"" says Chris Danielsen of the National Federation for the Blind. If that doesn't work, there's always a last-ditch solution: Set aside a month when people can really, truly pay attention to awareness months."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/why_60_is_the_new_50.html	"How many votes does Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid really need to pass health care reform? Is it 50 or 60? It's not simply a question of parliamentary procedure--the answer will in large part shape the legislation. The logic is simple: the more votes Reid needs, the more bargaining he has to do--particularly on the question of the public option. And the more bargaining he has to do, the weaker the legislation is likely to get. This question was at the forefront this week when Joe Lieberman announced that he would block health care legislation in the Senate if the bill weren't modified. His detractors, in their effort to assign Lieberman to his own special circle in hell, have overstated the case against him. Lieberman is not the only senator who might vote for the final bill but has expressed qualms. He is, however, the one who has said out loud that he would filibuster the final bill. Moderate Democrats--Lieberman is an independent--have been coy. (Indiana Democrat Evan Bayh has said he'd also block the bill, but he doesn't match Lieberman's history of poking Democrats in the eye.) Wait, say his critics: Lieberman's sins are of a different magnitude. Those other Democrats could have taken a middle road that Lieberman has closed off for himself. They could vote with their 57 Democratic colleagues and two independents to get the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster--but then vote against the final bill, which needs only a simple majority to pass. This would allow the bill to go forward but give them political cover at home. Technically, that's true. Politically, it's a near impossibility. Harry Reid has two big filibuster hurdles to clear. The first comes at the start of the process on the ""motion to proceed."" That puts the legislation in play. Joe Lieberman has said he'll not filibuster that. But one of the other moderate senators--Ben Nelson, Mary Landrieu, or Blanche Lincoln--might vote with Republicans. Those senators are waiting to make their final call until after the Congressional Budget Office makes a ruling on how much the bill will cost. If one of these senators does support a filibuster at this stage, that will make them more obstructionist than Lieberman. Why would they do such a thing? Because they might decide they have more leverage to get their way at the start of the process than at the end after debate and before the final vote when they'll be more subject to the momentum that builds as a bill goes forward. If Reid can clear that hurdle and get the bill into play, he'll face another big 60-vote test to stop all the debate and move to a final vote. At this point, as a political matter the final vote to end a filibuster is no different than the vote for final passage. (So, 60 is the new 50. Technically, 60 is the new 51, since a bill needs 51 votes to pass, but Reid needs only 50 senators. He can rely on Joe Biden, as president of the Senate, to break any tie votes.) At this point, the John Kerry rule kicks in. During the 2004 presidential campaign, the Democratic presidential candidate was lampooned for saying he voted in favor of funding for the Iraq war before he voted against it. Kerry had a perfectly sound procedural rationale for his vote, but it didn't matter. He looked like a man with no convictions. In the health care debate, the Kerry precedent plays out this way: If a senator votes to allow debate on the bill, but then against the bill itself, he risks looking like a hypocrite. I oppose the health care bill for reasons X and Y and therefore will not be voting for it, he can say. Yet when given the chance to actually do something about stopping a piece of legislation I oppose--by supporting a filibuster to block it--I chose not to. True, this reasoning is purely political. Is there no senator in this group, you ask, willing to take a political hit for the larger good of passing health care reform? The senators ""in play""--for the moment (check back hourly for updates!) Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Bayh, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, and Lieberman--have already made their calculations. It is that the political price they will pay for caving on their objections (whether it's the cost of the bill or an increased government role in health care) is bigger than the price they will pay for voting against health care. So they aren't inclined to see a ""larger good"" at stake here. It's also possible that they define ""larger good"" differently from supporters of the current bill. Then again, perhaps Reid should just call their bluff. Lieberman would be the least likely to cave. The Democrats, however, would ultimately do the right thing for their party and their president. Right? Reid doesn't think so. Playing that kind of hardball in your own caucus is tricky given that you may need the Senator you're shoving around today on another matter tomorrow. More important, he doesn't want to risk calling a vote without knowing its outcome. If he does call their bluff and holds the vote, and one of these moderate Democrats votes with the opposition, he suddenly has a big public relations problem on his hands. The president's health care reform plan not only can't get Republican votes, critics will say, it can't get all the Democratic votes. And the critics will be right."	Is 60 the new 50?

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/the_new_israel_lobby.html	"When a politician attends the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee *, Washington's largest pro-Israel lobbying group, his task is simple: assert his commitment to Israel in the strongest possible terms. At the inaugural conference of J Street, a new organization that pitches itself as a liberal alternative to AIPAC, the job is slightly more complicated: assert a strong and unshakeable commitment to both Israel and peace. So it went at this year's conference, where Gen. Jim Jones, national security adviser to President Obama, delivered the keynote address Tuesday. For all the controversy the conference prompted--several supporters withdrew, participants were criticized, J Street's mission was questioned--the proceedings Tuesday were notable for their reasonableness. Jones said little Obama hadn't said at the United Nations in September or that Jones himself hadn't said earlier this month to the American Task Force on Palestine. ""There will be setbacks, challenges, false starts, and false hopes,"" Jones told the J Street crowd. ""But the people of this region have suffered too long for this problem to be neglected."" Judging from the response, Jones delivered. Peace between the Israelis and Palestinians is not just a priority, he said. It's the top priority: ""If there was any one problem I'd tell president he should solve, this would be it."" (Presumably, Jones and Obama talk, so it's puzzling why he posed this conversation as a hypothetical.) Jones also tied a commitment to peace in Israel with efforts to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. When it comes to preventing a nuclear armed Iran, he said, ""Nothing is off the table."" Still, Jones's mere presence mattered almost more than his words. Only a year after its founding, J Street is no longer the obscure liberal lobby that could. It is an influential--and controversial--spokes-group for Jewish Americans who think the United States' approach to Israel has been too narrow. In its first six months, the group raised $580,000. (AIPAC's annual donations top $50 million.) Conservative members of the Jewish community have eyed the organization with suspicion, arguing that concessions in the name of peace put Israel in danger. Several members of Congress removed their names from the group's host committee in recent weeks. (One hundred forty-eight members remain on the list.) Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassador to Washington, declined an invitation to the conference, saying in a statement that the group took stances that ""impair the interests of Israel."" The White House's decision to send an emissary was thus considered a minor victory. ""You can be sure that this administration will be represented at all other future events,"" Jones said, to applause. The approval was mutual. Every president of the last three decades has tried and failed to secure peace between Israel and the Palestinians. But most of the speakers and panelists seemed confident that Obama can fix this thing--if not once and for all, at least for a while. The question is when and how. The solutions tossed out during a pair of morning panels--""An Israeli-Palestinian Peace Deal in 24 Months: How to Get it Done"" and ""What's Next? Analysis and Advice for the President from Washington Insiders""--fell into two general categories: Creative solutions and force-it-through solutions. The first type presumes that the key to achieving peace is to take an approach that hasn't been done before--or to reframe the problem. The second type suggests that in the past, we haven't tried hard enough: Palestinians and Israelis simply need to suck it up and make concessions. One proposed solution would work like a divorce proceeding: Put Israeli and Palestinian leaders in a room and say, You two hash it out. If they can't figure out a workable agreement in, say, four months, the United States would present them with its own plan. The theory behind this approach, says Gadi Batilansky, former spokesman for Ehud Barak, is that Israelis and Palestinians might not listen to each other, but they would certainly listen to President and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Barack Obama. This proposal falls squarely into the ""suck it up"" category. Another strategy would be to pitch peace in Israel not as a foreign policy issue but as a U.S. national-security issue. President Obama should approach peace as President Bush would approach a war. Or, as Lara Friedman of Americans for Peace Now puts it, as a ""peace of necessity."" Obama wouldn't look to poll numbers in Israel (which are currently in the single digits). Nor would he wait for the proper ""conditions on the ground""--strong Palestinian leadership, a freeze on Israeli settlements, etc. It may sound like an oxymoron, but Obama would be an aggressive peacemaker. ""I don't care if people are singing kumbaya together,"" says Friedman. ""The goal is to not be fighting."" A third way to refresh the debate would be to inject new variables. That way, the two sides wouldn't feel as if they were rehashing the same old terms of 2000 and 1993. Propose that some settlements could exist in a sovereign Palestinian state. Arrange creative land swaps. Require that leaders from both sides recognize historical wrongs along the way. The goal, says Robert Malley of the International Crisis Group, would be to rejigger the puzzle pieces. Consider the politics, too: Israeli politicians will never want to make concessions where their predecessors would not, since it makes them look weak. Better to give them a new--or new-looking--set of elements to discuss. As for the time frame, the answer seemed to be: soon. Jones said that ""time is not necessarily on our side,"" which suggests urgency. Daniel Levy, a J Street co-founder, admitted that ""I don't know if it can be done in 24 months,"" but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Obama's legislative platter is keeping him busy back home. But the speed of Iran's uranium enrichment--some reports say it could be capable of producing nuclear weapons in 2010--means peace in Israel could soon get a lot more complicated. Perhaps the best idea came inadvertently from panel moderator M.J. Rosenberg, when announcing a location switch. ""The event 'Palestinian Perspectives' is moving to the main bedroom,"" he said, before quickly correcting himself: ""Ballroom."" The audience laughed. ""That would solve all our problems!"" Correction, Oct. 30, 2009: This article originally misstated the full name of AIPAC. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/message_error.html	"In yet another repudiation of its predecessor, the Obama administration this week migrated the White House Web site to Drupal, the popular open-source Web site management software. By dumping the Bush administration's proprietary system and embracing software authored by the community and available to everyone, the consensus holds, the White House embodies the very essence of the new politics. I wish Drupal and the White House nothing but happiness. But I have a feeling this story ends badly. If the administration had conducted a few polls among the swing demographic of Web site administrators, it would have realized that Drupal is pocked with political landmines. To wit: Drupal represents everything the Obama team does not want to project. Allow me to elaborate. Drupal knows best. It's not that Drupal thinks you're evil. It just thinks you're ignorant. In a basic setup, the software is suspicious of everything you try to do. Should you, say, go completely rogue and try to add some Javascript in the body of a page--a 14-year-old technology that controls interactive components like buttons--the platform will have none of it.   The message: ""That's dangerous stuff, and you probably don't know what you're doing."" Better to outlaw something altogether, Drupal figures, than simply ask you if you really want to use it. If Drupal ran the Food and Drug Administration, it would ban high-fructose corn syrup. This is just the sort of straitjacketed paternalism that half the country is convinced the Democrats are hell-bent on imposing on us all. Drupal is impenetrable. Even the software's defenders admit that it is hostile to newcomers--or at least indifferent to their plight, as a University of Baltimore study found. The apologists will tell you that, once you scale the learning curve, it gets much easier. This is probably true, but a lot of ordinary, code-fearing people who just want a simple Web site are getting left behind. If Drupal were an employee of the federal government, it would be the person who answers the phone at Immigration and Customs Enforcement who is unable to help you and unable to tell you who can. If you suspect government is the problem, not the solution, this sort of bureaucratic sprawl is your worst enemy. Drupal hates change. Want to modernize Drupal by upgrading to a newer version? Ask these guys how that worked out for them. If Drupal were a piece of legislation, it would be the farm bill: desperately in need of an overhaul but unlikely ever to get one because entrenched interests keep the forces of reform at bay. Drupal is disorganized. Instead of displaying your pages in folders that you can browse, like you do on your personal computer, Drupal provides a nightmarish content list. To find what you're looking for, you have to search for it. And unlike most content management systems, Drupal doesn't have a convenient way  to prevent two people from accidentally editing the same page at the same time. This is exactly the kind of rudderless confusion that small-government types have always said defines the federal government. Drupal is righteous. The open-source movement has done wonderful things for the Web. But at its core, it remains a religion. If you went to DrupalCon in Paris last month, then you would have almost certainly come across proselytizers of one the movement's fundamental tenets: Drupal doesn't break Web sites. People with Drupal break Web sites. Most problems with Drupal stem from people who ""don't get it"" or aren't using it correctly. This is probably true, but it's not much consolation when you spend 45 minutes trying to upload a photo. Drupal's defenders are eerily reminiscent of those movement Democrats who were constantly knocking at your front door in the summer of 2008. Granted, they did get Obama elected, but it's a miracle they didn't cost him the election in the process. As a cautionary tale, the WhiteHouse.gov administrators might look to Recovery.gov, which is devoted to tracking stimulus spending. The site originally used Drupal but soon hired a private contractor--at a reported cost of $18 million--to rework the site. Perhaps the White House site's administrators have learned from their colleagues' mistakes. But I can't help but think the new software represents the triumph of hope over experience. Drupal looks great in theory: It's a powerful way to govern a Web site that is born out of the collective efforts of the community. In practice, it tends to be a bit of a mess. Does that sound like any particular form of government to you? (Disclosure: Slate sister sites The Big Money, DoubleX, and The Root run on Drupal. The author is not directly involved with any of those sites or their content management.)"	Running the White House Web site on Drupal is a political disaster.	['Obama']	[]
29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/cheney_reaction.html	"Dick Cheney was already going down in history as one of the most influential vice presidents ever. Now he's taking flak for being one of the most vocal ex-VPs, too. Since leaving office, Cheney has gone from White House booster No. 2 to White House critic No. 1. Agree with him or not, however, he's hardly an outlier: There's nothing more American than ex-presidents and VPs slamming their successors. While accepting a prize on Wednesday from the Center for Security Policy, Cheney criticized President Obama for ""dithering"" over whether to send more troops to Afghanistan. ""President Obama now seems afraid to make a decision and unable to provide his commander on the ground with the troops he needs to complete his mission,"" he said. The White House quickly pushed back. ""What Vice President Cheney calls 'dithering,' President Obama calls his solemn responsibility to the men and women in uniform and to the American public,"" said press secretary Robert Gibbs. ""I think we've all seen what happens when somebody doesn't take that responsibility seriously."" Cheney's quickness in criticizing Obama--it was only March when he told CNN that the new president was ""making some choices that, in my mind, will in fact raise the risk"" of another terrorist attack--has drawn fire. White House adviser David Axelrod accused Cheney in April of not behaving like a ""statesman."" Rep. Mike McMahon of New York deemed Cheney's most recent comments ""inappropriate. ... For a former vice president to use that type of word ['dithering'] and criticize the president in that type of forum is certainly in my opinion unpatriotic."" If that makes Cheney unpatriotic, he's in good company. There's a proud tradition of former executive-branch leaders disparaging sitting presidents. The most notorious example--the ur-ex-presidential critic--is Herbert Hoover. After losing the presidency to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, Hoover spent the next nine years railing on him. Like Cheney, Hoover was a conservative Republican. He thus believed that the New Deal insulted American values and that the Roosevelt administration ""violated the principles that reach the very foundation of our nation and race."" Hoover quieted down after Pearl Harbor, when the country rallied around the president. But he returned to form under John F. Kennedy, whom Hoover called a socialist. But Hoover wasn't even the first. Presidential and vice presidential disputes stretch back to the founders. During the election of 1800, sitting veep Thomas Jefferson slammed sitting president John Adams--his own boss--as a monarchist. Adams, in turn, painted Jefferson as a revolutionary and atheist who would destroy the churches. (That was before 1804, when the 12th Amendment was passed, putting both president and vice president on a single ticket.) After losing the presidency in 1828, John Quincy Adams made a second career out of criticizing Andrew Jackson and pro-slavery Democrats from his post-presidential perch as a congressman from Massachusetts. Some former White House denizens have despised their successors so much, they sought to oust them--even when the successor was their hand-picked choice. Teddy Roosevelt handed off the presidency to William Howard Taft, his secretary of war, in 1909, only to run against him in 1912. (That would be like George W. Bush coming back to campaign against John McCain in 2012, if McCain had won in 2008.) Roosevelt had soured on Taft, who he saw leading the GOP in a conservative direction. Roosevelt thus formed the progressive Bull Moose Party and ended up winning more votes than Taft--27 percent to Taft's 24 percent--thereby swinging the election to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. ""Roosevelt was my closest friend,"" Taft tearfully recalled, according to a reporter's account. Jimmy Carter bears the mantle for most critical ex-White Houser of modern times. (A title he may soon share with Cheney.) From peanut farmer to peanut gallery, Carter has systematically undermined every president since leaving office. Soon after losing to Ronald Reagan, Carter criticized him for not actively pursuing the Camp David agreements between Israel and Egypt, over which Carter had presided. In 1987, both Carter and former president Ford condemned Reagan for his handling of the Iran-Contra affair. In 1990, Carter publicly opposed George H.W. Bush's decision to use force against Iraq and personally urged United Nations member states not to authorize military action. Carter irked Bill Clinton before Clinton was even president: Clinton partly blames Carter for his failed gubernatorial re-election bid in 1980, after Carter decided to house 20,000 Cuban refugees at an Arkansas military installation. Both Carter and Bush spoke out against Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair. And during the 2008 election, Carter declared that Clinton had ""hurt his wife's candidacy."" He saved his choicest words, however, for George W. Bush, whose administration Carter called the ""worst in history."" Vice presidents have been just as critical of their successor administrations--maybe even more so. Richard Nixon slammed President Johnson over Vietnam in the 1960s, only to mire himself further while in the Oval Office. FDR's vice president, Henry Wallace, was so critical of Harry Truman that he ran against him on the Progressive Party ticket in 1948. Former veep Walter Mondale spoke out against Reagan before challenging him for the presidency in 1984. Al Gore kept mum on Bush for seven years before penning an entire book ripping into him. Indeed, carping is often seen as part of the job of ex-vice presidents--after all, they may have presidential ambitions of their own. Which is what makes Cheney's bomb-throwing so confusing for many. It would be one thing if he wanted to be president, the thinking goes. But since he doesn't, he should keep quiet and be a ""statesman."" The lack of presidential ambition (unless there's something he's not telling us) leaves two possible motivations: A desire to preserve his own legacy and good-old-fashioned conviction. Given the tone and content of his statements--for example, he insists that water-boarding is not torture--many Democrats find this last explanation the most disturbing of all. But the fact is, completely statesmanlike behavior is the exception more than the rule. Few modern ex-presidents and ex-veeps have kept entirely silent. Johnson didn't talk much. George H.W. Bush mostly kept his thoughts to himself. And George W. Bush, perhaps the most criticized president in history, has been the epitome of post-presidential rectitude.
