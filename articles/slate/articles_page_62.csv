Their stories--lucky for Democrats and the Obama administration--got sort of lost in the tumult of the government shutdown. Suffice it to say that no one could really get online and buy the insurance they'd been dreaming of. Finally, after a much-derided ""tech surge"" and some ritual congressional torture of administration officials, the website is working. Insurers are starting to invest in the site, actually, buying a reported $500 million of ads for their wares. We've checked in again with our human guinea pigs to see whether the system now works. Short answer: The website has improved, but the costs are all over the place. Long answer: Read their stories in their own words below. Toby Dillon, 36, IT manager, Tooele, Utah We were able to get on and get everything set up for enrollment by mid-October, then we had the mind-numbing task of going through the various plans available to us. Not counting ""bronze"" plans, we still had more than a dozen to pick through. My wife wanted specific care providers, so that further limited the list. I wanted doctor-visit costs that weren't ""$X after deductible."" This put us into the gold plan range, which I expected to be more expensive but turned out to be only $40 more per month than our ""benchmark"" silver plan, for a total of $257 per month, with a $250 deductible, $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum, which is pretty posh for our family. Our only hang-up is our new addition, due around Christmas. If we enroll now, we'd still have to do all this again in a month ... so we're going to hold off until January and sign up for February, thereby saving the premium and making sure all the family is on the same plan with as few hiccups as possible. Eufemia Scarfone, small business owner, Venice, Calif. I managed to sign up on Oct. 4, and I chose a Blue of California (Blue Shield) 80/20 plan that was $386 a month and has no deductible. I had to choose this somewhat blindly because at the time the health care organization I use did not know exactly what plans from the exchange they would be accepting. Historically, they have always accepted Blue Shield, so I thought this would be a safe bet. After I successfully signed up online, I got several confusing letters from Covered California. It was a mix of ""congratulations, you're covered"" and ""we're sorry, we can't verify your income so you might not be covered."" Because I'm self-employed, they couldn't find any employment data in their state database. I had to estimate my income at sign-up, and my estimate put me outside the range of the available subsidies. Coveredca.com told me that the premiums and any applicable subsidies would be auto-adjusted and applied to my account after I filed 2013 taxes. Meanwhile, back at my existing health insurance company, they decided to jack up my premium from $617 a month to $730 a month in October and blame Obamacare. As you can imagine, I am anxious to get as far away from this fleecing as possible. I received a letter from Blue Shield on Dec. 9 informing me that I needed to hurry up and pay them no later than Dec. 21 to guarantee my plan. It would have been nice to get some prior notice, but whatever. I went to their website right then and there and made an online payment. I intended to schedule the payment for Dec. 20, but while I was adding my payment information, their site had reset the date to that day and I didn't realize it until after I clicked ""submit."" I inadvertently paid them early. At that point I got a little paranoid, so just to be sure I was in good shape for January, I went to my health care provider's website only to discover that they are not accepting any Blue Shield plans from the health care exchange. At least they will be accepting the Anthem and some Healthnet plans, so all is not lost, and I still might save even more money on premiums. I had to call Covered California several times due to call volume. I finally got through and ended up on hold for about 20 minutes. When the agent answered, I explained what had happened and that I needed to change my plan to something else. He informed me that, unfortunately, because I had made the payment already, it was now going to be a process to get that canceled. I had to get out of the plan I just paid for and into a new one before Dec. 23 or I would be stuck with the Blue Shield plan. I called Blue Shield to cancel, and they were a bit confused at first but told me they ""started the process"" of cancellation and I would receive an email when it was complete, which would take about two days. Great! I call coveredca.com again, but they tell me I need a termination number from the first plan before they can vacate my enrollment from the system and I can choose a different plan. So I wait. As of Dec. 13, still no email from Blue Shield regarding my cancellation. I call again, and the first agent disconnects me. I call back. Agent No. 2 seems to have a better handle on what needs to happen, so he went through the cancellation process. My guess is that it didn't get done right the first time I called. I get back on the horn to Covered California. After a nice 40-minute hold listening to the same horrid song over and over, the agent tells me she has to delete my application. Apparently a termination number isn't necessary. I think I would be far more aggravated by this process if every single person I have dealt with weren't so incredibly pleasant and trying very hard to be helpful. Erin Molnar, 25, unemployed, Ferndale, Mich. So we did the process, and the site seemed to work. It was a little irritating because you couldn't easily go back to correct something, and it asked for things multiple times. Oddly it asked me if I had ever been in foster care, but not my husband. Overall it was an OK experience, though. We compared plans and found a silver plan I think with a deductible of $2,500 at a cost if about $450 per month for our family of three. While I don't think that's an unreasonable price, I'm currently unemployed, and we have a lot of student loan debt as well as upcoming child care costs and medical bills from being uninsured throughout my pregnancy, so I just don't see where we'd get $450 a month. We are not eligible for subsidies even while I'm unemployed. So for now we have decided to take the risk of being uninsured in the hopes that with my new job I'll get employer-sponsored health care. Without a subsidy I still just don't think it makes sense to buy it on the private market. Jim Matthews, 48, small business owner, Hanover, N.H. The short version: After some website fiddling my wife and I are signed up for a bronze healthcare.gov plan with a much (49 percent) lower premium than we could get in the small group market, and I've confirmed our enrollment with the insurer, but I won't be totally at ease until I see that they've actually charged my credit card for the first month's premium. The long version: I tried signing up on Oct. 1 and ran into a variety of website errors (e.g., telling me that my password was wrong when it wasn't). I set up three accounts with three different email addresses over the course of a week before I had one that worked well enough to show me my actual plan options and premiums. The 10 Anthem plans (Anthem is the only New Hampshire insurer on the federally run exchange) had premiums ranging from $772 (bronze, $11,500 joint deductible) to $1,269 (gold, $2,000 joint deductible). At this point in the process I paused, waiting to hear from my insurance broker about what it would cost us to renew our small group policy. In early November we got the answer: $1,579 per month for an Anthem policy with a $6,000 joint deductible. The exchange policies were clearly much better values--I could get a silver plan with a $5,000 deductible for less than $1,000 per month. The exchange plans have a narrower network, but it includes the local medical center where my wife and I get our medical care, so that isn't a drawback for us. By mid-November I had picked a plan--a Bronze HSA plan with a $11,000 joint deductible for $808 per month. We aren't expecting big medical expenses next year, so I gambled on a lower-premium, higher-deductible option, and I'll put pretax money into our Health Savings Account to use for out-of-pocket expenses. But when I went back to healthcare.gov to actually enroll, I couldn't login to my account. After a number of attempts and a fruitless conversation with a Live Chat support person (who suggested I apply over the phone or on paper), it occurred to me that I could start over. So I created a fourth healthcare.gov account with a fourth email address and breezed through the application and enrollment process in about half an hour on Nov. 12. The speed and stability of the site were much improved from my experiences in early October. Then I waited, as instructed, for confirmation from Anthem that I'd enrolled and directions on paying my first month's premium. As time passed and I read about problems with 834 forms I got increasingly nervous, so I called Anthem in early December. They confirmed that I was enrolled and told me that enrollment packets were being mailed out. When nothing had arrived after a week I called back. They repeated what I'd heard previously, and this time sent me a website link and an enrollment number I could use to pay my premium. I did so Dec. 11, but so far my credit card has not actually been charged. Joe McReynolds, 27, defense contractor, Washington, D.C. I looked at the D.C. exchange to see if there was anything competitive with the insurance I get from my employer. The D.C. exchange was broken the first week I tried it, but it's been working fine since then. Since I'm not eligible for subsidies, there wasn't anything competitive for me there; for my wife and me, the cheapest bronze plan on the D.C. exchange was more than double what we pay monthly for our (quite good) HMO coverage. So far, sticking with my current coverage, there's been no change in my premiums--if costs are rising, someone's eating them before they get to me. No lost coverage, doctor changes, or other problems with our current insurance. I have begun to realize just how charmed a life I lead in the health care department by having a private employer making a large contribution. For someone like me, working his first real job after grad school and having limited experience with the economics of health care, the changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act have mainly served to help me understand just how much health care costs to provide and how hefty that employer contribution ends up being. Seeing how much of my health care is subsidized by my employer, I'm actually pretty impressed now that the D.C. exchange could offer me coverage for only double what I'm paying out of pocket. As a young and healthy person, philosophically I'd like to be on the exchange in order to broaden their risk pool and make the ACA work (even if it costs more, that's a small price to pay for a health-care system that covers my friends with pre-existing conditions), but if there's some way to direct my employer's subsidy toward purchasing on the exchange, I'm not aware of it. Rachel Cory, rural health clinic manager, Washington state In a word, my experience is mixed. Everything has taken longer than anticipated, from the navigator certification process to the general function of Washington state's website, wahealthplanfinder.org. The site continues to experience intermittent problems. I've only walked one person through the application from start to finish. When it worked, it worked beautifully. It made logical sense: As the client answered questions, the site took the information she'd given and led to the next step in the process. It took about 20 minutes. Unfortunately, the site is still plagued with functional glitches and has been unavailable for periods of time. It must have been incredibly difficult to design this website. There are so many iterations of family sizes and economic statuses, and the site is tasked with processing all of those iterations against a very complex law. It then has to cross-reference this information with other federal sites, then direct the applicant to either a Medicaid application or the health insurance marketplace. I am in awe of the scope of this project. It helps to remember that when I hit a wall with a client. I have a disclaimer that I give to prospective applicants when they call to schedule a meeting: I tell them that this is a completely new process for the entire country. People expect the navigators to have some magic knowledge that will help them get through the process. The truth is we are all learning as we go. When I present the process in this way, people are pretty understanding and a little less frustrated when we hit glitches. I've heard mixed reviews from people, anecdotally, when they talk about how their coverage will change. For some, they had no insurance and are thrilled to be able to qualify for full coverage through the state or subsidized private insurance. These are the people who have already scheduled their appointments in January to catch up on the health care they've put off for years. Others have complained that they're being forced to do something they don't want to do. These are the individualists who don't recognize that their choices directly or indirectly affect the industry, and thus other people. Tasha Huebner, 45, self-employed, Oregon. Well, the Cover Oregon site isn't yet capable of letting people sign up online. Luckily, I sent in my paper application a few weeks before the deadline--because apparently they have so many they won't be able to process them all before Jan. 1. I just received my packet of info from Cover Oregon--they processed my application and gave me the information I needed to sign up, and I can now go on the website and pick out my plan and register for it! So at least that part is working. I'll be paying around $300 a month for a plan with a $500 or $750 deductible (depending on which plan I choose) and $1,500 out-of-pocket max. This is compared to the $780 I'm paying now (it went up in October) or the $820 I'd be paying in January. (I just got notified of a rate increase due to ""the costs of the ACA."") I'll be covered as of Jan. 1. So it hasn't been a totally smooth process, but it literally took me about 20 minutes to fill out the Cover Oregon form--compared to the many hours I wasted filling out insurance apps this past summer, only to be denied. All in all, I'm VERY happy. VERY VERY VERY. Ecstatic and relived. Emily Terrell, 40, part-time appraiser, Sumner, Wash. I ended up with a very different outcome than I expected. Yes, the plan I will get is still more expensive with a higher deductible. Also, my insurance company (same as before) seems to have dropped my medical practice. That's a bummer, but it might have happened anyway if I got a new job. I told my present employer that because of the new insurance, I'd have to look for another job. I work part time (20 to 30 hours per week) for this employer, and I said I'd find a new part-time job to supplement my income. Failing that, I'd go back to one of the public sector full-time jobs I left behind several years ago. (I was a community development director at a local city; now I'm a real-estate appraiser and consultant.) My employer thought about it for a week or so and came back with an offer. Even though our company is only three of us, they'd find a way to offer benefits so I could stay. We worked together but couldn't find an affordable group plan. My employer looked up options for Health Savings Accounts while I spent hours of frustration trying to find an HSA-compatible plan. After many attempts I almost bought insurance from the health exchange. I hesitated because the state wanted me to purchase dental insurance for my son. I already have dental for my son and didn't want to change up a plan that's working. I finally managed to get a call into my present insurer (they'd had real technical difficulties with the extra traffic they've been receiving). I found an HSA-compatible plan. My employer said if I paid for dental, he'd pay for health. Though I'd still be better off financially getting a full-time job in my field, because my employer values me and is willing to provide benefits (effectively a $6,000 per year raise), I can stay working from home and doing all the things that make my life great. In the end, I'd have to say this is a success story, but like the Karate Kid, I got beat up along the way. Stephen Marsh, 39, freelancer, Carmel, Ind. Sadly, I've been trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare since Nov. 4. If you hadn't contacted me, my plan had been to contact YOU, because I'm really out of options that don't involve ""alert the press"" and ""contact my senator/the president."" I'll try to keep this brief, but I know I'll fail. Healthcare.gov said I successfully registered on Nov. 9, quoting me a VERY acceptable rate (after subsidies) and putting me in initial enrollment. Unfortunately, that information has been unable to populate to my chosen provider. To summarize the hellish bureaucratic loop I've been trapped in:"	Should You Scream, Cry, Start Over? Practical Advice for Obamacare Sign-Ups.
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/escape_from_the_mysterious_room_the_game_congress_should_play.html	"This week, I volunteered to be locked in a room with 10 other people to play an escape game. It was fascinating and great fun. In the United States Senate this week, they were also playing a locked room game. Senators were trapped in a spite-fest that kept them in rare marathon sessions, through the night. In our attempt to get out of the room, we cooperated, spoke only when necessary, and focused relentlessly on progress. In the Senate, they were doing the opposite. Perhaps they could learn something from our experience. The 11 of us met to play Escape From the Mysterious Room in downtown San Francisco. A young woman guided us up industrial stairs and through long white hallways that seemed freshly constructed. You may be imagining the start of a grisly local news story--allowed themselves to be led ... windowless rooms ... turned into lampshades--but it actually felt more like a real estate agent was showing us to the last affordable apartment it the city. And that's what the room looked like when we entered. It was a rectangular space of about 250 square feet, furnished with a table, some comfortable chairs, a chest, bookshelf, and other bits of furniture. We would be locked in the room for an hour. The only way we could get out before that would be to solve a series of puzzles and open various locked objects, like a small chest, all of which would lead us (somehow) to a key. The clues to the puzzles and the tools for the physical unlockings were hidden, so when an automated voice intoned ""60 minutes,"" we started gently demolishing the place--unscrewing the desk chair, flipping over the bookshelf and violating every cushion. It was a reverse Ikea Party. When we started, we were like a gaggle of freshmen senators all full of purpose and wanting to make a name for ourselves, but with little leadership or organization. Four of us in the group were from Slate--me, my Political Gabfest co-hosts David Plotz and Emily Bazelon, and our executive producer, Andy Bowers. Four were listeners of the show who'd made generous gifts to charity--thank you!--and three were longtime Slate reader Auros Harman and two friends of his. In other words, a group with ties within it, and one which, for the purposes of complex, clock-is-ticking operations, was untested. The goal snapped us all into instant action. Everyone wanted to contribute. Emily immediately melded minds with a man she'd never met, as they sifted through an array of related clues that were brought to them by other mini-teams working in other corners of the room. Two others worked the intricate secret hiding places in a piece of furniture as though it were a performance routine they'd practiced. Most of the challenges revolved around finding the answers to crossword-like puzzles which would then reveal the next challenge. Merit was highly prized. You could prance around prattling orders or pressing your views on others, but people only listened if you could deliver toward the end goal. At one point, as three of us stood looking at one puzzle on the wall as if it were a rare Van Gogh--tilting our heads and muttering--a fourth (Auros) suggested one simple action that immediately exposed the clue that we hadn't been able to see. (I don't want to be more specific and give the game away.) For a moment, he was cheered as a genuine hero. Nine individual clues looked disconnected until one of the strangers drew quick renderings of them, and, after a few moments of experimentation, showed that they arranged into a recognizable pattern. What rescued this from being like one of those awful cooperation games your HR department forces you to do on company retreats is that this game allowed for ego. You wanted to be the one to solve the little puzzles. You didn't have to merely cheer others on. And there were no trust falls. It was group action in which each individual person could thrive. This is what made me think of the Senate, an institution of collective action with a membership formed on the basis of personal ambition. But the locked-room game is not exactly a model for that body in its current state. Our senators have already tried to lock themselves in a situation that requires them to be productive. It was called sequestration. It was essentially an attempt to box the members of Congress into a corner, in order to force them to work toward a goal they all wanted to achieve. Instead, sequestration failed, because after a faint-hearted effort, everyone decided they didn't like the stupid game and that it was the other guy's fault for wanting to play in the first place. In reacquainting themselves with the attributes required for progress, lawmakers will have to start slowly and that's where the locked-room game could be useful. What if Democrats and Republicans were broken into little bipartisan teams and forced to play our game? The urgency of the task would force them to put away their speeches and focus on progress and accomplishments. After working this atrophied muscle for an hour they might develop a fondness for achievement-through-collective-action and try it outside the room. Or, by being forced to trust and rely on each other, they might discover hidden talents in themselves and in each other that could be applied to working on legislation. If nothing else, the activity would at least force them to spend time together outside of the hallways where they pass each other with only a nod. This is something they used to do before partisanship and fundraising trips kept them from attending the same social functions in Washington. And it would push them into more useful contact than a tea party or a dinner would--no time wasted with meaningless chit chat. The locked-room game is also an effective identifier of the weak and the lame. Those who try to take control without earning it can be easily identified. Those who mint bad ideas on the half-minute can be offered cabinet posts. The game also helps identify organizational flaws. We were enthusiastic and focused but could have used a strong leader at times to keep us from duplicating work. We should have chosen such a leader at the outset. The game, like public policy, teaches you that answering questions is not the only key to success. You must make sure you're answering the right questions. Activity can make you feel like you're making progress, but it can also be a trap.gov. In the end, our bunch didn't get to the key. We came very close. We chewed through the next-to-last challenge quickly, shouting out the answers and racing to the next one, knowing we were inches away. It was a frantic burst of last minute activity Congress only approaches when a holiday break is near and everyone wants to get out of town. But unlike Congress, which often heads into the holidays in a fit of acrimony, we all emerged beaming and energized. Perhaps when the next vacation approaches, members of Congress could go on this particular field trip."	We Had to Work Together to Escape from a Room. It's a Game Congress Should Try Playing.

In a meeting with his House colleagues to discuss Wednesday's budget agreement, the House speaker finally let loose on the conservative groups that have been roiling Republican politics. Organizations like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action had opposed the plan without even knowing its details, said Boehner, because their true goal was to raise money and expand their organizations, not fight for any particular principle or policy. ""No one controls your voting card but you,"" Boehner said. This wasn't just a message for closed-doors. The speaker took on the groups in public: ""They're using our members, and they're using the American people for their own goals,"" Boehner said in a press conference Wednesday. ""This is ridiculous."" The budget agreement reached by Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray could very well bring some order to a policy process that has skidded from crisis to crisis for the last four years. But politically the deal has the potential to be very disruptive. Boehner was not simply voicing an alternative policy position about the merits of the plan's spending reductions. He was making a claim about the low motives and trickery of the organizations that claim to represent the interests of grassroots conservatives. When Ryan unveiled the budget agreement, he prefaced several of his statements by saying ""as a conservative."" What's being debated is not just the merits of the agreement, but who gets to determine who is and isn't a conservative. Ryan, the author of budgets that have been characterized by Democrats as radically conservative, is a trusted voice. He at least has the right enemies. What Ryan and Boehner are arguing for is pragmatic conservatism. Ryan made his case in the pages of the National Review:"	Why Boehner Is Ready to Call Out the Party's Far Right for Playing Dirty 
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/progressive_change_campaign_committee_third_way_and_elizabeth_warren_how.html	"Before we all forget about the latest spat between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and the banks, before it's downgraded to an anecdote in Game Change III: The Changeling, let's reflect on how the media got dragged into it and covered the story on Warren's terms. Short version: Two honchos at the center-left think tank Third Way wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed warning that a proposal to expand Social Security was foolishness and ""economic populism is a dead end for Democrats."" A clutch of progressives--or, if you prefer, economic populists--demanded that elected Democrats distance themselves from the op-ed. The senior senator from Massachusetts issued an open letter to bankers, asking them to disclose their donations to think tanks, and then told the Huffington Post that Third Way was ""flatly wrong."" All of this, according to the New York Times, was ""a sign of the left's new aggressiveness."" It was. For bonus points, it was a lesson in how easy it can be to draw the media, bankers, pundits, and activists into a ""war,"" as long as you've a got a working Internet connection and a strong hook. Both of the ideas at the heart of this fight--corporate influence over think tanks, expanding Social Security--had been litigated for years, well before Warren got to the Senate. This time, a small number of progressives just took advantage of the media's bias toward big personalities, and its obsession with presidential politics, to change what the media covered. The progressives' distaste for Third Way is as old as the organization itself. It was founded in 2005, after George W. Bush won an election that ended the careers of several red state ""New Democrats."" The exiles built an ""idea tank"" that would provide advice on how to recapture the center. It issued reports with advice about how the Hispanic vote was slipping away from the blue team (oops!) and how ""Democratic candidates for national office will be running uphill"" as long as liberals were ""the public face of the party."" The online left was attacking Bush in its own way. The re-elected president stomped across swing states making the case for the partial privatization of Social Security. The ""netroots"" crowd responded with, among other things, a catchall website at ThereIsNoCrisis.com. Washington's deathless pundit class, which never suffers for getting things wrong, warned that Democrats would suffer if they unreasonably refused to deal with Bush. Democrats gained in the polls, Bush dropped his plan, and the left was proven right, at least on strategy. The online left built new organizations like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, founded in 2009, and Progressives United, founded by Russ Feingold after he lost his Senate seat in the Tea Party wave. The movement, a confederacy of thirtysomethings, talked over listservs, at D.C. bars, at donor conferences hosted by groups like the Democracy Alliance. It built email lists and Twitter lists by demanding a public option in the Affordable Care Act and opposing the series of short-term austerity deals that came to define Washington in the Obama years. It almost always lost, and groups like Third Way--which warned Democrats against the public option, for example--always won. ""Who else is the insurance industry paying off?"" wrote PCCC co-founder Adam Green in a 2009 Huffington Post blog entry. ""Is it entirely coincidental that Third Way--which has no grassroots membership and is fully reliant on big donors--is going to bat for a proposal that would bring billions (trillions?) to the insurance industry? If Third Way is anything other than a corporate shill, with ideas that are for sale to the highest corporate bidder, they have an obligation to make transparent how much money they get from the insurance industry."" Green's jeremiad got little mainstream media pick-up. Neither did Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin's 2012 legislation (also announced on Huffington Post) to expand Social Security. Harkin, who's retiring in 2014, proposed lifting the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes, recalculating the cost of living, and increasing payments. He got the plan scored: It added 19 years of full payments to Social Security's current schedule. Duncan Black, one of the first popular liberal bloggers, used a USA Today guest-columnist gig to endorse a similar plan. None of this made it into the soup of buzzy, acceptable policy ideas known as the ""conversation."" Even the progressives, especially the PCCC, took some time to see the potential of the Harkin plan. ""We were tired of playing on defense,"" explains Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the Howard Dean-founded Democracy for America, who previously worked for the House Progressive Caucus. ""Every time the Congress reached a fiscal crisis, you'd see the president caving on Social Security and proposing chained CPI."" PCCC et al had been threatening primary challenges of Democrats who backed the president's offer, but that didn't get much coverage. Finally, on July 24 of this year, the PCCC, the DFA, and Social Security Works announced that Alaska Sen. Mark Begich--a red-state Democrat, up for re-election next year--had signed on to the Harkin plan. ""This petition and this weekend's Ed Show appearance are the first steps,"" wrote PCCC leaders on their email list. ""Then come calls to Congress, local press conferences, and the release of poll numbers showing the popularity of this proposal."" The first polling, a Public Policy Polling survey in Kentucky, pegged support for the plan at 51 percent. But there was no new traction for the plan, not outside the left. That started to change on Nov. 10, when the New Republic published a profile of Warren by Noam Scheiber, arguing that the left had found a message--and maybe messenger--as dangerous to the Clinton Restoration as Barack Obama had been in 2008. Among his data points: The aggressive promotion of Warren by groups like the PCCC, which fundraised for Warren in 2012 and printed stickers reading ""I'm From the Elizabeth Warren Wing of the Democratic Party."" One week later, to the surprise of Harkin's staff, Warren went to the floor of the Senate to endorse the Social Security plan. The left's enemies responded as predictably as Godzilla swatting at Mothra. ""Social Security proposals are wrongheaded,"" editorialized the Washington Post. Warren was a latecomer to the idea, but she was in that sweet spot that had reporters paying attention to her and asking her repeatedly if she'd run for president. (She keeps saying that she won't.) On the evening of Dec. 3, the Wall Street Journal published Third Way's op-ed. ""That Social Security plan had been out there but really languishing,"" column co-author Jim Kessler would later tell a radio host. ""Because Sen. Warren has such a powerful compelling voice, she started talking about it, and it suddenly it became much more talked about and viable alternative."" The op-ed circulated immediately on progressive listervs. Adam Green was asking any other progressive activists if they wanted in on a campaign to take Third Way apart. Mothra was swatting back. ""Just looking at the Third Way editorial, where it ran, who the audience was, it didn't strike me as a policy argument,"" says Progressives United spokesman (and former Feingold spokesman) Josh Orton. ""It was a cultural attack. I mean, Warren didn't even write the bill! It reminded me of what you hear from the bankers who say Obama is too mean to them. It could have been a fundraising letter to those bankers--who knows? Third Way has been a joke among progressives for years, but they didn't just fall off the turnip truck."" Shortly before 10 a.m. on Dec. 4, the PCCC emailed its Pennsylvania list (they claim around 29,000 members in the state) with the latest on this anti-Warren outrage, and how it would affect them. ""Third Way--a Wall Street-funded group that poses as a ""progressive"" think tank--blasted Warren and her bold economic agenda yesterday in Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal,"" wrote Green. ""Rep. Allyson Schwartz is Honorary Co-Chair of this group that's attacking Elizabeth Warren! Can you call Allyson Schwartz today and tell her to drop her affiliation with Third Way immediately?"" Why hit Schwartz, a congresswoman from the Philadelphia suburbs? One reason was that the PCCC had just met with John Hanger, a primary foe in Schwartz's current race for governor. He was polling at 4 percent, but he was guaranteed to make this a litmus-test issue for Schwartz. Within hours, Schwartz's campaign had told the Huffington Post that the op-ed was ""outrageous."" That advanced the story. So did Warren's open letter to five banks asking them to disclose their donations to Washington think tanks. Politico gave anonymity to a ""senior D.C. Republican,"" who argued that the ""normally savvy"" senator had blown it, and that her "" 'give me the names' edict sounds uncomfortably like the kind of demand that Joe McCarthy would have made in the 1950s."" It was just the sort of stuck-pig squeal that Warren's allies expect from the bankers and their defenders. They couldn't have scripted it--but they sort of did script it. The furor only lasted a few days, but the bile lingered. When I asked Third Way co-founder (and current VP for public affairs) Matt Bennett about the idea that the think tank was fishing for donors in the Wall Street Journal's subscription list, he laughed.* ""That's ridiculous,"" said Bennett. We had an op-ed in the New York Times two weeks ago and we had an op-ed in the Washington Post two months ago. There are only so many papers, and it just so happened that this wound up in the Wall Street Journal. The idea of the op-ed was really intended to create a stark choice for Democrats. Do we grapple with the entitlement crisis or not? It doesn't have the slightest thing to do with the finance sector. And by the way, we've taken very progressive views on financial reform. We've featured lectures by people like Paul Volcker and Sheila Bair who are not, shall we say, running dogs for the banks."" But they are think tankers who give quotes to reporters about the danger of a left-wing Democratic Party. In 2012, Bennett even knocked Elizabeth Warren, and was hat-tipped by no less an admirer than Sen. Scott Brown. That was why the progressives shot at their knees. Third Way is, as think tanks go, somewhat transparent about who writes their checks. During the Warren contretemps, The Nation's Lee Fang was able to source public records and prove that Third Way took money from corporate lobbyists and hedge fund managers. The progressives who want to mainstream a redistributive Social Security reform want, in the meantime, to discredit the people who may oppose it. Third Way understands the game. When I asked Bennett whether his think tank was opposed to ""economic populism,"" he wondered whether that term was de facto positive. ""It depends on how you view economic populism,"" he said. ""We didn't view the president's speech last week as populist, for example. He was talking about poverty--and that's a Democratic point of view, what he said. We view populism the way we view right-wing populism. It's a way to avoid making choices. Right-wing populists say that if we cut government down, everything will be better. The idea on the left is that if we can just expand entitlements, everything will be better and we don't have to make choices. And we just don't agree.""

She visited the site repeatedly since its series of rolling pratfalls started on Oct. 1. It never worked. She endured rounds of customer service help, which was no help at all. One interaction with online representative PGSTX0534 was indistinguishable from an MFA student's pastiche of Beckett. She tried to get eligibility determinations, premium estimates, and other useful information and the answers ranged from vague to maddening. Meanwhile, Alice was one of those on the individual market who had received a note saying that she would soon be losing her insurance. She suspected she would be uninsured by Jan. 1. Alice then decided to try a different route; she tried to sign up via a paper application, which led to a more old-fashioned experience with Pony Express wait times. (It took three weeks for her just to get the starter paperwork.) Another three weeks after returning her paperwork, she called each day to find out if her forms had been processed. They had not. Monday, I asked her if she had tried the new and improved website. She said she'd give it another try, just for kicks. This is the response I received:	Will Slate's Health Care Guinea Pig Finally Get Insured?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/democrats_have_an_obamacare_punch_list_the_president_s_party_prepares_for.html	"On Saturday, President Obama's new Web startup--healthcare.gov--is supposed to work better.  How much better is a little hard to pin down. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius says, ""We are definitely on track to have a significantly different user experience by the end of this month."" Considering the initial experience was a near total collapse, Sebelius is doing an excellent job at keeping expectations in the bargain basement. It is practically impossible for the site to fail at offering a ""different user experience,"" so her guarantee is perhaps the weakest promise one could make. The official promise is much more brave. According to a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the entire federal health care system, from beginning to end, will work as originally intended for the vast majority of users. That doesn't just mean that the site will function--from sign-up to picking a new plan--but that the handoff of information to insurance companies will run as intended. That back-end step has been the tricky one, even as improvements have been made to the beleaguered site. Insurance company sources tell the National Journal that there is still about a 5 percent error rate in the information the site submits to insurance companies on behalf of those picking a new insurance plan. If the site is fixed but this problem is not, the problem could get worse. People would sign on, fill out the forms, and insurance companies would be flooded with bad data. That would delay insurance companies sending out bills, which is the necessary step required for a person to actually have insurance by Jan. 1. For those in the individual market who have coverage now, if they don't sign up by that deadline, they will be exposed. The administration says the problem--the so-called 834 forms--is at the top of the ""punch list,"" but they have been saying that for months and aren't saying how much progress has been made. If this glitch remains, people who believed they were on the verge of getting new coverage will wonder what's up. They'll call their member of Congress, and those members will re-up their calls for delays and changes in the law. Sen. Al Franken has said he is open to a delay of the individual mandate if the problems with the system aren't fixed by the end of the month. A lingering 834 problem would appear to qualify as not being fixed. While HHS troubleshooters may have a policy punch list, Franken and other Democrats in Congress have a ""political punch list"" of their own. Vulnerable Democrats can't improve the implementation of the law, but they can limit their political liability by acting quickly when problems arise and preparing themselves for the predictable problems that are coming next year. The political damage to Democrats has been growing since the healthcare.gov debacle started. In the generic ballot poll--the crude but talismanic survey question used to test the relative health of the two parties--Republicans have closed a seven-point deficit they had after the government shutdown. Republicans are now ever so slightly favored over Democrats--42 to 41--in the average of polls. This shift is worrying to Democrats. Members of Congress and party strategists believe their problem is not just the broken promises and issues created by the site but also their party's slow response time. Democrats were caught flat-footed on the expiration of the promise that if you like your insurance, you can keep it. Voters wanted to see them on the case, trying to fix the situation. By the time the president apologized and then offered a ""fix"" that allowed insurance companies to permit people to keep their plans, the political damage had already been done. To avoid making the same mistake again, Democrats are looking at a number of problems likely to crop up in the next year and how they can be ready to respond when those little fires start. The first set of challenges will come from the delays the president used to lower the political pressure. On Wednesday the administration announced a delay in small businesses' access to the online marketplace, which means a year of complaints from small business owners about having to manage the cumbersome signup through other methods. (Though businesses can still sign up through an agent or broker, which is how many of them do it now.) The employer mandate will also come up again. In July, the Obama administration delayed the requirement that businesses with more than 50 employees cover their employees. Next fall Democrats may face the same kinds of political pressure that forced the delay this year, including stories about how companies are cutting employees' hours to avoid covering their health care. One of the problems with the back-end issues insurance companies are facing is the problem of ""orphan records""--people who think they've signed up on the web site but the information never actually made it to the insurance company. Those people are going to assume they're covered on Jan. 1, 2014. That's a possible anecdote factory of people who need care, were covered before, thought they'd switched to the new program, and are now are shocked and panicked because they're not. Another potential headache that needs to be managed is the president's promise that people can keep their doctor if they would like to. That won't be the case for many people as insurers restrict the choice of doctors to keep costs down. And then there's the fact that the IRS will be handling the enforcement of the law--a highly unpopular institution the Republicans have exploited for political gain before. Those are the Affordable Care Act's known aches and pains. Other problems Democrats worry about come from health system changes that have nothing to do with Obamacare but that Republicans will pin on the president's law. For years, employers have been pushing more of the cost of providing health insurance to their workers, particularly in a slow economy. As that trend continues, some companies will make employees pick up a bigger share of the premiums for coverage of family members. That's a long-term trend likely to continue and not directly attributable to the ACA. But Democrats worry that next year, all insurance market changes and market activity will be something they have to answer for. That could be upsetting enough to make Democrats want to punch somebody."	Why Democrats Are Preparing for Obamacare's Next Broken Promise

They had been invited to dinner and were greeted by Johnson's 16-year-old daughter who was barefoot in a green Chinese robe. Lady Bird was upstairs, after having attended a prayer service for the slain president and spending some time with Jackie Kennedy. Johnson was not yet home from the White House. To avoid the constant talk about Kennedy's assassination, the conversation turned to the practicalities of being 16 in the White House. ""How would you like it to have Secret Service men with you every minute of the day?"" Luci asked. Even now she couldn't talk to a boy late at night without the phone light going on in her parents' bedroom. Her father, seeing it, would either monitor the call or interrupt to tell her that she ought to be asleep. She concluded that living in the White House would only be worthwhile if she could have her own private line. My parents were there because my mother, Nancy Dickerson had known Johnson since the early 1950s and had covered him for CBS and NBC. The night of the shooting, Mom had been at Andrews Air Force Base with fellow journalist Bob Abernethy covering the return of the president's body. Afterward, she had stood in the rain outside of Johnson's home hoping to catch him when he returned late that night. Arriving accompanied by Secret Service agents with their guns drawn, Johnson waved but did not stop. The next day, she was on a TV panel discussing what his presidency might be like. After she was off the air, Mom was handed the phone. Johnson was on the line. He complimented her and issued the dinner invitation. When Johnson arrived home that evening, Lady Bird came downstairs with a drink and popcorn. The president immediately launched into a review of the broadcast Mom had been on earlier that day. It was clear that he had spent much of the day monitoring television coverage. The night before he had an extra television delivered to the house so that he could watch all the networks simultaneously. On the NBC show, one of Mom's colleagues, Martin Agronsky, had said that the powerful House Speaker Sam Rayburn had tried to persuade Johnson not to join John Kennedy on the presidential ticket. Mom very gently tried to correct Agronsky, suggesting that once all the history was out, it might turn out that Rayburn had actually been supportive, despite initial qualms. (History suggests she was right.) ""You corrected Agronsky without making a fool of him,"" said the new president about her colleague. ""Rayburn changed. He did want me to take the nomination, and you set the record straight without making him eat crow in public. Only way to do it."" Johnson was appreciative because in the days after the shooting he didn't want anyone suggesting that there had been any ambivalence about him becoming vice president or any distance between Johnson and the slain president. Johnson paced and turned back to the TVs. He started talking back to NBC's Huntley-Brinkley Report. He was determined that the country should be calm, and whenever the broadcasting duo said something he thought was inflammatory, Johnson would bark: ""Keep talking like that and you'll bring on a revolution just as sure as I'm standing here."" He wished Rayburn were alive to counsel him, Johnson said to no one in particular. Returning to Mom's gentle correction of her colleague, Johnson then told a Rayburn story. In his early days in the House, he explained, he was trying to get funds for a public works project but an older, stronger congressman had opposed it. Johnson maneuvered the program into committee and then onto the House floor. He won the debate on the floor but in doing so publicly put down his older opponent. Afterward, Rayburn took him aside and said, ""Lyndon, you feel pretty smart because you got what you wanted. But you also got yourself an enemy. A really clever fellow would have won without ridiculing a man on the way, and earning himself an enemy for life."" Everyone nodded. The president's speechwriter Horace Busby and Judge Homer Thornberry arrived. Johnson explained that he'd ordered the Secret Service to protect House Speaker John McCormack because he was worried about a government-wide coup. That afternoon the Soviets had made a show of good faith by turning over a complete dossier on Lee Harvey Oswald's activities during his years in Moscow. Johnson was relieved but not settled. ""Maybe they're out to get us all,"" he said. He was going to keep the armed services on alert. He wasn't sure the assassination was the work of just one man. He worried about conspiracy theories, too. He talked about how Lincoln's assassination still had unanswered questions: ""... Damn sure that kind of mystery doesn't happen here. I'm going to make sure there isn't one damn question or one damn mystery that isn't solved about this thing. You can be sure of that ... not one damn unanswered question."" He interrupted himself, walking over to the phone and pushing one of its buttons. He picked up the receiver. ""Is this the White House?"" Johnson said. ""Oh, sorry."" Then he punched another: ""The White House? Sorry."" He looked over at his wife. ""Bird! Come over here and get me the White House. That's going to have to be changed! The whole damn world could go up in smoke and I wouldn't even be able to get Dean Rusk. Take me 10 damn minutes to reach the secretary of state."" The White House secretaries who logged Johnson's activities every day as president recorded the moment with almost comical blandness. ""[President Johnson] said that one of the first things he would like to do is revise the White House operator system. It was too slow for him. ... All other things would be left the same at the White House. Didn't want to change anything."" (For every change the new president would make in those early days, no matter how small or worthwhile, Johnson was always careful to assure everyone that he would keep continuity with Kennedy). Finally the president got through to his National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy. He reminded him to ""get those wires out fast"" to every country recognized by the United States to assure them of the continuity of our government. Then, without irony after his inability to work the phones, he told Bundy: ""I don't want any of them thinking that we don't know what to do."" Next in the secretary's log is: ""Told Nancy about Rufus bravery."" Johnson's first letter as president had been to the Kennedy children. His second had been to the head of the Secret Service commending agent Rufus Youngblood. Immediately after the first shot was fired in Dallas, Johnson told the group that Youngblood threw Johnson and his wife onto the floor of the car. ""There we were hunkered down in the car and he had his body on us,"" said Johnson. ""And Bird was hunkered down there with us, too. We were hunkered. Rufus moved so fast. It was one of the greatest things I have ever seen, Nancy. I didn't know Rufus had that many reflexes."" At one point during the evening, Judge Thornberry called his daughter to reassure her, just as millions of parents called their children that night. LBJ took the phone from Thornberry and started talking. ""Is he your boyfriend?"" he asked. ""What's his name? Buddy? Well, put Buddy on, I want to talk with him ... Buddy? This is Lyndon Johnson, your new president ... just fine thank you ... you ... Thank you ... need all the help we can get ... Well, Buddy, take good care of that little girl who is with you ..."" It was as if Johnson was trying to comfort the country one person at a time, a job that would consume him for the first days of his presidency. If the president was ready, his wife was not. Before my mother left, Lady Bird said she was running out of black clothes to wear to all of the events. When Mom got home after dinner, she gathered her black coats and dresses to send over the next day. She would also call a local shop and have them send Lady Bird some black hats. She then sat down to the typewriter, set the caps lock, and typed out everything she could remember."	What My Mom Saw at LBJ's House the Night After JFK Died
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/filibuster_reform_the_senate_and_partisanship_the_old_institution_was_already.html	"If West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd were still in the Senate, it would be fascinating to see which side of the recent filibuster debate he would take. Byrd was a defender of Senate traditions, which caused him to warn his Democratic colleagues against changing the filibuster rules, but as majority leader, it was Byrd who in 1980 pushed to weaken filibuster rules. Whatever his view, Byrd's baroque oration would have drawn from Shakespeare (he quoted from all 37 plays in his 50-year career) and Cicero. But Byrd passed away three years ago. The Senate club whose rules he knew so well and righteously defended passed away some time ago too, though the exact date is not known. So today's change was merely a rule that codified an established fact: The Senate club is no longer what it once was. Or, as Byrd might put it, today's change made what was de facto now de jure. In the old Senate, the rules and customs created a culture of comity and bipartisanship. Little can be done in the Senate without unanimous consent of its members. That is one of its bedrock principles, which means each senator has tremendous power, but also has a certain amount of responsibility to keep the place humming. In return for such power, senators are supposed to follow the established norms of regular order, give extra weight to the views of veteran members, and shave off their partisan edges. Vice President Biden tells a story of being a young member of the Senate and saying something derogatory about North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms. Sen. Mike Mansfield, the Democratic leader, told Biden to knock it off. ""Everyone's sent here for a reason, because there's something in them that their folks like,"" he told the young Delaware senator. ""Don't question their motive."" That club doesn't exist anymore. The traditions are still there--senators are not supposed to refer to each other by first name--but as the memories about political slights grow longer than the memories of maintaining time-honored institutional traditions, the place has changed. In part, that's because the keepers of the partisan grudges live throughout the country. The Senate club is much smaller and younger and more receptive to their pressure. Only 32 members of the Senate have served at least three terms, down from 44 just six years ago. More than half of the senators have served one full term or less. As my colleague David Weigel writes, on the Democratic side this shift means there are more new Democrats pushing for filibuster reform. On the Republican side, the new ways showed themselves during the government shutdown. Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee essentially took control of the Senate for a period, leading the movement to tie funding the government to defunding Obamacare. It wasn't a success, but they got further than they would have in the old days. Leaders like Minority Leader Mitch McConnell face Tea Party challenges from the grass roots that limit what they can do in the Senate for fear of reprisals back home. Though incumbents still have plenty of protections, voters don't reward longevity as they once did. Committee chairmen who once controlled legislation and were more powerful than their party leaders have been neutered, which means a young upstart can make a name for himself and gain power by going on cable TV much faster than working patiently within the system to become a chairman. Following the rules of the greenroom can do more for your career than following the rules of the cloakroom. Among the things that have also died is the restrained use of the filibuster. This change weakens the minority's argument against the majority pushing filibuster reform--in the long run, this will hurt you because you'll be in the minority one day, too. The old Senate was like a game of baseball--long, with lots of beer, time for conversation, lead changes, and occasional moments of excitement. The Senate today feels more like football--every play is combat, clash, and action of the moment. Given this pace, grab your chance to change the rules now because your opponent is going to change them in the future anyway. As Majority Leader Harry Reid orchestrated the change in the rules governing executive nominations and lower-court appointments, his opponents cried tyranny, though they also promised that when they took power they would go further, applying the new standard to Supreme Court nominations. In other words, tyranny--but we promise we'll give you more of it. The new rules fit with that kind of Senate. When the Senate club does work, it's a shadow of its former self. The most recent example was the deal between Reid and McConnell to end the government shutdown. It was heralded as a model of cooperation and adult behavior. Members took to the floor to celebrate their ability to come together.It was almost like they had achieved something like Medicare or the Civil Rights Act. What they had achieved was simply that they had ended a government shutdown, which their members had helped launch in the first place. The Senate's job is to produce a budget, and instead its members could not rally fast enough to stop a shutdown that cost the economy $24 billion and 120,000 jobs. For stopping shy of $25 billion, they were congratulating themselves. Why are you hitting your head with that hammer? Because it feels good when I stop. Whoever is ultimately at fault for the rule change--the Democrats who forced it or the Republicans who blocked the nominations requiring the new rules--the result is that the minority will have less power. That means elections will matter even more than they did before. Every Republican campaign now has more incentive to fight harder to win the six seats needed to take back the Senate in the 2014 election. Presidential elections now mean more, too. Reid's move will secure Obama's legacy because the new nominees to the appeals court will be in a position to protect his achievements. Moderate senators will hold more power. Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor and Joe Manchin voted against the rule change. In the future, in a closely divided Senate, they are the kind of senators who will be the key vote to give or deny the majority their nominee. Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat, also voted against the new rules, but he's retiring, making way for another rookie. If the rookie is a Republican, one of his or her first tasks may be changing the rules again. Listen to this Gabfest Extra on the Senate's ""nuclear option."""	Why Filibuster Reform Is the Old Senate's Official Death Notice
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/scott_walker_republican_party_and_2016_the_wisconsin_governor_may_be_the.html	"If you are a Republican and you like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, then you probably already have your candidate for the 2016 presidential campaign. If you do not like Christie, then your candidate for 2016 is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Now that we've worked that out, you can ignore the next two years of GOP infighting. You can spend your free time canning beans or mastering the miter saw. It's a very premature conclusion, but the Wisconsin governor appears to be the only likely conservative alternative to Christie who also has a chance at getting elected. If you are uncomfortable with Christie as the default establishment choice, there is an incentive to choose someone else early. Because if the New Jersey governor's opponents split their vote among several candidates in the primaries, Christie will be the GOP nominee. The anti-Christie fragmentation is already underway. Once he was re-elected governor, the auditions to play the role of ABC (Anybody but Christie) started pretty quickly. Sen. Ted Cruz drew a fundamental distinction. ""I think it is terrific that he is brash, that he is outspoken, and that he won his race,"" said the Texas senator of Christie. ""But I think we need more leaders in Washington with the courage to stand for principle."" Sen. Marco Rubio tried to make the blue state of New Jersey a jail cell. ""Clearly, he was able to speak to the hopes and aspirations of people within New Jersey,"" said Rubio. ""That's important. We want to win everywhere, and Gov. Chris Christie has certainly shown he has a way of winning in New Jersey, in states like New Jersey."" Sen. Rand Paul said it was good to have a ""moderate"" like Christie in the party. Later he said Christie never would have won re-election were it not for the federal largess that paid for the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. The senators have spoken. The problem is that's what senators are mostly known for doing: talking. They may make good presidential candidates, but in 2016 the political bias is going to be for chief executives. Republican voters tend to be fond of governors; they see the job as good training for the White House. You sharpen a set of skills that more closely track with the ones you'll need in the Oval Office. With the voters so sick of Washington politicians, the political incentive is to stay away from senators because--no matter how much they behave like insurgents--they still have the smell of Washington on them. Finally, Republicans have been vocal for a long time that President Obama's failures flow from his lack of executive experience. Given this, it is hard to imagine that enough voters would want to replace him with another one-term senator who has built his reputation on nothing more than the quality of his speeches. (Unsurprisingly, Walker thinks the GOP is going to nominate a governor in 2016, too). That narrows the field down to the pool of leading current and former Republican governors: Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, Rick Perry, and Walker. All of those men have something to recommend them, but ""no one checks as many boxes as Walker does,"" as an Iowa GOP strategist puts it. Walker has near hero status in the grassroots for taking on Wisconsin's public sector unions. Cruz talks about taking stands on principle, but he lost his fight. Walker took a stand, was targeted by the full force of the Democratic machine, and stayed alive. He won a recall election with a larger margin than his original victory. He raised $30 million for that race, so he knows how to tap wealthy donors. Social conservatives also consider him one of their own for his pro-life views and his pedigree: His father was a Baptist minister. Jindal and Perry have supporters in conservative circles, but Jindal can't match Walker's union-slaying story and Perry's accomplishments won't help him overcome the memories of his disastrous 2012 run. If the incentive is to pick a Christie alternative who can survive, it also helps if the candidate comes from a battleground state--even better if they come from a swing state in the Midwest. Walker also brings helpful connections to Iowa, that early caucus state. Besides governing in nearby Wisconsin, Walker grew up in Iowa. Right now GOP operatives describe the competition in the Hawkeye State as one between Rand Paul (whose forces control the state party) and Sen. Ted Cruz (who excites the base). Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hails from a swing state, but he himself has admitted that he is out of step with the Republican Party on immigration. He may still be noodling a run, but he could easily be painted as a GOP moderate--and that space is already occupied by Christie. That leaves just John Kasich of Ohio. Like Walker, Kasich also took on the unions, but he lost. In the eyes of conservatives, he did something else that may be unpardonable: He took federal Medicaid money as a part of the Affordable Care Act. That robs Kasich of an issue he could have used to distinguish himself from Christie (who also took Medicaid money) and, say some conservatives, dismantles his ability to argue for smaller spending in Washington. Walker, on the other hand, refused the Medicaid money, and is launching his own state solution, which is receiving praise from conservatives. Walker has a book coming out tomorrow, Unintimidated: A Governor's Story and a Nation's Challenge, which has just the title you'd want if you were trying to use your record as governor as the platform for a national run. His biggest challenge may be his temperate demeanor. Conservatives want a fighter, and while Walker throws punches, he doesn't seem nearly as pugilistic as Christie, Cruz, and Paul. Personality traits can matter a great deal in primaries where policy distinctions between candidates are nearly nonexistent. Walker's other challenge is that he's still facing re-election in 2014. The polls are tight, but he could take a lesson from Christie: A strong win makes you seem strong."	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker May Be the GOP's Choice in 2016

The Oregon senator, who's up for re-election next year but lacks a strong challenger, had been a shock endorser of Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu's bill to force insurers to extend the cheap plans that had been scrapped for noncompliance with the Affordable Care Act. President Obama had just finished telling Americans that he had fixed the problem--he'd gone ahead and changed a rule, allowing the plans to continue for a year. So what did Merkley think? ""It doesn't go as far as I'd like to go,"" he said, ""but it's certainly a step in the right direction."" He still liked that pesky Landrieu bill, because it honored his idea of Obamacare. ""The concept was, when you came to the exchange, you could choose between the plan you had and the exchange without any limitation on the length you could keep the plan that you had."" Some 70 minutes later, after White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough had briefed the Democrats on the new rule, Merkley re-emerged from the meeting. He was born again. ""I really applaud the president for responding to our call,"" he said. ""We wanted to make sure the promise made was kept. He's gone a long way towards that today. The point is, now, what we have to do is have all legislators team up and call on the insurance industry to offer their side of the bargain. I'll certainly be calling on the insurance companies in Oregon to extend what they were offering."" President Obama's health care presser may be remembered as the ""fumble"" speech, or as the time he was so tangled on Obamacare that a question about the threat of a nuclear Iran became his life raft. But one of his goals, which partially succeeded, was to get his party back on the blame-the-insurers bandwagon. ""The old individual market was not working well,"" explained the president. He would be ""requiring insurers to extend current plans to inform their customers about two things: One, what protections these renewed plans don't include. Number two, that the marketplace offers new options with better coverage and tax credits that might help you bring down the cost."" Democrats are worried--correctly so!--that the cancellation letters about individual plans cannot be stopped. At best, if insurers defied all predictions and decided to re-offer the canceled plans, the president's rule would lead them back to the shredder in one year. ""The Obama rule is short-term political posturing,"" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican who's trying to rekindle support for his bill restoring canceled plans by revising it to save more plans that might be scrapped. ""There's very little we can do for people who've already got cancellation notices. There are people in the group plans whose policies will be renewing next year. If they have to comply with mandates that drive up the cost of health care, they'll drop coverage. There's the real danger--that's when you see tens of millions of people getting dropped."" But this is the world the Democrats created. They can't expect to have an excuse for every canceled plan--the cancellation of less comprehensive plans is necessary for the law to work. So they're going to follow in the president's wake, pronounce the ""if you like your plan"" controversy settled, and place the onus for increased costs or dropped plans with insurers again. ""The president's honored his promise,"" said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. ""I think it was the right decision, and I think the important thing is that--you know, we're hearing about people who are getting cancellations. Most people who are delighted to be getting coverage that they could never get before aren't writing in because they're happy."" Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who like King doesn't face re-election until 2018, emphasized that the White House needed to change its focus. ""I think the administration's done enough,"" he said. ""And I think you get back to messaging to the American public all the benefits of this bill, rather than duplicating the administration's efforts with the legislation on the Senate floor."" House Democrats, who are being jammed tomorrow with a vote on a Republican ""keep your plan"" bill, got their own Thursday meeting with McDonough. While Democrats met, their opposites spoke on the House floor, giving treacly, anger-making updates on the lives of constituents whose plans had been canceled. Yet Democrats left their meeting with a Merkley-esque spring in their steps; it was time to explain, again, that the heartless cancellations were all up to the heartless insurers. ""Requiring the insurance people to tell people what they're not getting covered is part of it,"" said Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen. ""We can't force anybody to do anything!"" insisted Washington Rep. Jim McDermott. ""One of the big issues here that nobody's talking about is that we're trying to make a change to insurance at the national level, when it's always been regulated at the state level. This is because of insurance companies canceling policies, changing them. The churning in the individual market has been going on as long as I've been in medicine, 30 years."" Why should that sooth the Democrats? Well, there was an election in 2012, too. Plenty of insurers drove up the costs of their plans. The party did fairly well anyway. In the base case, post-""keep your plan"" scenario, some of the extinct plans will be resurrected, but new premiums for those and other plans will be unveiled right before the midterms. Democrats can't stop the prices from going up. They can try to stop people from blaming their party for the sticker shock."	Democrats Didn't Just Escape Blame for Obamacare
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/slate_surveymonkey_healthcare_gov_poll_what_do_americans_think_of_the_obamacare.html	Since the launch of the Affordable Care Act's online health insurance marketplace in October, news coverage of technical glitches, coding problems, and a dysfunctional website has been unrelenting. Pundits and politicians have been casting blame or defending the program, but what do citizens think of the Obamacare rollout? Not surprisingly, a Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll found that most respondents are unimpressed with the glitch-prone healthcare.gov, even though few have even tried to sign up. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Considering the avalanche of negative news following the website's botched launch, the fact that even 13 percent of respondents considered the launch a success is a surprise. With Obama on an apology tour and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius getting lambasted everywhere from Capitol Hill to The Daily Show, 13 percent ain't bad. The plurality, at 38 percent, thought that the launch was extremely unsuccessful, while 60 percent overall deemed the launch unsuccessful. More than a quarter of the respondents hadn't made up their minds on the site's success yet, possibly waiting to see whether the technical issues are resolved before giving up on it. The impression of a failed launch is evident in the rate that people are accessing the website.  Barely 10 percent of the survey's respondents had tried to access the website, and only 22 percent knew someone who had attempted to log on. While most of the survey respondents, like most of the U.S. population, don't need a new insurance plan, these numbers are still remarkably low. The numbers also offered another grim verdict for healthcare.gov. Of the 46 survey respondents who had tried to buy insurance through the website, only three people successfully purchased insurance. That makes up less than 1 percent of the total sample size. Even as President Obama has expressed anger over the implementation of his signature piece of legislation, he has not escaped blame. More respondents assigned blame solely to the president than to Sebelius, and 41 percent said Obama was at least partially to blame. Most respondents, however, pinned blame on the software engineers and programmers who built the troubled website.	Poll: Wait, 13 Percent Think Healthcare.gov Is a Success?
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/elizabeth_warren_hillary_clinton_and_2016_speculation_media_is_applying.html	"These are dark times for America's most beloved industry, the political media. In three years, the country will elect a new president. As they have since 2009, reporters and readers assume that the Democratic candidate, and likeliest winner, will be Hillary Clinton. Forget about the voters--won't anyone think of the Web traffic? Nobody wants to cover the coronation of an icon who'll be too staffed up and confident to give real access (or leaks) to reporters. This crisis is the best (maybe only) way of explaining why every slow news day produces another round of 2016 fantasia. Today's game started with Noam Scheiber's look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the definitive political read on a woman whom Scheiber's own magazine had previously profiled as a hapless Senate candidate in a ""deadlocked"" race. Thirteen months after defeating Sen. Scott Brown, Warren was to be viewed as a potential populist president. ""When I recently asked a top Clinton campaign operative from 2008 if there's any Democrat who Hillary should fear in 2016,"" wrote Scheiber, ""he immediately named the Massachusetts senator."" This operative might have been spooked by a similar New York Times story, from six weeks ago, about how Warren had become ""the hot ticket"" of ""the populist left,"" and how Bill Clinton was left pathetically defending his record on finance. (""When they pass bills with a veto-proof majority, with a lot of Democrats voting for it, that I couldn't stop, all of a sudden we turn out to be maniacal deregulators."") Simply by existing, articles like these make a progressive upset of Hillary Clinton more likely. They alter the odds from zero to zero. Several things can be true--Warren can be outsmarting the financial industry, the Clintons can be worried about a shift in the Democratic Party, Warren might be more likely to run if Clinton does than if Clinton doesn't--without there being any chance of the front-runner losing. Actually, the idea that an insurgency needs to seize a presidency in order to win is sort of retrograde, and it's surprising that the disappointing (for progressives and a whole lot of other people) victory of Barack Obama hasn't cured it. Race matters. There's no mention of the Democratic Party's ethnic demographics in the New Republic's or the New York Times' Warren pieces. Scheiber reminds us that Obama was able to upset Hillary Clinton: ""All it takes is a single issue and a fresh face to bring the bad memories flooding back"" among progressives. Both Scheiber and the New York Times' Jonathan Martin mention Bill de Blasio's victory in New York City's Democratic primary for mayor. And you can't explain the Obama or the de Blasio win without black voters. A refresher: The president beat Clinton in a 50-state primary that she nearly won, by the end, as the salience of the Iraq War faded. Obama trounced Clinton in most of the caucuses, building a delegate margin, but he only stayed competitive because of black voters in Southern primary states. Obama was fading until the South Carolina primary, when an electorate that was mostly black gave him a landslide that polling hadn't predicted. There were 35 primaries to go: Clinton won 21 of them. (That number includes the Florida and Michigan races, which held votes but saw no campaigning due to a party dispute. Still, Clinton won them.) Of the states that went for Obama, only six of them--Illinois, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin--gave him the win among white voters. Scheiber blinks at this. A Democrat tells him that ""the typical Democratic insurgent ... captivates the latte-liberal demographic but has trouble making additional gains."" Right: Obama's ""additional gains"" come from nonwhites! Scheiber offers that ""New Hampshire, the first primary state, is fertile ground for a Warren-esque message--not many rich people, not many poor--and 80 percent of its residents live in the Boston media market."" True. Also true: The first polling of a possible New Hampshire primary puts Clinton 53 points ahead of Warren. Clinton is more popular than ever. The typical, facile lead-in to any discussion of possible Clintonian weakness goes like this: Well, in 2008, she was supposed to be ""inevitable"" and look what happened! True: In 2007-08, at the height of the Iraq surge, the Democrat who had voted for the war and not apologized was eventually defeated. Clinton is no longer that candidate, and polls stronger among Democrats than she ever has. Stick to the New Hampshire example. In every poll of the 2016 primary, at least 55 percent of primary voters have backed Clinton. Not once did Clinton ever crack 50 percent in any poll of the 2008 primary. In the only poll that was in the field in October 2005 and October 2013, the University of New Hampshire ""Granite State poll,"" Clinton's new strength is impossible to miss. Eight years ago, the poll found Clinton at 33 percent, 12 points ahead of her closest rival, John Kerry. Last month it put Clinton at 64 percent, 58 points ahead of Warren and just as far ahead of Vice President Joe Biden. Eighty-four percent of Democrats viewed her favorably. Already, almost twice as many Democrats viewed Warren unfavorably (15 percent) as viewed Clinton that way (8 percent). Are those static numbers? Well, no. They're just worlds better than anything Clinton scored in 2008, in a state she won anyway. The professional left doesn't know how to win. Scheiber quotes the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, who says Clinton's support from the financial industry could hurt her and ""there's very much a wait-and-see approach to Hillary among progressives."" And the PCCC should know, having co-branded itself with Warren with all the subtlety of a NASCAR driver showing off a new endorsement badge. The PCCC regularly asks supporters to stand with Warren on her new bank regulations; it sent members the senator's response to the last State of the Union under the headline ""Elizabeth Warren SOTU Awesomeness."" The PCCC also endorses progressives against Democratic establishment candidates--and here, it doesn't do so well. In the 2012 House race cycle, the PCCC endorsed against California's Scott Peters, Connecticut's Elizabeth Esty, and Illinois' Brad Schneider. All of those Democrats won their primaries. This year the PCCC tried and failed to draft Montana's former Gov. Brian Schweitzer into a Senate race, then endorsed a candidate for an open seat in Warren's own Massachusetts. The PCCC's candidate came in third place. The winner, Katherine Clark, was endorsed by the pro-female PAC Emily's List.* And Emily's List is now holding events in primary states, letting reporters know that it will repeat its 2008 endorsement if Hillary Clinton runs. The point isn't just that Hillary Clinton is the Democratic front-runner. No one doubts that; everyone's a little bored by that. The point is that it's risky, weak strategy to make a presidential primary the test kitchen for policy change. Conservatives learned this brutally in 1972 when they urged Ohio Rep. John Ashbrook to run against Richard Nixon. ""What I fear is a dissipation of our strength,"" wrote William F. Buckley to a friend. He was perceptive: Ashbrook won a wan 9.7 percent of the New Hampshire vote, and Nixon was emboldened to ignore the right. Over time, conservatives stopped expecting a president to get elected, lead, and solve all their problems. They built a grassroots machine and a litany of policy goals--the activists would speak, and the president would nod along. By 2012, Grover Norquist could tell a national conference that the next Republican president need only come to the job ""with enough working digits to handle a pen."" That's where progressives need to get, that un-glamorous and under-covered triumph of movement over party. Maybe, like Ron Paul, they can use a campaign to build the ranks. But if the Obama experience hasn't taught them that a dreamy presidential candidate won't bring about paradise, what will?

The Media's Silly, Crazy, and Somewhat Dumb Theories About the 2016 Presidential Race
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/media_matters_shreds_60_minutes_benghazi_story_the_liberal_group_forces.html	"You can no longer legally watch the Oct. 27 edition of 60 Minutes. It's been pulled, the original page deader than a healthcare.gov login. But if you caught it that night, or watched it online the next day, you were told to brace for an exclusive about the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi. ""You'll hear for the first time from a security officer who witnessed the attack,"" correspondent Lara Logan said in her introduction. ""He calls himself Morgan Jones--a pseudonym he's using for his own safety."" The segment laced previously revealed Benghazi facts into a narrative of what ""Jones"" had seen and done, derring-do like ""[scaling] the 12-foot-high wall of the compound that was still overrun with al-Qaida fighters"" and smashing a terrorist's face with his rifle. After it aired, some of the Republicans who'd been trying and trying to unearth more facts about the deadly night told their Twitter followers to check with CBS. ""Every American should watch @60Minutes piece on #Benghazi last night,"" wrote Arizona Sen. John McCain. ""We must know all the facts about what happened."" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham announced that he'd discuss the story on Fox & Friends. Later, he pledged to block presidential nominees in the Senate until he got more access to witnesses. At that moment, the team at Media Matters was strategizing about how to fight back. David Brock's watchdog group had been founded nine years ago largely as an antidote to Fox News stories about the presidential race. Today, with new president Bradley Beychok, Media Matters has grown to 75 staffers. Debunking the 60 Minutes piece, he says, was ""priority one, priority two, and priority three."" And as of Nov. 8, the story has been retracted, 60 Minutes has apologized, and ""Jones"" (real name Dylan Davies) is doing no interviews as his publisher recalls the hardback from booksellers. (Slate had also run an excerpt from the book's prologue.) ""This is a good example of when we're able to deploy any and all resources needed on a subject of importance,"" says Beychok. ""This is a topic we saw coming--as it's been in the conservative media for months and months. So we were ready for this."" That's what worries conservatives. Davies hung himself on the story, writing an incident report that claimed he was still in his villa when the attack happened, and then telling the FBI something similar. (CBS News didn't know the first fact, and Davies later told reporter Eli Lake he didn't write the report.) That threw the entire saga into doubt, even though it wasn't pivotal to the demand for a select committee to investigate Benghazi--what Republicans have asked for all year. ""I think he may be falsely accused,"" said McCain. ""It appears to me as if they are trying to shoot the messenger here, rather than try to explain the total mishandling of this whole situation. You discredit the Britisher because you can't discredit his message."" The role of Media Matters, he said, was ""not surprising."" (Graham has remained quiet, but is making a Sunday TV appearance.) ""Media Matters has scored a win with its attack on CBS News--and rightly so,"" wrote the regretful Joel Pollak, editor of Breitbart.com, in an editorial. (He had originally characterized the story as CBS ""try[ing] to atone for [the] Benghazi cover-up,"" for not releasing a dissembling quote on the attack from President Obama during the election.) ""That has not changed the basic facts of the Benghazi story: Obama and Clinton failed to protect U.S. diplomats, then lied to the public about a YouTube video. But it will make journalists more wary of covering the story, and especially of covering Clinton. They will realize now there is no room for error."" If that wasn't exactly the goal, progressives are comfortable with the spoils. One administration source compared this fallout to the implosion, back in May, of an ABC News story that overstated what memos revealed about the White House's involvement in Sunday show talking points about Benghazi. Maybe the Benghazi scandal has faded because gnarlier scandals popped up afterward, but stumbling media and congressional Pinkertons definitely helped. So Media Matters' win has to be seen as an early sign of Democratic plotting for 2016. Just weeks before the CBS story, Brock and Media Matters' Ari Rabin-Havt published The Benghazi Hoax, an e-book attempt to lock the scandal in a coffin and hammer in silver nails. In more than 90 pages and 198 footnotes, the authors aimed to prove that ""more than a dozen half-baked or completely bogus allegations about the attack in Libya have been raised ... and each one has been debunked by credible sources."" The organization was well-prepped for 60 Minutes. The body blow to the story was really dealt by Karen DeYoung, the Washington Post reporter who pulled the incident report. Media Matters largely amplified that scoop, but did it ever--the press shop released a letter from Brock demanding answers from the episode's producers, turning the story into a back-and-forth media war. As of Friday afternoon, since the CBS episode aired Media Matters had run 36 pieces about it. That's what Media Matters was built for. ""We are certainly better-prepared and more focused on taking our arguments, and making them effective, and disseminating them widely,"" said then-Sen. Hillary Clinton at a progressive conference in Chicago in 2007. ""We're really putting together a network in the blogosphere, in a lot of the new progressive infrastructure, institutions that I helped to start and support like Media Matters and Center for American Progress."" Since then, in the Obama years, Media Matters has occasionally deployed its researchers to mount full-spectrum defenses that the administration couldn't do by itself. It was Brock's group, for example, that dug up evidence to defend ""safe schools"" czar Kevin Jennings from allegations that he was a statutory rapist. That happened right after the firing of Van Jones, the ""green jobs"" czar, who could not explain away why he'd insulted conservatives and called himself a communist. Media Matters went on war footing, where it's remained. Just don't point out that Hillary Clinton's taken some credit for building the organization, or that Brock's move to the left started with an apology to the Clintons, or that the former secretary of state, whom conservatives hope to bring down over Benghazi, may run for president soon. That's not what this was about, they say. ""My hope is it causes people investigating the story to ask: Is what I'm hearing too good to be true?"" said Rabin-Havt. ""On both sides, there's a tendency, when you hear something that lines up with your point of view, to believe it. Conservatives, when they hear something like this, always jump on it. Sometimes you see major media figures led astray. You want to prevent that."""	The Liberal Attack Machine Shreds 60 Minutes Over Benghazi
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/bill_de_blasio_s_vision_of_a_progressive_new_york_city_the_newly_elected.html	"For those who dislike Bill de Blasio's vision for New York City--and even for some who voted for him--his election as the city's next mayor raises a provocative question: Is a progressive city possible? For the last half century, the answer to that question seemed to be no. De Blasio has been very clear about his plans to reduce the city's inequality by raising taxes on the rich, increasing services for the poor, and ending subsidies for corporations. But his plan flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that has dominated our thinking about cities since at least the 1970s. According to that wisdom, cities are ""competing"" in a global marketplace for mobile businesses and residents, and a city's efforts to redistribute from rich to poor--to provide expanded health care, more education, or a local living wage--are doomed. Cities cannot redistribute because wealthy city residents and the businesses that employ them will pack up and leave. Therefore, the successful metropolis must pursue business-friendly, growth-oriented policies that attract professionals and corporations, even if those policies result in greater income inequality. For de Blasio's skeptics, no city can resist mobile capital. Thus, de Blasio will either lead New York City into certain economic decline or he will be forced to abandon his most ambitious policies. If that is true, then there is only one way to be a mayor of a global, post-industrial city: Be Michael Bloomberg--a nonpartisan, technocrat attentive to the city's competitive position and comfortable with a city of wealth and corporate privilege. A mayor may choose to sound progressive, but when it comes to policy he or she has no choice but to encourage urban investment at the expense of combating inequality. That view of the city's ambitions is based on a kernel of economic truth. Certainly there are limits to what cities can do, and we should be realistic about them. But there are good reasons to believe that these constraints are dramatically overstated. First, we know that cities have always provided more welfare benefits to the poor than seemed possible if the pure ""no-redistribution"" theory is correct. Consider that over 40 years in the middle of the 20th century, New York City built thousands of working- and middle-class homes, hundreds of schools, libraries, and parks, and thousands of miles of roadways, bridges, tunnels, and subways. This basic infrastructure raised living standards for the urban poor, which in turn helped produce a robust urban middle class by the 1950s. Second, there is growing evidence that wealthy firms and highly skilled residents are not as mobile as was once thought. The city provides a home for a number of industries--fashion, finance, medicine, law, design, art, tourism--that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Industries that rely on sharing ideas, intellectual capital, or a deep bench of skilled workers need to be in a place where people feel connected. That place is the city, and for certain key industries, New York City. The same goes for the amenities that residents come to New York City to enjoy--its street life, restaurants, and so on. The suburbs or other cities often can't compete. Third, what we know about the revival of cities in the last 20 years is that it has not been driven by the dramatic lowering of local taxes and regulations. Some of our most economically robust cities--and New York is among them--have high taxes and substantial rules and regulations when compared to the suburbs or cities in the sunbelt. The growing popularity of cities is a global phenomenon and is driven by factors well beyond local tax and welfare policies. Technological and demographic change, shifts in consumer preferences, rising transportation costs, crime reduction, and the rise of the finance, technology, health care, and higher-education sectors of the economy have all contributed to the urban boom. If a city's economy is otherwise healthy, then redistributive fiscal policies are unlikely to make much of a difference. And mayors probably cannot control the size of the local economy as much as they claim anyway. But mayors can fight inequality by channeling resources to those who need them most. To those who believe that society has an obligation to pursue social justice, the moral benefits are obvious. The economic benefits of having an urban, healthy, educated workforce are obvious, too. If a revived urban liberalism is possible, then its time is now, while cities like New York can take advantage of their privileged position as highly desirable places to live. Not all cities are in that enviable position. Many cannot afford what Mayor de Blasio proposes. But if New York City's new mayor succeeds, he will advance an idea that has mostly gone out of fashion: that cities can play a significant role in creating an urban middle class by providing the kinds of resources necessary for upward mobility. Those resources are basic and obvious: security, education, transportation, health, and shelter. Expanding access to those kinds of municipal goods will create a more equal city. And it may teach us that a progressive city is still possible."	Is Mayor Bill de Blasio's Vision for New York City Even Possible?
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/ken_cuccinelli_loses_to_terry_mcauliffe_republicans_believe_obamacare_almost.html	"RICHMOND, Va.--Shortly after 7 p.m., when the polls had just closed, I entered the saddest room in Virginia politics. A small dining room in the basement of the Berkeley Hotel, described by a Republican friend as ""the third or fourth nicest hotel in the city,"" had been set aside for the victory party of lieutenant governor nominee E.W. Jackson. Posters of Jackson--half of them bearing his signature, all of them with gigantic pictures of Jackson's face--hung over copious selections of sweet and savory snacks. A projector screen alternated between election results and a slideshow of the candidate posing with voters on the trail. That was all happening a solid 10-minute stroll away from the actual Republican Party of Virginia bash--a reminder of the circumstances that gave the deeply flawed Jackson the nomination, and wrecked 2013 for the GOP here. Larnie Algood, an elderly Republican who'd worked the polls that day, chatted with the three other Republicans who'd gotten in early. ""We definitely turned out the vote in Mechanicsville,"" he said, referring to a Republican city nearby. ""That was strong. But wouldn't shock me, if [Attorney General candidate Mark] Obenshain was the only one who won. It'd be a shame if that happened."" That was at 7 p.m. An hour later, Republicans at the downtown Marriott were whooping as the early exit polls, with GOP gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli down by 7, were replaced by exit polls showing him down only 2. For two more hours, they milled around and congratulated each other and remarked on how close they'd made this thing--hey, they even won those House of Delegates races the media told them they'd lose! Asking the 2013 elections to be a referendum on something big was always a stretch. There were statewide elections in New Jersey and Virginia; there were races for mayor in New York and Houston and Detroit and Seattle; there was a special Republican primary for the House seat in Mobile, Ala. This Election Day was less a map of America, more a map of one of those scammy cellphone coverage plans that Verizon tells you not to buy. But it did not humiliate conservatives. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie was re-elected by 22 points--just what the polling predicted--with no coattails. Oh, sure, he became the first Republican candidate since 1998 or so to win the Hispanic vote, but he cut ads and stumped for four state senate candidates, all of whom were losing at the end of the night. In Alabama it was Dean Young, a social conservative who remade himself as a Tea Partier, who lost to an experienced, Chamber of Commerce-backed candidate named Bradley Byrne. Conservatives were largely fine with this, as Young was a know-nothing who couldn't even name the House minority leader when pop-quizzed. ""Thank goodness,"" emailed conservative columnist Quin Hillyer (who'd run in the first round of this primary) after the vote. Ah, but in Virginia--in Virginia, conservatives went the distance. They'd been written off since the end of summer (by reporters like, well, me) and they'd been outspent by $15 million. They still held on to most of their vote, even with Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis surprising everyone and pulling 7 percent. This, they said again and again, proved that Cuccinelli's closing argument was right. He kept saying the election was ""a referendum on Obamacare,"" and then he almost won. The meme spread slowly as the election party dragged on. As some of the Republican legislative candidates who'd won gave their perfunctory speeches (Del. James P. ""Jimmie"" Massie focused on the double threat of financial and moral collapse), I chatted with Monica Marinacci, a Republican who propped an Uncle Sam ""Beanie Baby"" bear on the table as she talked. ""I feel it's God's timing that the Obamacare cancellation notices came when they did,"" she said. ""Two weeks ago this would not have been close. But everyone knows someone who has gotten a cancellation notice."" After the exit poll was tweaked, I ran into Matt Mackowiak, whose Fight for Tomorrow PAC had been on the air with a grim ad about how Democrats would ""Detroit""--a verb, meaning ruin--Virginia. ""That ad moved people by 5 points when it was shown,"" he said. Even more effective was the campaign to make the election a choice on Obamacare. ""If the election was two weeks from now, Cuccinelli would have won."" The mood at the party kept on brightening. Election celebrations, when the races are tight, always have a guile-free sort of glee. If a Democrat's winning a close race in Virginia, the race only ""breaks"" for him when the final 10 percent of precincts come in, clustered in the D.C. suburbs and the coastal cities. The result on Tuesday was a lot of random cheering--and the ringing of a bell. John Wallmeyer, a Tea Party activist who owned a tricorner hat, a colonial coat, and a bell, had been at this hotel at the movement's height, when Cuccinelli addressed a 2010 Tea Party convention in Richmond. Normally, I refrain from interviewing activists who've dressed to become the craziest people in the room. But I'd covered that convention, and honestly wondered what Wallmeyer thought of what the movement had become in the wake of this close loss. As he explained that the closeness might stop ""the establishment from getting wishy washy,"" we heard a clatter, and turned to see a group of immigration reform activists occupying the stage that had been left empty by the slow count. ""What do we want?"" they shouted. ""Immigration reform!"" ""When do we want it?"" ""Now!"" The Republicans teamed with hotel security to frog-march the protesters away. It took a while, especially as it concerned one pugnacious protester who pulled away from a guard and sought refuge in a crowd. They provided no refuge. ""Immigration reform!"" shouted the protester. ""They take our jobs!"" heckled an older woman. The protester was ejected, and not long after that, the suburban votes came in to put McAuliffe in the lead. It was too late to change the mood. The truly despondent were leaving; the mildly interested stuck around to see what Cuccinelli would say. Brian Baker, a consultant with the super PAC Ending Spending, found a good vantage point and talked to me about the little-noticed work his group had done. It had commissioned a poll that found a 1-point race, catching Cuccinelli's late momentum. It had spent maybe $500,000 on ads, many of them on Web ads telling voters to pick McAuliffe if they wanted to support Obamacare. ""You can win a referendum on Obamacare,"" said Baker. ""That's a lesson of this race."" When conservatives start to plot for 2014, that's the lesson they'll internalize. They will not be told, by ""the establishment,"" that they fought on a losing issue, with a candidate who ran 12 points behind his own 2009 statewide vote, in a party that threw away elections because they didn't nominate moderates. Not at all. Party Chairman Pat Mullins told revelers that Terry McAuliffe's 48 percent of the vote gave him ""no mandate,"" and that the ""referendum on Obamacare"" should shock the other side. Ken Cuccinelli, in his last foreseeable speech as a candidate, insisted that this was true.  ""Despite being outspent by an unprecedented $15 million,"" he said, ""this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare."" ""Run for Senate!"" yelled a voice in the crowd."	The Final Hours of Ken Cuccinelli's Losing Campaign

Elizabeth Warren was standing right in front of us. RootsCamp, the annual ""unconference"" that sequesters thousands of hopeful progressive activists in the Washington Convention Center, kicked off with an hour of punchy, concise speeches. Almost none of the press had arrived in the plenary ballroom when the freshman Massachusetts senator, the one they keep writing will-she-run-for-president tales about, got up for an unscheduled 9-minute address. ""I wanted to be with people who get things done!"" said Warren. No one had announced her name, and she didn't give it--none of that was necessary, as Warren thanked the crowd for giving her the tools to win, and to consider all that had been won in one short year. ""We're not all the way home on anybody's issues, but we're holding banks a lot more accountable,"" said the senator. ""The student loan fight? We haven't won it, but we have changed it--and we're going to win it when we go forward. There have been new energy initiatives--the White House has really stepped up to the plate. We passed an immigration bill in the Senate. ... We passed ENDA, for equality in the workplace. On the question of protecting Social Security, we're ready to rumble."" Shortly thereafter, after asking thousands of progressive organizers, wonks, designers, and strategists to ""wade into the fights that need to be fought,"" Warren waved her arms and left the stage. She never mentioned health care or the Affordable Care Act. It was a short speech, sure, but the greatest progressive achievement since the 1960s did not make the highlight reel. Who could blame her? Roughly since September, when insurers started clear-cutting trees to print cancellation notices on policies that did not meet ACA standards, Democrats have struggled to say what's great about the law. The president talks about it only when he has to apologize for its rollout, or for having said, ""If you like your plan, you can keep your plan."" The day before Rootscamp--and the following is, to progressive activists, one of the most annoying phrases in the English language--Politifact.com named ""if you like your plan"" the ""lie of the year."" So Warren talked about something else. That's a popular response. Last year's RootsCamp, held in the flush of an Obama victory that the data-heads saw coming, was a festival of high-fiving and campaign secret-telling. This year's gathering went in a thousand directions at once, with fewer clear wins to celebrate and much more in-progress plotting and ruminating. I once described the look of RootsCamp as ""the casting pool for a party scene on Girls""--a biased and limiting cliche that I largely stand by. But this year's crowd included the chanting and mostly black Dream Defenders, activists who occupied the Florida Capitol in Tallahassee to demand changes to the Stand Your Ground law. This year's badges included preferred gender pronouns, for anyone who wanted to be addressed by one that wasn't obvious and didn't want to make anyone feel too awkward for ""misgendering."" This year's panels--all of them are proposed by attendees, and placed on ""the wall,"" to be picked without judgment--included ""Feeling Guilty About Our Privilege is Unproductive, but Storming In and Taking Over is Too"" and ""How We Got Queer Shit Done in Texas"" and ""11 Upworthy Ways To Maybe Win The Interwebs If You Are Lucky."" Bridget Todd of the New Organizing Institute provided the mantra: ""Always throw glitter, not shade."" The lifeless convention center was duly transformed into a happy, caring place--but what about the health care law? The big wall contained no advice or panels on it. In one morning session, heads of Organizing for America, the five-year-old spinoff of the Obama campaign, ran through all of their achievements in 2013. They held onto 40-odd million followers and 4-plus million engaged activists. We heard tales of elderly Democrats being inspired to start Twitter accounts and harsh their Republican members of Congress. ""We follow what's awesome out there,"" said an OFA staffer, clicking a PowerPoint over to a tweet about Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis' filibuster, a social media valentine that earned 17,000-plus retweets and 6,500-plus favorites. At that moment, a Republican strategist who was at the conference to learn the left's ways said ""enough of this"" and found another panel. At no moment in any of the presentations I saw, focusing on 2012 veterans trying to win more elections, was there any grappling with the health care law. I nagged Matt Saniie, an Obama campaign veteran now working with Enroll America, for some insight into the signups. ""Because of the problems with the website, enrollment didn't really get underway until the last month,"" he said. A fuller story could be told four or five months from now. (My Republican friend assured me that trackers were inside Enroll America events, and they weren't much more hope-inspiring than a clogged website.) I wasn't at RootsCamp to ask people with computers and jargon (say ""pro and delta"" instead of ""pro and con,"" because if it's not working you merely change it) why they didn't fix healthcare.gov. That would be stupid. The site was clicking away now, and lefty techs had explained, many times, to many slow reporters, why making a campaign website run was not like building an impossibly complicated health care exchange. No, I was curious about whether progressives were working on making the law work as intended--as something that would cover more people while raising costs for others. At the luncheon where I was annoying Saniie, an activist named Jason Rosenbaum suggested ""he may be a little bit freer to talk"" about the big story. ""I'd say someone who gets health care will be incredibly grateful, because the system is awful in this country and the ACA does a lot to change it,"" said Rosenbaum, the director of technology at the Action Network. ""I don't know how quickly that will show itself in politics--there's a lot of data that's being created, and certainly that will be used. There's a lot more transparency about coverage levels, and how payments and hospitals work. It creates messages around health care that are useful, because people will understand how badly insurance companies gouge the public. In 2008, 2009, the insurance companies were the enemy, and that moved the public."" Can that happen in 11 months, before the midterms, when the exact opposite is happening now? Would it happen by 2016? The only solace I found--for liberals, I mean--was in a panel about what Beyonce could teach liberals about politics and messaging. The stories flowed, from dozens of progressives, about Beyonce's unflappable nature and endless creativity and ability to kiss off haters. Jose Morales, an election administration fellow at the New Organizing Institute, asked his peers to remember how the singer had lip-synced the national anthem at this year's presidential inauguration, the first of many post-election come-downs. He described the press conference Beyonce held when the TMZ stories became too much to ignore. There was a message here, maybe, for progressives fearful that their great project was being undermined by a botched roll-out of a--possibly--botched law. ""What she did was say, 'I'm going to get out in front of this, and I'm going to talk about the fact that, yeah, I might have missed up a little bit, but I actually did this to make sure that this was a good event,' "" said Morales. "" 'My intentions were right. To prove it, I'm going to sing right into this mic right now and make y'all feel like the best damn Americans in the room.' I love America, so hearing that twice was amazing! But there's a lesson to be learned. There's a lot of time spent doing crisis management--stupid politics. The way she got in front and owned it, controlling that message, you stopped hearing about it. I think we can learn something from that."""	The First Rule of RootsCamp: Don't Mention Obamacare
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/democrats_destroyed_the_republicans_on_the_budget_deal_the_murray_ryan_plan.html	"Five years ago, when Sen. Barack Obama was running for president, he'd occasionally be confronted with the media's all-purpose stumper for liberals. What, a host or moderator would ask, would you do to tackle entitlements? Obama would say whatever he needed to say. ""We're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly,"" he promised in his second debate with Sen. John McCain. ""We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do it in my first term as president."" Obama's first two years in office were defined by the Affordable Care Act, which actually did cut the rate of growth in Medicare spending. (Democrats were reminded of that in countless campaign ads.) But ""entitlement reform,"" as defined in Washington, meant much more. After Republicans won the House of Representatives, with polls showing voters panicking about the national debt, the president used his 2011 State of the Union address to endorse ""a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations."" During the long, hot, pathetic summer of the debt limit, the president proposed a change in the formula that determined Social Security benefits. Just this year, his budget offered up that tweak--one that would shrink checks for millions of people--as a sop to Republicans. Even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he was ""encouraged."" But now, look at the Budget Conference Committee's two-year plan--or ""the Murray-Ryan plan,"" as the gods of brief headlines have dubbed it. It restores some of the money cut by sequestration, and it makes federal employees put up more of their own money for their pensions. It doesn't even scratch entitlements. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan has made a chipper (and seemingly successful) pitch to conservatives about how the deal tackles ""automatic spending,"" but that's rhetorical taekwondo, an attempt to put $12 billion of pension savings on the level of trillion-dollar entitlements. On Wednesday, as Ryan sold the plan to Republicans, the old ""debt crisis"" rhetoric that defined 2011 and 2012 had vanished completely. Republicans had spent most of 2013 calling sequestration a win for the party, something that cut the deficit and gave them ""leverage"" for the next rounds of talks. That was the point of sequestration, that its general offensiveness would force both parties back to long-term spending negotiations, and that the entitlement state would take a hit. And then the budget negotiated by Ryan actually blew through the $967 billion sequestration spending cap for the next fiscal year. Oh, well. ""Sometimes it's better to go in with a scalpel than it is cutting across the board,"" suggested Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a class of 2010 Tea Partier who often votes against bipartisan deals. ""Maybe that's what people are starting to realize. If what you're doing actually gets to a better means of cutting spending down the road, that's something to consider."" If, then, maybe later--but didn't Republicans get a chance at actual entitlement cuts, then blow it? Back in 2011, when they had Obama on the ropes, couldn't they have gotten a Democratic president to swing the ax at Social Security? Remember how S&P downgraded America's credit rating because ""the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics""? Couldn't they have gotten more than that? They choose not to think so. ""I don't believe the White House ever agreed to that,"" said Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, after being pitched on the Ryan-Murray budget. ""I believe that was a bait and switch. [Obama's] famous for this--remember how the discussion with Boehner broke down? He would throw things on the table, and then, when we would grab them, he'd back away from them."" Tennessee Rep. Diane Black, another class of 2010 member, was one of the more conservative Republicans in the Ryan-Murray budget conference. Social Security cuts, she said, were indeed, sort of, ""on the table"" before the talks started. ""But you probably saw that even before we had our first meeting, Democrats were saying they wouldn't even support their own president and consider it,"" said an exasperated Black. ""You've got Democrats out there saying there's a nuclear option here--they wouldn't even talk about it!"" Black wasn't saying it explicitly, but in this version of the story the parties had reversed their roles in the ""narrative."" The Republicans--Paul Ryan especially--were bravely compromising to keep the government running and end the era of Dec. 31 kludge-o-matic deals. The Democrats, they were the intransigent ones, the short-sighted deal-killers. The Democrats will proudly wear that label, at least when it comes to Social Security. Yes, the most progressive members of the party had sworn not to support a ""grand bargain"" or sequestration fix that cut Social Security. They'll tell you they were proven right. ""The people that say 'we need to deal with entitlements' are the ones who want to cut Social Security,"" said Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who's been arguing that Social Security needs to be expanded. ""I just think there's no appetite to do that on the Democratic side. Fundamentally, the debate should be on retirement security, not on how we use retirement security to deal with budget issues. I know Social Security can be fixed long term, pretty easily, because we can predict the costs. A lot of Democrats are now understanding that we should have a debate about Social Security, not the budget. If the debate's about Social Security, we win."" And they did win. At a Wednesday forum put on by the Heritage Foundation, eight conservative members of Boehner's conference took turns explaining why the Democrats had crushed them. ""Until today, I thought Republicans were going to hold the line on the sequester,"" said Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador. ""Democrats realized they were right all along, that we were never going to hold the line."" ""Look, we got beat,"" said South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney. ""We don't have the votes. Our opening position was the law [of sequestration caps]. Their opening position is to break the law. When those are the two starting positions, the compromise will be to break the law."" Now that they've lost, what's the future of that entitlement reform President Obama keeps saying he's ready for? How will Republicans force him to the proverbial table where all Washington deals are birthed? They don't know. A slowly growing economy, higher taxes, and trimmed spending has cut the deficit down to half of its recession high. Fix the Debt, the $43 million advocacy group that staged press conference after stunt after press conference to ""seize the moment"" on entitlement reform, is winding down and shedding staff. The 2013 budget agreement pays for a smaller government than Democrats would have liked. It also concludes the short era of Grand Bargaining. They'll take that deal."	How the Democrats Routed the GOP on the Budget Deal
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/chris_kapenga_mark_levin_and_article_v_the_secret_campaign_to_pass_conservative.html	"The newest movement to save the republic began this past Saturday on the grounds of George Washington's old estate. Shortly before 9 a.m., nearly 100 state legislators from 32 states filed into the library that sits above the museums of Mount Vernon. It was state legislators only; supporters (and reporters) learned that the hard way, as they called for details or were stopped at the security gates. Inside, the legislators said a prayer, recited the Pledge of Allegiance, and got to work talking about how to form a convention of states that could amend the Constitution-without interference from Congress. They'd been brought to Mount Vernon by a team of five Republican legislators, who'd circulated the invitation back on Oct. 22. ""Article V of the U.S. Constitution gives states equal standing with Congress to propose constitutional amendments,"" they wrote. ""In light of the federal government's struggle to effectively execute the will of the people,"" they'd create a bipartisan and ""politically pure"" environment to figure this out. ""I started the meeting with a discussion about what authority the convention would have,"" recalled Wisconsin Rep. Chris Kapenga, a CPA who was swept into office in the 2010 Tea Party wave. He was one of the five organizers of the meeting, and he emphasized several times that Democrats were in the room. This wasn't about any partisan goal. It was about states reclaiming the power they'd ceded, through stasis and lack of strategy, to the feds, by getting 34 states to call for a convention. ""We wanted people to understand that the convention itself is a legal authority,"" said Kapenga. ""Over the last year and a half I've been studying Article V--I went back into the Federalist Papers, read anybody who did anything on constitutional conventions--I saw that hundreds of resolutions have been brought forth, by both parties, and always failed. Reason No. 1: The states are not used to working together. Reason No. 2 was the process. So, we worked on the process."" The meeting lasted four hours, ending when legislators agreed to meet again in the spring of 2014. That's the most progress anyone's made in decades toward a states-first constitutional amendment campaign. A few liberals have glommed onto the idea, but right now all of the enthusiasm for Article V is coming from the right. How do we know? Well, most of the legislators who trekked to Mount Vernon were in town--Washington, D.C. is 30 minutes up the road--for the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Some of them hit up a panel organized by Convention of States, a project of Tea Party Patriots co-founder Mark Meckler. His new organization, Citizens for Self-Governments, schlepped 24-page briefing books that laid out the plan: ""viable political operations,"" with district captains, in at least 3,000 state legislative districts in 40 states. Meckler and his colleagues would make it easy. In the book, CFSG listed a few ""examples of amendment topics"" that were stalled in Washington but doable at a convention: a balanced budget amendment, term limits for the Supreme Court, ""a prohibition of using international treaties and law to govern the domestic law of the United States,"" and a ""limit"" on taxes. The convention would be centered not on any one of these ideas, but ""for the purpose of limiting the power and jurisdiction of the federal government."" The chance of success? ""Almost certain."" If that wasn't enough, the conservative legislators who stopped by this panel heard an endorsement from a real politician. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, another member of the 2010 Tea Party class, suggested Article V as a way of rolling back the government, because Washington never would. ""They are giving away candy, and it is tasty stuff,"" he said. ""We've got the drill and the Novocaine to fix the cavity."" Johnson's got company. Every major Republican leader in Ohio, from Gov. John Kasich through the state Legislature, has endorsed a constitutional convention in order to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment. ""I'm for getting a balanced budget, one way or the other,"" Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said when asked about Article V. ""I think we need it. It's tough in Congress, but getting two-thirds of the states might be a way to get it. I'm supportive."" If a Republican's affiliated with the Tea Party in some way, chances are he's down with the convention, too. ""I do like the idea of forcing the country to take up some constitutional amendments,"" said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. How did so many conservatives come around to this idea, so quickly? It happened naturally--states' rights are hardly new to Republican activists--but it gained traction thanks to radio host and author Mark Levin. Every year or so, Levin writes a tract of doomsaying, originalist constitutional arguments that sells like mad but gets completely ignored on the left. It happened again this year, when his book The Liberty Amendments topped the New York Times best-seller list. While liberals were napping, Levin was selling a pocket history of state tyranny and a package of amendments that could thwart it. ""Upon ascending to the presidency,"" wrote Levin, ""[Franklin] Roosevelt erected an autocratic program to overcome the transience of Statist electoral victories and interrupted rule."" Conservatives could win elections, but they could never roll back the state that FDR, then LBJ, then Barack Obama had expanded. ""The repercussions were never in doubt and are now ever more tangible, with a definite upshot--devouring the civil society and subsuming individual sovereignty. This is precisely why the Framers provided in Article V a backstop to restore constitutional republicanism."" And Levin knew what the Framers would have wanted. He proposed 10 amendments, starting with 12-year term limits for members of Congress and Supreme Court judges. Unpopular Supreme Court decisions could be overridden by a three-fifths congressional vote, ""not subject to a presidential veto."" The 17th Amendment would be abolished, letting state legislatures once again elect the Senate. (If that happened today, the Senate would be snapped up immediately by Republicans.) If 34 states chose to, they could override any federal statutes or regulations ""exceeding an economic burden of $100 million."" None of this could pass the 113th Congress. None of this had really been proposed when Republicans ran the federal government. That was Levin's whole point. ""America is blue state right now,"" he told the crowd of social conservatives who gathered for this year's Values Voter Summit. ""The only way to address this is to find 34 state legislatures, and to take the time to do it. It took us a century to get here and so it may take us 20 or 30 years to get out of this. But we have no options. This is the only option. I don't care if no senator or no member of Congress supports this. We bypass them."" Without Levin, far fewer conservatives would be tingling at the mention of ""Article V."" The legislators who met in Mount Vernon had their qualms with giving Levin credit. ""He called me up to have me on his show,"" said Kapenga. ""That was a little frustrating, because I saw a couple of people saying this was inspired by Levin's book. This was planned before the book! All of a sudden, people say, 'Oh, these guys must have read The Liberty Amendments.' But this is a nonpartisan idea. Prof. Lawrence Lessig, who definitely doesn't agree with Mark Levin, has said that we're doing something that makes sense."" That's true. There are progressive-minded legal thinkers who like the idea of states blowing past the unmanageable Congress. ""Relying on ALEC will assure that the specific proposals will be untenably right-wing,"" said University of Texas law professor Sandy Levinson. ""But, of course, that doesn't guarantee they'll get to the magic number of 34, let alone the further magic number of 38 actually to amend the Constitution."" Some good-government reform, like multiple-member House districts, would combat gerrymandering in a way that cut against Republicans. ""It's impossible to imagine that the House of Representatives would adopt such a proposal,"" said Levinson, referring to the notion of multiple-member seats. ""But one can imagine that it could get to 38. There would be no reason for the 19 states with four or fewer representatives particularly to care, and one could imagine that another 19 states would see this as a way to diminish the reapportionment wars."" But conservatives wouldn't be clamoring for Article V if they thought a convention would produce victories for the left. They've got a head start on this; they're thinking of how to build a movement that runs around Congress to restore the ""Constitution in exile."" The convention, if it happened some years from now, needs to happen on their terms. Not that they're going to shout that from the mountaintop. ""This is something that our members were interested in,"" ALEC spokeswoman Molly Fuhs explained when asked about the Article V panel. ""We do not advocate for anything."""

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/president_obama_s_new_focus_on_inequality_how_the_president_s_economic_message.html	"When President Obama said this week that ending income inequality was ""this generation's task,"" his aides noted he was consciously echoing themes he'd raised in a speech two years earlier in Osawatomie, Kan. The trail actually goes back even farther than that. The president has given several significant economic speeches since becoming a national politician. The first was a commencement address at Knox College in 2005, five months after he joined the Senate. Two others include a September 2007 speech he gave at Nasdaq and one he gave three years ago Friday at Forsyth Technical Community College. All five of these speeches have been big, strained for historical sweep, and touched on a central theme: the need for government intervention at a time when the economy has gotten out of whack. But they are not all the same in emphasis. In those eight years, Obama has oscillated between two kinds of economic messages based on his most pressing political needs. When appealing to business interests and independent voters, he has addressed the need for collective action to compete in the global marketplace. When appealing to his party's base, he has addressed the need for collective action to right the inequities of income inequality. In 2005 at Knox College, Obama called on the students to do more than strive to make a buck when they graduated. Instead, he called on them to contribute to a national cause: upgrading the economy for the modern age. He told the story of the previous times America had decided to repair the inequities in the market. After the Civil War and during the New Deal, lawmakers set the rules for commerce and the nation thrived. Obama said that this was a moral good, but he had a larger point: It was a competitive necessity. His speech was about global competition, not inequality. America had to improve the mix of winners and losers in the economy so it wouldn't fall behind. He quoted Thomas Friedman and spoke of the quiet revolution in technology and global trade. ""Countries like India and China realized this,"" he said of the changes. ""They understand that they no longer need to be just a source of cheap labor or cheap exports. They can compete with us on a global scale."" He cited statistics showing how China was graduating more engineers than the United States. America needed to upgrade its talent pool in order to compete in the new century. Two years later President Obama traveled to Wall Street and told the same story of government intervention. But this time he was not a freshman senator newly famous for his message of uniting red and blue states. He was a presidential candidate competing for base voters in a Democratic primary. He quoted FDR calling for a ""reappraisal of values."" He made a moral case for economic tweaking. The worry was not an advancing China or India. Instead, the president said the fundamental challenge for the economy was whether the wealthy few would prosper while everyone else fell further behind, ultimately destroying the American Dream. Thomas Friedman's book The World Is Flat had been quoted approvingly at Knox College in 2005, but now, two years later, the president was using the book in a different way. Describing the concerns of regular people, the candidate said, ""Their problem is not that our world is flat. It's that our playing field isn't level. It's that opportunity is no longer equal. And that's something we cannot accept anymore."" The globalism that Friedman described was no longer the reason to improve the economy. Now the president framed it as almost a distraction, something that had moved the national focus away from making sure that the middle class was surviving. Three years later, with his party's setback in the 2010 election, the president dropped the talk of inequality again. Years of partisan battles with Congress and a hot, slow march toward passing the Affordable Care Act had bruised the president's political standing. Voters told pollsters he was more liberal than they'd hoped when they voted for him in 2008. He had also damaged his reputation with the business community. So in December 2010, Obama traveled to Forsyth Technical Community College in Winston-Salem and spoke of a generational challenge. He said that in the global race for competitiveness the country faced a Sputnik moment. He mentioned China 10 times and India three. He returned to listing statistics that showed how other countries had outpaced America. Instead of talking about inequality, the president talked about trade, tax reform, and investments in education that would allow America to thrive in the world. The speech, given a month before the State of the Union, was a warm-up for that big speech and would be a template for 2011, his aides said at the time. By the end of 2011, this generation's test was no longer global competition but--you guessed it!--confronting inequality. The president was framing the battle for the 2012 presidential election, which the Obama team wanted to be about who would work hardest for the middle class. The speech was an effort to echo his 2007 speech to Wall Street, which several of Obama's longtime aides considered one of his best, on par with his speech at the 2004 Democratic convention. Top political strategist David Axelrod considers it the closest expression of Obama's true self. It's a theme the president returned to this week, saying that it would give shape to his remaining years in office. For Democrats--off their game after two months of healthcare.gov headaches--the tack back to inequality and middle-class woes is a welcome one. Everyone can get back to singing from the same song sheet. It's a message that worked well for President Obama in 2012. In a non-presidential year, when the party's base voters play a larger role than in a general election year, it's music to the party's most faithful followers. The president is ""finally sounding like the progressive many of his supporters thought they were backing in 2008,"" said Paul Krugman. These two topics are not mutually exclusive--inequality is a problem, and global competition is a reality. But President Obama's domestic political circumstances seem to be the most determinative of the ""generational test"" he wants to accentuate. When the president is trying to move the nation to support his economic policies, he can argue it round or flat."	How Obama's Political Fortunes Predict His Economic Message
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/barack_obama_needs_to_sell_obamacare_again_the_president_is_trying_to_save.html	"Like all retailers, the president is rolling out a big post-Thanksgiving sale. With the healthcare.gov website up and running on Cyber Monday, he's launched a three-week campaign to save Obamacare. On Tuesday he began by trying to remarket the product, touting the Affordable Care Act's broad benefits and reminding people why he went to all this trouble in the first place. ""For too long, few things left working families more vulnerable to the anxieties and insecurities of today's economy than a broken health care system,"" Obama said. On Wednesday the president explained how the health care law fit into his effort to resuscitate the American dream for the middle class, a project he's been grinding away with mixed success since his 2007 campaign. Then, at a second Wednesday event, the president attended a White House Youth Summit to make an extended and detailed pitch for how they could help push up health care enrollments. This is part of the nitty-gritty of convincing enough young, healthy Americans to participate in the federal exchanges so that the insurance pools aren't glutted with older, sicker Americans, driving up premiums. No soaring rhetorical heights here; this is the earthbound task of trying to make the law work. On Thursday evening, the president sits down with MSNBC's Chris Matthews at American University to pitch to that younger audience again. These are the highs and lows of what it means to be President Obama right now. One minute he is speaking about the sweep of history, and the next he resembles a late-night television pitchman. In advance of Obama's Wednesday Big Theme speech, the president's aides were advertising it as an echo of the self-consciously grand one the president gave two years ago in Osawatomie, Kan., which itself was an echo of Teddy Roosevelt's ""New Nationalism"" speech delivered in the same spot 100 years ago. For presidents, the topics don't get much bigger than the American dream or much more vital than correcting the disparities between the rich and the poor. This is oratory that requires a pretty line or two. But if the president actually wants to achieve his dream of improving the economic condition of millions of Americans, it's going to happen through the plodding business of bringing Americans into his health system one at a time. He doesn't need to move people to tears; he needs to move your 27-year-old son Joey to get off the sofa, open his laptop, and buy insurance. This sprint for enrollees explains why the White House is launching its public relations campaign before the system is fully functional. Despite claims last week that the website would work as intended for the vast majority of people, insurance companies are still complaining that they are getting faulty information. If that's the case, then the website patches are supercharging an existing flaw and swamping insurance companies with more bad information. That loose-stitching would suggest caution in any private enterprise, but the administration is under political and operational pressure. They have to show that the site is working, and they have to increase the number of people picking plans to make up for the two months when enrollment was not up to the pace required to make this grand experiment fly. But if everything rides on the president inspiring Joey, things don't look good. A poll released Wednesday from Harvard's Institute of Politics showed just how wary young Americans are of Obamacare. Fifty-seven percent of millennials disapprove of it. By a 5-1 margin they believe that health care costs will increase, and by 2-1 they think the quality of their care will worsen. Among 18- to 29-year-olds currently without health insurance, less than one-third say they're likely to enroll in the Obamacare exchanges. ""It almost seems to me that it's almost cool to be opposed to health care reform,"" says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Institute of Politics. President Obama's approval rating is 41 percent among younger voters, down 11 points. But the bigger problem with selling health care reform to younger Americans is that the pitch is coming from a distrusted institution: the government. ""Not only do you have a questionable product, but it's being 'sold' by a questionable institution where there is less trust today than there was yesterday,"" says Della Volpe. This is why the administration has tried so hard to sell the law though social media and sports and entertainment figures. Despite these hurdles, convincing younger, healthy Americans to sign up is the most promising path the president has to meeting any of the goals of his larger economic vision for the middle class. His other routes are stalled. The president has a number of policy proposals he says will help Americans: early childhood education, raising the minimum wage, pouring more money into education and training. These and other initiatives aren't moving in Congress, no matter how many speeches the president gives. By contrast if younger Americans sign up, the Affordable Care Act will survive, and if that happens, it will benefit millions of Americans who have been on the losing side of an economy where incomes have flat-lined and where 95 percent of the income gains since the recession have gone to the top 1 percent. For a president with low approval ratings and little hope of making progress with congressional Republicans, the prospects for new achievement are bleak. But that doesn't mean he can't get something done. The one law that can do the president the most good has already passed. Now he just needs to sell, sell, sell."	President Obama Has Been Reduced to a Late-Night TV Pitchman

The annual family gathering is the wrong place to have a political argument. Thanksgiving debates are often a proxy for old grievances or an outlet for holiday stress--the turkey is taking too long, the flight was delayed, or the kids won't stop sulking. Also, anyone who really wants to sink their teeth into a meaty debate--at the possible expense of fellow feeling, family warmth, and ready pie--isn't going to be convinced of anything. So don't try to persuade them because you'll just be frustrated. Instead, arm yourself with diversions. YouTube videos of cats are a crowd pleaser. Load one onto your smartphone and deploy at the first mention of Sen. Ted Cruz. This year at our house, the dishwasher seems to be having sympathy glitches with healthcare.gov, which might sound like a pain, but tending to it will give me a ready excuse to exit the table if things get too hot. (I expect that the vast majority of dishwashing users will have a positive experience by the end of the month.) Despite similar warnings, in the six years Slate has been publishing its guide to Thanksgiving political arguments, we have learned that many people still can't resist. Many find themselves offering a version of Loudon Wainwright's Thanksgiving prayer: ""If I argue with a loved one, Lord, please make me the winner."" In that spirit, we present our guide to some of this year's thorniest political arguments. Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, there might be something in here to help you hold your own long enough to knock over a glass and make a run for it. President Obama's Deal With Iran: A horrible idea: When the leaders of Hezbollah say a deal is a win for Iran, you know you got burned. A few nice tweets from President Hassan Rouhani shouldn't fool anyone--Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism committed to the destruction of Israel. If that's not enough, Tehran props up Syrian President Bashar Assad's murderous regime, which has killed more than 100,000 of its citizens, something the Obama administration once cared about. It used to be just embarrassing that America had outsourced its Syria policy to Vladimir Putin, but Washington cutting a deal with Iran is more troubling. Was Obama's dithering and confusion over bombing Syria driven by his desire to protect secret negotiations with Iran? Surely, Israel is made more vulnerable by Obama's accommodation with Tehran. In addition to weakening our strongest Middle East ally, we're also further damaging relations with Saudi Arabia. But apparently President Obama has been fooled--loosening sanctions in return for what is, at best, a mild slowdown in Iran's nuclear program. There is nothing in this deal that says Iran cannot enrich uranium. In fact, the deal says the opposite. The centrifuges are still spinning. The heavy water reactor still exists--and Iran seems to think it can keep building it. Once Iran has gotten its money and strung along the West, Tehran could make a rush for a nuclear breakout in eight weeks. Sanctions were working. The supreme leader is never going to surrender a nuclear weapons program that is the key to his country's security and the greatest piece of leverage he will ever have in dealing with the Great Satan. So you have to use sanctions to force him. That's what got Iran to the table in the first place. This deal removes that pressure. Now we have the Iranian foreign minister telling Congress what it can do about sanctions. The administration has handed over leverage to the Iranians by wanting this deal too much. Given that posture, who knows what the administration will give up as a part of the final talks? A step toward peace: Just citing the Munich Agreement in 1938 is no substitute for a reasoned argument. If it were, then Newt Gingrich would have been right when he said Ronald Reagan was like Neville Chamberlain for meeting with Gorbachev. You may want Iran to give up its nuclear program completely, but that's not realistic. Even if total dismantlement were the endgame, it would start gradually--as this deal outlines. This is an interim agreement, not the final treaty. If Iran does not forgo building a nuclear arsenal or tries to evade its promise to permit outside inspections, then sanctions snap back into place and Congress will be free to impose tougher ones. Washington risks nothing and this pause interrupts what was essentially a march to a war. I'd prefer not to have another war, and apparently the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff doesn't think it's a good idea either. The cash Iran will receive--$7 billion in frozen assets--is a drop in the bucket compared to the sanctions that are still in place. So there is still plenty of economic incentive for Iran to offer more as a part of a comprehensive deal. In six months, we will either have a deal no one thought was possible or the United States will have even more leverage to isolate Tehran internationally--either way, we win. President Obama's Health Care Plan: You are a fan: Yes, the website was a disaster, and there's no excuse. But let's not forget the context. Republican governors fought allowing exchanges in their states, adding to the burden on the federal government. House Republicans made it clear they would never appropriate the funds needed to implement the U.S. law fully. Still, let's stipulate that the website is a mess. But what's the central problem--the website or the law? It's just a website. How do we know that? Look at the success of the state exchanges. People are signing up, which means it's not the product that is a problem, but the access to the product. If the product were bad, there would be no fixing it. At least you can fix a website. Yes, I know, the president said you could keep your plan. Presidents say a lot of things that sometimes turn out not to be true despite their best intentions. Some even invade other countries on the basis of information that turns out to be wrong. It's bad to have your access to a superior health care plan delayed, but not as bad as botching the invasion of an entire country. The president has apologized and moved to fix the matter. When all is said and done, the number of people who will want to stay on their previous plans where they got worse coverage and no subsidy will be small. (The number of happy people, on the other hand, is growing.) There's even some evidence that the website is actually working a lot better, and the more it works, the more there will be good stories about people actually being helped. Plus, at this time of Thanksgiving, we should reflect on the people this law is intended to help. Two-thirds of those signing up on the individual insurance exchanges nationwide are expected to be people who didn't have any insurance previously, either because they couldn't afford it or because they were barred by preexisting conditions. Let's not compare this law to metaphysical perfection, but to the brutal system it seeks to improve. Forty-eight million people in this country are without insurance, which is a national disgrace. They're not as comfortable as we are. A lot of them are now able to sign up for Medicaid, a program we've never debated at this table because it's pretty popular. The law anticipates the costs associated with that spike in Medicaid enrollment. (Bean counters at the Congressional Budget Office nevertheless claim that the law will cut the deficit by $109 billion by 2022.) Health care inflation, one of the drivers of government debt, is already down because of the Affordable Care Act. You are against Obamacare: The website is a mess because the program is a mess. As Mom used to say, ""What starts out twisted stays twisted."" The president oversold the benefits of the website just as he oversold how painless the entire law was going to be. He thought he could get away saying that if you liked your insurance you would be able to keep it. Why? Because he assumed the people who didn't like their old plans would love their freshly minted Obamacare plans. Guess what, they don't. Now he's had to spin like mad--including making the estimates of coverage on the website look better than they are--and modify parts of the law by delaying the employer mandate and open enrollment next year. He faces a fundamental problem: The federal government can't take on a project of this size. That's why 56 percent of the public doesn't agree with the underlying goal that every American should have health insurance, a record high. Another nightmare is coming: People won't be able to keep their doctor the way the president promised either. That's because, in an effort to keep costs down, insurance companies are slashing doctor payments and limiting the number of doctors they will cover. It's called the Affordable Care Act, but according to, the Kaiser Family Foundation premiums in 2014 will likely be higher in most states. Even if they can get the website moving again, the law faces a slew of hurdles--the beleaguered IRS has to oversee the enforcement, next year those companies with more than 50 employees who were given a one-year reprieve from the mandate will be forced to join, and the system for paying insurers for ""risk corridors"" hasn't been worked out. But this is about more than a health care law. This was the president's signature legislative accomplishment. His team had three years to prepare, and even though many involved knew it was going to collapse on launch and tests just before the launch failed to handle 500 users, they went ahead anyway. Health care inflation may be down, but that's because 77 percent of that cost decrease comes from the recession, not a law that was passed in 2010. You think the healthcare.gov failure was planned in order to create the conditions for single payer: Once the pies are served, we'll have plenty of extra tinfoil to help you make your hat. Filibuster Reform: For it: There's nothing in the Constitution about the filibuster. The Senate changes its rules to meet the times. In an earlier era, members broke across party lines. Now everyone votes in lockstep. The most conservative Democrat has a more liberal voting record than the most liberal Republican. In this new environment, the minority has used the filibuster excessively. In the history of the republic, there have been 168 cloture motions filed on behalf of executive and judicial nominations. Half of them have occurred during the Obama administration. A little cranberry with your turkey is fine, but when the cranberry replaces the turkey something has gone wrong. In a lot of cases the filibuster was being used to block appointments not because the candidate wasn't qualified but because Republicans didn't like the underlying law. Republicans didn't object to Richard Cordray as much as they objected to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau he was supposed to lead. It was also true of the Court of Appeals judges that caused Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to finally use the ""nuclear option"" last week. Republicans didn't object to them as judges--just that they would give Obama a perceived advantage on the country's second most important court. Fortunately for everyone, by removing the 60-vote threshold, more qualified people are going to come forward and accept administration jobs because they won't have to endure such a crazy process. This isn't some Democratic Party gambit. It was Republican leader Bill Frist who first came up with the nuclear option in 2005. That was back when there were far fewer cloture motions. The nature of the institution is changing: Only 32 senators have been there three terms or longer, down from 44 six years ago, and half of the body has been there one term or less. You long for a Senate with norms as quaint as the spittoons still on the floor of the chamber, but that Senate doesn't exist any more. If it did, Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee wouldn't have been able to take over the body as they did during the government shutdown against the will of the majority of the members in their own party. With that kind of partisanship, the polite rules of the past prevent anything from getting done. Republicans have promised to retaliate, but I thought you were fighting this on constitutional grounds? So your answer to what you see as tyrannical actions is the promise of more tyranny? Against it: By lowering the number of votes it takes to break a filibuster, the Democrats have helped the Senate become more like the House of Representatives where the majority controls everything. The Senate is supposed to be different. This is more than just a limited modification that only applies to judges and appointments. There was once an unwritten rule that this change could only take place at the start of a session. That meant the Senate could evaluate the change on its own merits. Now, by changing the filibuster rules midterm, Democrats have made it easier to change the filibuster easier in the future when the minority launches a filibuster to block a Supreme Court nominee or a piece of legislation. Democrats have argued that lowering the standard is simply a move toward a basic democratic principle of majority rule, but the motives were not that high-born in this case. If they were, Democrats would have been able to produce this magic trick at the beginning of the Senate session. This was a political move: an attempt to secure Obama's legacy by changing the partisan makeup of the lower courts, especially the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. It's the court that handles all challenges to legislation and regulation--EPA rules on power plants and financial services regulations under Dodd-Frank. Now the court will lean left and protect Obama. Democrats site inflated numbers to justify filibuster reform, arguing that Republicans have tried to block more nominations than Democrats. They are counting ""cloture motions,"" which are different than filibusters. If you count actual filibusters, 10 of George W. Bush's nominees were filibustered, versus five Obama nominees. Your new Democratic senators--more than a half have never served in the minority--don't know what it's like to rely on the filibuster to hold the majority in check. They are being shortsighted. Democratic Senators once believed this; Sens. Barack Obama and Joe Biden did. Republicans will be glad to show them what it's like being in the minority after the 2014 elections. Government Shutdown: Good idea: The confrontation over the budget let the public know exactly which party was willing to do whatever it took to avoid the disaster of the Affordable Care Act. Out in the real America they want people who will stand up and fight for what they believe in. Standing on principle is never a bad idea. Now that the Obamacare disaster has arrived, the president's approval rating is falling. Public opinion about the president's health care law is as bad as it has ever been, and people know which party was standing up for them all along. Bad idea (Moderate Republican version): Obamacare was going to be a disaster anyway. Our task is to show that we can govern. Showing principle is great, but you have to get elected to do things to change the system. These debating society adventures hurt our party's image by reinforcing the idea that we are so obstructionist that we've lost all good sense. The ploy did nothing to slow the law or decrease its popularity. The country was willing to back a showdown with the president over the deficit. We found the one thing the country was not willing to abide: shutting down the government over defunding health care. Nearly every poll taken showed that a majority of the public opposed that gambit. Bad idea (Democrat version): The government shutdown cost the economy $24 billion and over 120,000 jobs while achieving nothing. Next. My Party Is Better Than Yours: Republican: The president's approval ratings are as low as they have ever been. They are in George W. Bush territory. In the past, during low approval ratings moments--like the 2011 debt limit fight--people still trusted the president. That is not true now. Only 49 percent of Americans trust him in the latest CBS poll. That number was 60 percent a year ago in the same poll. Fifty-three percent do not find him trustworthy, in a recent CNN poll. In the same poll, only 40 percent said he could manage the government. Once your numbers get that low, they don't bounce back--particularly at the end of a presidency when approval ratings naturally fall. Yes, they might have recovered with Reagan and Clinton, but the economy was much better during those administrations. There is no bright side today. That's why almost 70 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track, nearly the highest figure of Obama's presidency. Yes, Obama will not be up for re-election again, but this is bleeding over into the Democratic congressional picture too, which is why it matters. In late October's Generic Ballot polling--the crude measure that tests how the parties will fare in a nonpresidential election--Democrats polled an average of 7 points better than Republicans. Now Republicans hold a 1-point edge when you ask people whether they plan to vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate. Democrat: Sure, the party is in a tough patch now, but just because Democrats aren't doing well today doesn't mean that Republicans are rising. The latest CBS poll says only 21 percent of the public approves of House or Senate Republicans. That's barely up from the 18-point historic low during the shutdown. Other polls show the same thing. So, while we're not doing well, the Republican Party is hardly benefiting. And Democrats don't have a Tea Party problem. The problems the president's health care plan is having right now only delays the day of reckoning because your party isn't doing anything to solve its underlying problems: coming up with a message that appeals to younger voters, suburban women, and minorities. The crushing realities of being a party of Southern white males still hang over you. Republicans will return soon enough to where they have been most of 2013--at each other's throats. You don't think there is a Civil War brewing in the Republican Party? The Republican Governors Committee is actively using Washington Republicans as a foil to explain to voters how not to govern. Chris Christie Will Be the GOP Nominee: Yes he can! Chris Christie proved in New Jersey that he can win anywhere. In a state with 700,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, he received a third of the Democratic votes, won a majority of Hispanic voters, and won women voters against a female candidate. Those numbers sound magical to a lot of Republicans who don't want to lose another presidential race, but who are also looking for a national figure to rebrand the party that has been defined by the Tea Party. These establishment Republicans often have access to cash and friends with cash. Christie can tap that money. Christie is a governor, which means he knows how to make decisions, execute, and he's not tainted by Capitol Hill Republicans That doesn't mean Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio won't run. It helps Christie if they do. They'll split the opposition vote the way Romney's opponents did and it will help Christie. Christie is also a force, which will make him more attractive as a general election candidate who can stand up to a political star like Hillary Clinton, and it means that Gov. Scott Walker, who may be this election's Tim Pawlenty, will not be able to seriously challenge him in the primaries. Christie cut taxes, took on the unions, is pro-life, and does not support same-sex marriage, making him as conservative as he needs to be to not offend his party. Christie is no Rudy Giuliani; he's a winner. He'll collapse: Gov. Christie will collapse like Rick Perry, Fred Thompson, and yes, Rudy Giuliani, because he is too brittle for the primary process. Hurricane Sandy gave him political power he won't be able to draw on as a national candidate. It will irritate him when he is criticized from all sides for taking federal money to clean up Sandy's mess. Staying on the right side of the ideological fault lines will nibble away at him like water torture until he says something impolitic that will worry conservatives. Then it will be like a sweater-thread. The whole campaign will fall apart, opening the way for Walker or someone else. Christie's famous explosions--the shouting at some numbskull that enthralls New Jersey voters--will not play well in early primary states like Iowa and South Carolina. There's an easy line to cross between the authenticity that voters like and coming off as an authentic jerk. Conservatives don't like being handed an anointed candidate, especially one prone to lectures. That's why in the recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 68 percent said they either didn't like Christie or didn't know enough to like him. Christie's Wall Street fans are a strike against him in the grassroots. He also supports gun control and he took Medicaid money as a part of President Obama's health care plan, a huge no-no in conservative circles. And wait until his opponents dust off those photos of him arm-in-arm with Obama during the final days of the last presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton Will Be the Democratic Nominee: Yes: There is no competition. Sixty-six percent of Democratic or Democratic-leaning respondents say they'd support Hillary Clinton in a presidential primary, according to the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. She has an enormous donor network, and a worldly, foreign-policy gloss and tough executive experience after running the State Department, something she lacked last time. The ghost of Benghazi isn't going to weigh her down in the Democratic primary since those voters think the whole thing is just another right-wing obsession. She may be from the Robert Rubin wing of the party, which irritates some liberals, but that wing is the same one that brought the Democratic Party back to power in the '90s. Plus, for the majority of Democrats, it's not a disqualifying trait to care about business and the markets. Some people are saying, ""Sure, but she looked inevitable before and look what happened."" That's silly. Elizabeth Warren, who is a darling to the liberal wing of the party, will not be 2016's Barack Obama. If she does run, she would be that campaign's Howard Dean. She would turn out loud and enthusiastic crowds, but there would be a ceiling to her vote. No: The inevitability cloak is so heavy. By the time she actually runs, people will be tired of Hillary Clinton. Elections are about the future and she seems like a figure from the past. That will be amplified by the return of all the drama that collects around the Clinton name, which will make voters feel like they need a break. You can try to write off the party's liberal base--the way people wrote off New York Mayor Bill de Blasio--but the country's economic disparities and the distaste for banks and corporations is creating a radical desire for change. Last year the top 1 percent of the country made 19 percent of the income, and the top 10 percent made 50 percent. Clinton may try to argue that she is that change, but she is too cautious and distant to actually convey it. Her attempts to do so will unveil her weaknesses as a candidate and give a challenger an opportunity to emerge as a leader of a movement. Voters will support a movement more than they will the inevitable caretaker candidate of a system they know is broken. This matters for the general election, too. The Democratic nominee will not be able to easily duplicate Obama's success with first time and occasional voters. It will be easier to motivate these reluctant voters, to maintain the Democratic electoral advantage in the general election, if the candidate is one who can speak to the economic angst being felt by the public. That's a language it's hard for Clinton to speak. Anyone for leftovers?"	How to Win This Year's Thanksgiving Day Political Arguments
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/harry_reid_obamacare_and_filibuster_reform_democrats_want_a_new_political.html	"When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brought a showdown over President Obama's judicial nominations, Republicans complained that he was launching a fake fight to distract from the disaster of Obamacare. We know that this was a crazy charge. If Reid were launching a fake fight, he'd have come up with a much longer one. The vote that changed the rules so that filibusters of executive appointments and lower-court judges could be broken with 51 votes instead of 60 was important, but it wasn't drawn out for maximum political advantage. By Senate standards, where nothing is said unless everyone has a chance to say it twice, the day or so of debate was brisk. The so-called nuclear option was nuclear--over in a flash. If Reid wanted to delay things, he would have used the land war in Asia option. That's not to say Democrats aren't looking for a diversion. They're desperate for one. Democrats nervous about the Affordable Care Act debacle are holding on to two articles of faith. One is that healthcare.gov will work some day and that people will start signing up in sufficient numbers. The other is that there will be a big fight to come with Republicans that will help them off the ropes. Democratic officials have no control over the first, but on the second, if a fight doesn't happen soon, they may have to pick one. For Democrats trying to hold on to control of the Senate and not lose ground in the House in 2014, simply defending themselves from Obamacare attacks won't be enough. They need to find an issue that puts Republicans on the defensive. Historically speaking, Democrats won't have it easy next year. Since World War II, in the elections held in the sixth year of a president's term, the party in the White House has averaged a 29-seat loss in the House and a nearly six-seat loss in the Senate. The healthcare.gov detour has wasted time, hurt Democrats in the polls, and put greater pressure on coming up with a strategy that defines Republicans. This all means we can expect an even nastier campaign season and more bruising legislative clashes in the future. Since the Affordable Care Act website succumbed to stage fright on its Oct. 1 debut, the Democrats have lost their advantage in the generic ballot test against Republicans, the crude polling measurement used to test the public mood going into congressional elections. Just after the government shutdown, Democrats had an eight-point advantage in an average of the polls. Now they have a one-point lead. In addition, Republicans, whose obsession with repealing Obamacare was seen as debilitating when it led them to shut down the government, can now boast about their prescience. They can crow that their larger argument about the scope and size of government intervention has also been ratified. They can watch while Democrats splinter over how many modifications to make to the law. Congressional Republicans do not have a coherent agenda of their own, but they can hide that deficiency for the moment by running against the president's health care plan. These GOP talking points published by the New York Times make that clear. Right now, Republicans feel very little need to confront Democrats directly--they are simply huddling in their locker room. Democrats need to do something to bring Republicans onto the field. In the meantime, Democrats are battling with themselves--both with their president's unfulfilled promises and with how the details of legislation could be tweaked in this way or that. They are struggling to find a way to change the subject or at least fight to a draw. That's why you're likely to hear more from Democrats about the 35-page GOP ""playbook"" on how to use Obamacare's failures as a political weapon. ""It allows us to point out that everything they're doing is purely political,"" says Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen. Given how low Republicans were several weeks ago, Democrats can bank on the fact that in time, their fortunes will turn. It is the nature of the political circle of life. While Democratic numbers may have dropped, Republican numbers have not risen. In the generic ballot test, Democrats have simply fallen to the Republicans' level. The latest CBS poll shows that, despite the president's troubles, the Republicans in Congress have a 21-point approval rating, only three points higher than during the depths of the government shutdown. Democrats are looking for an issue that reconnects the public to those feelings that have caused them to think of Republicans in such historically abysmal terms. For candidates up for re-election, the most potent attacks will be specific to their opponent, but those attacks often gain extra potency when they land on fertile ground prepared by national debates. The showdown over Republican judicial obstructionism didn't create a fight that will wake the public, but fights next year over the minimum wage and immigration might. The most often cited location for defining debates is the budget fights, an area where Democrats can return to talking about their core issues--middle-class economic security and maintaining the safety net. There have been reports that Republicans and Democrats are making progress on a short-term budget agreement in advance of the Jan. 15 deadline, but that may be oversold. They are making progress relative to their previous disagreements, but the old debates about what loopholes to close and how much spending to cut offer the potential for a public flare-up.  Now that the Senate has changed the filibuster rules, Republicans may also be spoiling for a fight and even less willing to compromise. Even if they do reach agreement on a way to reconfigure the sequestration cuts for the next year or so, the next round of formal budget presentations will start next year. Republican House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan will present another formal budget, and Democrats expect it to provide rich targets as Ryan reiterates his plans to transform Medicare and Social Security. While Democrats wait for their issue to come along, many are grinding their teeth at the president. Conversations with strategists involved in protecting Democratic fortunes include therapeutic moments where they simply vent about how little love there is for the president. ""No one is going to do it for good old Barack,"" said one, during a conversation about whether the president could promote anything in future budget negotiations that his base would find mildly discomforting. The consensus is that Obama's dislike of politics--oddly, also his chosen profession--means there is a shallow reservoir of goodwill for him among his party. Many members feel like they are on their own, dealing with the messes he has created more than benefiting from his help. Among those in tight races, this feeling is no doubt true, but those same members may not want to dismiss him so completely. While the president is toxic in their districts, the president may yet have an electoral role to play in the search for a public confrontation. Despite his low approval ratings and new public doubts about his trustworthiness, the president is still more popular than his Republican opponents. He also has a unique microphone. A question to watch for in 2014 is whether the president goes to bat for his party in an energetic way or whether he refrains from ending his presidency on a highly partisan note. Of course, this all supposes he has this choice and isn't still trying to explain what happened to his website."	Why Democrats Are Itching for a Fight
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/harry_reid_and_filibuster_reform_the_nuclear_option_is_a_huge_victory_for.html	"No one can agree how the Judicial Wars started. Most pundits sigh deeply and start with the defeat of Robert Bork, who wasn't actually filibustered--only 42 senators voted for his 1987 nomination. Others pick up the story in the 1990s, when Republicans ran the Senate and stymied Bill Clinton. One can, as most Republicans prefer to do, remember what happened in 2005, when Republicans wanted to end filibusters on judicial nominees and every Democrat--including our current president--predicted nuclear fallout, brimstone, and exploding skulls. We do know how the Senate came to change its rules today, a vote that represented the biggest victory for the left since the election of President Barack Obama. That process started in the first weeks of 2009, after a Democratic landslide mighty enough to sweep even Al Franken into the upper house. The Republicans, who'd held 55 seats during the 2005 ""nuclear option"" fight, were down to 41. A new class of Democrats, including Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall, buckled in for action. They got a slog. An economic stimulus package, once expected to get up to 80 votes, got over the 60-vote cloture line only with huge concessions to three Republicans. A simple omnibus parks funding bill took weeks to pass. Then, in May, just enough Republicans held together to filibuster the president's nominee for deputy secretary of the Interior. To Majority Leader Harry Reid's surprise, the Democratic left honed in quickly on the filibuster, demanding that he change it. ""The progressive media started pounding on Reid very early in the process--I'm talking post-2008--to engage or to execute the so-called nuclear option,"" remembers Reid's then chief of staff Jim Manley. ""I'd be getting phone calls from the Huffington Post once in a while about it. We did roundtables with progressive media where it was raised. Sen. Reid held regular meetings with the freshmen to get their input and ideas on Senate matters, and this was always at the top of their agenda."" Reid, who joined the Senate in 1987, was cold to the idea. He really did believe what he said in 2005, when he claimed the filibuster ""encourag[ed] moderation and consensus,"" and begged Republicans to keep it. Merkley had met with Reid on filibuster reform even before his election, but according to Democratic Senate aides, only 20 or so senators initially agreed with him. In 2011, when he made his first real charge at rules reform, Merkley had only 46 Democrats on board (out of 53), and some of that support was soft. But the Republicans kept on filibustering. In May 2012, Republicans blocked an attempt to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Reid responded with an apology to progressives. ""If there were ever a time when Tom Udall and Jeff Merkley were prophetic, it's tonight,"" he said. ""These two young, fine senators said it was time to change the rules of the Senate, and we didn't. And they were right. The rest of us were wrong--or most of us, anyway. What a shame."" In retrospect, that was the moment progressives brought their party on board with the biggest majority-rule congressional reform since the 1970s. Every one of Reid's procedural moves since then has broken the minority's power to obstruct legislation. This wasn't just a case of broken trust between Democrats and Republicans--though that was part of it. This was a victory for a movement that believes its greatest threat comes from unfriendly courts and minority obstruction. Progressives have believed that for a long time. If the filibuster didn't exist, you could have passed a muscular Civil Rights Act sooner, passed universal health care in the 1970s, or passed the House's simpler, larger version of the Affordable Care Act in 2009. Plenty of progressives would argue that an ACA with a ""public option"" would have avoided the problems now dogging the Senate version that eventually passed, one that gave insurers more power in order to win extra votes from Republicans--who didn't vote for the bill anyway. The filibuster, as seen by progressives, didn't just ""level the playing field"" or ""provide checks and balances."" It allowed the minority party to block their agenda, with zero consequence. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed to understand better than the Democrats did. ""We worked very hard to keep our fingerprints off of these proposals,"" McConnell told the Atlantic's Josh Green in 2011, after Democrats lost the midterms. ""We thought--correctly, I think--that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisan. When you hang the 'bipartisan' tag on something, the perception is that differences have been worked out, and there's a broad agreement that that's the way forward."" That meant that the filibuster empowered Republicans, and the courts--not exactly filling with Obama nominees, thanks to that 60-vote threshold--validated them further. The travails of the ACA proved that, and progressive journalists recorded it all. In a long reported piece on how the act's mandate became controversial, Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein credited the rulings of conservative judges. He quoted law professor Orin Kerr, who explained that the conservative argument that the mandate was unconstitutional didn't pass the laugh test until ""there were two conservative district judges who agreed with the argument, largely echoing the Republican position and the media coverage.""* The 5-4 victory that saved Obamacare (while giving states freedom to opt out of a Medicaid expansion) calmed progressives, but only briefly. Because the mandate was upheld as a tax, McConnell set about planning to undo the entire law with only 51 votes during the budget reconciliation progress. ""We were prepared to do that had we had the votes to do it after the election,"" McConnell told National Journal. To Democrats, to progressives, this sounded like yet more proof that Republicans responded to defeat by asking for more favorable rules. The filibuster became part of a litany--gerrymandering that helped the GOP hold the House, voter ID/polling place laws that cut into minority and youth votes, circuit courts that undid Democratic laws. The D.C. circuit, currently split 4-4 between Democratic and Republican appointees, had ruled against the administration's recess appointments, ruled against financial regulations, and ruled against aspects of the ACA. Democrats knew exactly why Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley was leading filibusters against any nominee to fill the three open D.C. seats. It's only fitting that Reid broke the judicial filibuster today by filling them. But Reid never expected to be here making that call. In 2005, according to Democrats, they really did want the judicial wars to taper off. ""There was still a reservoir of good will that members on both sides of the aisle could dip into to try and get to a compromise,"" says Manley. ""That reservoir just isn't there anymore. Republicans don't care about the institution. All they want is power."" Republicans didn't try to convince Democrats otherwise. Their closing, baffled arguments against the filibuster reform (as recently as last week, Republican aides were confident the vote wouldn't happen) were a series of threats, varying in their politeness. ""When we have the majority, when we have a Republican president, we will put more people like Scalia on the court,"" said Grassley when asked to envision a post-nuclear world. ""There's not a doubt in my mind that if the majority breaks the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate with regard to nominations, the next majority will do it for everything,"" said McConnell. Progressives know that. They expect that. They didn't demand the change because they're ignorant about the 2014 polls. If they lose that election, they'll have given themselves a year to confirm judges and executive nominees. If they lose the presidency in 2016, they'll have empowered a Republican to put judicial robes on whichever Federalist Society member he wants. But they expected Republicans to break the filibuster anyway. ""I know that if there is a Republican president and a Republican majority,"" Sen. Merkley said this month, ""they will force up-and-down votes, because they demonstrated their commitment to that principle in 2005."" Merkley's opponents never really reckoned with his logic. Progressives did not consider filibuster reform a ""risk."" They saw a way to kick over an impediment to majority rule, before Republicans took power and kicked it over themselves. They're trading something that might have brought ""consensus"" for something that empowers the party that wins elections. And they're fine with that.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/barack_obama_s_broken_health_care_promises_does_the_president_have_any_credibility.html	"In his press conference Thursday, the president outlined his challenge for the remainder of his term. ""I'm just going to keep on working as hard as I can around the priorities that I think the American people care about. And I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general."" Winning back credibility is hard for presidents. It requires either an emergency or the kind of candor presidents don't usually feel free to express. Anything short of that isn't likely to dispel the impressions people have formed as a result of the big event that caused them to lose their trust in a president in the first place. Given the difficult road the president's health care plan has traveled, it seems like he is going to have an especially hard time winning back that trust. What makes it so hard is that as a basic proposition, administrations are not really in the credibility business. When a president or his spokesman steps up to the lectern, no one girds himself for a bracing moment of honesty. Spinning the messy nature of life is central to a president's purpose. A large part of the audience--a skeptical press corps and political foes--assumes a certain amount of dissembling. That's the natural state of things. President Obama has a particular challenge. He is in a hunkered marathon of damage control. His signature achievement as president is in trouble, polls show Americans trust him less than they ever did, and he's at that stage in his presidency where his legacy is beginning to be defined. Even the most pure-hearted pilgrim would have to lash himself to the mast to keep from engaging in spin to manage these problems. But when you spin in the middle of a credibility crisis, the garden-variety shadings required by the office can make your problem worse. That's bad for the president's standing and for his party, but it's also bad because it means everything the president says gets a downgrade. If no one listens or believes you, it's hard to make the case for any good news. This brings us to the deadline for the successful operation of healthcare.gov. It is supposed to be up and humming on Nov. 30. As a policy matter, if the president's experiment is going to work, he needs the website to function so that healthy people--particularly young healthy people--can sign up and keep premiums from skyrocketing. As a public relations matter, he needs this so that the system can start minting enough positive anecdotes of people successfully signing up to beat back all the negative press. As a credibility matter, the president and his team need the website to work by this date because they have said it would. The pressure to spin is going to be enormous. When you're in a crouch, you worry your candor is only going to give ammunition to your detractors. There was a whiff of this instinct in the management of the rollout numbers this week. Spin too much and the administration will remind everyone of what caused the calamity in the first place: No one wanted to tell the truth that the website wasn't ready more than a month ago. The Obama team already faces a steep hill here. The complexity of the repair job and the history of broken promises means they probably shouldn't even be guaranteeing the site will be working by a hard date. In a battle for credibility, these claims don't send calm--they send a warning that another disappointment is coming. Baby please take me back, this time I promise. Credibility is not just about honesty. It's about authority. Does the president really have command over the things he's talking about? The president admitted that he was not in the loop about the colossal problems with his health care rollout. ""I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to,"" the president said on Thursday. ""Had I been informed, I wouldn't be going out saying, 'Boy, this is going to be great.' You know, I'm accused of a lot of things, but I don't think I'm stupid enough to go around saying, 'This is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity,' a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn't going to work."" The president is no doubt receiving lots of regular updates now, but as the public evaluates his ability to speak accurately about the issues of the day, has he lost something by not appearing to be at the center of his own administration? In his new book about John Kennedy, Camelot's Court, Robert Dallek describes how important retaining that image was to JFK's conception of the presidency: ""When Kennedy took responsibility for the Bay of Pigs, it was not simply a courageous move to protect subordinates, but also a statement of his conviction that if he were to establish himself as a historical figure, he needed to be seen as at the center of all his administration did-- the achievements and the failures."" Obama's credibility challenges won't stop when his incompetently managed health care website is finally repaired. Once that gets fixed, the president will ride another credibility roller coaster: truthfully describing whether the Affordable Care Act is working as designed. All the attention on his law's launch-pad disaster may have distracted people from the fact that the underlying pursuit is a very tough one. If healthcare.gov had launched perfectly, there still would have been a huge debate over whether Obamacare was working as promised. Were younger people signing up? Were the risk pools in various regions of the country filled with the right kinds of policyholders necessary to keep premiums in check? This was the original brain surgery the president was undertaking before the earthquake. Once the patient is lifted back off the floor and the generator is patched up, you still have to do brain surgery. President George W. Bush, whose low approval ratings Obama is approaching, used to say that the real evaluation of his presidency wouldn't happen until he was dead. That's probably true of all presidents, but President Obama may have a short cut to a preliminary verdict. In a year, we'll know whether the Affordable Care Act was a success or failure. It's the most predictable factor that could improve or eviscerate the president's credibility. All he has to do now is perform brain surgery.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/cornelia_pillard_s_judicial_nomination_filibustered_will_senate_democrats.html	"On Tuesday evening, as they'd expected, Senate Democrats watched helplessly as one of President Obama's judicial nominees was filibustered. Cornelia Pillard, a 52-year old law professor at Georgetown, would have been the fourth woman on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.* And Democrats had leaned hard on that fact. ""Just say we don't want women on this court,"" rasped Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy in the final pre-vote floor speech, browbeating Republicans. The accusations of bias and sexism, remarkably, did not win over the GOP. Only two Republican senators (Maine's Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski) voted to allow a vote on Pillard, after which Leahy led a posse of Democrats to TV cameras and microphones to denounce the GOP as a pack of woman-demoting deal-breakers. ""You cannot say that one president can have his way on qualified judges, and another president can't have his way--that you can have qualified men but not qualified women,"" said Leahy. ""You know, I've been here longer than anybody else serving in the Senate. I've always tried to protect the rules in Republican majorities and Democratic majorities, because my experience has been they were used responsibly. Very, very rarely were they used to filibuster. That's become a thing of the past. I think we're at the point where there will have to be a rules change."" A rules change? This, again? Leahy was asked what was different between November 2013 and the spring of 2005, when Republicans swore they'd break the filibuster to cram through their own blocked nominees. The ""Gang of 14,"" seven Democrats and seven Republicans, cut a deal to let most of the nominees through but preserve the 60-vote veto. ""We had a lot of Republicans who said at that time there should only be a filibuster in the most extraordinary circumstances,"" said Leahy. Then, without warning, he smacked the podium he was speaking behind. Thwack. ""Each one of those Republicans who said that has filibustered on this! Their credibility is shredded."" There's a lot of that going around, these claims of lost credibility, hypocrisy, and bias. Democrats, distracted at the moment by the pitchfork-wielding mobs asking why their private insurance plans were canceled, are slowly building up to another filibuster fight. At issue are the three open seats on the D.C. Circuit, currently divided 4-4 between Republican and Democratic appointees, and currently the premier threat to Democratic legislation. It was Republican appointees on the D.C. Circuit who invalidated Obama's recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, and it was Republican appointee Janice Rogers Brown--confirmed by the 2005 Gang of 14 deal--who ruled against the administration's contraception mandate last month. Republicans, led by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, have remained largely unified in a campaign to block any new nominee to the circuit. Their strategy: lock in the current 4-4 court by eliminating the empty seats and redistributing them to other circuits, because some other courts (ones that aren't the first recourse for people suing Congress over legislation) have more cases. ""In 2012, there were 512 'administrative appeals' filed in D.C.,"" said Grassley on Tuesday. ""In the 2nd Circuit, there were 1,493. Stated differently, in D.C. there were only 64 administrative appeals per active judge. The 2nd Circuit has nearly twice as many with 115."" That framing, which seemed like a stretch--no one also denies that the D.C. Circuit gets more pivotal cases than the 2nd Circuit--has since been universally adopted by the right. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, the sort of Republican whom Democrats like to cut deals with, has endorsed Grassley's Court Efficiency Act because it would ""bring a reasonable end to the destructive partisan fights to which both parties have contributed."" A third-party ad hitting Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor (a Gang of 14 member) right now accuses him of trying to ""pack a key court with liberal judges"" because he doesn't want to eliminate the three open seats. Grassley points out that Democrats blocked a 2006 Bush nominee on the grounds that the seat didn't need to be filled--what more evidence does he need? ""We're going by the standards that Democrats set in 2006,"" said Grassley after Tuesday's vote. ""They said that we didn't need any more judges. And that's exactly what I'm telling 'em, what they said! We're just doing what they said. They set the standard and they can't say we're doing this because we've got a Democratic president, because I got a judge removed, the 12th one removed, when we had a Republican president."" The newest Democratic attack line, that to oppose female nominees was to oppose women, did not move Grassley. ""When I voted for 75 women judges, they want to tell me I'm against women?"" Only three Republican members of the Gang of 14 still serve in the Senate. Two of them, Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, voted with Grassley on Tuesday. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch voted present, as he often does to protest the new filibuster standards. But he didn't disagree with what Grassley was saying. ""Let's face it, it's outrageous that anybody backs the Democrats on this after what they did a few years back,"" said Hatch. ""The arguments they made, if they were valid then, they're even more valid today. There's no reason to stack that court so they can get legislation they could never get through the Congress."" Running through all of these arguments is a powerful vein of mistrust. Democrats know very well that they may lose the Senate in 2014. Even a banner year will probably feature a couple of losses, making court fights even harder to win. And they remember the result of the 2005 compromise: Republicans got most of what they wanted. So why shouldn't Democrats start up another round of rules-change-mania? What's the worst that could happen? ""Talking to senators, one gets the sense that they know that if there is a Republican president and a Republican majority, they will force up-and-down votes because they demonstrated their commitment to that principle in 2005,"" said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the de facto leader of the rules-reform caucus. ""There is, in a democracy, power that goes with the voice of the people. When people elect a president, there are electing him for his nominating powers as well as his management."" Republicans shrug this off, with contempt. ""They ought to do that!"" said Grassley. ""Then when we have the majority, when we have a Republican president, we put more people like Scalia on the court. Here's the point: They're going to regret it if they do. I don't think they're going to be dumb enough to do it. But if they do it, the way they're playing this game now, with these sorts of agreements--they're getting everything they want but we're not getting anything out of it. We need a level playing field."" That's not what Democrats are offering. They're expecting a third nominee to be filibustered, which could then kick open the filibuster-reform door. ""I don't think that's gonna happen,"" said Hatch of the possible rule change. ""If they want to do that, it's the stupidest thing they could possibly do. They'd rue the day that happened. Sooner or later there'll be a time ... "" The senator trailed off. ""Republicans would not let them get away with it, and what goes around comes around."" *Correction, Nov. 13, 2013: This originally misstated that Cornelia Pillard is African-American.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/barack_obama_s_bad_apology_the_president_s_apology_for_the_affordable_care.html	"In his interview with NBC News on Thursday, President Obama tried to offer an apology for those who are losing their health care plans because of the Affordable Care Act, as well as do damage control. He failed at both. ""I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,"" the president told Chuck Todd about those trying to buy insurance in the individual marketplace. These people--the Associated Press says there are more than 3.5 million of them--are losing their plans, not because of anything the president said, but because of his policies. Many don't know if they can get a new plan that will be better than their old plan because the system isn't working yet. While the president offered the right words, they were awfully late, as it has been weeks since people have been getting frightening letters saying their coverage would soon disappear. During that period--the weeks between when the worry began and this apology finally arrived--the president has tried various escape routes to get out of his original promise that if you had a plan you liked, you could keep it. It didn't work for him. All doors were locked. So, with no more room, and political pressure building, he offered his deepest sympathies. Why does the wait matter? Because an apology's proximity to a harm offers an important indication about a person's underlying motivations--whether he is feeling guilt, responsibility, and repentance, or whether he's just doing what custom dictates. When you accidentally brain another customer at the market reaching for a bottle of wine, you rush to say you're sorry. You spit it out because you are compelled like mad to reverse the damage. If you knock into the person and squash a papaya on his starched shirt, you become a flurry of hands to clean it up and make things better. However, if you cause an accident and wait until you bump into the person two weeks later after ducking behind postal boxes to avoid him, he is right to be suspicious about how sorry you are. Presidents don't offer apologies much. Clinton apologized for failing to prevent a genocide in Rwanda and for his deception about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, but it was all very much after the fact. George Bush apologized quickly for the atrocities at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. But the speed didn't help much because the problem was of such enormity it was metaphysically the least he could do. When you apologize late, it makes people think that you don't really mean it and you've been forced into it as a last resort. You know who knows how to do it right? Barack Obama. In 2009, when former Sen. Tom Daschle was up for an administration post and had to withdraw, Obama ate the frog right away. ""I think I screwed up,"" Obama said. ""And I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again. I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics,"" Obama continued. ""And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards--one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes."" Everyone says John F. Kennedy set the standard for accountability by taking the blame for the Bay of Pigs disaster. A lot of this is a myth based on his comment at a press conference, when he said that ""victory has 100 fathers and defeat is an orphan. ... I'm the responsible officer of the Government."" That's pretty oblique. Obama's Daschle apology is actually a great example of the form: explicit, with no mumbling. Not only did the president not meet the Daschle standard in this case, but he bubble-wrapped it with lots of explanations and rationalizations--his broken promise only affects 5 percent of the population, insurance companies are offering subpar plans, there's churn in the market, and so on. All of this may be true, but when your apology sputters out at the end of a list of mitigating conditions, it lacks much punch. It seems grudging. So do the people going through this feel better? Probably not. Does it look like the president was trying to make himself look better? Yes, it does. In fact, the president didn't want to spend much time on the apology at all. What he really wanted to do was put the underlying problem about the individual market in perspective. His larger task is reminding people of the reasons Obamacare was necessary in the first place. But trying to offer that kind of perspective and context isn't the stuff of great apologies. Because, when you try to go back to first principles, you can sound professorial, distant, and like you're trying to shrink from the human cost of the screw-up. The problem with this approach is that the delay has inadvertently created the kind of worry the president passed the law to diminish. ""It's scary to them,"" the president said of those who have lost their plans and are in limbo. This fear is similar to the fear the president described when making his argument for the original legislation in 2009 and 2010. When you have no insurance, it's frightening. When you worry you'll be dropped from your insurance, it's frightening. When you might go bankrupt because the plan you have won't truly cover your bills when you get sick, that's frightening. The president launched the Affordable Care Act to attack all of that worry. As the president sees it, despite the worries of today, people are still not as bad-off as they were when they were subject to the full mercy of the previous system. (That's likely to be true for the majority of those in the individual market.) In that system, there was no relief in sight. Now he can at least offer the hope that, despite the great botch, help is coming--once healthcare.gov lets people sign up. But that message--today's temporary fear is better than yesterday's chronic one--is hardly an easy one to sell. Instead, the president offered explanations for why healthcare.gov wasn't working. One of the rationalizations was that the debacle was the result of the normal friction that comes from trying to do complicated things in government. ""I think, what most people I hope also recognize is that when you try to do something big like make our health care system better that there're going to be problems along the way, even if ultimately what you're doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off. And I hope that people will look at the end product."" Does the president really want to try to smooth over this failure by casting it as the inevitable result of trying to do big things? Sure, that gets him out of his present jam, but it's a tough legacy to leave for any future president who wants to do ambitious work. If what healthcare.gov is going through now is the garden-variety type of ""problem along the way"" that comes from activist government, then you've just read the Republican Party's talking points. On the other hand, if the president took real responsibility--as he did over the botched Daschle appointment--and admitted at some level that that there were unique failures in his own administration, it might leave alive the possibility that a big job like this could be carried out by a more competent team. That's a tough thing to say for someone who is trying to dig himself out and keep his signature program alive, but it's not possible to be sorry and not be responsible at the same time."	"Does President Obama Know How to Say ""I'm Sorry""?"
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/ken_cuccinelli_s_failed_virginia_campaign_the_blame_game_and_the_future.html	"The argument among Republicans over why they lost the governor's race in Virginia feels like the debate over ""who lost China"" in the 1950s. Did Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli lose because he was too conservative? Or, did he lose because the Republican establishment didn't support him? This isn't just a matter of scapegoating. Every losing campaign has its fights and finger pointing (and the authors of Double Down would like to thank you for that), but sometimes it just stops there. There was no greater meaning to take away from the postgame tussle after Hillary Clinton's primary loss in 2008. This blame game is important, however, because it is really a fight about the Republican Party's strategy for the future. In the first round, the existing participants in the Republican internal party debate have pretty much played to type. Karl Rove, who is pushing the party to nominate ""electable"" candidates, writes that Cuccinelli's loss shows that GOP candidates need to unite the party's factions instead of alienate them. The New York Times suggests Cuccinelli's loss has reanimated the push to end the highly partisan nominating conventions that lead to people like the former Virginia attorney general being picked in the first place. Exit polls show that 50 percent of Virginia voters found Cuccinelli too extreme. Activist conservatives, on the other hand, blame the Republican Governors Association and the Republican National Committee for not putting enough money into the race. The Tea Party crowd claims the establishment sold the Tea Party out again, just as it did during the government shutdown when moderate GOP senators didn't have the guts to stand and fight over Obamacare. Same whine, new bottles, right? No. There is one important contributing factor to the loss that both sides agree on. Rove argued in his Virginia election post-mortem that the government shutdown contributed to Cuccinelli's defeat. Cuccinelli campaign strategist Chris LaCivita agrees: The government shutdown distracted from talking about the failure of Obamacare's launch. ""There was definitely a national mood that was moving, that is moving, that is continuing to move against the White House and the Affordable Care Act. And I can't help but ask myself, what would have been the result had he had five weeks of this discussion instead of just two and a half?"" LaCivita would like to have October back, and spend the whole month beating Obamacare like a drum. Instead, more than half of the month was spent on the shutdown and the parlor game of whether the Republican Party would drive the country over the debt limit brink. The Cuccinelli camp can't know for sure whether this strategy would have changed the election's outcome. They didn't do a poll in the last few weeks of the race and have no data to support their view. But the numbers don't matter among Republicans who believe highlighting Obamacare's failures is a campaign winner--the only question left to settle is the tactical wisdom or stupidity of the government shutdown. The debate over Obamacare and the shutdown was about tactics, where those who were not willing to do absolutely everything were seen as less committed to the cause. In this effort, Cuccinelli and his Republican brethren were on the same side. Cuccinelli and Sens. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz, two of the main authors of the effort to defund Obamacare, are fellow travelers. They believe that the health care law is so bad that all necessary measures should be taken to undermine it. Cuccinelli regularly boasted on the stump that he had been the first attorney general to lodge a suit against the Affordable Care Act. He had done everything in his power to undo the law. As senators, Cruz and Lee did their part too--pushing for a government shutdown, despite what the polls and many of their fellow Republicans told them. Such a forward-leaning, conservative stance was not just the right thing to do, argue its adherents, it was also the politically smart thing to do. It shows your most ardent supporters that you really mean what you say. Do controversial things in support of what you believe, and voters will flock to you. The opposite argument, offered by members of the ""establishment,"" is that sometimes while everyone might agree on the goal, different tactics are required to get there, even if it means getting there in the long run. Many of these more pragmatic voices were in the Senate cloakroom, arguing that a government shutdown would hurt the Republican brand and distract from the better sport of watching Obamacare collapse under its own weight. That strikes the rising right as timid and weak. In the aftermath of the shutdown, when the GOP's approval rating crashed, Tea Party supporters argued that while they may not have achieved their ultimate goal of stopping Obamacare, they highlighted the deficiencies in the program. They believed their antics had thrilled the public and those same voters would reward them for their principled stand. The Washington insiders might not have liked it, but the voters did. But after Cuccinelli's closer-than-expected election loss, that's not how his camp sees it anymore. By blaming its woes on the shutdown distraction, the Cuccinelli campaign sounds an awful lot like establishment Republicans before the shutdown. Now, in the clear light of defeat, this band of conservatives seems to appreciate that sometimes there are costs to doomed acts of principle. To wonder about those costs in advance of the kamikaze strategy is not a sign that you are weak, unprincipled, or a RINO--it simply keeps you from having to blame the strategy when the election is over and it's too late."	The Blame Game Over Ken Cuccinelli's Loss Actually Matters

That's the newly re-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's twist on the famous message on the bridge that spans the Delaware River on the way into the Garden State. ""I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey, maybe the folks in Washington, D.C. should tune in their TVs right now to see how it's done,"" he said in his victory speech after winning a second term on Tuesday. In the era of the Tea Party--when victors talk about stripping away government with a liberal use of the words liberty and freedom--the future presidential candidate's speech was remarkable for its support of government as a useful enterprise. He had every reason to--Christie's landslide victory was built on his sustained reaction to Hurricane Sandy that hit a year ago, taking 37 lives and costing $30 billion worth of damage as it erased huge swaths of the storied Jersey Shore. But Christie wasn't just talking about effective government in the wake of disaster. He was making the case for something bigger--for the reanimation of government as a force for making effective change in people's lives. Christie reflected on the mood of the electorate when he came to office in 2009. ""The people of New Jersey four years ago were downhearted and dispirited, they didn't believe that government could work for them anymore."" Let's stop here. In your standard Tea Party address, the emphasis is less on making government work but paring it down to limit its debilitating effects. What fills the heart and lifts the spirit comes from freedom; it can never be found in an institution of government. Christie, on the other hand, portrayed effective government as having something to offer. ""In fact, what they thought was that government was just there to take from them but not to give to them, not to work with them, not to work for them. Well, four years later, we stand here tonight showing that it is possible to put doing your job first."" Doing your job. Getting the job done. That was the constant refrain from Christie in his election night victory speech. He didn't talk about a single policy proposal or thing that he had done, which was probably smart. It doesn't confuse or complicate his main message, and it also allows him to claim his re-election is a validation of his entire record without unearthing any opposition that might arise from the dislike of a particular program. Who can argue with wanting to get things done? For a nation weary of Washington's inability to complete even the most basic tasks assigned to it by the Constitution and custom, promises that you can get the job done are alluring. (Most would probably settle for a promise to not screw things up.) Mitt Romney largely ran away from his record as a governor; Chris Christie is using his time in Trenton as a walking stick. But how far will it take him? Will he build his campaign on a vision of what effective government would look like at the federal level--courting possible Tea Party assaults for doing so--or will he talk about it as just one of his past successes? How important will Christie's argument for the power of government be for this Republican presidential hopeful? Will it be a walking stick or a crutch?"

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will secure his re-election today and begin his race for the White House tomorrow. Wherever he falls in the ultimate order of GOP candidates trying to win their party's nomination, he will occupy a familiar historical spot: the untested juggernaut. Christie's advantages for the 2016 presidential race are many: He's a media darling, can raise boatloads of cash, has a plausible nomination story, and he's an exciting and forceful personality. But like other high-expectation candidates, he has also never been tested in the unique crucible of a presidential campaign. Christie is a volatile hothead about to enter a process that makes the most even-tempered fly off the handle. Primaries are irritating, petty, and grueling, and 2016 could be particularly brutish if it turns out to be the grand reckoning in the GOP's civil war over the soul of the party. As the establishment's man, Christie will face tests a lot more challenging than the Garden State's Democratic Party. The Christie bedtime story being sold by his staff is that he can do for Republicans nationally what he has done for New Jersey. He can govern as a conservative, even in a state with 700,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, and win bipartisan love along the way. In a country thirsty for pragmatism and progress, he is the top dog among Republican governors selling themselves as the competent conservative cousins to the backward and grumpy relations in Congress. After losing the popular vote in five of the last six elections, Republicans are hungry for success and they want a winner. ""Sometimes, I feel like our party cares more about winning the argument than they care about winning elections. And if you don't win elections, you can't govern,"" Christie told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday. If you need proof of what the alternative political strategy looks like, Gov. Christie would like to introduce you to the darling of the party's hard-core conservatives, Ken Cuccinelli--the governor of nothing at all. It's a compelling pitch, but it isn't going to spare Christie a fight that will test his temperament. He could very well survive the Republican primaries just fine--the GOP has tapped the establishment candidate more often than not--but the question for Christie is whether he has the skills to emerge from the warping primary process with his pleasing bedtime story intact. That has always been a challenge for any candidate, but it may be particularly acute in Christie's case: Grassroots Republicans are trying to look into candidates' souls and Christie's can be a volatile place. Bombast and periodic eruptions are part of Christie's act, but what is that going to look like when he pops off at some conservative activist who corners him in a windowless ballroom at a Lincoln Day Dinner? What issue is likely to trip up Christie and cause this problem? He's pro-life and against gay marriage, which would suggest he should fare well with cultural conservatives. His trouble will come from his request for relief money to fight the effects of Hurricane Sandy and accepting federal Medicaid money as a part of the Affordable Care Act. But to dissect the issues puts too much emphasis on them. The overarching worry among conservatives will be that no matter what the issue, a man who makes such a fetish of his ability to work with Democrats is going to sell out conservatives in the end. This tension has been at the core of the fight between the Republican Party establishment and grassroots since the 1940s. Sometimes that fight is about policy, but often the candidates are so close in their positions that the fight is more about personality and tactics. A quote from Michael Bowen's Roots of Modern Conservatism: Dewey, Taft, and the Battle for the Soul of the Republican Party brings this home. ""It is important to bear in mind that the major political controversies today do not center about objectives,"" said a Republican staffer, ""but mainly about methods of attaining objectives."" That was a quote from more than 60 years ago, but could just as easily apply to last month's fight over defunding Obamacare. The fight over ""methods for attaining objectives"" is already underway. Embedded in Christie's argument for his presidential candidacy is a jab at grassroots conservatives. The purists don't get it, he has argued; Republicans need to win elections to get their policies enacted, and if they insist on purity they'll never nominate anyone who can get elected. Conservatives, on the other hand, believe that if you run on principle and stand on principle you bring voters to you. The exact policy terrain where this inevitable fight will take place has yet to be determined, but there are other reasons conservatives are suspicious of Christie. He has all the wrong friends. The media likes Christie and so does the establishment. As Dan Balz writes in his book Collision 2012, a who's-who of the Eastern elite begged Christie in one of those vast polished wood rooms in a private New York club and pushed him to run for president. During one quarter of fundraising, Christie received money from top Democratic donors. Those who anticipate Christie will abandon them in the end point to his self-centered 2012 convention speech and his embrace of President Obama in the late days of the campaign. That is the brew that kept Christie from getting an invitation to the Conservative Political Action Conference, despite his being the most popular conservative in the nation, proof that purity tests are being administered regardless of other factors. So who will fill the ABC (Anybody But Christie) slot, and will they be able to lay a glove on him? There's no clear choice, but in the 2012 contest voters cycled through a series of Anybody But Romney misfits, suggesting that activists will back pretty much anyone if they run as the anti-establishment figure. In 2008, proof of this tissue rejection was that when the grassroots thought Sen. John McCain wasn't conservative enough, they actually rallied around Romney. Will all of this infighting doom Christie? Only if he lets it. He enters the next level of 2016 speculation facing three options: He blows up like Rudy Giuliani and Rick Perry, he warps himself to please the base like McCain and Romney, or he gets in a life and death struggle and emerges to win the general election the way George Bush did in 2000. The only qualification for the launchpad blow-up is high expectations and the comfort that comes from being lauded for your greatness. Both Giuliani and Perry were considered formidable at one time, but turned out to be incapable of handling the rigors of a campaign. When they cratered, they had no campaign experience to fall back on that allowed them to climb back into the race. McCain, a born fighter, rescued his campaign in 2008 in part because he had been through the presidential slog before.* But McCain, like Romney, also warped himself and his message in the GOP primary process in order to appeal to conservative voters. That undermined his general election appeal. Christie doesn't seem to be taking that route. If he does, his friends in the green rooms and board rooms will bury him under a mountain of advice that he's ruining his straight-talking brand. The likely avenue is that Christie will run against the Democrats whose votes he's been courting, arguing that his ability to get anything conservative done in a blue state shows that he can stick to his principles even under the constant assault of baying socialists. George Bush's challenge didn't come from the right, but from McCain in the middle. Bush emerged from the contest honed and sharpened--and with few lasting scars that his opponent could exploit. That's not going to happen this time. The reverse is more likely: Christie surfs the Civil War, allowing those competing on his right to punch themselves out and leave him standing. That will take a lot of patience and thick skin. His training begins now. Correction, Nov. 6, 2013: This article mistakenly referred to John McCain's last presidential campaign as having taken place in 2012. He last ran in 2008. (Return.)"
