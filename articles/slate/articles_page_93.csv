The room is full at 12:20. There are middle-aged people with Ron Paul gear--vintage 2008 stuff, homemade designs with Paul wearing a surgical mask--and students from the University of Nevada Las Vegas. They keep themselves amused. ""Socialism sucks!"" yells one kid wearing a knit cap. ""Ron Paul 2012!"" yells another student. ""Rand Paul 2016!"" yells an older man cradling a tot. The show starts on time. Paul's wife Carol, a petite woman with big blonde hair, walks to a reserved seat and gets immediate cheers of recognition. Peter Tariche, a serious-looking computer programmer who directs Youth for Ron Paul in the Western states, rises for the introduction. ""Only one man has defended liberty and the Constitution,"" says Tariche. ""History will look back kindly on him, for our generation has the power, the will, and the courage to restore a free society. We, the youth of this campaign, will fuel this movement. We will fix the problems that now face this generation."" That's Paul's cue. He strides onto the stage and begins with this: ""A lot has happened the last couple of years."" Thus begins a 35-minute lecture about Austrian economics, Keynesian economics, Randolph Bourne (who coined the idea that ""war is the health of the state""), the origins of the housing crisis, and the road to serfdom. He talks up his new plan to cut $1 trillion in 2013, and thereby balance the budget, by scrapping foreign aid and five Cabinet departments, and starting to scale back entitlements. But he's really much more comfortable on the philosophy. ""The Austrian economists,"" says Paul, ""the free-market economists who predicted the downfall of the Bretton Woods agreement and the collapse of so much of what has happened over these years, they've also made this predictions about an interventionist planned economy of the Keynesian type--that it would eventually lead to this bankruptcy. It would lead to more government, not less. If it didn't get stopped, it would lead to a fascist type of socialism. Guess what?"" That's a rhetorical question. Talking to members of the crowd after the speech, I don't find any voters still shopping around. These are Paul diehards who would chug hemlock before voting for someone else. The difference between them and, say, the Paul diehards who flood other states' straw polls, or wave signs outside of debates, is that they're in Nevada. This is a caucus state. This is a place where Ron Paul matters, where Ron Paul's fans can rattle the GOP. Four years ago, no one knew what would happen in Nevada's caucuses. They were sort of an experiment, a way to make a diverse Western state matter. The final Nevada polls predicted that Mitt Romney would win the caucuses narrowly, with about 26 percent of the vote, and that Paul would pull single digits and come in sixth. That didn't happen. Romney won 51 percent of the vote; Paul came in second. When the state conventions came up--the caucus vote was non-binding--Paul's supporters stayed solid, dragging out a floor fight, demanding their delegates. It was a legendary battle locally (I still have DVDs that the Paul fans pressed and distributed afterward), and it would presage what happened in 2009 and 2010, when outsider activists took over their Republican parties in state after state. In Nevada, the activist rebellion ended up producing U.S. Senate candidate Sharron Angle. Paul's movement isn't a surprise anymore. It's an excuse-in-the-making for Republicans who will end up losing to him. Three months before the caucuses, he has two campaign offices and six full-time staff here. Romney is working the state, too; Herman Cain and Rick Perry have some staff and endorsements. The other candidates don't really have anything. Last week, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, and Jon Huntsman actually used the state's decision to move up the caucuses to announce that they'd skip the caucuses. Paul's fans love, love, love watching the forfeits. ""Come on, who was gonna vote for Huntsman?"" scoffs one UNLV senior who's studying economics. ""Oh, 'I'm not going to compete in Nevada because they moved up the vote.' That's like me saying I could play in the NBA, but I don't want to. Nope. I'm not in the NBA because I'm 5-foot-7-inches."" The NBA's not the best metaphor for what's happening to these caucuses. If it stays a contest of Romney and his Mormon base versus Paul's merry libertarians, it's a poker game that no one else can buy into. And Paul's fans, not used to this feeling, like being on top. When the candidate's speech ends--no Q&A--he moves back toward the hallway, past the ropeline, ready to sign books and shake hands. Deirdre Heydee, a fan who drove in from California, has brought $80 skateboards with Paul's face drawn on them. Paul doesn't get to shake many hands. The media have rushed over to ask him questions, and a local TV reporter shoves a microphone in his face to grill him on entitlements.  ""What would you say to people in Nevada,"" she asks, ""who depend on the programs you're talking about cutting?"" ""Well, I talked about that,"" says Paul. ""I'm not going to repeat my speech."" ""What would you say, if they depend on those programs?"" ""I gave my speech. I can't repeat my speech."" Paul avoids a pulsating blob of cameras and heads back to the hallway. A few fans snap at the reporter for asking the question. Carol Paul chastises her, saying she stopped her husband from meeting more of the people who wanted to see him. It's ironic. Earlier in the day, the Paul campaign had sent out a fundraising e-mail blaming the press for not giving him more coverage. ""The media continues their old tricks of propping up their preferred candidates with more airtime,"" it says, ""while ignoring those who challenge the status quo."" But hey, maybe defending every little position in a scrum isn't what Paul is talking about. The bet is that he doesn't need to. He gives the same basic speech he's been giving for 30 years; he keeps adding followers; he's got the money to spread the message. And Nevada, bleak as it is right now, is fertile territory for the message. Unemployment in this state spiked to the mid-teens in 2009, and it's stayed there. After the speech, I drive over to Paul's new campaign office in the Vegas suburb of Henderson. It's one of the only inhabited spaces in a stucco strip mall built for two dozen stores. I walk into the office at the same time that a new Paul supporter is stopping in for a lawn sign. ""People walk past the parking lot and they see the economy,"" says Steve Bierfeldt, Paul's Nevada executive director. ""People in Nevada don't need to be told that unemployment's a problem, or foreclosures are a problem. They're living that. He's talking about it."" And so Paul's campaign thinks Nevada is actually winnable? ""Definitely."""	"Ron Paul Leads Libertarians Into the Nevada Desert

According to Alex Jones, from 1992 to 1996 Cain was ""Kansas City Board President of the Federal Reserve Bank."" According to a Cain fan at Ricochet, Cain was merely a ""member of a Federal Reserve District Board."" In his book, This Is Herman Cain!, the candidate calls himself a former ""head of the Kansas City Federal Reserve."" Maybe the mainstream media has figured this out? Maybe not. According to the Atlantic, he was a ""Federal Reserve Chairman."" According to the Huffington Post, he was a ""director of the Kansas City Fed."" It was Cain's only high-profile government role, and 15 years after he finished it, the public that might make him president has no idea what it was or meant. What did Herman Cain do at the Fed, and what does it tell us about him? The answers: ""Not much,"" and ""a little more than not much."" There are 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. Each has a nine-member board of directors, composed of three commercial bankers (Class A, in Fed jargon), three people from nonbanking sectors of the economy (Class B), and three captains of industry from the region (Class C). Cain was Class C. In 1992, he joined the board of directors at the Kansas City branch of the Federal Reserve. In 1994, he was chosen to chair the board. What does the board of directors actually do? Every month that Cain was there, board members would meet, talk through the economic developments and data in their areas, and offer some advice. Fed economists would listen. The research would be taken up to Kansas City Fed President Tom Hoenig, who could use it however he deigned to use it.* ""They're a source of economic information for the bank,"" explains Bill Medley, public information director for the Kansas City Fed. What's their single biggest contribution? They recommend the discount rate, or what the Fed charges for loans. ""But that,"" says Medley, ""has to be approved by the board of governors."" That means that Cain's role was chiefly as a charismatic guy who ran meetings well and corralled good advice. He was not an economist. In This Is Herman Cain!, the candidate recalls the Fed job as a Frank Capra-esque affair; a lunch with the branch manager turned into a pitch for an unexpected job. ""I thought: Wow, the Federal Reserve wants me to serve on one of its boards!"" writes Cain. ""That was something I had never really thought about, but it seemed pretty prestigious."" It was a learning experience, too. ""Looking back on my time at the Federal Reserve, it gave me the opportunity to be exposed to macroeconomics."" Was Cain just some naif in the ways of high-level Fed policy? Sure. That was the point. His fellow board members would include the head of a petroleum company, a Kansas City housing advocate, and an Oklahoma cattle magnate. Bill McQuillan, the chairman of CNB National Bank in Greeley, Neb., overlapped with Cain for three years and shared ""puddle jumper"" planes with him when they needed to go to the monthly meetings. ""I liked him right away,"" remembers McQuillan. ""He was a family man. He talked about music a lot. Really, he was a very bright, charismatic guy."" Cain turned the full power of his charisma on his new part-time job: Making meetings run quickly. ""He'd come prepared,"" says McQuillan. ""His goal was to get all of us engaged in a discussion--maximum participation. He'd open, and say 'We've got these issues to get through. We want to get through them as quickly as possible, and the floor is open for discussion.' "" The meetings would last around half a day. ""If things were not quite as focused as they should have been, he'd bring them back,"" says McQuillan. ""He would never make a person feel like they were talking out of turn. He'd say, 'I appreciate your comments, but in the interest of time, we should move on.' "" Funny enough, that's just how Cain describes his executive style. Whenever he's pressed on policy, on what to do in Afghanistan, on how to handle a crisis, he has a common refrain: ""I'll summon the experts."" He likes leaders who do the same, which is a reason he praises former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. ""He would sit patiently and listen to all the reports,"" writes Cain in his memoir, ""hear everybody, and then come to his insightful conclusion about what we needed to do. He was a very effective leader who did not make unilateral decisions."" Cain praised Greenspan at last week's Republican debate, too. Right away, in the unpredictable politics of 2011, it came off like a possible gaffe. Greenspan's reputation isn't what it once was, nor is the Fed's. In the 1990s, the Fed's dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment high wasn't quite so tricky. When McQuillan and Cain were riding those puddle jumpers, joblessness in Nebraska fell below 3 percent. Cain focused on inflation. ""When it comes to monetary policy,"" fellow board member Drue Jennings told the Atlantic this year, ""he was an inflation hawk."" What does that mean in 2011? It means that Cain wants the Fed to stop worrying about unemployment and focus on keeping inflation low. In his words, the Fed's ""focus needs to be narrowed"": Worry about the currency and let the rest of us worry about jobs. That's a common Republican critique of the Fed right now, but it's also a little strange. Inflation hasn't been a problem since before the Great Recession began. Cain's fans--and they include everyone who's talked on the record about his Fed days-- don't knock him for that. They remember a smart guy from whom everyone expected bigger things. ""One time,"" says McQuillan, ""I remember sitting around the table with him and talking politics. I said, 'Herman, you'd be a great senator.' He said it wasn't the time for that. So I told him he'd make a great president. He looked at me like: Are you crazy?"" Correction, Oct. 18, 2011: This article originally misidentified Kansas City Fed President Tom Hoenig's title as Kansas City Fed chairman. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

Sure, we could talk about how this is a fluke, or how ""Herman Cain"" is just how voters tell pollsters ""I don't know what to do yet,"" or how this is all part of Mitt Romney's Rube Goldberg plan to become president. All of that may be true, later. For now, the GOP's current frontrunner is a 65-year-old black man. Seriously. In three of the last five national polls, Cain has tied or surpassed Romney. In Public Policy Polling's survey, which dug a little deeper, voters were asked to narrow the field to just Romney and Cain. Hypothetically, Cain led Romney by 12 points. Republican voters really, really like Herman Cain. For the first time since the abortive Colin Powell draft of 1995, a black candidate has led a few polls for the GOP presidential nomination. And Cain, unlike Powell, is serious about this. What does it mean? According to Michael Steele, the first black chairman of the Republican National Committee, the answer is ... not too much. Is it promising? Sure. But let's not get carried away. ""I think Herman's doing well on the power of his ideas, his vision,"" says Steele. ""I'd say to Republicans: 'Look--he's not a cosmetic fix who's going to ameliorate that ugly stripe that black people see when they look at you. You've got that because over the last 40 years, you've done jack to empower them.' People need to be careful, not to come at this with the attitude that it's going to fix their image. It's offensive to Herman. It's offensive to me as an African-American."" Still, even if this is one big distraction on the road to the Romney inaugural, Tea Party organizers are loving it. Cain became a national figure because he teleported around the country speaking at every anti-tax event that would have him. He was out there swinging and laughing when Tea Partiers were accused of racism. Now, Tea Partiers want him to be president. Who's calling them racist now? ""This proves that the Tea Party doesn't count color against candidates,"" says Brendan Steinhauser, the coordinator of state campaigns at FreedomWorks. ""So Rep. Andre Carson says the Tea Party wants to lynch black people. What does he have to say if Cain gets the nomination? It certainly disproves this idea that the movement is racist."" Every time some annoying reporter or pundit or talking head or political scientist mused about the Tea Party and race--why did these people dislike President Obama so much?--the movement would point to a crop of black politicians, like Rep. Allen West, who were right in line with them. They were talking up Cain when editors were wasting space on Tim Pawlenty. Andrew Breitbart, the conservative-media entrepreneur, remembers what happened when he closed out an election-fraud-phobic ""True the Vote"" conference this year in Texas. ""I posited the Cain-West or West-Cain 'All Black, All Tea Party' ticket,"" he says, ""and there was a spontaneous standing ovation of epic proportion."" You can't overstate how much the ""racism"" stuff irritates the sorts of conservatives now backing Cain. They were hit with it throughout 2009. In 2010, after a Capitol Hill rally to stop the health care bill, Carson and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus accused them of using racist insults; people like Breitbart fought for weeks to get stories about this debunked and retracted. Now they can point to polls that show them backing Herman Cain. ""They made these charges that the Tea Party was racist, or Astroturf, or gun nuts, or all the other pejoratives,"" says Sal Russo of the Tea Party Express. ""The charges were all bogus."" But maybe the Tea Party shouldn't be so cheery, says Christopher Parker. He's an associate professor of political science at the University of Washington. In 2010, he was the lead investigator on an academic study of the Tea Party and race. The academics surveyed 117 ""true believers"" of the movement, alongside hundreds of ""true skeptics,"" people with mixed opinions, and people who didn't know about the movement. Parker found that Tea Partiers held generally more negative views of blacks and Hispanics, measured in a number of ways. One of Parker's test statements was: ""Irish, Italians, Jewish, and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without special favors."" Seventy percent of all white people in the study agreed; 88 percent of Tea Partiers agreed. Another statement: ""If blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites."" Fifty-six percent of all white people agreed, and 73 percent of Tea Partiers. These are the kind of sentiments that Cain has voiced as he's been asked about race. ""He has an inspiring story,"" says Parker. It doesn't change the study's conclusions. ""Just because you have one person who can be an exception to your view doesn't mean the view is blunted,"" says Parker. ""He can be seen as an exceptional negro who defies stereotypes. A group may have less charitable opinions about race, but there are always going to be a few token black folks who they like. Herman Cain just happens to be the token this time."" This is the ivory tower version of a debate older than Booker T. Washington--a debate that won't be over even if Cain surprises us. In 2007 and 2008, black news sites and politics blogs were all over the rise of Barack Obama. In 2011, the rise of Cain is treated like an oddity. ""Don't get fooled by that tap-dancing he's doing for white Republicans,"" writes Brentin Mock at Loop21, introducing a list of silly stories from Cain's autobiography. ""He is way blacker then he's cared to admit on the campaign trail."" At Jack and Jill Politics, Anson Asaka calls the candidate ""Uncle Herman Cain,"" and says his lack of interest in civil rights issues disqualifies him as a credible leader. ""He stayed in his place,"" writes Asaka, ""at the back of the bus."" This is a sentiment that Steele understands pretty well. ""Anyone who sits up here and thinks, 'Let's put Herman Cain against Barack Obama and we'll win,' is so stupid that he should sit in his cellar and play around on the Internet or something,"" says Steele. ""Voters are more sophisticated than that. Come on, now: Do you think black folks got up the day after I was elected and said, 'Oh my God, there's a black Republican Party chairman! I've got to join the Republicans!'"" Steele laughs at the idea. ""They're not saying 'Herman Cain is on the rise, let's take a second look at that party!' People aren't like that."""

Nobody seriously expected thousands of people to hit the streets (or camp on them) for weeksand protest the rotten economy, growing inequality, and the shifty titans of finance. But there were people who tried to make it happen, and there are people who've found themselves swept in by the tide. Here's a guide to Slate's coverage of Occupy Wall Street. The timeline, which will be updated, tracks the origins of the movement from some wishful op-eds to actual arrests. The glossary explains the terms and the players. This diagram maps the intersection between #OWS and the Tea Party. Elsewhere in Slate: Heather Murphy compiles the photos from the surprise eviction of protestors at Zuccotti Park. David Weigel explains how a 78-year-old retiree could help the Koch Bothers battle OWS. Joseph E. Stiglitz says Occupy protestors are part of a worldwide movement against inequality. Eliot Spitzer offers some advice for protestors pondering their next move. Beverly Gage urges occupiers to take a cue from organized labor at the turn of the 20th century. KJ Dell'Antonia considers whether Occupy Wall Street is a teachable moment for children. David Weigel chronicles Republican attempts to answer anti-Wall Street protestors. Dahlia Lithwick explains how the movement confuses and ignores media pundits. David Weigel reports that the Occupy movement found its footing in Las Vegas. Simon Doonan documents the deliriously diverse fashion trends at Zuccotti Park. Dahlia Lithwick says protestors angry at the Supreme Court have more to worry about than Citizens United. Dahlia Lithwick offers legal guidelines for protestors trying to avoid getting arrested. Anne Applebaum questions just how democratic the Occupy movement really is. Heather Murphy gives you the photo quiz: Occupier or Tea Partier? Annie Lowrey asks if the Occupiers have a point about the 1 percent. David Weigel spends two days in New York watching the Occupiers in action. Eliot Spitzer says the movement has already won. Annie Lowrey introduces the 53 Percenters, the would-be neo-Tea Party anti-Occupy movement. Jacob Weisberg compares and contrasts the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.  If you want to watch a Tea Partier turn red-faced and start smashing things, compare his movement to Occupy Wall Street. ""We here at the Tea Party Express find those comparisons to be insulting,"" wrote that group's spokeswoman, Amy Kremer, in a jeremiad/fundraising appeal. ""Their motivations, their behavior and their disrespect for the principles that made this country great could not stand in starker contrast to ours."" The feeling isn't mutual. Many Occupiers think that their nascent movement should have started years ago. Van Jones, the former White House adviser who's trying to build a left-wing Tea Party, has welded together the two movements in a series of speeches. With Occupy Wall Street, he has said, Obama-era liberals have gone from ""hopey to mopey"" and finally captured the oomph that the Tea Party used to have. How much do the movements actually have in common? The Venn diagram below plots the concerns, allies, heroes, and inspirations of the two movements. It illustrates where and how they intersect, and which of them have opposite, anti-matter versions on the other side."	Everything You Need To Know About Occupy Wall Street
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/herman_cain_s_9_9_9_plan_it_has_a_long_republican_pedigree_.html	"Now that he's a top-tier candidate, Herman Cain's rivals are patting him down, looking for his Achilles' heel. They think they've found it: his ""9-9-9 plan."" In Tuesday night's economy-centric debate, the GOP's also-rans temporarily stopped eating Cain's dust to call 9-9-9 not ""doable"" (Jon Huntsman); a ""sales tax"" (Rick Santorum); and the Satanic inspiration of the fallen one, Lucifer Morningstar, (Michele Bachmann, roughly paraphrased). Here's what 9-9-9 actually is. Seven weeks ago, speaking before a packed house at Hudson's Barbeque in Lexington, S.C., Cain announced a simple plan to replace the current tax code. Step one: Replace it with a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent business tax, and a 9 percent sales tax. Step two: After this works, ""amidst a backdrop of the economic boom created by the Phase 1 Enhanced Plan,"" replace those taxes with a national consumption tax of 23 percent. You can see why Cain's rivals are sputtering, disbelieving, and uncomprehending about this. They may try, as Santorum has tried, to describe how 9-9-9 will raise taxes for millions of people, and wait for Republican voters to digest that news and reject Cain. The evidence will back them up. The politics might not. Cain, who's been pitching some version of this plan for seven years, is taking advantage of a deep-running conservative angst about taxes. Conservatives want taxes to be simple. They want them to be fair. If other Republicans didn't see the 9-9-9 craze coming, they haven't been paying attention. Every 16 years, every time a rebuilt Republican Party is trying to unseat a Democratic president, it has to deal with some existential new tax reform concept. In 1980, Ronald Reagan ran on a supply-side tax cut devised by economists that Washington didn't respect and that was derided by the man who eventually became Reagan's vice president. In 1995, magazine tycoon Steve Forbes entered the Republican primaries and spent about $60 million to push one message: The country should have a flat tax rate, no deductions, on income above $36,000. ""The flat tax is simply a means to an end to enable people to keep more of what they earn,"" he said, ""remove barriers to investment, so the economy can grow."" This is basically what Cain is promising now. Reagan won. Forbes didn't. Cain probably won't win. And yet all three plans evolved from similar-looking piles of primordial goop. Reagan's tax plan followed the 1978 taxpayer's revolt in California. Forbes' plan--admittedly, a version of an idea that had been kicking around think tanks and the Jerry Brown campaign--followed on the 1994 GOP landslide. Cain's plan, a remix of the 12-year-old ""Fair Tax,"" is taking off for the same reason he became a viable candidate in the first place: The Tea Party, having taken over the Republican Party, wants to keep the revolution going. That's why Republicans are having some trouble talking the idea back into the cellar. It doesn't really matter that the idea came from accountant and Cain adviser Rich Lowrie, and not from a trained economist. Re-watch Tuesday's debate: This is an electorate that cheers when candidates talk about the crimes of Ben Bernanke. This is a campaign in which Mitt Romney (J.D., MBA, Harvard) attacks Barack Obama for listening to ""the Harvard faculty lounge."" Republican voters don't hear ""untrained economist"" and think ""lousy plan."" There's more: They don't hear ""sales tax"" and immediately think they're going to get treated unfairly. All year, conservative voters have insisted that the tax code is unfair because not enough people pay taxes. In a post-debate interview on Bloomberg TV, right after she'd attacked Cain's plan, Bachmann repeated her belief that ""everybody"" should pay taxes, and that it was unfair that 47 percent of Americans ended up paying no net federal income tax. That's a strange sort of populist sentiment in the GOP right now, seen most recently in the WeArethe53% Tumblr of personal stories that RedState.com's Erick Erickson set up to mock Occupy Wall Street activists. The Republican voters who love 9-9-9 believe the same things that the old Forbes devotees believed. They believe that other Americans are paying no net income taxes, and they don't think it's fair. They know how much time they have to spend figuring out all of their deductions, and so a simple code--Forbes promised a tax form that could fit on a postcard--would solve their problem. Cain got a handle on that sentiment early, using it in this ad for his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia in 2004. ""The United States tax code,"" he said. ""It's an 8-million-word mess!"" Cain's rivals have to engage in a little bit of deprogramming. They must convince voters who think that the tax code is stacked against them of the truth: That complicated code is wasting some time while saving a lot of money. After the debate, NBC News' Domenico Montanaro checked one of Cain's claims--that a family pulling in $50,000 currently pays $10,000 in taxes. As Cain would say, the problem with that analysis is that it's incorrect. With the grab bag of deductions left in place by Bush and Obama reforms, that family pays $766 in taxes. According to the professional rain-on-parade economist Bruce Bartlett, the first stage of 9-9-9 would do what it sounds like--it would increase the cost of living for poor people by 9 percent. Either Cain is right, and the supercharged economy would bail them out, or Cain is wrong, and they'll be worse off than ever. So how has Cain gotten so far on this idea? ""It's a rejection of redistributionist tax policy,"" says Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, who is doing his gentle best to point out that 9-9-9's a bad idea. ""No one has done the calculations, so people are reacting viscerally to the idea. A single rate flat tax is a very attractive thing."" It's attractive because it tells conservative voters what they already believe: Tax the free-loaders, simplify the forms, and the rest of the problems take care of themselves. To take Cain down, Republicans have to blow up the anti-tax arguments of 30 years."	"Why Republicans Are Having Such a Hard Time Dismissing Herman Cain's Goofy 9-9-9- Plan

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/mormon_controversy_pastor_robert_jeffress_may_be_doing_mitt_romn.html	"Mitt Romney should send Texas pastor Robert Jeffress a gift. It could be a fruit basket, or an e-card, or a bottle of nonalcoholic scotch. Really, whatever Romney thinks is appropriate. If the Great Mormon Debate of 2011 had to happen--and it did--the candidate couldn't ask for a better instigator than a guy with the gravitas of a jug band soloist and the tact of a Laugh Factory heckler. I watched it happen and almost knew how it would end. Before Rick Perry's big Friday speech to the Values Voter Summit, a Jeffress accomplice scuttled around the press seats, passing out his remarks, in which the pastor from First Baptist Dallas would plead for the nomination of ""a genuine follower of Jesus Christ."" After Romney spoke (a fine speech, not that anyone remembers it), Jeffress hung around offstage, available to roving mobs of reporters. He called Romney ""a member of a cult"" and said ""the idea that Mormonism is a cult is not some fringe conservative idea."" The pastor hung out for hours, taking cell phone calls, doing live TV hits, repeating the word ""cult"" a few times every minute. Jeffress used his moment to create a substance heretofore unknown to nature: sympathy for Mitt Romney. The pastor was condemned almost immediately by people as diverse as James Fallows (""anti-Mormonism is bigotry"") and Bill Bennett (""do not give voice to bigotry""). In his summit speech, right after warning of ""a race war declared by the New Black Panther Party,"" Glenn Beck summoned his famous tears and said, ""I am a proud member of the Church of Jesus Christ""--aka, a Mormon. The Romney religious question has been brought into the race as a vaudeville routine, with a cartoon villain that everyone can agree to hate. It's the best the candidate could have hoped for. Any other way, this issue is a loser for him. Romney's problem: math. Voters are less comfortable with the idea of a Mormon president than they are with the idea of a Hispanic president, or a Jewish president, or--we have some proof now--a black president. In a July Gallup poll, 22 percent of Americans said they wouldn't vote for a Mormon. It was the second highest ""nuh-uh"" number since Gallup started asking the question in 1967, when Romney's father was exploring a run. That poll shows that, while Jeffress' marathon reporter rap session was clumsy and bigoted, his statements were merely a reflection of how acceptable anti-Mormon sentiment  is. Mormons consider themselves to be Christians. Many Christians don't buy it. Mormonism is different enough from orthodox Christianity, from the belief that Christ started to atone in Gethsemane to the belief that he will return to Missouri, that a mainline Methodist or Catholic or Baptist can't honestly say that the religions are all the same. At the Values Voter Summit, which put 3,000 mostly Christian activists in a few rooms for reporters to survey, this was the common take. Opinions differed between total agreement with the ""cult"" idea--""that's just true!"" said a home-schooled student named Samuel Barton--and technical disagreements that conceded Jeffress' point. ""There is nothing that is traditionally Christian about Mormonism,"" said William Temple, the ""Tea Party Patriot"" and pastor who dresses as a Revolutionary War figure and ends up in the photo shoots of every major conservative event. ""When [Romney] says, or when anyone says, 'a belief in God,' my question as a pastor is: What God?"" He explained this at length: Romney's foes have been more diplomatic while saying, basically, the same thing. ""I'm not running for theologian-in-chief,"" snapped Herman Cain in a Sunday CNN interview. Rick Santorum went for the take-him-at-his-word defense on Romney. ""He says he's a Christian,"" said Santorum on Fox News. ""I believe he said Christian. I'm not an expert on Mormonism."" These are completely fair answers. Saying you don't know if Romney is a Christian isn't like saying you don't know if Barack Obama was born in the United States. It's like saying you don't know if Barack Obama thinks he's a better writer than Jack Kerouac. You can't answer ""yes."" The answer is probably ""no."" Electing Mitt Romney in 2012 would mean electing, for the first time, a president whose religion is not part of orthodox Christianity. Romney was always going to have to deal with this. Mormonism will be up for debate in a way that no mainline Christian's candidate ever will be. That's the price of trying to become a presidential first. That's why Jeffress has made Romney's job easier. Mormonism has emerged as an issue because a bigot brought it up. The pastor has taken something that liberals were comfortable worrying about--they've homed in on Mormon opposition to gay marriage and highlighted how the now-fading Glenn Beck was shaped by the religion--and pre-defined it as kooky hate speech. He's not going to stop doing that--he even used his Sunday sermon to do it. All that does is remind Mormon-skeptics that the leading critics of the faith are the sort of people who call Islam an ""evil, evil religion"" that inspires pedophilia and murder. Who wants to team up with that? When Barack Obama started running for president, some pundits were convinced that his race was going to hurt him. If it didn't hurt him explicitly, it was going to show up on Election Day, because an alleged ""Bradley Effect"" would make voters tell pollsters they were fine with a black candidate, right before they voted against him. It didn't happen. Republican strategists are convinced that Obama's race and the promise of casting a history-making, bigotry-erasing vote helped him win, and kept the media from going too hard on some of his associations. There's no feeling quite like that for Romney, or for Mormons. It has to be manufactured. The independents and conservatives who don't like Mormonism have to get sick about who else feels this way. In 2008, Mike Huckabee was mostly clever enough to hint at Romney's religion without sounding like a hater. He was no Robert Jeffress. If Romney eventually overcomes his ""Mormon problem,"" he'll have Jeffress to thank."	"Mormon Controversy: Pastor Robert Jeffress May Be Doing Mitt Romney A Favor By Bashing Mormonism

Reporters poked him to let off a little steam over AIG bonuses. There were calls again during the BP oil spill. Now Obama gets mad all the time. On Tuesday, he called out House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Last Saturday, the venue was the Congressional Black Caucus dinner. Claiming Republicans don't want to pass anything that would give the president a victory, he has taken to saying: ""Give me a win? Give me a win? Give me a break."" The most hopeful presidential campaign in a generation is likely to be followed by the most depressing one. The domestic economic situation is bad. The European collapse means things are likely to get worse. The political reality is just as ugly. Congress can barely meet the minimum requirements of the office--keeping the government running--and both the Republicans and Democrats look like they're going to run catastrophe campaigns: ""Elect the other guy,"" they say, ""and we can't be responsible for the calamities that ensue."" The choice will be between deepening the disaster the president has put you in and the disaster a Tea Party-controlled Republican president will visit on you. Great. Republicans have been hitting the president since his first month. They get him coming and going. He is both a feckless blob incapable of solving the current economic crisis and a hyperactive liberal whose unprecedented market-meddling is forcing America into ruin. Obama is not just a bad president, but a threat to the viability of the American experiment. That's what these sustained discussions of American exceptionalism are about. For his part, Obama didn't start out the year with such a grim approach. He wanted to Win the Future! That's what his State of the Union speech was about. Americans can do anything! He used to drop the WTF phrase in every speech. It sounded almost like the successor slogan to Change You Can Believe In. Now he says it less frequently. (The last time was Sept. 26.) He still talks about a promising future, but he brings in the dark clouds for the more powerful appeal: America is under threat. The most notable use of this idea was born in his critique of Rep. Paul Ryan's budget. He said it would lead to a ""fundamentally different America."" Now the charge shows up more frequently. In the fights over his jobs package, he says the GOP threatens the ""quintessentially American idea"" that everyone should pay his fair share. When Republican candidates failed to condemn the booing of a gay soldier at a recent presidential debate, he used the occasion to remind Americans that ""we don't believe in a small America."" Speaking to a joint session of Congress recently, he said the Republican vision is ""not the story of America."" Monday the president's campaign released a memo about Obama's possible Republican opponents. Whoever wins the GOP nomination, the president's team is going to put him in a three-cornered hat. ""The campaign to win the Republican nomination has become a campaign to win the hearts and minds of the tea party,"" wrote the president's campaign press secretary. This may rally the base, but it may also be attractive to highly educated swing voters if Obama can make the case that it is Republicans who are posing the threat. That's why it's helpful to paint the party by its most extreme elements now, as they play out in the carnival of the primary--to define the party before Republicans pick a less threatening candidate like Mitt Romney. The Tea Party is unpopular. Congressional Republicans are unpopular. A leading GOP candidate doesn't believe in climate science or evolution. The accumulation of negative data ""frightens a lot of voters who are open to the Republican economic message and have gone cold on Obama,"" argues one veteran Democratic strategist. Or, as another party veteran put it, the strategy is to: ""win ugly."" This may be the president's best option, because as he demonstrated this week, it's impossible to give a satisfying answer to the question Ronald Reagan posed in 1980: Are you better off? Winning ugly isn't uncommon in politics. But this campaign could be a long way from the one Obama ran in 2008, promising to change the political system. Republicans will spend the next 14 months reminding him of that. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie adopted the ""more in sorrow than in anger"" tone last week as he read Obama's past statements about lowering partisanship. In responding to the president's hard line on his jobs bill, Republican lawmakers ask him to drop his ""my way or the highway approach,"" the same cliche he used to toss at them. The president and GOP candidates will still talk about optimism and big plans for the future. This is required rhetoric for an American politician. But it's not optimism for its own sake; it's just another bedrock American virtue under threat of a bad election result. This isn't new--even the ever optimistic Reagan was a pessimist when he needed to be in the 1980 campaign, talking about the Carter economy and the threat from the Soviets. It seems wrong to end a piece on the shriveled state of optimism on a gloomy note. So an optimist might argue that the election might seem darkest now because one of the unofficial competitions of any primary is to mint increasingly baroque denunciations of the incumbent. Michele Bachmann announced she wants to impeach Obama. The eventual Republican nominee will have to embrace optimism at some point--even if it's just a little detour from the main plan like a policy speech on education. When will president Obama leave off railing? That's harder to say. He doesn't have many options."	"Why the 2012 Presidential Race Could Be the Most Depressing Campaign Ever

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/chris_christie_announces_he_s_not_running_republicans_may_contin.html	"It was the strangest case of autocorrect in history. Chris Christie kept saying, ""No,"" but Republican dreamers in green rooms and board rooms kept hearing, ""Please ask me again."" On Tuesday the New Jersey governor finally put an end to the requests that he run for president.  ""New Jersey, whether you like it or not you're stuck with me,"" he said at a packed press conference from the state capital. And now back to our regular programming, the ""Romney and Not Romney"" show. For those just tuning in, the role of Not Mitt Romney is being played for this half-hour by Herman Cain, who replaced Rick Perry, who inherited the role from Michele Bachmann. Christie could have been the most successful Not Romney to date, but as it turns out, he prefers the role of Not Running. Team Romney was so happy that when they got early word they called major donors to let them know. The campaign can now reach out to those who had been awaiting Christie's decision. The Republican race for the presidency is now set. There may be more guest appearances, but the nominee is going to come from the current cast. Despair was the emotion animating the Christie candidacy, which wasn't so much a shadow campaign as a zombie campaign. No matter how many times Christie tried to kill the movement, it reappeared, enlivened by pundits, party insiders in the thrall of blunt talk, and an unsettled field. There is an unresolved feeling about Romney. He is atop the polls again, but three-quarters of the voters say they want someone else. Even the majority of his supporters say they could still change their mind. But there's no alternative for the conservatives who think Romney isn't one of them, or for those who might like Romney but want a little more pep in their candidate. Perry is in free-fall, his poll numbers plummeting, beset by troubles of his own making and out of left field. Cain has captured the imagination of a segment of the party, risen in the polls, but seems more like a boomlet--a crowd favorite lacking discipline or organization. This isn't unusual. Voters like to have a say in the matter of who the presidential candidate is. This was true even when Ronald Reagan--yes, Ronald Reagan--ran in 1980. Republicans didn't just coronate him. They gave George H.W. Bush victories in Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Then, when Bush ran for president in 1988, the party that supposedly picks the person whose turn it is chose someone other than the sitting vice president in the Iowa caucuses. The nominating process is messy. The Christie boomlet was therapy for those who couldn't handle the uncertainty. It was not a groundswell. A CBS poll shows that only 32 percent of those who said they would vote in a Republican primary wanted a Christie run, while 38 percent did not. In a Washington Post poll, 42 percent want him to run. Poll respondents didn't know him that well, which accounts for those low numbers, but it would have been a challenge for him to define himself in such a short period of time before the first contest. Christie had been a firm ""no"" throughout the months of courtship. A group of longtime New York and New Jersey Republican money-men promised to give him instant cash. He talked about running with everyone from George W. Bush to Henry Kissinger to Nancy Reagan. All were reportedly encouraging. In one of these conversations Christie left the impression he was seriously considering a run. The volume of the entreaties is what made him reconsider. At his press conference he told the story of a Nebraska farmer who sent a Fed Ex to Christie's children, telling them to let their father off the hook about missing games and not spending time with them if he ran. At one point, he said, in the middle of the night, his wife told him: ""If you want to run, go for it. Don't worry about me and the kids."" If he'd decided to run, perhaps Christie could have overcome his soft poll numbers. But conversations with party activists suggest he would have gotten a frosty reception. He held moderate positions on such issues as immigration and civil unions. He would have had to defend these while simultaneously building a fundraising organization and political operation. Plus, the instincts that made Christie attractive as a governor might have been hard to translate. Blunt talk may work in New Jersey, or in Texas, but as Perry's campaign is proving, it doesn't always translate well to the national stage. (Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana worried this issue might have doomed his candidacy.) Lamar Alexander, a governor who twice ran for president, has said the difference between campaigning statewide and campaigning nationally is the difference between ""playing in your backyard versus playing in the NBA."" In addition to the many logistical and political hurdles to the Christie candidacy, there were conceptual issues. One of the chief Republican complaints against President Obama is that he lacked experience--but Christie has served a shorter amount of time as governor of New Jersey than Obama did as senator from Illinois before he ran for president. Another chief complaint against Obama is that he just mouths pretty words. When I talked to Republicans about why they like Christie, they almost always mentioned his style of speaking. Of course, Sarah Palin still circles the field--but it's too late, especially with the Iowa caucuses now possibly 35 days earlier than originally scheduled. Besides, her poll numbers are abysmal, with 66 percent of Republicans saying they don't want her to run, in a recent ABC/Washington Post poll. Any more flirtations or late candidacies run the risk of making the party look ridiculous and wasting more energy on what is essentially an intramural feud in a year when Republicans have of a very good chance of winning the presidency. In the end, Christie's decision shows prudence and restraint, although he did go on--his press conference lasted almost an hour and was so chatty it seemed he might dandle one of the members of the press on his knee. He whacked Obama for his lack of leadership, helping the eventual GOP nominee, and repeatedly he praised his own state, using the occasion of turning down a chance at presidential power as an opportunity to build his power base as governor. These are wise moves showing political and strategic savvy. Let the speculation commence: Christie 2016, anyone?"	Now That Chris Christie Is Really, Truly, Absolutely Not Running, Republicans Will Have To Make Their Peace With Mitt...

I told him I knew the quickest way to the second-ever Tea Party Debt Commission hearing. I was wrong. As we wander around the strip-mall blight near the Orange County Convention Center, squeezing past some bushes and generators, I begin to worry I have led us astray. Then I see the ads for the ""Mac 'n Cheese Patty Melt."" This is the place. Today's hearing is taking place at Denny's, where there is already a heavy crowd looking at menus and glancing at a flat-screen TV. I take a seat next to members of Frederick Douglass Republicans, African-American conservatives with shirts that read ""FDR: Not the one you're thinking of!"" We chat for a little while about whether a Gingrich/Cain or a Cain/Gingrich ticket would be better for Republicans. ""We were hoping we'd get 50 people!"" says a beaming Brendan Steinhauser, FreedomWorks' director of state campaigns. Clearly, we're going to have an overflow. A harried waitress picks up orders (""Give her a great tip!"" says Steinhauser), and the program begins. Matt Kibbe, the mutton-chopped president of Freedom Works, starts by saying the first grassroots debt hearing, in Utah, was a huge success, with 300 attendees. ""We spent three hours talking about some pretty substantial budget issues, stuff your member of Congress probably doesn't even know about,"" he says. ""That's where we're going. We've got to push these budget issues for ourselves."" It's been two years since FreedomWorks sponsored a massive Taxpayer March on Washington, the mega-event that inspired the rest of the media to cover the Tea Party as much as Fox News did. A 2010 version of the march was markedly smaller. There was no attempt to repeat it in 2011. This is what FreedomWorks is doing instead: Trying to show Tea Partiers that they can be even more successful if they get seriously wonky. Dean Clancy, the dry legislative counsel of FreedomWorks, has to do the heavy lifting. He loads a PowerPoint presentation onto the flat screen, talking activists through a history of the debt crisis. First up are the ""traditional rules of fiscal discipline."" They are: Limit spending, tax lightly, keep borrowing to a minimum, and maintain a surplus to pay off debt. ""Keynesian economics reverses every one of these principles,"" explains Clancy. The activists take notes. No one appears to need convincing. Clancy lays out the goals of the Tea Party commission, which contrast nicely with the Deficit Supercommittee, the lame D.C. pretender. The supercommittee wants to cut $1.2 trillion over 10 years; FreedomWorks wants to cut $9 trillion. The supercommittee wants the status quo, but smaller; FreedomWorks wants to balance the budget. The only other plan out there that balances the budget is Sen. Rand Paul's. ""Our favorite,"" Clancy explains. ""He balanced the budget by 2016. He does it by getting rid of four federal departments: Energy, HUD ..."" The rest of the departments are drowned out by applause. The presentation continues. ""What drives our debt?"" asks Clancy. His chart shows that it's health care spending, represented by a red line zooms upward like some supervillain's escape pod out of an underground lair. It's a persistent problem, and it needs to be attacked with spending cuts. The chart explains: ""Outlays are currently 25 percent of GDP. Therefore, we cannot balance the budget by raising taxes."" The movement must be ready. Failing to make the case that entitlements must be cut--something that some activists are slow to admit--is going to lead, down the line, to more taxes. We see four points summing this up."	"The Tea Party Debt Commission Hearing--at Denny's

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/the_christie_shuffle.html	"Round and round the speculation has swirled over whether New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will jump into the presidential race. After his speech  Tuesday night, only one conclusion is possible: Chris Christie is not running for president until such time as he decides he will run for president, which he might announce in a sentence that abuts a previous one denying that he's running for president. Twice he was asked about his intentions. Once he seemed to say he wasn't running. The second time he suggested he was considering it. The effect could only have been improved if he had spoken while circling a mulberry bush. I wish Chris Christie would run. He's promising truth telling, detailed solutions to problems like entitlement growth, tax reform and foreign entanglemetns-- all of it delivered in an entertaining package. Candidates usually make stiff declarations about how honest and direct they're going to be while planning to be nothing of the kind. It would be a service and entertaining to see someone give it an actual try. It also might smoke out the other Republican candidates into venturing a few plain statements or at least fleeing with less haste from their previous ones. Would Christie run a campaign as bold as the one he promised Tuesday night in his forceful and wide-ranging address at the Regan Library? Here's how he says he's done it in New Jersey: ""It is a simple but powerful message-lead on the tough issues by telling your citizens the truth about the depth of our challenges.  Tell them the truth about the difficulty of the solutions.  This is the only effective way to lead in America during these times."" Later, in his call for strong leadership he said one of America's greatest challenges was ""to not become a country that places comfortable lies ahead of difficult truths.""Christie's reputation for blunt talk about everything from deficits to unions and telling off those who challenge him is what's creating the presidential buzz, so he has the aptitude. But in handling the buzz he's not exactly being a straight shooter. When asked if he was running, Christie directed the audience to a Politico video compilation of his many denials. This seemed to close the door, though not all the way which was the kind of too cute behavior you'd hope someone like Chris Christie stand up and lampoon. But then a woman stood and implored the governor to run for president with such passion it seemed like she might come to tears. ""I mean this with all my heart,"" she said. ""Please, sir, reconsider. Go home and really think about it. Please. Do it for my daughter, do it for our grandchildren, do it for our sons. Please, sir, your country needs you to run for president."" Christie responded: ""I thank you for what you're saying and I take it in and I'm listening to every word of it and feeling it. It's extraordinarily flattering, but by the same token, that heartfelt message you gave me is also not a reason for me to do it. That reason has to reside inside me."" He never said no. This suggests two options: he's either a phony truth-teller who has made up his mind and isn't being straight with the waoman or he's genuinely taking in what she says and still considering it. But if he's genuinely having a think then why in his first answer did he point everyone to the Politico video? Why not just play it on the level, especially after a speech that talked about leadership and hard truths. The second answer should have been the first answer. There are lots of reasons for Christie to engage in this gentle deception. It's probably smart for him to be playing it the way he is. Coyness and shading and diversions are a requirement of campaigns and successful politics. But it's a reminder that promises of honesty are limited. Equally limited is the ability to change Congress and partisanship through the power of effective speaking. Both of these limitations were embedded in Christie's speech which, like the Obama speeches of 2008, was full of moving promises and bromides that fire the imagination into thinking problems can be solved from behind a magical lectern. Christie received a standing ovation which shows the audience liked the forceful advocacy for the notion of hard truths, but tells us nothing about whether they really want to hear the real thing. They might be happy to leave it at stirring and vague. If Christie ran, he would be our third truth-telling candidate of this cycle. The first was Tim Pawlenty. He wasn't in the race long enough to test the theory. (His position on ethanol doesn't count). Rick Perry is the second self-styled truth-teller and boy is he paying for it. The biggest problem is the one he caused himself with his blunt language. He said anyone who thought the children of undocumented workers didn't deserve an education ""didn't have a heart."" Sharp. From the gut. It was Christie-like statement, and according to the rules outlined in the Candid Candidate Handbook, it's the kind of direct talk voters are supposed to like even if they don't agree with it. What did Perry get for his frank expression? It made him a target for plain-speaking Christie who singled out Perry among the GOP field in his speech. He didn't call him out by name but after disagreeing with his policy said ""let me be very clear from my perspective: That is not a heartless position that is a commonsense position."" Christie proved that when you speak out, as Perry did, it makes you a target. Your opponents attack you and so do powerful forces like Christie who aren't even in the race. That's what makes candidates tentative, or dooms those that say anything mildly close to honest. This is why Mitch Daniels jokes his campaign might have been over almost before it started. Actually speaking your mind is dangerous. Christie could announce his campaign and pay no price for reversing his position. Obama said he wasn't going to run before he decided to. Christie could also point to the woman at the Reagan library and the others who have begged him to run and say the groundswell helped him change his mind. Every candidate tries to claim there is a movement of yearning citizens behind calling them to the contest. Christie can roll the videotape. He just has to hope that he lives up to the posture he put forward in his speech or his opponents will roll the videotape too. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/rick_perry_has_a_heart.html	"ORLANDO, Fla.--The six and a half minutes Rick Perry spent talking about immigration at the Fox News/Google debate form the Zapruder film of his sudden political collapse. It replayed all weekend in the amygdalas of Florida Republicans. When you walked the halls and skywalks of the Orange County Convention Center, or the Peabody Hotel, or the Hilton, you heard the key quotes repeated back verbatim, with disbelief. Republicans decided that Perry had blown it. Texas' law that let the children of illegal immigrants pay discounted in-state tuition was just indefensible. In their defense, Perry made minced dog chow out of the question. He channeled the spirit of Christopher Darden, asking Rick Santorum if he had ever even been to the border (he had) and pointing out that ""only four"" legislators had dissented from the tuition scheme. ""This was a state issue,"" he said. ""Texans voted on it. And I still support it greatly."" Perry was arrogant and alienating and had no clue why this was backfiring on him. You can understand his misunderstanding. Perry started to rise as a national figure when he joined the Tea Party and preached the doctrine of Texan exceptionalism. He raised the specter of secession (or maybe nullification) because of Washington's tendency to ""thumb their nose at the American people."" He wrote a whole book,  Fed Up!, full of ways to devolve Washington's powers to Austin, Boston, Bismarck, and the rest of them. ""States can be free to experiment with different ideas to deal with societal concerns and problems,"" writes Perry, ""and they can do so at a level closer to the people so that those particular trials can match the morals and beliefs of the people most affected."" This is what the Republican base says it believes. There should be no ""one size fits all"" health care plan; the states should form compacts to determine their own policies; the EPA should be shrunk small enough to be drowned in a bathtub full of fracking fluid. And yet, this is not quite what the Republican base believes. For months, it was Mitt Romney and his insistence that Massachusetts' health care mandate was a state issue. Now, it's Perry and the college kids. Michael Williams, the Texas railroad commissioner who's single-handedly bringing back the bowtie, had the unwelcome task of speaking on Perry's behalf before the Florida straw poll. He accepted the premise that Perry hadn't explained the law very well. ""I've had extra days to think about it!"" said Williams. And anyway, Perry was right. ""The federal government has wholly failed to control our border,"" he said, ""so as a consequence we're going to have noncitizens who are residents of our state. We want people to come to America, because as John Paul II said, we are the continent of hope."" After the voting stopped, I asked Republican delegates why Perry was wrong. Only occasionally did they agree that immigration laws could be left up to states. ""What people don't understand is that Texans do it their way,"" said Duke Wade, a crestfallen Perry-backing delegate from Sarasota. ""People get all bent out of shape, but all Perry is saying is, 'We want to make sure that these kids, they're good citizens.' They're working on being good citizens. He didn't quite adequately explain in the debate."" According to a Rasmussen Reports released last month, 81 percent of voters said they opposed the idea of letting noncitizens get in-state tuition rates. That was up from 59 percent in 2007. Most delegates agreed with the nay-sayers. ""So, Perry said it was a state's rights issue,"" huffed Willie Lawson, a delegate from Hillsborough County. ""It would be, if immigrants just stayed in Texas. But they don't! If immigrants stayed in one place, then California could have its policy, and Texas could have its policy. But they leave. People leave."" That was as nuanced as it got. Carol Van Rennen, a delegate from Melbourne, paused an argument she was having about Perry to explain that her grandchildren were having a tough time paying for school. ""The reason why is that all this money is going to illegal immigrants,"" she said. Shelly Foder, a delegate from Lake City, spoke in a staccato to make sure I heard her argument. ""Stop. Giving. To the illegals."" Perry's argument is that he supported a law in Texas that he wouldn't institute nationwide. ""He opposes the national DREAM Act,"" explained Williams. Romney's defense on health care is similar: He supported a law in Massachusetts that he won't support elsewhere. ""I did what I believe was right for the people of my state,"" he said in his air-clearing health care address four months ago. There's no evidence that Republican voters buy this. If they've stopped punishing Romney, it's only because Perry, for now, is a pinata that gives out more candy when you bash him. On Thursday, Romney made a distinctly un-10th Amendment argument against his rival. ""We have to turn off the magnet of extraordinary government benefits,"" he said, ""like a $100,000 tax credit--or, excuse me, discount for going to the University of Texas."" It didn't matter if it was only in one state. President Romney wouldn't let Texans exercise their sovereignty like that. And shortly after Romney said this, Ron Paul got his biggest cheer of the night with a libertarian koan: ""The responsibility of the president would be to veto every single bill that violates the 10th Amendment."" Republicans choose not to marry these two ideas. There are some sound, cynical reasons. The argument Perry leans on--that the federal government's immigration policy doesn't work--is the same one used by the comprehensive-reform crowd. It raises hackles. And they have plenty of politicians to choose from who don't support policies like these, even if the policies are popular and broadly supported in their own states. Still, why was it so hard to find Republicans in Orlando who gave Perry a pass on 10th Amendment grounds? Perry's been clear on this: He thinks the states can do whatever they want, and the federal government should let them carry out every policy in such areas as health care or drug legalization. Republican voters cheered that, right until the policy in question was one they didn't like. This isn't where Perry wanted the 10th Amendment fight to go. Now that we're there, it's pretty revealing."	Rick Perry on immigration: Do Republicans believe in states' rights?

On Tuesday night, Howard Kurtz reported that the former governor of New Mexico would get a podium at the Fox News/Google presidential debate. Other journalists tried to confirm the story with the Johnson campaign. No dice. They called the Florida GOP. Same deal. Not until Wednesday morning, when the governor was in a plane headed to Florida, could the campaign start popping bottles. He started strategizing on Wednesday night. ""Everybody that I've met in my life prior to today emailed me, I think,"" Johnson said. ""Everybody had a suggestion for what I was supposed to do."" The mission: Get taken seriously for once. Johnson was supposed to be the Next Ron Paul of Republican politics. Ron Paul realized that he had gotten pretty good at that job. Johnson impressed nobody at a May debate in South Carolina. He had not debated a political foe since 1998, which led to word-salad answers like this one: ""I'm in the camp that believes that we as individuals, we need a bit of help, so government helps out but at the point at which it runs out, that's when we really deal with the problems that we have and as individuals that's when we deal with those problems."" Candidates who poll around 1 percent are rewarded if they make debates more exciting. Johnson was punished. He missed the cut for every other debate, flunking the ad hoc tests of polling strength, becoming a nonperson. In his last finance report, he had around $6,000 to campaign with. The one Republican who backed legal marijuana, opposed the death penalty, and wanted to cut 43 percent from the military budget had become invisible. Libertarians have more intellectual sway in the Republican Party right now than they've had in ... well, give me a couple hours, and I'll think of another time. Johnson's vanishing act annoyed them. On Wednesday, before I got to Florida, a libertarian friend who owns a comic book store (no jokes!) asked me why Gary Johnson kept getting stiffed in the debates. For the first time, I could say that he wasn't being stiffed. Thursday, as Republican delegates and legislators and hangers-on kibitzed, I ran into FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe. ""Gary Johnson's going to come out swinging,"" he predicted. Then I ran into State Senate President Mike Haridopolos, a mainline conservative Republican, and asked him if he was ready for Johnson. ""What was his name?"" said Haridopolos. ""God bless him for showing up."" Johnson took his place on stage before 9 p.m., ready to swing. When the cameras came to him (thank you, Fox News, for sparing us the action bios and forced introductory quips of the CNN debates), Johnson fed off the energy of an audience packed tight with Ron Paul lovers. He waved to the crowd with a look that said, ""That's right. I made it. I have enough money left in my campaign account to buy a 30-second ad in the 2 a.m. block on this channel--maybe. But I made it."" Over two hours, Johnson would get four questions. This was better than he expected; when he previewed his non-strategy to me, he guessed he'd get ""two and a half."" Every question got the same answer, with a series of lines rearranged like parsley on a plate. ""I think I vetoed more bills than any governor in the country."" (True.) ""I will submit a balanced budget for 2013."" (We may never know.) ""I think the biggest threat to our national security is that we're bankrupt."" (We're not, technically, but this a nice line to co-opt from the Tea Party.) One hour and 44 minutes in, Johnson got his fourth question. It was obviously going to be his last--maybe his last question in this format ever. He deployed a zinger. ""My next door neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel ready jobs than this president."" The candidate who had been kept out of polite society had just told a poop joke on the same stage as the next Republican presidential nominee. It killed. Johnson didn't even try to contain his screw-you grin. When the debate ended, his rivals told him he'd had the best line of the night. Him! The guy who had probably inspired late-night calculus sessions of debate promoters to find a formula that included struggling Jon Huntsman but excluded him. Fox wrapped its live shot and went to instant commentary from Charles Krauthammer. ""That was the best line of the night,"" said Krauthammer, ""and had he said it early on, he might now be a top tier candidate."" Johnson could walk into the spin room as a winner, kind of. Andrew Breitbart was already in there, doing more interviews than half of the candidates' strategists, praising the guy who had barely made it in. ""In my gut I'd vote for Johnson or Cain, because they made me laugh,"" said Breitbart. ""That's the shallow, Hollywood perspective for you."" The governor sat for a TV interview, then confronted a first for the Johnson campaign: a crowd of reporters. The first bites came from foreign press, for whom any presidential candidate's quotes are precious. ""You want to balance the budget, you said,"" offered a Japanese reporter. ""Do you risk becoming a single-issue candidate?"" This was the best problem Johnson had faced in months. The question implied that he was actually a candidate. He answered it. He got a question about momentum, and answered it: ""What if I'm supposed to not even show up in New Hampshire, and I come in fifth?"" He got a question about the death penalty. ""Innocent people have probably been put to death in Texas!"" he said. ""I changed my mind on this issue based on the evidence."" He told the story of a wrongful conviction in New Mexico that spun him around, getting more and more emotive. He offered up more differences with the front-runners. ""I'm glad the military supported 'don't ask, don't tell,' "" he said. ""I'm not a social conservative. I don't want to build a fence on the border."" It was all friendly--who wants to grind a 1 percent candidate down with details?--until a hawkish reporter from a foreign policy pressure group pointed a bulky HD camera at Johnson. ""Sir, the federal government has listed CAIR as a Muslim Brotherhood front group."" ""You know,"" said Johnson, ""this is the first I've heard of it. I probably should have heard of it."" ""Are you familiar with CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations?""""No, I'm not."" Johnson looks perplexed: Why is he being asked this? His interrogator, unsure just how to quiz someone who doesn't know about this, sweats and sputters. ""Uh, OK. Have you heard of the Holy Land Foundation trial, sir? ""No, I have not. I've been to Israel. I've met with Netanyahu. I feel like I have a sense of what's happening there."" The interrogator, sort of desperate, started raising his vocal pitch at the end of his questions. ""The Holy Land Foundation trial is the largest anti-terrorism trial in the United States? They designated 254 groups as unindicted co-conspirators, and are tied to the Muslim Brotherhood?"" Johnson shrugged. ""Based on what you're saying, this is a bad situation."" ""We'd be happy to send you some information,"" said the interrogator, giving up. ""Good! That'd be great."" A Fox News radio reporter tried to bring the conversation back, to humanize Johnson. How did it feel to be excluded from the rest of these cattle calls? ""Do you take it personally?"" the reporter asked. ""Does it hurt you?"" Johnson leaned toward the microphone, left leg forward, as if he were winding up for a pitch. ""If you were in my shoes, you would be hurt,"" he said. ""You would ask, what's going on? Is this the American system? Is this fair? Is this the media? I mean, really?"" Johnson's happy campaign team started applauding. ""I'm in this race because I think I can win. Now, that might sound terribly outrageous."""	Gary Johnson delivers the best line of the GOP debate and becomes a real candidate.
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/fed_up.html	"Here is how the Federal Reserve Board of Governors tells Republicans to shut up:""Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.""Bam!""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.""Pow! Steven Wright wishes he could deadpan like this. In a short statement that surprised few and pleased fewer, the Fed announced that it would purchase $400 billion of treasury securities. It reminded gawkers that it's going to keep printing money to stimulate the economy. That's what other central bankers are doing, and that's what the Fed will do. Inflation isn't a worry. The health of the economy, amid the slow, staggering collapse of confidence in Europe, is a worry. Can this work? If it does, it slightly lowers long-term interest rates, and some people take advantage of that to spend more money. Daniel Gross describes this as ""adding a drop to a full pitcher of water,"" and that's not too cynical. But according to one economics-forecasting firm, the Fed's move could create--sorry, couldinspire hard-working Americans to create--as many as 350,000 jobs. So why did the Fed's move make Republicans so angry? On Monday, the GOP's leaders in the House and Senate sent a letter to Chairman Ben Bernanke asking the Fed to ""resist further extraordinary intervention in the U.S. economy."" The reason: They didn't think the previous rounds of quantitative easing had worked. Also, ""there had been significant concern expressed by Federal Reserve Board Members, academics, business leaders, Members of Congress, and the public."" They really should have stopped before rattling off those last two. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended by both parties, created an independent central bank that could operate outside of politics--i.e., it could do things frowned upon by Congress and the public. The act, as amended in 1977, commands the Fed to promote ""the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."" The message going out from Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, Jon Kyl, and Eric Cantor was: Don't do as you're told. ""You don't want to turn over monetary policy to the whims of political and maybe even populist views of the time,"" says Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the Treasury Department in the George W. Bush administration. ""This criticism from Republicans is way off-base. I think it's evidence of some misunderstanding of the Fed's statutory mandate."" It might be a misunderstanding, or it might just be a flat-out rejection. I'm guessing it's the latter. My evidence: The words coming out of every leading Republican's mouth for the past few months. For convenience's sake, start the story with Rick Perry. The week after he started running for president, he said that ""printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treacherous--or treasonous."" Outraged Republican voters swarmed over to Perry and boosted him to a double-digit poll lead in their primary. Four weeks later, when the candidates debated in Tampa, they one-upped each other and Perry. ""They should be a sound-money Federal Reserve,"" said Rick Santorum. ""That should be their single charter, and that is it."" Herman Cain, who once served on the Kansas City Fed's board of governors, agreed with that: ""The Fed did its job when it was singularly focused on sound money."" Michele Bachmann raised the specter of Nazism by calling TARP ""enabling act legislation"" and dreamed of a Fed ""shrunk back down to such a tight leash that they're going to squeak."" These were some of the least-discussed moments in the debate. No surprise: Republican orthodoxy on the Fed has been moving to the right with sound-barrier-busting speed. And why wouldn't it be? In Fed Up!, his little white book of political musings, Perry argued that ""the Federal Reserve's monetary policy of extremely low interest rates over a long period of time"" was one of the pressure pumps inflating the housing bubble. That's true. It was. Still, it's quite a leap from ""the Fed's made mistakes"" to ""the Fed shouldn't try to boost employment because some people are against it."" The best argument for the Boehner/McConnell/Perry position--at this point, we can safely call it ""the Republican position""--was probably made by John B. Taylor. ""Until very recently,"" Taylor found, ""policy statements and directives from the Fed didn't explicitly mention the 'maximum employment' part of the dual mandate in the Federal Reserve Act. The committee's members preferred to emphasize the goal of price stability and its role in creating strong economic and employment growth."" All true, but how does it relate to the problems of the Great Recession? In previous downturns, like 1980-82 or 1991-92, interest rates were higher and inflation was a greater concern. The Fed says inflation is manageable. Republicans say it's such an incipient problem that the Fed needs to tear up its plans and keep it under control. But there just isn't any evidence that inflation is looming The primal fear of a weak dollar--something no politician claims to favor--is what's behind this Republican demand to fix a nonexistent problem. The reaction to the GOP letter was angry. The reaction to Perry's comments was even angrier. From a political standpoint, this is probably good for Republicans, because they're on the record against a policy that can't do much to boost the economy, and that bet's worked well for them in the Obama era. It might be good for Democrats to understand how deep and existential, and radical, the GOP's critique of the Fed really is. For the Fed, it's a wash. Read the law. It can do whatever it wants."	Republicans may not like it, but the law says the Fed can do whatever it wants.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/this_time_he_really_means_it.html	"The grand bargain is back--and it's angry. President Obama put forward his long-term, $3.6 trillion deficit-reduction plan Monday, and it is patterned on the agreement he nearly reached last summer with his former golfing buddy John Boehner. But this time there was more punch to the plan. The president called for $1.5 trillion in revenue increases, which is $1.5 trillion more than Republicans want. Obama offered the GOP less on Medicare reductions than he had flirted with last summer, too. The entire proposal was delivered in a stern and blunt tone. ""I believe the American middle class, who've been pressured relentlessly for decades, believe it's time that they were fought for as hard as the lobbyists and some lawmakers have fought to protect special treatment for billionaires and big corporations,"" Obama said, referring to Republicans. After the president's speech to the joint session of Congress two weeks ago, the question among his supporters was whether he would keep up the fight. The answer is yes. Obama threatened Republicans that if they didn't pass his $447 billion jobs program, he would make them pay with voters. In his speech Monday, he made it clear that he was not going to cajole as he had in previous negotiations but try more force this time. He was blunt in his threats, including that he would use the veto if Medicare benefits are changed without serious revenue increases from ""the wealthiest Americans."" If he can turn up the heat on Republicans so that it drives them to the negotiating table, fine. If not, he has a campaign issue. The president's argument is based on fairness. He used a variant of fair nine times in his short speech, outpacing his next favorite balance (for those of you keeping score at home). He pitched shared sacrifice: Those who receive government benefits or work for the government would have to do with less, and top earners would have to pitch in more. He called for letting the tax cuts enacted under the Bush administration expire as designed and suggested no millionaire should pay less in taxes than a member of the middle class. ""This is not class warfare, this is math,"" he said. ""The money is going to have to come from someplace."" This mix of taxes and spending reductions to stave off the unavoidable negative effects of record deficits has been recommended by almost every bipartisan group that has tried to come up with a solution, including the president's own Simpson-Bowles commission. But the emphasis on taxes, and the smaller-than-expected approach to entitlement reform, were panned by Republican lawmakers. Liberal groups like Moveon.org and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee were encouraged. Haven't we heard this kind of talk from the president before? Obama's statement had an edge of irritation and frustration identical to the one he showed that night when the grand bargain broke down in late July. The president gives these extended brow-furrowing speeches periodically. His supporters get all excited, then he withdraws or makes a deal with Republicans (as he did with the Bush tax cuts and the debt ceiling), and they get deflated again. It has happened so much during his first term that this sequence of events is in danger of replacing the usual cliche for cruel disappointment, that moment when Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown and he winds up flat on his back. So is it really different this time? One chance that it is: the previous approach didn't work. In the debt ceiling debate, Obama took occasional jabs at Republicans--but mostly he assumed he would appear more reasonable than Republicans. Polls showed that his positions were more popular. Polls also showed that Republicans were the ones people blamed for being obstructionist. Ergo, the president would come out ahead, right? Not so. He won no particular praise after averting a government shutdown in April. After the debt-limit deal was reached, both he and the Republican Congress took a hit. In a recent CBS poll, the congressional Republicans had a 19 percent approval rating. The president's was 43 percent, the lowest of his administration. Obama's harder tone makes the 2012 presidential campaign feel all the more like a Mad Lib with just a blank space for the Republican nominee. (""Blank Space"" is actually the liberal nickname for Rick Perry.) But this strategy doesn't have to be just about getting the president re-elected . His new argument is a greater commitment to a strategy he's tried before: Up the political pressure on Republicans so that they cave. If the president' s new argument causes people to pressure the Republicans in Congress, that could lead to movement where previous strategies have not. That's not likely to happen. Pollsters have a crude rule of thumb: If the president doesn't have an approval rating close to 50 percent, he's not likely to get re-elected. Will Obama's new tone affect his approval rating? He has to shore up Democratic voters, but he is also gambling that voters who are up for grabs will be attracted to--and bother to go out and vote upon--the idea that shared sacrifice and fairness should govern federal policy. The question is whether the president is willing to endure the frantic hours at the end of this game of chicken. The problem has always been that the president can never make good on his threats because he will get blamed for bad outcomes; after all, he's the one who occupies the office where people place their hopes and blame. That's still true. If significant portions of his jobs act don't pass--and the supercommittee fails, raising the likelihood of across-the-board cuts--will he relent or stand firm? This year will end with another familiar game of chicken. The president  hasn't yet threatened to throw his steering wheel out the window, but he's loosening the bolts.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/cnn_republican_presidential_debate_rick_perry_and_mitt_romney_du.html	"LAS VEGAS--In order to give the CNN Western Republican Presidential Debate a regional flair, the network created a horseshoe logo. The candidates went one better. They turned the debate into a Wild West bar fight. It started with a scuffle over Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan, then tipped over tables in a skirmish over Mitt Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts. The candidates talked over each other, their voices escalating. They accused each other of lying. At one testy point, when Romney was lecturing Rick Perry about interrupting, he put his hand on the Texas governor's shoulder. He was trying to provoke him. Watch it, Mitt--he could be packing. But after the townsfolk came out from behind the water barrel and the children were allowed to walk the streets again, what had changed? Not much. This was the most entertaining debate of the eight so far. But the shoving and bickering--while a sign that the first contest is less than three months away--probably didn't change the state of the race: an eventual Romney vs. Perry matchup being interrupted by a Cain interlude. Cain was at the bottom of the first pile-on. Every candidate said his 9-9-9 plan was a bad idea. It would create a national sales tax, a value-added tax, and would hit the poor disproportionately. Cain said these were all ""knee-jerk"" reactions and encouraged people to read the plan on his website. This wasn't an answer but a dodge. He said the criticisms were a case of mixing apples and oranges. ""We are replacing the current tax code with oranges,"" he responded at one point. The whole thing threatened to turn into a fruit salad. (What, no pears?) Romney quipped that because the Cain national sales tax would be added to existing state sales taxes, ""I'm going to be getting a bushel basket that has apples and oranges in it because I've got to pay both taxes."" Cain's answers about his plan should be graded on a curve of his own ambition. Maybe if he were offering a garden-variety economic plan, he could get away with answers no sharper than a throw pillow. But he is talking about a wholesale reform of one of the most contentious and complicated portions of the federal experience at a time when government has never been more sclerotic. He's also promising to do it in 90 days, which is faster than Ronald Reagan passed his tax breaks in 1981. (Oh, he's also going to balance the budget in a year.) It's great to be ambitious. But this is like turning around Godfather's Pizza by promising the pies will make themselves. Cain says he'll be able to pull all of this off because he'll have the support of the people. But not everyone is convinced. The National Review, Newt Gingrich, and The Tax Policy Center aren't nuts, at least not always. Sure, Cain can continue to push his plan. But if he can't do a better job explaining and selling it, he might as well just give in to the notion of a fantasy campaign and promise he'll ride a unicorn in his inaugural parade. None of this may diminish Cain's support, because intensity of support is not necessarily tied to strength of his answers. He didn't do that well defending his plan at the last debate either, and yet his standing improved.  He is the most likable of all the Republican candidates, according to a recent CNN poll. The Gallup poll shows that Republican voters have the most intensely positive view of him--and it's growing. When Cain repeated that he thought the Occupy Wall Street protesters had only themselves to blame, the audience erupted. That sound bite probably did him as much good as his insufficient answers on his tax plan hurt him. Cain also benefited from not being Romney, Rick Santorum, or Perry. Those three were contentious throughout the evening, trading personal attacks and crying foul. At first the attacks on Romney were a group affair. Several took a turn kicking his health care plan. Romney defended it as ably as he has all year. Gingrich gave him a partial assist by saying it was unfair to compare it to Obama's health care plan, then went on to say that Romney had imposed a ""bureaucratic, high-cost system"" on his state. Romney shot back that his plan included an individual mandate that Gingrich had once supported. Romney does his homework. He always had a negative fact to throw back at Perry when the Texas governor went after him. Attacked on his record creating jobs in Massachusetts, he charged that many of the new jobs created in Texas went to illegal immigrants. He also attacked in real time. When Perry interrupted him, Romney suggested that if he wanted to be president he'd need to allow others to talk. ""This has been a tough couple of debates for Rick,"" said Romney at another point. Perry's jaw clenched so tight that if he'd had a piece of coal in there, it'd now be a diamond. Perry had drunk his Red Bull. His first utterance was that he was not a ""conservative of convenience,"" which was a veiled shot at Romney. Romney ""is a very slick guy,"" said Perry's communications director, Ray Sullivan. ""That slickness includes the ability to change positions on a dime."" This is the same point Obama strategist David Axelrod has been making lately. The message was repeated in the press releases from the Perry campaign: ""Romney Is a Fraud on Immigration,"" read one. Perry took just about every available opportunity to attack Romney on everything from his economic record as governor to immigration--sometimes both at the same time. He answered one question about health care in Texas by attacking Romney's hiring of illegal aliens, which was a bit head-snapping. ""It's time for you to tell the truth,"" said Perry about Romney's use of a firm that hired illegal aliens. Going after Romney on immigration is a double win for Perry: It helps weaken Romney and helps clean up Perry's problem with conservatives who don't like his in-state-tuition-for-children-of-illegal-immigrants policy. Perry wasn't just attacking. As if taking a page out of Romney's playbook, Perry avoided some chances to attack and used questions as opportunities to promote his record in Texas and his energy policies. He looked like a candidate who wanted the prize. While Perry was competing for Most Improved, the award for Most Immature goes to Rick Santorum, who otherwise had some forceful moments defending the family unit, a winning position for conservatives. At one point Santorum nearly stomped his feet like a toddler in a sustained interruption of Romney. When Romney climbed out from under the fusillade, Santorum complained that Romney had run out of time--time that Santorum himself had taken up with his tantrum. In the passion primary, the candidates' contest to show voters that they care deeply about improving the economy, Perry flirted with being a bit overheated. The audience booed him when he continued to return to the issue of Romney's hiring of illegal immigrants. Romney, meanwhile, gave it right back to his accusers, showing evidence of being an actual human being. That's one way to see it. For others it might look like Romney was a little shrill and rattled as he lectured Perry. How can you tell an experienced candidate? In the middle of the fracas over immigration, Romney stepped back to say that the reason everyone onstage was so passionate about illegal immigration was because they were passionate about legal immigration. Nevada's voting population is 26 percent Latino, and Romney had his eye on that. In the one slip-up of his trademark technical precision, Romney said that he fired the lawn-mowing firm using illegal aliens. ""You can't have any illegals working on our property,"" he said he'd told them. ""I'm running for office, for Pete's sake."" This won't diminish the charge that he is more calculating than principled. There have been eight debates. There will be 12 more. To invest each one with drama, the networks hosting them have to boast about how grave the stakes are. The hyperbole escalates to the point where it seems like the candidates might take a swing at each other. At moments during Tuesday's debate, for the first time this year, the pre-debate hyperbole actually seemed plausible."	"Mitt Romney and Rick Perry Duke It Out at the Rowdiest Debate Yet

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/why_herman_cain_keeps_trying_to_say_mitt_romney_is_wall_street_s.html	"Mitt Romney can claim a lot of geography. He was born in Michigan, was governor of Massachusetts, worked and lived in Utah, and has a summer place in New Hampshire. Oh, and he's said to be building in San Diego. Right now, though, his opponents are trying to plant him in downtown New York City. Romney ""is more of a Wall Street guy,"" said Herman Cain last week. ""I'm more of a Main Street guy."" Romney would ""roll back Wall Street reforms and go back to where we were before the crisis and let Wall Street write its own rules,"" said David Axelrod on This Week. The Democratic National Committee issued a press release highlighting a New York Times story saying Romney raised more money than any other candidate from Wall Street firms. By putting Romney on Wall Street, Democrats are attempting to tie him to the reckless traders who caused the economic collapse and the CEOs who pay themselves ever-larger bonuses. Romney is a part of and a friend to the 1 percent. This is a predictable and understandable strategy. It's harder to figure out what Herman Cain is trying to do. He is a defender of Wall Street. He said the protesters occupying Wall Street were un-American. Has he changed? If not, maybe there isn't much of a distinction between him and Romney after all. The charge is potent because Romney, who talks more about the middle class than any other GOP candidate, has tried to show that he understands the concerns of those who are struggling in the Obama economy. That's a general election message. In Republican Party politics, there's a downside to being seen as too tied to Wall Street. There are plenty of conservatives who don't like Wall Street. They hate TARP and they hate the special deals bankers carve for themselves. Cain could be throwing them red meat, except that he supported TARP (and suggested those who didn't were dummies) which bailed out Wall Street banks, and he defended it in the last debate. He also said the protesters at Occupy Wall Street didn't understand that the Wall Street banks were ""the ones creating jobs."" So when Cain says Romney is a Wall Street guy, it's a compliment, right? After all, this is the guy who endorsed Romney in 2008, citing his business attributes. In 2011, however, Cain is pointing to Romney's experience as the most important distinction between the two men. So Wall Street connections can't be a good thing anymore. Romney never worked on Wall Street. He never lived there. But that's beside the point, much the same way it's beside the point that Obama never taught at Harvard when Romney says Obama spent too much time at the Harvard faculty lounge. Cain has explained that what he means is that he has made pizzas, cleaned bathrooms, swept parking lots, and done all those things you do when you run a business. This isn't about how each executive clocked their hours. It's a criticism, and the charge is that Romney isn't close to people's real experiences. He's a manipulator who breaks up companies, puts them together, and crafts leverage buyouts, as Cain explained it to Human Events. When Cain says ""Wall Street"" in this fashion, he's doing something alarmingly similar to what those protesters are doing. It's shorthand for a system that has lost touch with real Americans. Cain isn't the first Romney challenger to use the term this way. Rick Perry did on the second day of his campaign. George W. Bush had a similar view of Wall Street from his days in Midland, Texas: ""They'll buy you or sell you, depending upon if it's in their interest."" So what does Cain really think of Wall Street? Perhaps he will explain in Tuesday's debate how his CEO attributes make him more qualified than Romney's CEO attributes. And by the way, Cain is not the only candidate of two minds about Wall Street. Obama is too. There was a time when Obama could raise lots of money from Wall Street. On the one hand, his advisers use Wall Street as a boogeyman, but the president warns against disparaging a whole group of people. ""Dr. King would want us to challenge the excesses of Wall Street without demonizing those who work there,"" he said at the dedication of the King memorial in Washington. Maybe because Romney never actually worked on Wall Street it's still OK to demonize him."	"Who's More of a Wall Street Candidate, Herman Cain or Mitt Romney?

Then it was Bob Dole, Steve Forbes, and the ""flat tax."" Now it's Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and the ""9-9-9 plan."" Republicans can be forgiven for having flashbacks to 1996. Fifteen years ago, one conservative summed up his enthusiasm for Dole by saying it was like kissing your sister. With Romney, it may be more like kissing a mannequin of your sister. Cain is now the third candidate, after Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry, to rise in the polls as a challenger to the perceived front-runner: According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Cain is actually running ahead of Romney among Republicans, 27 percent to 23 percent. He is also pushing a catchy tax proposal that has won him a lot of attention. But what really makes Cain different is that he is the most articulate advocate of the Gospel of Simple: the idea that solutions are not as complex as the experts say, and that much of our current mess has been caused by those preaching complexity. At the last debate Cain took aim at Romney, asking him to name all 59 points in his economic plan. Romney responded that the economic picture was more complicated than that: ""Simple answers are always very helpful, but oftentimes inadequate.""Afterward Cain dismissed Romney's ""put down"" him, saying ""simplicity is genius."" If this sounds familiar, it's a version of what Ross Perot used to say repeatedly. This argument for simplicity resonates with Cain supporters like Diane Harris of Naples, Fla., who voted for Cain in a straw poll of conservative activists in Florida last month. ""Because Romney is a politician and a bureaucrat he'd say that. Bureaucrats take forever. They never take the simple course to get anything accomplished. He has a big 'ole plan. We're tired of that. There are common-sense ways to fix stuff but people keep adding more and more levels until it's an anchor around your neck and you're in the water."" A listing of the people who preach complexity would closely resemble the cast of modern villains in politics today: lawyers, career politicians, establishment party bosses, and the media. Complexity is what's behind Romney's problem, because it's code for lack of principle and shifting positions. When Cain supporters and conservatives hear about complexity, they hear loopholes being created. As my colleague David Weigel points out , that's what's behind the power of the 9-9-9 plan: fairness. No one can get a lawyer to weasel them a better deal. In this respect, Cain is not just the non-Romney, he is also the anti-Obama. The president sets marathon records for the length of his answers. This isn't know-nothingism--Cain's support in the current Journal poll comes from college-educated voters. This was the role Perry was supposed to play. It was also Donald Trump's appeal. But Trump didn't run, and Perry is still in a tailspin. Cain's problem may be that he lacks the organization, which in turn may keep him from turning his support into a viable campaign. But this lack of organization is no deterrent to his supporters--in fact, it's one of his advantages. It's evidence of his authenticity. Cain now must find some way to stay in his moment in the spotlight in a way that the other non-Romney candidates have not. His 9-9-9 plan has taken considerable flak from both the left, which thinks it hurts the poor, and the right, where anti-tax advocates like Grover Norquist worry about the sales tax. Cain also might have to answer for his support of the TARP bailout, which rankles the same Tea Party supporters who adore him. The gospel of simple relies on the same thing hope and change did: the pleasing sound of lines confidently spoken. The downside of this simplicity is that it can be a mask for a candidate who isn't doing his homework and doesn't want to bother. That's what Cain's advisers who quit his campaign this summer charged: He wasn't really committed to doing the hard work of running for president. There's a whiff of this in Cain's answers to criticism. Responding to a critic of the sales tax portion of his plan Cain told the New Hampshire voter ""are you happy with the current tax code? Do we know what's in it? At least we know what's in this."" That's not really a reason. A lot of Cain's answers lack the crispness of that 1994 debate with Bill Clinton. In 1996, Forbes was such an unknown that Dole was able to define him and beat him once the voting started. It was a very negative campaign that bled Dole of money. That isn't likely to be how the Cain and Romney matchup ends. Cain doesn't have the money. He also endorsed Romney in 2008, which makes it harder to argue he has a disqualifying flaw. Cain has tapped into enthusiasm and is having his moment. Seeing how he turns that into votes is more complicated."	"Herman Cain Keeps It Simple and Keeps Rising in the Polls

A reference to growing income inequality between 99 percent of Americans and the top 1 percent of earners, who have amassed approximately one-third of national wealth.

An NYPD officer who pepper-sprayed a protester on Sept. 26, an event that went viral, getting the protests mentioned on the Daily Show. The volunteers who run Occupy Wall Street assemblies. Keeping with many protesters' calls for a more egalitarian society, Occupy movements in several cities have established daily meetings seeking consensus among participants on everything from long-term objectives to daily operations of campsites. This and its related tactics evolved between March 31, when a left-wing coalition occupied the state capitol in Albany, N.Y., to stop the 2012 budget, and May 12, when that coalition held a little-covered march. What speakers at general assemblies or marches say to announce that they want to start speaking and have their words repeated throughout a crowd.

A grassroots tax-fairness group whose name became accidentally confused with the explosion of the We Are the 99% movement. Launched on tax day in 2010, they began by bracketing Tea Party protests; they now show up to Occupy rallies. Bullhorns and microphones are not allowed at Zuccotti Park. Instead, Occupy Wall Street demonstrators addressing the crowd say ""mic check,"" giving everyone else the cue to loudly repeat short segments of whatever the speaker says so others farther away can hear.

19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/lgop_new_hampshire_debate_mitt_romney_shows_he_s_still_the_man_t.html	"HANOVER, N.H.--When you hold a debate at a boardroom table, the business guys are going to do well. Mitt Romney and Herman Cain were the winners at the Bloomberg/Washington Post debate Tuesday night at Dartmouth College. The eight candidates sat ""in the round,"" discussing only the economy, which gave Romney a chance to repeat with force the things he says every day on the campaign trail. He spoke confidently about his business career and experience. Cain was amiable, as always, and took every opportunity to mention his ""9-9-9 plan."" After this debate, it's fair to say this plan would be his answer to questions about trout fishing. This was the first Republican debate after the Great Flirtations. There are no more saviors coming in the Republican Party--Chris Christie, who announced last week he would let this cup pass, endorsed Romney on Tuesday afternoon. If the alternatives to Romney don't perform better, Republicans should just get it over with and start learning to love him. Rick Perry has the background and the money to be the alternative to Romney, but he didn't do much for himself at this debate. For long stretches he seemed to slide under the dining room table. When he spoke, even about an energy plan he is supposed to roll out in the coming days, he was vague and full of platitudes. At such moments, he seemed to be in need of an energy plan. Perry is running on his success creating jobs in Texas, and this debate could have been an opportunity to give his campaign a boost. He'll have to make his opportunities in the coming days instead, using his campaign cash to introduce himself to voters as someone a lot more like them than the polished Mitt Romney. Perry's road to the nomination is probably through the gut. It's hard to make that kind of connection with voters from behind a polished wood table--and time is running out to make any connection at all. Cain is a one-note wonder. This is his strength and his limitation. For those who like Cain, he reminded them all the reasons they do. He skips past questions and concerns with confidence: There is no problem, he shows as much as says, that can't be solved with a good aphorism and good cheer. He doesn't sound like a politician or a pointy-headed intellectual. When asked about the Federal Reserve Board on which he once sat, he didn't even sound that knowledgeable. But does Cain have a second act? Is there more to life than 9-9-9? Moderator Charlie Rose tried to get at the magic behind Cain by asking whose  economic advice he relies on. Cain cited Rich Lowrie, a mysterious figure who helped him on his tax plan. When Romney seemed to pat Cain on the head, suggesting the economy needed solutions a little more complicated than Cain's slogan, it probably drove voters to Cain--We've seen what the experts can do, Mr. Romney!--but at some point Romney's point will hold. There are serious questions about Cain's plan, and he can't dismiss them with a smile. Romney had to defend his support for TARP, which won't help him with Tea Party activists. Then again, they don't like him anyway. He is helped in that Gingrich and Cain also supported the bailout. Cain repeated Romney's answer that TARP was not a bad idea but was poorly executed. At times Cain, who endorsed Romney in 2008, feels like he's vying to be Romney's running mate. He's taken on Perry on his hunting camp and said that he could not consider being Perry's running mate because of his positions. Of all the candidates, it's Newt Gingrich, the self-appointed ombudsman of these debates, who seems to be having the best time. A question is posed and--kapow!--he just wallops the first straw man he can find. Hippie protesters who don't clean up after themselves, dumb questions from the media, the stupid congressional supercommittee sequestration process: Often none of it has anything to do with anything, much less the questions he was asked, but he's having fun. And sometimes he's right on the nose--particularly on the supercommittee. A few more performances like this and he could be the place those non-Romney votes that have moved from Bachmann to Perry to Cain might land for a day or so. Since the last debate, the early primary and caucus states have moved up their contests by about a month. There is no evidence that has quickened the pulse of Romney's competitors to knock him down. In the portion of the evening where they could pose questions to one another he got four, the most of anyone, but it gave him only more free time to repeat his forceful positions. Romney appeared to react to the compressed calendar by looking to the general election, talking repeatedly about the middle class. More and more, unless one of his opponents steps up, it looks like Romney is going to be the one sitting at the head of the Republican family table in November."

He'd directed a few documentaries before The Undefeated, a warm documentary about Palin, but none that could draw dozens of reporters to screenings--none that could effectively shut down an Iowa town when its subject turned up. Climbing aboard the Palin train, he became a player in the great tabloid drama of the Republican Party: What Will Sarah Palin Do Next? That train, which has been losing momentum for months, has halted, leaving the chroniclers and inhabitants of Palinworld stranded ... somewhere. Palin's critics are having the easiest time of it. From the morning in 2008 when Palin was named the Republican vice presidential nominee to last night, Andrew Sullivan wrote tens of thousands of words about Palin's perfidy, on her ""strange lies,"" on baseless rumors about her last pregnancy. He welcomed last night's news with a Madonna video and a pure discharge of bile. ""It is hard to describe the relief,"" he wrote, ""of this awful person finally going away."" Joe McGinniss, the author who lived next to Palin to write his book The Rogue, was just as relieved. ""I say, 'whew,' "" joked McGinniss. ""The country didn't need to dodge a second bullet."" His Palin bio just hit No. 10 on the New York Times best-seller list, right before it became a curio. Was the woman he spent two years writing about no longer relevant? ""She'll always be relevant as an example of how close an utterly unqualified individual came to being only a heartbeat away from the presidency. I'll gladly sacrifice a few sales to have the country rid of Sarah Palin forevermore."" But will the country really be rid of Palin just because she isn't running? After she lost the vice presidency, she was, by default, the biggest star in the Republican Party. That had a lot to do with the idea that she would run for president. When she left Juneau-- she's now been a former governor longer than she's been a governor--it hurt her image, but it gave reporters hope that she'd run for president. When she spoke to the National Tea Party Convention in February 2010, she turned an ad hoc conference into a national news event, streamed lived on all three cable news networks. ""Then, I thought she was going to run,"" said Judson Phillips, the founder of Tea Party Nation, which put on the conference. (He did a Q&A with her onstage after the big show.) ""I have been predicting for months now that she would not run. While she remains popular within the Tea Party, any support she had for running had long since dwindled."" That was a problem. In December 2008, Palin was an unlikely Republican presidential nominee. By 2011, especially after she bumbled her ""blood libel"" statement on the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the idea of Palin leading the ticket was pure fantasy. It was good for ratings; it was good for traffic. To some degree, Palin will still be good for traffic. But some of the people who covered her will move on. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, who spent the month of February ostentatiously refusing to write on Palin, said he had found a new form of distraction: ""I only have eyes for the Hermanator."" But the media's fantasy was based on something. There were people who told pollsters that they wanted her to run for president. There were people who spent free hours writing at blogs like Conservatives for Palin, which on Wednesday night published items with the titles ""Sarah Palin--The People's Leader."" (""We are collectively faced with the patriotic duty of properly listening to the remaining candidates."") And there were people like Peter Singleton, a 56-year-old lawyer from Menlo Park, Calif., who uprooted his life and moved to Iowa to organize for a possible Palin campaign. He became the best-known activist in ""Organize for Palin."" He was approached by reporters for hints of what Palin would do with herself, even though he did not personally meet her until the Iowa State Fair two months ago. He lived out of ""inexpensive hotels and friends' apartments."" For his trouble, he heard the news like everyone else did. ""My phone blew up,"" he said. ""Boom, boom, boom. Call, call, call. And then, like I told the Wall Street Journal, I wanted to have a drink."" Singleton was happy about how he'd spent 2011. ""We were the only grassroots or campaign network that had a bunch of volunteers!"" he said. ""Everybody else had paid professionals doing their work--we had covered more than 80 county central committee meetings [Iowa has 99 counties] and we often were the only campaign represented. You don't win the election because of meeting central committees, sure, but we were building good databases. I can tell you categorically, the five best field operatives in the state right now are Organize for Palin operatives who have never done this before."" Was he angry? No. Would he be moving on? Sort of. He talked about Palin in the same way Bannon did. ""This has never been about Sarah Palin as a candidate,"" he said. ""It's about the American people, and where we are as a country right now."" Back in Los Angeles, Bannon's screening of The Undefeated for the Hollywood Congress of Republicans had gone well. About one-third of the crowd, he said, consisted of Palin supporters. The parts of the movie about the sleazy unfairness of the media weren't any less shocking. Life was going on, and Palin still meant something, but she'd missed out on something else. ""I do feel that the Republican Party and the movement needs another primary like 1976, when Reagan took on the establishment,"" said Bannon. ""It's not gonna be as intense with Palin not in the race. I don't see that we'll have quite the fight we were gonna have. Palin could have galvanized us."""

He gives a brief tour of his office, which overlooks one of the nicer blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue, and which, on a good day, is flooded with sunlight. On the walls, there are news clips about Wexler's election wins, and pictures of the former seven-term congressman with leaders in the region he wants to fix. Here's one with a grimacing Bibi Netanyahu. ""We'd just been told that Arafat had died,"" explains Wexler. Here's a bigger, glossier photo: Wexler on the campaign trail with Barack Obama. ""That was in Tampa,"" he says, pointing at a picture of a candidate and a crowd in a state of pure bliss. It wasn't in his old southeast Florida district, but ""they sent me everywhere."" In 2007 and 2008, Wexler's barnstorming helped Obama among Jewish voters. The Democratic nominee with the middle name ""Hussein"" and a pew in Jeremiah Wright's church won 78 percent of the Jewish vote, 4 points better than John Kerry's share in 2004. In 2009, Wexler retired abruptly to run the center, founded 20 years earlier by the tycoon behind Slim-Fast. Israel policy-watchers spied a strategic move: One of the president's most adroit Jewish allies was now a third-party broker. As he traveled the Middle East to talk up peace, surely, he was going to keep talking up Obama. That was two years ago. Since then, the people who never trusted Obama on Israel have won argument after argument. The policy hasn't changed. In 2008, Obama backed a two-state solution, with the 1967 borders as the basis, and land swaps shifting the territories to ones that Israel and a theoretical Palestine could defend, and he wanted Israel to stop building settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. In 2011, Republicans ran against this--and on the idea that Obama was ""disrespecting"" Israel--to win the 9th congressional district seat in New York City. Last month, a Gallup Poll clocked Jewish support for Obama falling 30 points, to 53 percent. Wexler doesn't dispute that there was a problem. He dings the media for exaggerating it, hyping the critiques of people like Ed Koch, who endorsed the Republican in New York's 9th. ""His reputation in Florida with former New Yorkers is strong,"" Wexler shrugs. ""In New York, he's maybe less persuasive. That's just what I hear. Besides, says Wexler: ""The universe has changed dramatically since that election in New York. The past month, we have witnessed what may be a series of the most high-profile, staunchly pro-Israel actions by a president in years."" He rattles them off, drumming his fingers on the table to make his points: Defending the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, revealing a sale of bunker-busting missiles to the Jewish state. ""You had the secretary of state, [U.N.] Ambassador [Susan] Rice, and others, aligned with Israel consistently, and at times seemingly against the world--certainly against a consensus of world opinion--in terms of thwarting the unilateral Palestinian effort for statehood at the United Nations."" And then there was the killing of Yemeni cleric and al-Qaida leader Anwar al-Awlaki. It was good for America, he says, and helpful for his quest of brokering Middle East peace to help out Israel. ""It shows a strong, bold, resolute president in defense of American interests,"" he says. ""As a result, America, as well as President Obama, gets more respect."" It helps America if an American citizen is killed by drones? ""I think it's totally within the bounds of the law. The more interesting legal questions will be: What about collateral damage? What about the unintended effects of some of these actions? Again, I think totally within the bounds of the law, but those may have factors that the law may not have anticipated."" So: Why is there still a perception problem for Obama on Israel? When Wexler writes op-eds or gives talks at AIPAC, why do they have such a tone of here's-what-you're-doing-wrong? ""I don't want to be cavalier about it,"" says Wexler, ""but there has been an ongoing effort by the president's opponents to characterize his policy regarding Israel in a negative light. And while I'm not involved in the politics of it, I am involved in the policy and the substance of it, and it's just factually inaccurate. And that's the good news for the president."" Why is it good news? Because Obama and his allies can win Jewish voters over by explaining this. Obama's Jewish interlocutors see his current problem as mostly phony, based on a few data points. John Heilemann ran down the big ones in a lengthy New York feature: the call for an end to new settlements, a ""snub"" of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the 1967 borders discussion. On the Republican campaign trail, one of the easiest ways to generate applause is to say something about Obama ""throwing Israel under the bus"" (Mitt Romney) or ""putting Israel at risk"" (Michele Bachmann). To Wexler, it's all so obvious, and untrue, and exploitive. He takes a current example--the fight over aid to the Palestinian Authority. As the PA bid for statehood at the United Nations, the Republican-led House of Representatives blocked the PA's unspent funding. It's a standard Republican line on the trail, more proof of Obama taking the wrong side. That's nuts. ""I wish people, before they make these grandiose proclamations, would take into account at least two factors,"" he says. ""Number one, take the security impact on Israeli Security Forces. Number two, think of that Israeli mom who's putting her kid on the bus in the morning--does your action make her kid more or less safe? If you take away that funding, the extraordinary security gains that have been laboriously achieved over the last half a dozen years will be compromised. The Palestinian people will suffer and the Israeli people will suffer as a result. Bankrupting the Palestinian Authority is a boon to Hamas! If you want to help the extremists in Gaza and the West Bank, bankrupt the Palestinian Authority. Go ahead!"" Wexler drums his fingers, taking them off the table only to throw up his hands. The problem with the Obama-skeptics in the GOP, he says, is that their Israel policies are unrealistic, untethered to the peace process that actually exists. What's the natural conclusion, he asks, of the attack on the two-state solution based on 1967 borders with swaps? Is it no Palestianian state? ""You do that,"" he says, ""and then [Palestinians] say: 'All right, I'll take one state--can I have my vote please?' I remember that Dick Armey--I don't want to misquote him, I'll paraphrase him--used to call for the expulsion of Arabs from the West Bank. Look. This isn't the end of World War I. The world isn't going to permit the mass expulsion of hundreds of thousands of people. Advocating for something that would make Israel less democratic, and less of a moral compass--I don't think that's in Israel's best interest."" Wexler talks regularly with the administration, but will he be as active a surrogate in 2012 as he was in 2008? He knew this question was coming. ""I will travel the world wide,"" he says, ""but particularly the United States, to articulate a policy that supports the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. I am convinced that the policies that President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton have championed are the best way forward for the United States and Israel. I will, to the best of my ability objectively articulate why, for the American Jewish community, and everyone else who is interested, why those principles best serve America and Israel."" Wexler leans back, between the plaque from his old congressional office and the better-days photo of the Obama campaign rally. ""As to where I will specifically be, my guess is that I'll spend some time in Florida."""	"Meet the Man Who Defends Obama's Position on Israel to American Jews

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/occupy_wall_street_and_the_creation_of_the_post_obama_left_.html	"NEW YORK--""Mic Check!"" ""MIC CHECK!"" In Zuccotti Park, temporary home to a few hundred activists shaming the financial system, megaphones are not permitted. Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement--and really, anyone who stops by the park is a member--have gotten around this with an old protester's trick: If you speak, you shout ""mic check,"" as if you're onstage tuning your guitar. People around you repeat everything you say, so that the people around them can hear. This happens twice a day. The protesters call it the New York City General Assembly. It takes a lot of time. On Saturday, the crowd was especially impatient. More than a thousand of them had tried to march over the Brooklyn Bridge, and more than 700 were arrested. Rumors about the arrests were spreading. Some protesters had watched liberated or lucky protesters walk back onto Manhattan, past a watchful phalanx of cops, pumping their fists. Now, this organizer was going to testify. ""Direct action."" ""DIRECT ACTION!"" ""Planned for."" ""PLANNED FOR!"" ""A peaceful march. Over the Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian walkway. During the march. A small group of individuals. Took it upon themselves. To take the vehicle roadway. That was not blocked off. Immediately. People from direct action. Started communicating. To protesters. That there were two options. The planned route. On the pedestrian walkway. Or, if they wanted to. To autonomously take. The vehicle roadway. Which we warned them. Was illegal. And highly unsafe."" The movement has been taught a few hand motions to keep this process going. Holding up their fingers and wiggling them means ""I agree"" or ""I like that."" Turning their hands as if turning a wheel means ""get to the point."" A few hands have turned into wheels. ""Many people. Were unfortunately. Corralled into. The vehicle roadway. I was a scout. For today's march. I found it bizarre. That there was very little security. Or police presence. On the Manhattan side. Of the Brooklyn Bridge. It should be noted. That there was a lot of. Police activity. On the Brooklyn side. I arrived. In the middle of the march. When I got there. Most of my committee. Were directing people. To take the legal. Pedestrian walkway. As was planned. Despite this. When I got there. Hundreds of people. Were marching. On the vehicular roadway. I saw almost. Nobody following. Our committee's recommendation. To follow the pedestrian walkway. In fact, the crowd. Marching on the highway. Was so big. That I myself. Followed them."" But I had just spent an hour talking to protesters who'd escaped arrest. They were saying that the police, not the marchers, had created the confusion on the bridge. ""If you didn't get out in four or five seconds, you were arrested,"" said an activist named Constance Quinn, lisping a little bit behind some mouth piercings. She was about to sign up for YouTube to post the video she took. ""There were people climbing over the railing to get back on the pedestrian side."" The reality was that the arrest was a muddle, a mistake exacerbated by some police (""some"" because other protesters said they'd been let free, their plastic handcuffs snipped off, by cops who told them to beat it). It was also their media breakthrough. On Friday, they'd been griping about their portrayal in the press, which tended to be either snark or a blackout. On Saturday, they'd gotten a story on the front page of the New York Times. On Sunday, the arrests led the New York Post. So the arrests were the hook. What's the story? I hung out with Occupy Wall Street on Friday and Saturday, which wasn't enough time to figure out what the movement is about, because no one knows what it's about. The professional radicals who provided the jargon and call-and-response technique had not pressed their agenda onto the protesters. The union members who'd started to show up, like the SEIU volunteers who dropped off free ponchos and food, admired the protest without co-signing it. They're saving that for an Oct. 5 march, which will bring dozens of unions in league with the nascent movement. That's going to help with optics. The packs of young anarchists at the head of the crowds look like the people that Middle America ignored when they protested the WTO, or the War in Iraq - not people who look like they share Joe Middle Class's concerns. The arrival of the unions will add more average-looking, worried people to a movemene that's already happily incoherent. At any moment on Friday and Saturday, there were more Ron Paul 2012 signs than ""Free Mumia"" signs. On Friday afternoon, the crowd had swelled because of a rumor: Some smartass claimed that Radiohead would be playing in the park, in solidarity. Two construction workers stood near the south side of the park watching a bunch of drummers and horn players blast free jazz with occasional infusions of Thom Yorke's songs. They figured that the band wasn't showing, and they left, but most of the new gawkers stayed. A sign appeared in the crowd: ""A Radiohead rumor was the tipping point in Cairo, too."" David Intrator, who was playing saxophone with the band, talked about why he was there. ""I saw one kid with a sign that said: 'I'm Here 'Cuz This Shit is Fucked Up,'"" said Intrator. ""That about says it, you know? We need a systemic, fundamental change in society. I wish I could give you a definition of that. I can't. I just know that the system is fundamentally flawed."" There was almost no talk about politicians. ""The last six or seven presidents have been fakes,"" shrugged Teddy Curtis, who'd taken off work early from his job at a waste energy conversion company to hoist an ""End the Fed"" sign. ""I think They know who we're going to get before we do. Nothing changes."" The anarchists and minarchists in the crowd might not like this observation--no parties, man!--but Occupy Wall Street is post-Obama left-wing populism. It will be post-Obama even if the man himself holds office until January 2017. Seven years ago, the people protesting in Zuccotti Park had marched outside the Republican National Convention, decrying George W. Bush. Three years ago, they had channeled their energy into the messianic candidacy of Barack Obama. And here they were again, inspired by AdBusters and Democracy Now, ashamed of how the Tea Party movement became the de facto populist response to the crisis. On Saturday, before the arrests happened, the volunteer organizers of the protest handed out a four-page newspaper called The Occupied Wall Street Journal.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/leading_bystander.html	"Chris Christie made a rousing call for leadership at the Reagan Library Tuesday night. He outlined what it looks like (a certain New Jersey governor) and what it doesn't (a sitting U.S. president). ""We continue wait and hope that our president will finally stop being a bystander in the Oval Office,"" he said. ""We hope that he will shake off the paralysis that has made it impossible for him to take on the really big things."" This is the first or second biggest critique of President Obama from Republicans. The claim that competes for the top spot is that he is a socialist who can't stop forcing programs on the American people--not that he doesn't lead, but that he does too much. So which is it? Obama can't be the first president to achieve things simply through ESP, despite the Spock analogies. The leadership critique is imprecise. Obama has shown leadership; the question is (or should be) what kind. It's also a rhetorical trick. What the president's critics really mean when they say the president ""isn't leading"" is that he hasn't announced that he is supporting their plans, or that he hasn't decided to commit public suicide by announcing a position for which they can then denounce him. By any measure, Obama is a leader. The first stimulus plan, health care reform, and financial regulatory reform he pushed for are all significant pieces of legislation. Christie's measurement of leadership is doing ""big things"" even if they are unpopular. Health care, as Republicans will tell you, represents about one-fifth of the economy. Obama certainly wasn't facing the prospect of popularity when he pushed for changing it. To the extent that there is a memorable management quote from the Obama years, it is about showing leadership: ""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste."" In putting Reagan forward as the paragon of leadership, Christie showed just how messy definitions of leadership can be. The governor said ""the rule for effective governance is simple. It is one Ronald Reagan knew by heart. ... When there is a problem, fix it."" Is he sure that was Reagan's message? A more familiar Reagan-praising speech would have read: ""The rule for effective governance is simple. Get government out of the way."" By characterizing the government's role as a fix-it shop, Christie is either redefining Reagan or missing the rule Reagan knew by heart: that government isn't the place you turn to get your fix. Christie singled out Ronald Reagan's firing of air-traffic control workers as a tone-setting move early in his administration. Obama fired the head of GM. Not as big a move, certainly, and you may disagree with it, but it is not the move of a president unable to make tough calls. From the air-traffic controller's strike, Christie drew a foreign policy lesson. America's friends and enemies, he said, knew that the president was serious. For the purposes of argument, let's assume that's true. In such a world it must also then be possible that issuing the orders to kill Osama Bin Laden also sent a message. A president who is a mere bystander couldn't have done that. At the time, Reagan's conservative critics would have laughed at anyone who would have tried to use the firing as a stand-in for foreign policy strength. They often accused the president of being weak with Russia. They called him an ""idiot for Soviet propaganda."" So, too, Obama's critics say his dithering in the Middle East overshadows any leadership success he might claim from staying focused on killing Bin Laden. At which point an Obama defender might point out that Reagan pulled out of Lebanon completely when the going got tough--a weaker leadership signal than Obama's Afghanistan troop build-up and predator drone escalation. This fight can go on and I encourage partisans to have at it in the comments section (as if they need any encouragement from me). But it is an argument about kinds of leadership, not whether a president has it. The leadership critique obscures the real questions that should be asked about the sitting president or the person who wishes to replace him. Simply being a leader doesn't tell you much. George W. Bush used to say ""a leader leads"" as if simply taking action should absolve him of criticism. That didn't get him off the hook any more than Obama should be off the hook now. The questions should be about effective leadership. Does he pick the right fights? Does he have the skills to succeed, or at least mark up a qualified success? If his leadership has not been effective, is the president the only one to blame? America does have a divided government. The president is not king. Is it Obama or Republicans in Congress who deserves the greater share of the blame? Or, as Christie suggested in his speech, is it both? Getting the definition of leadership right keeps us from falling under the spell of pretty words. Calling for leadership is a trick both parties use to arouse anger and keep us from thinking too much more about the underlying issue. If only we had a leader, everything would be solved, they'd like us to think. But we should think more about what it actually takes to be president--what kind of leadership works and what kind of leadership doesn't. Simply saying things aren't working and drawing a line back to whoever is president doesn't actually tell us anything useful that we might apply to the next person we'd put in office. Instead, we wind up voting for the person who most forcefully claims the current occupant lacks leadership. That makes for appealing speeches, but a fondness for rhetoric is what the president's critics say led the country into voting for him in the first place."

The savior's ""style is very engaging,""according to Stanley Kurtz. ""At times, he seems to act out virtually every word he speaks with his body."" A magazine in the savior's home state calls him ""the kind of politician who would rather be feared than loved--or respected."" Hang on, my mistake. I set out to write about Chris Christie, the new Republican messiah, but in my haste I accidentally started quoting punditry about Rick Perry, the old Republican messiah. (Many thanks to Conor Friedersdorf for rounding up so many articles from the musty genre of Perry-worship.) No, no: Christie is completely different! If he gets in, it'll be like the Beatles disembarking from a plane into a crowd of frenzied schoolgirls. Faced with his straight talk, the other Republican candidates may just up and quit and see if Fox News has any open slots for contributors. Christie's address on ""American exceptionalism"" at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Tuesday only adds to the buzz. Christie's circle has tamped down on it, confirming for the umpteenth time that he does not plan to run for president. You can find this news in a Politico article that shares online space with a ""2012 Presidential Election Calendar."" Still on the calendar: ""Chris Christie Speaking at an Ann Wagner for Congress Finance Event"" and ""Chris Christie Speaking at a New Jersey Republican Party Finance Event."" Here's another item to add to the calendar, every day for the foreseeable future: Chris Christie Unable To Stop Republicans From Floating Him as Dream Candidate. Eleven months from now, he will be answering questions about Republican National Convention delegates who want to dump their candidate and install him. There is no stopping Bill Kristol from running at you with a crown and an inspirational poem, as Paul Ryan has learned. As we endure this, remember two things. One: The Republican field is offering most of what Christie offers, even if a bored press corps has run out of ways to cover it. Two: Christie's reputation as a speaker, once underrated, is now overrated. To be fair to the pundits, a lot of the overrating has come from Christie himself. His constant aw-shucks-ing of the presidential hype has taken on a too-satisfied tone. ""I think what the country is thirsting for,"" he said this weekend, ""more than anything else right now, is someone of stature and credibility to tell them that and say, 'Here's where I want us to go to deal with this crisis.' The fact that nobody yet who's running for president, in my view, has done that effectively is why you continue to hear people ask [Indiana Gov. Mitch] Daniels if he'll reconsider and ask me if I'll reconsider."" But the current Republican candidates have been talking about this stuff. It's hard to say if they've been ""effective,"" what with Christie's YouTube oeuvre to compare themselves to, but they've been doing it. Perry has stumbled over his words (which is why there's a Christie boomlet, again), but Perry has written a federalist manifesto in which he recommends decentralizing Social Security and shrinking Medicare. ""I would suggest that any Republican who is not going to work toward finding a solution to the budgetary problems that we have in this country ought to just go home,"" he's said. Mitt Romney has endorsed the Paul Ryan budget, as has Jon Huntsman. Both of them have had to walk a gauntlet of stupid ideological pledges, which nonetheless means they've had to make more tough calls about national issues than the dream candidate has. On policy and our national crises, the current contenders are no more airy than Christie himself. On immigration, he's arguably to the left of Perry--he even calls illegal immigration an ""administrative manner,"" not a ""crime."" His rep as an unparalleled teller of truths grows out of a February 2011 speech he gave at the American Enterprise Institute. ""Here is the truth that no one is talking about,"" said Christie then, referring to a truth some people were already talking about. ""You're going to have to raise the retirement age for Social Security. Oh, I just said it and I'm still standing here! I did not vaporize into the carpeting and I said it! We have to reform Medicare because it costs too much and it is going to bankrupt us. Once again lightning did not come through the windows and strike me dead. And we have to fix Medicaid because it's not only bankrupting the federal government, it's bankrupting every state government. There you go."" Christie's ""vaporize into the carpeting"" line was a winner; Daniels quoted it Monday in a speech in the very same room at the very same think tank. Yet he was saying, without specifics, what everyone in Washington says, sometimes with more specifics. As a noncandidate, Christie has stuck to talking about a few issues that the punditocracy and voters can't get enough of: greedy public-sector unions, school reform, and why Washington doesn't work. Is he better at it than other Republicans? Better than most, sure, but he gets to pick his forums--speeches, interviews, town halls. When he had to debate opponents in 2009, he was poorly reviewed for, of all things, a deficit of straight talk. The 2012 season has been one long repetition of a three-act play:"	Chris Christie: He's not the savior Republican think he is.
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/could_mitch_have_made_it.html	"Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana can imagine the death of the presidential campaign he decided not to launch. In the Republican debate held in Ames, Iowa, in August, candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would oppose a long-term budget deal that included a 10-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases. They all did (and Rick Perry, who wasn't yet in the race, later affirmed that he would have joined them). In an interview for CBS, I asked Daniels what he would have done. ""I would not have raised my hand,"" he said. If Daniels were a candidate, his campaign would have tested the proposition that a truth-telling contender can survive a party's nominating process. That is the thesis of Daniels' new book Keeping the Republic: Saving America by Trusting Americans: Politicians should level with voters, and voters can handle it. It's also the theory animating the fantasy-league Republicans who keep trying to encourage governors like Chris Christie of New Jersey to join the party's presidential race. If only one of these authentic characters who tells it like it is would emerge, the theory goes, voters would swarm to them and Obama would be trounced. Daniels is not promoting increasing taxes. But he is flirting with lending some perspective to the presidential race--or at least an ounce of consideration. ""Here's what I would have said, and I wish somebody would have said,"" he says. ""I would have said, not 'I'll take the deal', but 'tell me more.'"" He is highly suspicious of tax increases, and the tests he would apply are stringent. But Daniels is obsessed with the size of the debt and the looming catastrophe that will occur if it is not addressed. ""We ought to view it as a military threat,"" he says. In order to start solving the problem, he is willing to trade progress on the big goal for ideological rigidity. ""It would be a mistake the close the door. We need the 90 percent imaginary or hypothetical spending cuts here. We need that desperately, and I'd be willing up to some point to pay a price, if it were practical, to secure it."" Daniels has been joking with those who urged him to run that he might have killed his campaign in his first debate. ""It would have been my boom moment,"" he says of not raising his hand. He knows from experience. When Daniels suggested Republicans should downplay social issues in order to stay focused on the deficit and not turn off independent voters, he was thoroughly criticized. Still, he argues in his new book and in interviews that voters are ready to hear the truth about the country's serious fiscal condition and can handle a debate about the hard choices required. Wait, if his campaign would have been doomed, how can he be so sure people are ready to hear the truth? What Daniels says is required is a candidate who is willing to take the risk and fight past the political mercenaries who, Daniels says, have degraded political discourse. ""You either believe the American people have the capacity to run their own lives and their government or you don't."" Daniels hasn't seen such a strategy yet in the current field, he says, though he thinks one of the current candidates can get there. What he's seen so far is that candidates are competing as if they are merely the ""default option"" for a country that doesn't like President Obama. The problem with this approach, argues Daniels, is that candidates are not using the campaign to build a mandate for action once they take office. Daniels and Christie (so far) have resisted the entreaties to join the GOP race. Perry did not and is now trying to survive a bad stylistic debate performance in which his most potent gaffe was the product of too much candor: ""If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart,"" Perry said last week, defending his Texas program that allows children of undocumented workers to attend state schools at in-state tuition rates. John Dickerson Interviews Mitch Daniels Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and another dream candidate who has received entreaties to enter the GOP race, once supported such a policy. All that Perry did was forcefully articulate what he believes. This was once considered a good thing about him. The 10-to-1 question and the uniform responses from Republican candidates have become a key moment in the Republican race. It was either a genuine reflection of the anti-tax orthodoxy among the candidates or an acknowledgement of the political reality that candidates can't be seen flirting with tax increases. This moment will return next year in the great debate with Obama over how to reduce the deficit--and in the debate over whether such an uncompromising view is what has ruined government. Daniels, by choosing not to run, gave up any chance to be a direct participant in that debate. And had he decided to run and keep speaking his mind, he probably wouldn't have made it that far.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/rick_rolled.html	"The Republican presidential debate in Orlando was sponsored by Google, but it was Gov. Rick Perry who was searching. The frontrunner's answers meandered. When fielding a hypothetical question about terrorists getting nukes in Pakistan, his response ribboned out like he was reading the first search results to come up. Even when he read his attack lines on rival Mitt Romney from the notes on his lectern, it was muddy. This was Perry's third debate this campaign; with each successive one, his performance gets worse. The race between the Republican frontrunners has been between electability and authenticity. ""Paint Creek"" Perry is one of you--he prays, he speaks plainly, he's from a small town in Texas--and Moneybags Mitt ain't. Romney's pitch: He can beat President Obama, whereas Perry is too reckless. At the debate, Perry not only failed to make the case about Romney's essential phoniness, he turned the weapon on himself (Perry-kiri?), creating several self-inflicted wounds to the heart of his authenticity pitch. The first wound came at the start. Romney and Perry got into a pushy book club debate, pointing to what the other had or had not written in their books and what lines each was pretending they'd never written at all. Romney continued his assault on Perry's plan for letting the states run Social Security. Perry said he'd never suggested that for the larger Social Security system, but merely for state employees. This isn't so. He was talking about the larger program not just in his book, but also since the book was published and since this campaign started. Perry has made his comments on Social Security a symbol of how candid and authentic he is. At the last debate, he ducked the question of returning the retirement program to the states. For this debate, he constructed a diversion--a net reduction in honesty from his previous (less than straightforward) position. ""There's a Rick Perry out there that's saying the federal government shouldn't be in the pension business,"" Romney said. ""You better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that."" Perry evacuated the topic and sprinted for safer ground. He pointed out that Romney had changed the wording on health care in his book in between the hardcover and paperback editions. The changes were made to remove any suggestions that Romney once favored making his Massachusetts plan a national plan. It seemed like a good line of attack, aiming at people's doubts about Romney's core, but he got tangled. He tried again later to raise Romney's position changes, but instead of showing an instinct for the jugular, he became a word juggler:"	Republican presidential debate: The more he debates, the worse Rick Perry gets.

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/rogue_author.html	"Joe McGinniss is no longer surprised at the hate engendered by his new biography,  The Rogue: Searching for the Real Sarah Palin. ""Did you see this crazy blogger, Stacy McCain, saying he's starting a legal fund for Todd Palin?"" he asks. The blog post appeals for $25 donations to SarahPAC to ""help defray Todd's legal expenses when he shows up at McGinniss's first book signing and pounds that scurvy worm into a bloody pulp."" That was posted Thursday, but McGinniss has long been familiar with the passions the Palins arouse. In May 2010, he lucked into a cheap rental home that happened to be next to the Palins' house. Palin publicly shamed McGinniss for doing it. McGinniss prints in his book some of the hate mail he received, and says that it temporarily made his research harder to do. After the fury died down, McGinniss conducted ""at least a couple of hundred interviews from ""people who, despite the intimidation and the fear, were willing to talk."" The juiciest quotes and stories in The Rogue come from anonymous sources, but McGinniss says he nixed ""90 percent of the anecdotes I heard,"" sticking to the ones he could confirm. Todd Palin has opted to knock the book down by quoting his own anonymous sources, who say McGinniss ""was the most disingenuous and intellectual [sic] dishonest writer they'd ever dealt with."" ""That's probably about AGIA,"" says McGinniss, referring to a gas pipeline project that Palin championed but couldn't make work. It was the focus of his first long article about Palin in 2009. ""Todd still has a hair across his ass about that."" Maybe the Palins are desperate. ""She hasn't even announced her candidacy. I don't think she's gonna run, do you? And now she's running third behind Perry and Romney."" Just in case Palin defies McGinniss and stays relevant, here's a guide to a few of the Palin personae McGinniss sketches in The Rogue. Some of this stuff is so outrageous as to be unbelievable--c'mon, snorting cocaine off an oil drum in the great Alaskan wilderness?--and no doubt the fact-checkers and Palin partisans of the Internet will have a few thousand words to say about it over the coming weeks. But as McGinniss ruefully acknowledges in his final chapter, anything that has to do with Palin gets people chattering. Or, at least, starting legal-defense funds. Sarah Palin, NeighborThe first line of the book, dated May 22, 2010, is straightforward: ""I moved in next door to Sarah Palin today."" An evocative description of the Wasilla home he rented last year is illustrated by a snapshot of Lake Lucille, which both McGinniss and Palin have views of. There is a map of the area around the Palin home, illustrating where McGinniss lived. McGinniss reports that the Palins told the original owner that they were going to cut a path through her property. ""Todd told her, very plainly, that Sarah was mayor and they could do whatever they wanted, and it would be a mistake for her to try and stop them."" The Palins even put up a fence with the ugly back side facing the neighbor's house. Later, once he learns who's living next door, Todd Palin pays McGinniss a visit, sporting a ""First Dude"" T-shirt and decrying his 2009 piece on AGIA. ""We'll just see how long you stay around here,"" he says, wagging his finger. Sarah Palin, Christian One of Sarah's high-school classmates tells McGinniss that on bus trips, the future governor would ""start preaching to us all about 'the Rapture.'... I remember even way back then she kept talking about how the Bible said the Middle East was going to be a bloodbath and that the end-times were upon us or drawing nigh or some such shit."" Palin won office in Wasilla with the help of evangelical Christians. ""On her first day in office, Sarah changed the screen saver on the mayor's official computer to read GOD LOVES YOU SARAH PALIN."" Phil Munger, whose band played at a commencement for homeschoolers that Palin spoke at, reports on her creationist views, saying she spoke of seeing ""pictures that showed human footprints inside dinosaur tracks."" Later in the book, an anonymous source says Palin's religious creed might be an act. ""There was no religion in that house. There was nothing about God. There was no Christ. Nobody prayed. There were no Bibles, there were no Christ Is in This Home signs."" Sarah Palin, HedonistColleen Cottle, a recently acquired Wasilla source, unloads rumors to McGinniss like buckshot, including one about ""Brad Hanson, with whom Sarah had the affair back when Brad and Todd were partners in the Polaris snowmobile store in Big Lake."" This story, denied by the Palins when the National Enquirer first reported it, and denied again this week, reappears throughout the book. This story pales before the already infamous Glen Rice anecdote. In 1987, according to McGinniss, Palin slept with the University of Michigan basketball star while she was a reporter for Anchorage's KTUU-TV and told friends that it was a mistake. ""The thing that people remember is her freak-out,"" says an anonymous friend, ""[and] how completely crazy she got: I fucked a black man! She was just horrified."" Rice confirms the story to McGinniss, but he's puzzled by the secondhand report of regret. ""Even after I left Alaska, we talked a lot on the phone."" And then there's Todd. J.C. McCavitt, an old friend, says Todd ""has the most amazing beer-drinking capacity I've ever seen."" An ""attractive white woman"" in Dillingham, Todd's hometown, recalls that he complimented her on her ""great heart-shaped ass."" A ""friend"" recalls a snow machine outing at Crosswinds Lake, where both Palins went rogue. ""The cocaine was free flowing. Somebody found a fifty-five-gallon oil drum and turned it upside down and we were all doing cocaine lines off the top of the drum."" Sarah Palin, GourmandOne friend recalls that Sarah wasn't much in the kitchen when she married Todd. ""She can't cook shit. She couldn't do grilled cheese. She'd burn water."" John Bitney, the husband of a woman who took care of Palin's kids, notes that when Todd was out, ""I'd walk into that kitchen and Bristol and Willow would be sitting there with a burnt pot of Kraft Mac and cheese on the stove and they'd be trying to open one of those Ramen noodle packs, and Sarah would be up in her bedroom with the door closed saying she didn't want to be disturbed."" On the governor's own diet: ""One day she came in with Oreos, bread, bags of fast food, and she ate everything and then disappeared and came out of the bathroom later with blurry eyes, her hair up, and her knuckles red."" Sarah Palin, ParentA far rougher accusation is that Palin didn't pay that much attention to her son Track's hockey career, with sources recalling that she wasn't at many games. ""When Sarah did attend,"" writes McGinniss, ""spectators recall that she cheered loudest not for goals, but on those occasions when Track knocked an opposing player down and hit him repeatedly with his stick."" Another friend says that Track Palin joined the army on the advice of his father: ""You're gonna do this because you owe us. This is gonna look good for us and you're gonna do it."" The state trooper who drove Track and Sarah to the enlistment office tells McGinniss that ""there was quite a lot of emotion in the back seat of that car, but patriotism was not one of the emotions."" Jim Whitaker, a former mayor of Fairbanks who endorsed Obama for president in 2008, explains how he soured on Palin when they had a meeting in Anchorage and she blew off meeting with her son--who was returning from basic training--to rant about talk radio. ""For at least another half hour we kept going, just talking about silly stuff."" In a long section about rumors that Sarah Palin's son Trig is not hers, McGinniss wonders why, the day Palin's water broke, Todd Palin seemingly used his BlackBerry only to talk about how ""her speech kicked ass."" McGinniss gives the theories about Trig's birth plenty of space. He endorses none of them. He hints that only a megalomaniac could carry out such a scheme. Sarah Palin, SexpotIn high school, a classmate claims, Palin liked to sleep in the nude, because ""she said it wasn't healthy for girls to sleep with clothes on."" Later on, Palin's rivals in her first mayoral race claim she spread rumors of them acting luridly in a step-aerobics class, telling the instructor that she felt uncomfortable because they were ""ogling her butt."" Another source claims that Palin once wore her workout clothes at home and sang ""Baby Got Back"" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, annoying Todd.* After getting to city hall, ""someone who knew her well at the time"" recounts Palin's attitude toward meetings. ""I have to go to a fuckin' meeting tonight. ... I got on my biggest push-up bra. I'm gonna get what I want tonight.""Correction, Sept. 16, 2011: This story originally misidentified the title of the Sir-Mix-a-Lot song that Sarah Palin sang along with. It is ""Baby Got Back,"" not ""I Like Big Butts."""	The Rogue: Joe McGinniss stands by the more outrageous parts of his Sarah Palin tell-all.
