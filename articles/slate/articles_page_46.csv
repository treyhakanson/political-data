He told ABC's George Stephanopoulos he understands that the next Democratic presidential nominee will need to distance herself from him. The next candidate will want an opportunity to describe what he or she believes in and the public wants to inhale what Obama called ""that new car smell."" Let the Olfactory Primary begin! The public certainly likes a new new thing, though after trying out a one-term senator with no executive experience, the voters in 2016 might be looking for more time-tested qualities. But whatever the waft of the Hillary mobile, it will be hitched to the Obama wagon. That's true of any Democratic nominee, but particularly true for Clinton, who served as his secretary of state. President Obama and any Democratic successor will be closely connected for all of the obvious reasons--they will share roughly the same philosophy; they will have both fought Republican opponents--but also because of the growth of the imperial presidency. The more presidents act alone, the more their policies live or die depending on the views of the next president. The president's recent decision not to deport millions of undocumented immigrants could be undone by the next president. So too could some of his environmental regulations. Both of those issues are important to key constituencies in the Obama coalition--Latinos and younger voters--so the next Democratic nominee will promise to uphold them. Though the Affordable Care Act is a piece of legislation, the president has shown how it can be protected through executive modifications, a tradition his successor could continue. Plus, the law will continue to face existential threats from Republicans, which means its survival may also be dependent on the shield of the presidential veto. Each Democratic candidate who hopes to have a chance will run supporting Obama's positions on health care, immigration, and climate change. Given those positions on the big things, any move to distance themselves from Obama will seem puny by comparison. In newsrooms, editors will monitor the micrometers between the faintest policy differences, and they will shout emergency orders to make a big deal about it. But despite all the talk about distancing, candidates will learn what Democratic senators up for re-election learned this fall: Resistance is futile. If there is a D next to your name, you can't really get that far from the president. Over the next two years, if you could capture the relative political distance between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in Hyperlapse, it would look like two figures standing in place with a blast from the flash cameras every time one or the other made the smallest wiggle but retaining their essential original posture. Even if they are not trying to distance themselves from an unpopular incumbent, candidates do sometimes have different views and whether by design or accident they will define themselves as what the president is not. Obama's aides say the president understands this: He is supposedly prepared to endure some criticism and even the occasional blow or two to his ego because the best way to lock in his legacy is if a Democrat is elected. As Taylor Branch wrote in The Clinton Tapes, Bill Clinton once told Al Gore, ""Al, I would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post."" That equanimity sounds good now, but it might be hard to sustain that Zen posture. In the end, what makes it hard for presidents is not just enduring the abuse but the idea that the current nominee could be running a better campaign. However much Gore's distancing might have hurt Clinton personally, he also thought the Gore team was politically stupid to run away from the president and he imagined he could do some good out there campaigning for Gore on the campaign trail. Obama may feel the same way; he may stay mum, but his loyal aides will provide the anonymous quotes. It will also be hard for Obama to sit still. During the final months of the 2014 races, Obama could barely move without it becoming a campaign story. That will kick in even faster before 2016. Taking abuse is easy; willfully dressing up in the lame-duck costume every day to sit mute at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is much harder. Given that Clinton can't easily distance herself from Obama, the challenge for her candidacy is how to build a vision for the future that is so interesting and consuming that voters pay attention to that above all else. As Clinton pointed out months ago, answering ""why"" she is running is the crucial question for voters and herself. Democratic operatives in the Obama orbit and outside have said it appeared there was no answer to this important question, which they said was a fatal flaw. But recently three different Democratic veterans have pointed to the speech Clinton gave during a campaign stop for Tom Wolf, the incoming governor of Pennsylvania, describing it as the most passionate, personal, and complete rationale for her Clinton's candidacy they've seen since the dying days of her 2008 campaign. If Clinton does wind up criticizing President Obama more explicitly, it will offer an echo and a payback. In the 2008 race, Sen. Obama distanced himself from the Clintons. In The Audacity of Hope, Obama wrote about getting out from under the baby boomer self-obsession of the 1990s--a clear reference to the Clinton years--and he campaigned against ""triangulation and poll-driven politics."" Those words were synonymous with Bill Clinton and pejorative because, as Obama explained in one debate, that strategy sought to build power for Clinton and not for the party or a set of ideas. It is because of this worldview that Obama famously picked Ronald Reagan over Clinton when talking about leaders who had genuinely transformed the country. That is why the president has such an intimate understanding of the power of the ""new car smell."" He came to power by selling it."	How Will Obama React When Democrats Try to Distance Themselves From His Presidency?
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/barack_obama_s_executive_action_on_immigration_the_president_did_not_just.html	"President Obama is announcing his executive action on immigration, and some conservatives are raging with wild claims of sinister intent. ""The move will be on to grant them health care benefits and citizenship within six months of Obama's executive action,"" warned Rush Limbaugh in a Wednesday broadcast. Likewise, said Michele Bachmann, ""The president has a very single-minded vision. He's looking at new voters for 2016. ... People do vote without being a citizen. It's a wink and a nod, we all know it's going to happen."" The most explicit version came from Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a staunch opponent of immigration reform and vocal advocate of voter identification laws. Speaking on his radio show, he said, ""The long-term strategy of, first of all, replacing American voters with illegal aliens, recently legalized, who then become U.S. citizens."" He continued: ""There is still a decided bias in favor of bigger government, not smaller government. So maybe this strategy of replacing American voters with newly legalized aliens, if you look at it through an ethnic lens ... you've got a locked-in vote for socialism."" There you have it: President Obama is trying to engineer a permanent majority by legalizing new voters and giving them benefits to strengthen their link to the Democratic Party. This probably isn't true--as far as anyone knows, neither Obama nor Democratic strategists are rubbing their hands like Birdman in anticipation of a final victory--but it does touch on something based in reality. Put simply, Latinos are a large and important part of the Democratic coalition; without their heavy support, Democrats couldn't win Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico, and would have a hard time with places like Colorado and Virginia, where new Latino voters helped Democrats flip the states from Republican control in 2008 and 2012. Right-wing claims aside, the president's immigration order won't give voting rights to unauthorized immigrants. But it could bolster Democratic standing with Latinos, Asians, and other groups with deep ties to immigrant communities. Or, if that's too much, it could at least reverse the slide--on the eve of this year's midterm elections, just 63 percent of Latinos leaned toward or identified with the Democratic Party, down from 70 percent in 2012. But even this frame gives a little too much agency to politicians, who are more reactive than forward-thinking. More than anything, this is a case of Democratic politicians reacting to the activists who have pressured the White House on immigration for six years, pushing legislation and demanding new avenues for action when Congress didn't deliver. And after a year of increasingly negative pressure, the party--and the president--has relented. The right way to look at Thursday's executive order, in short, is as a textbook case of successful interest group pressure. And while there are electoral consequences, I think both sides could stand a dose of reality in their predictions. Contrary to conservative fears, Republicans don't have to worry about losing elections because of the president's executive order. And on the other side, Democrats shouldn't see this as a panacea for boosting Latino turnout in future contests. It's important to remember that Latinos (and Asians, the other group most affected by immigration policy) have relatively low rates of voter registration. Last year Gallup found that just 51 percent of Latinos and 60 percent of Asians were registered to vote, compared with 85 percent of whites and 81 percent of blacks. And while a record number of Latinos were eligible to vote in this year's elections--25.2 million, according to the Pew Research Center--they were a small percentage of the overall voting population in key races across the country. In the nation's closest Senate contests, for instance, Latinos were just 4.7 percent of eligible voters. Moreover, neither Latinos nor Asians are evenly distributed across the political landscape. Latinos are concentrated in the Southwest and on the West Coast, with the largest populations in deep-red states like Texas and Arizona or deep-blue states like New Mexico and California. And similarly, Asians are largely on the West Coast. Only a few places have moderate-size Latino populations, and while it has made a difference for presidential elections--giving Democrats an edge in Nevada and a chance in North Carolina, for example--it hasn't meant much for statewide and congressional races, where Republicans are still competitive. Absent an immigration order that grants citizenship to unauthorized immigrants--which would prompt a real constitutional crisis--there's no world in which conservative fears on immigration and elections come to pass. As for Democrats, helping unauthorized immigrants may pay some dividends in the next elections. Those Latinos who weren't thrilled with the Democratic Party--but lean toward its views--might decide to register and vote, strengthening the party wherever they live. And on the margins, that can matter a great deal; Democrats and Republicans are almost evenly matched in Florida, where a few thousand votes can sway state and federal elections. A Florida where more Latinos vote--and where they vote for Democrats--is one where the Democratic Party is set to break the state's stalemate. Beyond that, however, I'm not sure how much the Democrats gain. At most, the president's immigration order might strengthen the short-term bonds among Latinos, Asians, and the Democratic Party. More significant, I think, is the Republican reaction. If the GOP reacts to the immigration order with unhinged hysteria and anti-immigrant animus--which, looking at the above quotes, to say nothing of the past, is possible--it could further estrange itself from these groups. And that, more than anything, could shift the long-term shape of our politics. Political memory runs long, and the Latino teenager of today is the grandmother of tomorrow. If she believes the Republican Party is out to harm her and her family, how will that weigh on the views of her children and grandchildren? How will they vote? The experience of groups like Jewish Americans suggests a future in which Latinos are broadly in the American mainstream but vote for Democrats out of social solidarity and a memory of the past. At the same time, Democrats should know that they risk a short-term backlash by acting on immigration. The white working class is hostile to new immigration, and is wary of what it means for their lives. In the 2011 Pew Political Typology survey, writes Andrew Levison in The White Working Class Today, ""Hostility to immigrants is one of the two areas ... where white working class Americans display the greatest degree of 'conservatism.' "" Levison notes the 56 percent of respondents who either strongly or somewhat agree that recent immigrants ""threaten traditional American customs and values."" Indeed, when the question is framed ""in starkly economic terms as a competition between immigrants and American workers over jobs and resources,"" the number who strongly agree that immigrants are a ""burden"" because they ""take our jobs, housing, and health care"" is 53 percent. Yes, that leaves a substantial plurality who are more ambivalent--or even positive--on the issue, but that's still nothing to dismiss. Democrats already suffered one wipeout because of their weakness with the white working class. Moving on immigration could give them another, even as it helps countless immigrant families and communities. With all of that said, the most likely electoral outcome after Obama's immigration order is nothing. The status quo will hold, and both sides will be on the same ground as before. In other words, Republicans can stop their panic and Democrats can hold off on too much celebration."	No, Obama's Executive Action on Immigration Will Not Create Millions of Democratic Voters
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/obama_s_immigration_precedents_obama_won_t_be_the_first_executive_to_go.html	"President Obama is set to unveil his long-promised executive immigration overhaul on Thursday during a primetime address from the White House. The exact details of the president's plan remain under wraps, but the general framework has been known for the past week: Obama will use his executive authority to shield from deportation as many as 5 million unauthorized immigrants who are the parents or spouses of U.S. citizens or legal residents, and give many of them the ability to work legally in the country. Democrats see the plan as an extraordinary move from a president doing what Congress should be undertaking but can't. Republicans see it as an extralegal action from a president eager to do what Congress simply doesn't want to. But while the battle lines are clear, the fight has now shifted to one over historical precedent. Do the actions of past presidents reveal that Obama isn't guilty of the type of executive overreach conservatives are accusing him of, or is Obama using that same history as a pretext for a power grab, one that will set its own dangerous precedent? This question emerged on Monday when the Associated Press published a national story that included this matter-of-fact opening sentence: ""Two presidents have acted unilaterally on immigration--and both were Republican."" The report pointed out that both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush extended reprieves from deportation to family members who were not covered by a 1986 congressional overhaul of the nation's immigration system. Neither man faced the type of blowback that Obama is getting prior to his own announcement. In fact, there's a long history of presidents taking immigration action on their own. As the Los Angeles Times documented earlier this week, the list of executives pushing through reforms includes: George W. Bush, who allowed members of the military with green cards to expedite their citizenship process in the wake of 9/11; Bill Clinton, who eased deportation of refugees from El Salvador and Haiti; and Jimmy Carter, who granted a wide range of refugee groups temporary relief from deportation. The list doesn't stop there: John F. Kennedy created a federal program for Cuban refugees, Harry Truman launched his own commission to study immigration reform after Congress refused his request to do so, and Franklin Roosevelt initiated the Bracero program, which brought 2 million short-term Mexican farm workers to the country. The common theme in most of these cases is that Congress eventually acted to make the executive actions permanent. Ask an immigration advocate, and she'll tell you this proves that the presidents were pushing Congress to do what it would have done on its own eventually. Ask an opponent, and she'll say the biggest reason lawmakers followed the presidents' lead is because they had no other choice. The New York Times' Ross Douthat made that case forcefully earlier this week, responding in part to my piece from last week that pointed out that any action Obama takes is, by definition, only a temporary one. Douthat argued that ""once a government has taken the step of formally inviting a particular population to take jobs and (by implication) put down roots, there's a stronger moral obligation not to consider deportation."" That obligation, meanwhile, comes with political pressure not to take away something that people already have. ""Whatever the legal realities, in practical and political terms it's clear that Obama is expecting this move to create facts on the ground that no future president will be able to reverse,"" he wrote. The counterargument, voiced by many supporters of Obama's executive action, is that those moral obligations are there all along--it just sometimes takes a president untethered to the realities of congressional lawmaking to deliver on it. ""Many of these [earlier presidential] actions were controversial when first announced,"" Charles Kamasaki, senior cabinet adviser at the National Council of La Raza, argued earlier this week. ""But Congress later affirmed virtually all of them--without explicitly reversing any of them--suggesting that eventually they were widely accepted."" Kamasaki concluded: ""Decades from now, people looking back on President Obama's imminent announcement ... [will] wonder: what was all the fuss about?"" Republicans, naturally, remain focused on the here and now, particularly after their strong gains in the midterm elections. The good news for the GOP is that they appear to have found a winning argument in their complaints about executive overreach. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted earlier this week found 48 percent of Americans oppose the president going it alone on immigration, while only 38 percent support him doing so. The problem for Republicans is that it will be easier to win in the court of public opinion today than in a court of law tomorrow. GOP assertions aside, there's no evidence that Obama's plan is illegal, and most experts agree that his expected moves have plenty of legal precedent to back them up. Efforts to undercut the president's immigration overhaul by using the power of the purse also appear to be a long shot. The federal agency most responsible for implementing the executive orders will be U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which pays for itself with revenue generated by immigration applications. That means the GOP can't defund the agency as some lawmakers have suggested they might, regardless of whether they used a laser-like budget cut or shut down the whole government. Still, Republicans have vowed to press on, waging war on the president's plan any way they can. It's those promises to undo Obama's actions that actually undercut the rhetoric from both sides. If as Kamasaki suggests, past presidents' decisions to go it alone were justified because Congress ultimately followed, then Obama's wait to be proved right is likely to be a long one. At the same time, congressional Republicans' current quest to kill the president's reforms makes it seem less likely that they'll one day be willing to make them permanent simply because they're the status quo. Both sides, then, can point to the same history books, but neither will find exactly what they're looking for."	Why Doesn't the GOP Care That a Bunch of Other Presidents Went It Alone on Immigration?
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/immigration_policy_forces_american_citizens_to_live_abroad_many_pin_hopes.html	"As she mulls over whether President Obama's immigration plan could possibly help her, U.S. citizen Nicole Salgado cannot help but feel intense frustration. She is exasperated with repeatedly explaining to members of Congress that it was Congress that approved a 1996 law making it impossible for her to legalize her undocumented husband of 10 years, even though she's an American citizen who grew up near Syracuse, New York. Salgado is also fed up with explaining why she was forced to move to Mexico eight years ago to live with her spouse, Margarito Resendiz, a construction worker she met in San Mateo County, California. He was forced to leave the United States and serve out a mandatory 10-year minimum ""bar"" on living in the United States. That's a punishment he faced after the couple tried to do the ""right thing"" and come forward to seek legal status for Resendiz based on his marriage to Salgado. The move to Mexico has exhausted the couple's savings and derailed dreams. And it's left them struggling to eke out enough of a living in Mexico to raise the couple's now 4-year-old daughter, who is also a U.S. citizen. At 36, Salgado has patched together gigs teaching English. But she's been unable to make consistent use of her Cornell University education and her master's degree in teaching science from California's San Jose State University. ""Living down here in exile,"" she said, ""I have lost a lot of faith in our U.S. system."" Salgado is one of hundreds of thousands of Americans married to undocumented people who have moved abroad to stay with their spouses, suffered through separation from them, or lived in constant fear that their spouses will be discovered and deported. These families are wondering if they'll benefit from Obama's executive action to temporarily legalize undocumented immigrants with close ties to Americans. Obama is expected to announce plans in broad strokes Thursday night in a speech. The expectation is that he will spare certain undocumented immigrants with U.S.-born children or U.S. spouses from deportation, as media have reported. But the fine details of the plan will be of utmost importance, especially to people like Salgado, whose husband is already outside the country after voluntarily leaving to serve his bar. He cannot get a visa to return unless reforms to the law are made or Obama uses his power to provide a humanitarian path for his return. Other foreign spouses have been deported after their marriages, and now have records that could also complicate their return. As the Center for Public Integrity and KQED Radio reported in 2012, some of these couples were torn apart after they discovered that Congress had created obscure but harsh penalties specifically to punish undocumented people who seek green cards after marriage--no matter if those marriages are legitimate and couples already have children together. Couples have been shocked to discover that the undocumented spouse must first comply with a minimum 10-year bar before trying to get permanent residency or a ""green card."" Some foreign spouses have been slapped with 20-year bars or lifetime bars if they have a deportation in their history or were accused of falsely claiming to be a legal resident at some point. In Resendiz's case, because he had a prior deportation before marrying, he faced a permanent bar with an option to request a pardon--no guarantees--after 10 years. The application for the pardon will likely cost at least $10,000 between filing fees and lawyer's costs. That's $10,000 that Salgado doesn't have now and doesn't think she will have in the near future. In August, Salgado posted a letter she sent to Obama imploring him to be sure to take into consideration the plight of American citizens like her if he presses forward with executive action. Salgado expressed concern about a backlash from Congress in reaction to any executive action. But she said she and other Americans are suffering from separation or exile--or the anxiety of their spouses being deported--and they need relief from the stalemate over immigration reform in Washington. ""Be as creative as possible,"" Salgado wrote to Obama, ""and use the full extent of your powers to take the lead in finding a way to include my family--my husband--and hundreds of thousands of our American families in that vision, and in any executive action you take on immigration, so we do not have to make the decision between family and country anymore."" Salgado co-wrote a book about her experiences called Amor and Exile and launched a campaign to deliver it to members of Congress in 2013. She also belongs to a network called American Families United, which has been lobbying Congress and attempting to push forward bills to modify a complex web of penalties and give immigration officials more latitude to exempt couples. In CPI and KQED's investigation, ""Separated by Law,"" Americans told stories of their family life shattered and their lives impoverished by penalties that were suggested to Congress as a way to deter illegal immigration through example. There is no evidence that the penalties have had any impact on dissuading people from illegal immigration. As CPI reported, Los Angeles resident Chris Xitco thought he could still legalize his wife by simply taking her down to a federal immigration center and signing her up and paying a fine. To his dismay, she was given a 10-year bar during an interview that had to be conducted in Juarez, Mexico, at a U.S. consulate. The couple had received no prior warning this could happen, and they had a new baby. Xitco's wife, Delia, is still living south of Tijuana, Mexico, in a gated house where Xitco fears for the family's safety and visits on weekends. San Diego resident T.J. Barbour, a software engineer, found out about the bars after he married and decided against filing for his wife Mayte's green card. But after she was stopped by a police officer for driving too slowly, she was held in detention for six months while the couple tried to obtain asylum for Mayte. Immigration agents dumped Mayte in Tijuana after she lost her case without even a warning phone call to Barbour. The couple's son was 9 at the time and has suffered losing his mother's care. North Carolina native Anita Mann moved to a remote area of Mexico with three small children so they could join her husband, who is still under a 10-year bar. Others who moved to Mexico, including Margo Bruemmer of New Jersey, told CPI and members of Congress about threats they and their children faced in some rural areas where they were living, including extortion and kidnapping. They implored members of Congress to reform laws to allow them to bring their spouses back. In February 2013, during a visit to Congress, Bruemmer spoke at a press conference, saying: ""I am begging for our lawmakers, in this upcoming immigration reform debate, to not forget those of us already living outside the country, already barred. Please, do not forget us."" A Philadelphia member of American Families United, who is married with three children, said she's worried about being left out if the Obama action does not include her husband. If she tried to legalize him, she said, the 1996 congressional mandates would require he receive a lifetime bar because he was accused of attempting to use a fake ID card years ago. The woman, who asked for anonymity, said that every day, she worries that her husband could be detected and deported. She hopes undocumented friends she has who have children with U.S. citizenship will benefit from the executive action. But she can't bear the thought of her husband being left out of any relief because of his history long ago. ""As a citizen, it's like a twilight zone. I don't even have words to express it,"" she said. In March 2013, Obama took a measured step for these couples by making it easier for some to apply to receive a special hardship waiver allowing the foreign spouse to return. Congress' 1996 law does allow U.S. citizens to request such a waiver if citizens can prove they have a devastating medical condition or hardship beyond the normal suffering a spouse might experience due to separation. Obama's 2013 change allows couples to file for the hardship waiver before the foreign spouse leaves the country to begin serving out a bar. But the option is off-limits to people who have deportations in their past or records, like the Philadelphia woman's husband. Kim Anderson, president of American Families United, said her group has tried to press the White House recently to provide measures that would help their members, such as ""humanitarian parole,"" which could allow citizens to bring back spouses even if only on a provisional basis. The group continues to hope Congress will amend the penalties it created in 1996. ""I've been astounded over the years at the assumptions that you marry a U.S. citizen and get a green card. It couldn't be further from the truth,"" said Anderson, whose own marriage was crushed by the despair over separation. ""You should not have to be forced between your life and your country."" This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C., that investigates current juvenile justice policies."	How U.S. Immigration Policy Has Forced Some American Citizens Into Exile
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/president_obama_wants_to_hit_republicans_hard_on_immigration_he_is_no_longer.html	"President Obama will likely soon announce his executive actions revamping his administration's immigration policies. (Update, Nov. 19, 2014, at 11:20 a.m.: He will make the announcement Thursday.) As many as 5 million undocumented immigrants may be spared deportation. Republicans will react with anger and fury, but the president believes the move might spur Republicans to act on immigration if for no other reason than to overwrite his executive orders. Some of the president's aides and supporters believe it will lead to a Republican overreaction like the government shutdown of last year. That, in turn, would weaken the GOP, helping Democrats politically and possibly even offering the opportunity for better negotiating terms with Republicans on a variety of issues, when they become anxious to show that they can govern ahead of 2016. That's the theory anyway. More important, this president has picked a course for the final stage of his presidency that is a total reversal from its original heading. The promises of Obama 2008 have been dead for a long time. The idea of progress through engagement and a higher-minded approach to the zero-sum politics of the Bush years started dying not long after Obama had his first contact with a determined Republican opposition. By the time the president won re-election, his team was operating under the premise that it was useless to negotiate with Republicans in the House. They concluded GOP leaders couldn't deliver on the minimum requirements necessary for governing. What the president is doing now on immigration is going one step further. He's embracing a strategy that posits that progress doesn't come through cajoling, speechmaking, or refusing to budge, as he did during the debt ceiling debate during the shutdown; instead, you have to punch them in the nose. It's an approach that is bigger and more confrontational than the minimum wage workarounds or Environmental Protection Agency regulations. He once promised to use his pen to make progress; now he's wielding it as a weapon. This, say the president's aides, is the only way to proceed when faced with Republicans who refuse to act on immigration reform. The GOP has had years to make progress and has failed to do so. Marco Rubio, the Republican senator who pushed a comprehensive solution, now feels like a remote participant in the conversation and House Speaker John Boehner wouldn't raise a bipartisan Senate bill in the House for fear of having an election-year crackup over policy details. That dynamic hasn't changed, so the president is moving forward. But what if the president could play hardball and still be lofty and optimistic? Why not give Republicans a handful of months to come up with their immigration plan and then, if they don't meet the deadline, go ahead with the executive orders? There's no real rush (or Obama would have ordered the overhaul before the election), and the election has actually changed the dynamic. (If the election didn't change things, then why did Obama wait until it passed to act?) An argument can be made for delay on purely political grounds. It would look ""reasonable"" to the op-ed writers and pundits, and it would put pressure on Republicans to act--to actually wrestle with the details of the issue--and that would be messy as different GOP factions fought it out over specific legislative language. Chaos in Republican ranks benefits the president because GOP leaders would have to work to avoid appearing that they were unable to govern on an important issue of the day. That might make them partners on a larger immigration deal that could benefit more people and offer a big legacy item for the president, whereas if the president moves unilaterally they'll never cooperate with the White House on immigration. Any deal with Obama after the executive orders would be seen by the conservative grass roots as a grand capitulation. The president cannot delay, say his aides and allies, because he cannot disappoint his supporters in the Latino community again. There have been too many delays already. Deferring any longer would damage the political unity he'll hope to draw on in his final two years, and it would hurt Democrats up for re-election in 2016, especially if the president backed down again. That's why in an interview with Univision, outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made his case for the president ""going big"" by referring to his own political situation. ""I think the parents of people I know in Nevada deserve this."" Plus, the president actually believes in the underlying policy and the value of protecting up to 5 million undocumented immigrants. Democrats believe that delay will only create calls for more delay and more inaction. By forcing the confrontation now, the president takes immediate action to help immigrant families and still puts political pressure on the GOP. Republican leaders now have to temper their reaction by reining in in their members calling for impeachment or another set of budget confrontations, perhaps even a government shutdown, which could backfire as the last one did. At the moment, the risk of a shutdown looks remote, but the challenge is larger than just avoiding a shutdown. Republicans also have to be smart about how they undo the president's actions, making it an argument about presidential overreach and not an opportunity for them to be painted as inflexible on the issue. President Obama's new, muscular position on immigration is the best evidence of his newfound freedom that has come after his party's big loss at the polls. He is no longer holding his fire to protect Democrats up for re-election in red states. (Some of his aides believe the restraint not only irritated him but led to the weak outcome.) This will likely be the first of few brawls in the president's final years in office. Apparently, he's learned that the best way to avoid becoming a lame duck is with your fists."	Obama Doesn't Have to Strong-Arm Republicans. He Just Wants To.
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/what_republicans_mean_when_they_say_amnesty_only_immigration_hard_liners.html	"If there is one issue that will creep into everything that happens on Capitol Hill right now, it is immigration. Whether you're interested in spending, national security, the next attorney general, or the 2016 presidential contest, immigration will be deeply involved. And where there's talk of immigration, there's talk of amnesty. When Republicans use that term--and, for the most part, only Republicans use it--the word is typically shorthand for ""bad immigration policy."" Asking if a Republican supports amnesty is akin to asking if someone is beating his or her spouse; it's a loaded term, and the correct answer is always no. For conservatives, amnesty is bad. Nobody likes amnesty. But there's a hitch: Some of the top legislators who frequently use the term can't actually explain what amnesty is. I spent the past few days asking Republican senators what they meant when they referred to amnesty in terms of immigration policy. The answers I got were intriguing. That's because while Republican congressional leaders are always eager to discuss their opposition to this vague, amorphous concept, many of them are downright befuddled when asked to explain what that concept looks like in real life. Their responses ranged from straightforward to nonsensical. When I asked Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican, what specific immigration policies he was referring to when he used the term amnesty, he said, ""I don't understand the question."" ""Amnesty is a forgiveness by definition,"" he said, ""and there are many different types of that so I'm not gonna get into trying to define it, what other people might think. If you look in the dictionary, it's forgiveness, you can take it for that."" The dictionary definition of amnesty is not particularly illuminating when it comes to Republicans' immigration stances. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said this: ""Amnesty to me is totally forgiving or granting a pardon to people who've broken the law."" No word on whether giving work permits is the same as giving a pardon. I then asked Arkansas' Sen. John Boozman what he meant when he used the A-word. ""It's behavior that you don't want to reward,"" he said. ""And so if somebody enters the country illegally and then is given the ability to move to the front of the line, as opposed to somebody who goes through the normal process, then I would call that amnesty."" ""It would be a pathway to citizenship,"" he said. According to that definition, the president's executive action on immigration is not amnesty. ""The sticking point would be in the details,"" Boozman added. ""That might require whatever."" Indeed. Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts took a strong stance against the president's pending executive action during his tough re-election campaign. And in a statement to Breitbart news last week, he said, ""The president's attempts to grant amnesty through executive order will be the first battleground where this new majority can stand up to this president and block his actions."" That statement would suggest that the president's immigration action--we don't have all the details on that yet--is definitely amnesty. When asked on Monday night what specific policy changes would constitute amnesty, Roberts said, ""I don't know what's in the president's program yet, I'll have to take a look."" When I asked Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer if deferring deportations of undocumented immigrants--the anticipated central plank of the president's executive action--counts as amnesty, she said, ""I don't know!"" and laughed. And Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt took a lengthy pause before answering. ""I think the term means anything that waives part of the current law and lets people stay,"" he said. But he added that immigration reform should be piecemeal and that crafting policy to deal with undocumented immigrants currently living here would be easier if the border was secure. So would that mean that granting work permits would be amnesty if we did it now, but wouldn't be if we did it after securing the border? ""I think trying to talk about specific definitions that happen in a framework where nothing is working to conclusion is just not a very good way to spend time,"" he said. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake has a simpler position: He doesn't use the term. ""It's kind of a fungible definition,"" he said. ""Some people say anything short of deportation, and others if they pay back taxes or they pay a fine, or a waiting period, then it's not. My definition of amnesty is an unconditional pardon for a breach of law, and really, nothing that's been proposed by anybody qualifies for that."" But while U.S. senators may not be able to give a cogent explanation of the meaning of a word they use all the time, groups that are hawkish on immigration and the conservative media members sympathetic to them have worked overtime to get Republicans on the record opposing amnesty in the broadest possible definition of the word. The best example of this comes from the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The group has substantial clout in the conservative circles--radio host Mark Levin called it ""near and dear to my heart,"" and Laura Ingraham invokes it often--that most staunchly oppose higher levels of legal immigration and legal status for undocumented immigrants. And though the organization isn't technically partisan, its major affiliations are all with leaders and politicians on the right. Over the course of the 2014 primary season, the FAIR Congressional Task Force debuted a three-question candidate survey asking whether candidates would support or oppose legislation granting work authorization for undocumented immigrants, increasing the number of immigrants legally allowed to immigrate to the United States each year, and increasing the number of guest workers admitted annually. Mississippi Senate candidate Chris McDaniel was among the first to fill out the questionnaire, and he answered in the negative to each question. He then proceeded to call for Sen. Thad Cochran to be ""courageous enough"" to sign the questionnaire, per Breitbart. Cochran didn't sign it--no surprise--and influential conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham cited that when she endorsed McDaniel. A few other prominent Republican primary contenders also got on board. Dave Brat, who defeated former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in one of the most astounding upsets in recent memory, took the questionnaire (answering no to all three questions) and made immigration one of the main issues in that Virginia primary. And Georgia Sen.-elect David Perdue also went on the record during his primary answering no to the questionnaire's three hypotheticals. Here's why this matters: For conservative immigration hawks, amnesty equals opposition to any sort of legal status for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. And it's a definition that's enforced in part by an organization that opposes any hike in legal immigration levels. Amnesty, in the FAIR questionnaire's vernacular, means granting ""any form of work authorization to illegal aliens."" Iowa Rep. Steve King, California Rep. Tom McClintock, Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, Georgia Rep.-elect Barry Loudermilk, and North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones have all committed to opposing any legislation that increases legal immigration. The bottom line is that immigration hard-liners--for lack of a more precise term--are very clear about what they mean when they talk about amnesty. But plenty of non-hard-liners use the term too, and many of those don't really know what they mean by it. Others, according to their own definitions of the term, don't think it's fair to characterize the president's anticipated move as amnesty. Keep that in mind as debate over immigration policy unfolds over the coming weeks. Or don't--since many of the people talking will have no idea what they are talking about."	What Do Republicans Mean When They Say Amnesty?

An official announcement of his long-promised plan may come as soon as Sunday, or the president could wait until after Congress passes legislation in early December to keep the government running. Either way, the White House says, an executive overhaul of the nation's immigration system is coming this year. This is a big deal. While we don't yet know how many people who will be directly affected by his executive actions, it's expected to exceed the 1.5 million covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which the president created in 2012 to allow so-called Dreamers to apply for work permits and reprieves from deportation. If Obama goes as big as his advisers have suggested, his executive orders could cover nearly half of the estimated 11.7 million immigrants currently living in the country without authorization. This will also be a huge deal politically. Republicans have already, to varying degrees, threatened to shut down the government to block the reforms.  Democrats, meanwhile, are openly fantasizing about how this immigration overhaul could add a whole lot of blue to the electoral map in 2016 and beyond. But given all the hype you'll hear from the left and the right--both of which have plenty of motivation to paint the president's move as either extraordinary (Democrats) or extralegal (Republicans)--it's important to remember that the bulk of Obama's actions will be temporary. There's no guarantee that they'll remain in place after he leaves office in two years. What happens after that will be in the hands of the next president. Here's what we know based on the rough sketch the administration has already provided to the New York Times and the Associated Press. The most sweeping action the president will likely take is to extend DACA-like reprieves to particular groups of unauthorized immigrants, the largest of which will probably be parents of children who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Such a reprieve would temporarily protect them from the threat of deportation, but it wouldn't remove that threat forever. Despite what conservatives are suggesting with their talk of ""executive amnesty,"" the president doesn't have the unilateral power to make someone a U.S. citizen or permanent legal resident. As Gregory Chen, the advocacy director for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, explained to the Center for American Progress this summer: ""[Obama] can't simply say, 'I'm going to change the criteria for a green card and give it to people I think should be eligible, such as someone who has lived here for five years and is contributing well to the community.' "" Like DACA, Obama's forthcoming plan will be based on ""prosecutorial discretion,"" which affords a president plenty of wiggle room to decide how he wants to enforce the laws that are on the books. While such a move is supported by plenty of legal precedent, it's also fleeting by nature. Once Obama leaves office, that prosecutorial discretion will fall to his successor, be that President Hillary Clinton, President Chris Christie, or anyone else. There is one group for whom Obama's actions could have a more lasting impact: those unauthorized immigrants whose spouses are U.S. citizens or legal residents. Most people in that group are technically eligible to apply for a green card already, but only if they first leave the country and wait out what's typically a lengthy separation from their family. Obama could offer what is known as ""parole in place"" to that group, allowing them to stay in the country legally while the green card process plays out. He did a similar thing last November for undocumented individuals with immediate family members serving in the U.S. military. Anyone who has a green card in hand before the president leaves office in early 2017 wouldn't have to worry about losing it if the next president changes course. The number of immigrants who fall in that category, however, is much smaller than those in the category of parents of children who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. According to the Migration Policy Institute, there are approximately 1.5 million unauthorized spouses of U.S. citizens or permanent residents, compared to 3.6 million parents. All of which is to say that, yes, Obama's forthcoming announcement will be incredibly important to a huge number of people. It will affect millions of immigrants directly and millions more indirectly, and it will also set a precedent that the next president will have to grapple with. But as the Washington hype machine kicks into high gear over the next several weeks, keep in mind that the bulk of Obama's moves will not be permanent ones. Real, lasting change to our immigration policy can come only from Congress. The president has already told lawmakers that. The problem, though, is they appear in no hurry to listen."	Liberals and Conservatives Are Overplaying the Significance of Obama's Action on Immigration
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/republican_anger_over_jonathan_gruber_s_obamacare_comments_is_justified.html	"If only Halloween hadn't passed, someone could go as MIT's Jonathan Gruber. He is the economist most likely to get people in Washington to run out of a room. At the moment he is a problem for the Obama administration and Democrats, though he's spooked Republicans before, too. At an academic panel in 2013, Gruber said of the Affordable Care Act: ""This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure"" the Congressional Budget Office ""did not score the mandate as taxes."" He also said that ""lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,"" and added, ""Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass."" The video has surfaced now and conservatives are pointing to the admission as more proof that the Obama administration, which came to town pledging new levels of transparency, was trying to hoodwink voters with the Affordable Care Act. Gruber has now distanced himself from his remarks. ""I don't know who he is,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday, although she has referred to his work in the past. ""He didn't help write our bill."" Democrats are saying that Gruber was only one of many advisers and that the $400,000 he was paid by the government was simply for his economic model. This reaction looks like panic to distance Democrats from Gruber, which is impossible. It's impossible not only because Gruber says he helped with the law and visited the White House five times in 2009 to help craft it, but also because the Democrats were the first to use the MIT professor as a political weapon. Before he was causing problems for the Obama administration, the Obama team was using Gruber to unsettle Mitt Romney. In the 2012 campaign, Obama's camp was claiming that the Massachusetts health care plan was the intellectual model for Obamacare, just as Romney was trying to disavow it. Gruber was essential to this case. In a video produced by the Obama campaign celebrating the anniversary of ""Romneycare,"" Gruber says, ""I helped Gov. Romney develop his health care reform or Romneycare, before going down to Washington to help President Obama develop his national version of that law."" The spot includes old footage of Romney thanking Gruber for his work on the Massachusetts health bill. ""The core of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare and what we did in Massachusetts are identical,"" Gruber says. The MIT professor was such an important part of the creation of Obamacare that his association with Romney's effort proved the link between the two programs. If that involvement in Obamacare was sufficient to condemn Romney in 2012, it's sufficient enough for Republicans to raise it now over Gruber's claims about the Affordable Care Act. What's Gruber for the goose, is Gruber for the gander. Gruber's name came up earlier this year in another skirmish over the law. In yet another talk, he suggested that the Affordable Care Act was written so that states that didn't set up insurance exchanges would not also get tax credits. ""If you're a state and you don't set up an exchange, that means your citizens don't get their tax credits,"" he said. (He since has said that he was speaking off the cuff and didn't mean to say what he said.) That's a key argument in the Supreme Court case against the law in which plaintiffs argue that the subsidies that go to states with federal exchanges are illegal. More Gruber remarks are coming out. Jake Tapper reports on CNN of another instance in which Gruber said the authors of the law mislabeled provisions to make them easier to swallow. One possible defense of Gruber that can be made is that he was merely describing a truth both parties know: that in order to achieve policy objectives, laws have to be written in convoluted ways to avoid political traps, including a politically bad assessment from the Congressional Budget Office. Also, what Gruber describes was a part of the open policy debate surrounding the law. That would return a conversation that is about duplicity back into one about policy differences. The law wasn't trying to fool the American people, just the Congressional Budget Office. But that's not much of a case. Given how often the administration has used the Congressional Budget Office as metaphysical guarantors of truth, this argument just lands you back into hoodwink territory. If the Congressional Budget Office is an institution of such solemnity, why would you want to trick its analysts? The better defense is the one the White House is giving, which is that millions of people are now covered by the law and they seem to like it. As Republicans try to dismantle the Affordable Care Act from their new position of power in Congress, Gruber will become an oft-cited Oracle of Obamacare. But he confirms a broader critique conservatives have of the president, which is that he either cynically thinks people can be fooled or he thinks people aren't smart enough to know what's good for them. That means we're likely to hear Gruber's name in debates over issues like immigration, in which he has played no role at all."	Republicans Are Right to Play Six Degrees of Jonathan Gruber
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/republican_party_plans_to_fight_president_obama_s_executive_action_on_immigration.html	"President Obama's executive action on immigration is coming--Immigration-palooza 2.0 is here--and Republicans won't take it delicately. (Cue the Ron Paul ""It's happening"" GIFs.) We've seen this movie before, and it isn't pretty. Over the coming weeks, Republicans will unfold their strategy to push back against the president's unilateral move, which could halt deportations for up to 5 million undocumented immigrants. It's the first big fight of the new Congress, and the new Congress isn't even sworn in yet. The first thing to bear in mind with the coming immigration smackdown is that this isn't the first time in recent memory that the Hill has fallen into mass chaos over immigration. Last year eight Republican and Democratic senators teamed up to introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation intended to solve the increasingly pressing problem of mass illegal immigration. We all know how well that turned out: Conservative lawmakers and activists pushed back as soon as details of the bill started to emerge, Tea Party activists descended on Washington, phone lines melted, the bill passed the Senate on a 68-32 vote, and then the House did nothing and the legislation unceremoniously died. Those days may soon return. Fox News has reported the president could announce the specifics of a long-vaunted executive action on immigration as early as next week. There's a host of proposals that he's theoretically considering, including a possible expansion of a previous executive action that kept some immigrants who entered the United States illegally as minors from being deported. Another potential provision of the president's executive action, per Fox, is to expand programs that end deportations for some undocumented immigrants whose close relatives are in the United States legally. That wouldn't be Obama's first executive action to prevent deportations; in June 2012 he moved to stop deportations of some undocumented immigrants who entered the country as minors. Democrats have been largely unified in lauding the president's decision to move forward without Congress, and no prominent members of his party have suggested that he lacks the authority to do so. And advocates of immigration reform will be disappointed only if the scope of the president's action is narrower than expected. Republicans, however, are in an entirely different boat. For this to make sense, you have to understand that the GOP is about as divided over immigration policy as any political party is over any single issue. There's a general consensus that the border should be secure and that amnesty is bad, but things break into a million tiny pieces from there. Depending on whom you ask, ""border security"" can mean a host of different things, including fence-building, higher security spending, more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and who knows what else. And the word amnesty is also ambiguous: Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the Senate immigration bill's original sponsors, means something very different when he uses that word than immigration hawk Sen. Jeff Sessions. There are Republicans who want to put the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country on track to getting citizenship, and there are Republicans who want to send everyone back to their home countries as quickly as possible and seal the border behind them. If you want to get a better sense of how this tension plays out, you should watch this debate that Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist and columnist Ann Coulter--nobody's RINOs--had on CNBC during the last immigration fight. If you want another example of immigration tearing into the roof of the GOP, then recall the events that led to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's astounding primary defeat. Dave Brat, the political newbie who beat him, had basically zero powerful backing except from national anti-immigration reform figures (including Coulter and radio host Laura Ingraham). And if you still aren't persuaded, do a quick perusal of Rubio's rise and fall in Tea Party circles. The Florida senator came to Washington as a Tea Party golden boy but saw his presidential prospects tanked by the time the immigration kerfuffle resolved itself. Now, that doesn't mean he can't run a competitive presidential campaign and will never get conservative grassroots support. But it does mean that there's a sizable, powerful chunk of the conservative base that will never trust him because of his stance on immigration reform. You can't overstate the extent to which immigration turns Republicans against Republicans. With that in mind, the big question is this: How will Republicans respond to the president's impending move? And to answer that, it's important to bear in mind that there are two separate grievances that Republicans have with the president's coming executive action. The first grievance is with the substance of the president's anticipated move. The Ann Coulter wing of the GOP--for lack of a better term--worries that increased immigration will depress wages and increase the strain on the social safety net. These conservatives argue the president's executive action will incentivize illegal immigration and exacerbate a variety of social ills. Not all Republicans make all of these arguments, but many do, including Sessions, as well as numerous members of the House Republican Conference. The other main grievance has less to do with the substance of the action than with the fact that the president is taking it unilaterally. Many Republican leaders (including Sessions) see the move as an unconstitutional power grab that threatens our system of checks and balances. Numerous voices on the right have expressed this concern, including Charles Krauthammer, who said the president's move could be ""impeachable"" and ""a flagrant assault on the Constitution."" And in a Politico Magazine op-ed, Sen. Orrin Hatch argued that by unilaterally changing the way immigration laws are enforced, the president has ""failed to live up to his constitutional duty to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' "" Some Republicans are in the first camp, some are in the second, and some are both. Republicans have a number of options, none of which comes close to guaranteeing their desired outcome. First off, House Speaker John Boehner has floated the possibility of suing the president over his move. According to the Washington Post, Boehner is considering either expanding his current lawsuit against the administration that focuses on the implementation of the president's health care law, or launching a second one on immigration. This option seems premised on the idea that suing the president is a muscular response that would mollify the speaker's angry base. That premise is also probably false. One Senate aide who focuses on immigration said a lawsuit on the issue could be stuck in court for years. And the speaker's health care lawsuit has drawn great mirth from some quarters, as both the law firms he hired for the project have quit. There's also some question as to whether Boehner even has legal standing. Breitbart, which is probably the favorite news site for anti-immigration-reform activists, dubbed Boehner's lawsuit idea a ""clown show."" But that's obviously not the only option. Another possibility is trying to defund the president's move. If that gives you flashbacks to a government shutdown, well, it should. Congress will need to authorize more spending in early December to keep the government running, and some conservatives have suggested putting a provision in the next spending bill to specifically state that the president isn't authorized to use funds for his new immigration action. The next spending bill (called a continuing resolution) could be either short-term or long-term. Another possibility: buying themselves a little time. Republicans could pass a short-term spending bill without anything on immigration enforcement, and then pass a long-term spending bill next Congress--when the new members are sworn in and they control the Senate--to try to limit his authority on the issue. Defunding the president's immigration gambit could come with some hiccups, though. First, it's not crystal clear whether the president's immigration action would be funded by fees or through the appropriations process. People I spoke with didn't have a definite answer to that question. If the former is the case, then it might not be possible to use a spending bill to block the president. Second, there is a reasonable chance that the president wouldn't be interested in signing a spending bill that put him in those constraints, in which case the government could run short on money and--ta-da!--shut down. Nobody wants a shutdown. Boehner doesn't want it, incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't want it, House Republicans don't want it, even hawkish immigration activists say they don't want it. One would hope that means it's very unlikely. One would hope. But if the president didn't sign a spending bill that funded everything but his executive action, his party could face substantial political consequences. Republicans don't have an ironclad plan for responding to the president's move yet. All of this is very theoretical, and it could change depending on what specifically the president decides to do. Either way, expect to hear a lot from Republicans about ""poisoning the well."" Moderate Republican senators who spoke with Slate on Thursday reiterated (and re-reiterated) that a well would be poisoned if the president moved ahead with his immigration action. The implication is that there's currently a metaphorical well of pristine water symbolizing the promise of cooperation and bipartisanship in the next two years of the Obama presidency. (The White House likely isn't aware of this well's location.) The bottom line is that comprehensive immigration reform is a huge issue for conservatives of just about every stripe. A number of Republican candidates made opposition to comprehensive immigration reform central to their election campaigns, including Sens.-elect Thom Tillis and Tom Cotton. They will not want to ""go soft"" on immigration within minutes of arriving to their new offices.  Many Tea Party activists thought the Senate Gang of Eight's immigration bill was just as bad as Obamacare, so they will be riled up from Day One. In a sense, the immigration debate conjures something close to two unstoppable political forces: The activists who favor comprehensive immigration reform get at least as galvanized as the activists who oppose it, and both groups are integral parts of the Democrats' and Republicans' respective bases. So here we are. The 114th Congress will get off to a rollicking start. Just be sure to keep an eye on your well water."	How the GOP Will Fight Obama on Immigration
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/veterans_affairs_overhaul_the_va_should_worry_less_about_cleaning_house.html	"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald is promising a massive overhaul of the embattled agency, a restructuring that he has billed as the largest in its 84-year history. The West Point grad and former CEO of Procter & Gamble took over the department this summer after his predecessor resigned due to a scandal that involved VA staff manipulating records to hide the fact that veterans were waiting months longer for medical appointments than the hospitals claimed. ""As VA moves forward, we will judge the success of all our efforts against a single metric: the outcomes we provide for veterans,"" McDonald vowed Monday, on the eve of Veterans Day. As that quote suggests, McDonald's plan is ambitious in scope and short on details. The secretary has conceded his remake is still in the early stages, and the department has given no timetable for how long the reorganization will ultimately take. The most high-profile change that's been announced thus far would be to create a single customer service bureau to make it easier for veterans to navigate a sprawling department that provides veterans with health care, but also benefits, burial, and even home loans. That modification notwithstanding, Washington's immediate focus remains where it has been since the scandal broke this summer--on cleaning house, not fixing it. ""We can't change this department unless we change the culture,"" McDonald told CNN on Tuesday. ""Primary to changing the culture is holding people accountable when they violate our values."" But the search for scapegoats won't help the agency face perhaps its biggest challenge: staffing up to ensure that veterans are getting the health care they deserve. Yes, there are undoubtedly people who work for the VA who deserve to be fired. The agency's fundamental problem, though, is the same one that it's faced for years: It needs to hire a whole lot more doctors and nurses. That message has been part of the VA's recent media blitz, but it has been largely buried beneath Washington's focus on firing. Time and time again, McDonald has rattled off the number of staffers who are being targeted for firing or other disciplinary action. During a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday, McDonald said that he has given congressional leaders a list of 35 employees that the VA wants to oust as a result of the health care scandal and suggested that he has a second list with the names of more than 1,000 employees who also face disciplinary action, up to and including termination. This past Friday, meanwhile, the secretary estimated that 5,600 employees have been subjected to disciplinary review in the past year, although aides later clarified to the Associated Press that most of those actions were unrelated to this summer's scandal. The department's most vocal critics want less talk of firing and more actual firing. The VA is handcuffed by the letter of the law, which requires a judge to sign off on each termination and gives the employee a chance to appeal. Congressional Republicans say that's no excuse for the fact that to date only one high-ranking agency official has been fired over the scandal. (Several others, meanwhile, have either retired or are currently appealing.) ""New plans, initiatives, and organizational structures are all well and good, but they will not produce their intended results until VA rids itself of the employees who have shaken veterans' trust in the system,"" House Committee on Veterans' Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said Monday. Veterans' groups that have been largely supportive of McDonald's new customer-centric approach likewise want to see heads roll. ""Even if reform is happening, and I really think it is, I think they want blood--they want to see people are really being punished,"" Louis Celli, the American Legion's legislative director, told the New York Times last month. In many regards, that makes sense. Even if you fix a system, that system is unlikely to function properly if you can't trust the people running it. The VA needs to assure skeptical veterans and angry lawmakers that employees who acted improperly are being held accountable and that the very worst have been removed from their jobs. Mass firings--or declarations that mass firings are in the offing--also make for good PR, allowing McDonald to offer (vague) numbers as evidence of action that's more easily understood that his still-in-the-works revamp. But firing a whole bunch of employees won't address the VA's basic problem. By cooking the books, medical staff may have stood to gain financially via bonuses and performance review-driven raises. Nearly everyone agrees, though, that a shortage of doctors was one of the scandal's root causes. J. David Cox Sr., the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, estimated earlier this year that many VA primary care doctors were treating upward of 2,000 patients each, roughly 800 more than they were supposed to be. VA staff shouldn't have been papering over the shortage for the sake of their salaries, but the shortage itself--not just the cover-up of said storage--was clearly a major issue. McDonald has said that he hopes to address the shortage by hiring as many as 28,000 doctors, nurses, and other additional medical staff--a total that doesn't appear to include the hundreds or maybe even thousands of employees they may need to replace once the agency is done cleaning house. That's a staggering number, one that would be nearly impossible to fill in the best of times--and these are not the best of times. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that the U.S. will face a shortage of more than 130,000 physicians over the next decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, meanwhile, predicts that the total number of job openings for nurses will stand at more than 1 million by 2022. McDonald has been touring medical schools to sell skeptical candidates on joining the much-maligned department and has already begun bringing VA salaries closer in line with those in the private sector. Still, the secretary acknowledges, that won't fix the agency's larger branding problem. On Monday, he recounted to NPR how during a trip this summer to the Phoenix facility at the center of the scandal he found himself talking with a fellow airline passenger who was an Air Force vet with a daughter in med school. ""He talked to her about working for the VA,"" McDonald said. ""And she said, 'Dad, haven't you been listening to the radio--or don't you know what's going on? Why would I want to work for the VA?' "" ""I knew immediately I had to change the tenor,"" McDonald concluded. ""So I have to get out there, and I've got to tell the positive stories about what the VA does."" That's a fair goal, but it's an impossible one to reach as long as Washington stays focused on those VA employees that need to be shown the door. McDonald might make Congress happy by saying that he's going to fire 1,000 people. If he wants to do right by veterans, he'll focus a lot more on the 28,000 he needs to hire."	The Solution to the VA's Problems Isn't Firing Staffers--It's Hiring Them

But I also felt the same. My parents and their friends hosted Super Bowl parties. Every Fourth of July, we picnicked or watched fireworks on the roof of our van. At school I worried about fitting in until, as a teenager, all I wanted was to be totally different. I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X the summer I turned 13 and returned to school with an X safety-pinned to my backpack. I didn't hold back my opinions, not even with the police officer assigned to our D.A.R.E. anti-drug school program who, as Los Angeles burned in race riots, said that Rodney King deserved to be beaten. I argued with my English teacher until she agreed that instead of writing a paper on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol--a book about a holiday I didn't celebrate, I stridently reminded her--I could do a class presentation on Islam. I never worried that this behavior would land me on a list of teenagers to monitor as potential ""violent extremists."" It didn't occur to me that my teachers or neighbors might be cataloging my behaviors and beliefs to determine whether I was on a ""pathway toward violent extremism""--or that they would consider referring me to the FBI. That would have been a bizarre response to my teenage angst. But that is what our government, in the name of ""identify[ing] threats before they emerge,"" is now encouraging. Under a pilot program announced this fall, the U.S. government is tasking local American Muslim communities to monitor the opinions and noncriminal behaviors of their members, especially youth. Under the moniker of ""Countering Violent Extremism,"" communities are being asked to identify individuals who, based on factors including their political beliefs and behavior, could pose a threat. Some of these individuals will then be counseled or diverted to community-run social programs. Others could be referred to the police or FBI. That approach may sound innocuous. But it sets American Muslim teenagers apart, stigmatizes them as potential terrorists, and drives a dividing line between them and their non-Muslim peers. It subjects them to the suspicions and conjecture of local mosque elders. It places enormous trust in the judgment of these local community ""partners"" about whether and when to turn matters over to law enforcement. That is especially dangerous given the FBI's record of using undercover agents and paid informants to target gullible young men in terrorism sting operations, despite their lack of ability or pre-existing intention to engage in criminal activity. Needless to say, the government's aim isn't to locate every angst-ridden Muslim teenager. Its goal is to identify individuals who may eventually plan terrorist activity or join armed groups operating, for instance, in Syria and Iraq. But in addition to advising communities to be on the watch for individuals who take steps to engage in this behavior, the government has also suggested they self-police based on malleable ""indicators"" and ""predictors"" of violence. There is tremendous risk of abuse and mistake in any program that tries to predict future criminals, including terrorists. Empirical studies show that violent threats cannot be predicted by any religious, ideological, ethnic, or racial profiling. The evidence suggests that there is no direct link among religious observance, radical ideas, and violent acts. Some of the theories underlying the government's approach caution just that, but they nevertheless advise law enforcement--and now, American Muslim community ""partners""--to connect the dots linking an individuals' noncriminal behavior, his ideas, and his attitudes. That kind of monitoring shrinks the space for free expression by creating an atmosphere where people fear they must watch what they say and how they act, lest it be reported. It also denies what it is to grow up. As a teenager, I became angry and difficult. I disappeared on weekends. I chatted online for hours as my family ate dinner downstairs. I wasn't a violent terrorist in the making. But under the government's program, community members will be encouraged to monitor these behaviors and intervene with teens who engage in them. Yet not only were my growing pains a poor predictor for any tendency toward violence, they were a part of my struggle to understand myself and who I wanted to be. Freedom to explore your beliefs and identity isn't just a core value of our democracy--it's a basic need of any teenager. The government has a legitimate role to play in identifying actual evidence of criminal activity. But we should all be able to openly discuss and debate, for example, ISIS and U.S. military responses, without fear of being reported for suspicious beliefs or behavior. The Justice Department should know better. But it has not established rules barring local U.S. attorneys and FBI agents--who are leading efforts in some cities--from asking communities to monitor First Amendment-protected beliefs and activities. Particularly in the absence of clear rules, communities eager to assist law enforcement are likely to over-report on the political opinions and religious beliefs of their members--and the Justice Department could use that information for surveillance and prosecution purposes. The White House, which is promoting these efforts, has not even established a mechanism to oversee them and track these impacts. There are ways to engage with American Muslim communities that are more effective and rights-respecting. They require the government to give up approaches to counterterrorism that treat American Muslims as inherently suspect and single them out for monitoring based on their faith, race, or ethnicity. I grew up in a country rife with civil rights problems. I discussed, debated, and challenged them--without incurring government scrutiny. It is the kind of freedom everyone deserves."

The recurring question, even now, is: What happened? Unemployment is down, and Republicans are unpopular. How did Democrats lose so badly? The latest answer comes from National Journal's Charlie Cook, who blames the drubbing on a series of bad choices from Democrats and the president, stretching back to the beginning of the present administration. ""In mid-summer 2009, polls universally showed that Americans wanted the president, along with the overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, to focus on the economy and job creation,"" he writes. ""Instead, in its infinite wisdom, Congress chose to focus almost exclusively and obsessively on health care reform."" Cook grants that health care reform was a ""worthy objective,"" but he sees the decision as a mistake. ""Voters saw little action that would have turned the economy around and created jobs for many working- and middle-class Americans. Their struggle continues to this day, and it cost Democrats their Senate majority last week."" There's no doubt that economic anxiety drove last Tuesday's results. ""People are deeply suspicious that government can deliver on these problems,"" says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman in a conversation with Greg Sargent of the Washington Post. ""And they are not wrong. We've been promising that government can be a tool to improve people's economic situation for decades, and by and large, it hasn't happened."" But the other idea in Cook's diagnosis--that a ""focus"" on the economy would have saved Democratic prospects--is ludicrous. Substantively, another stimulus wasn't in the cards in the summer of 2009, when Democrats moved to climate change and health care reform. Indeed, the first stimulus--the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--was a huge political undertaking that strained the Democratic coalition, from disputes between liberals and moderates on the size of the stimulus to the fight to get it through the Senate, which almost failed. To build unity and break a GOP filibuster, supporters trimmed the bill for the most conservative Democrats--who feared political attacks at home--and did the same for the three Republicans who joined the push, Sens. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine. The party was exhausted. Blue-dog Democrats were loath to spend more on stimulus, and the administration didn't see the need--at $787 billion, they thought the law was big enough to do the job. It would be a year before the White House saw the need for another stimulus package--and given the backlash to the ARRA and other efforts to save the economy--it's not clear it could have passed, even if Democrats put health care and climate on the sidelines. Of course, that doesn't mean Democrats couldn't have talked about the economy more. Obama could have kept a rhetorical focus on economic growth even as he went for other agenda items. And likewise, for this year, Democrats could have used more populist rhetoric to describe their agenda and their accomplishments. But there's no evidence this would have changed outcomes in either 2010 or 2014. In part because of the structure of both elections--red-state contests in electorates that favor Republicans--and in part because of the material reality for ordinary voters. Put another way, talking about the economy and using populist language doesn't change the reality of mass foreclosures and stagnant wages. ""The fact remains that incomes for most Americans aren't growing very fast and haven't been for years,"" writes David Leonhardt for the New York Times. ""Median inflation-adjusted income last year was still $2,100 lower than when President Obama took office in 2009--and $3,600 lower than when President George W. Bush took office in 2001."" Democrats, he says, lack a short-term plan to help the middle class. And the ideas they have--like infrastructure spending, raising the minimum wage, and increasing education--are either indirect or take years to come to fruition. According to Cook, there was a chance to do more in 2009. But it wasn't a more public ""focus"" on the economy, which wouldn't have helped anyone, even if it looked good; it was housing relief. As David Dayen notes for Salon, the administration could have pushed mass refinancing through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as another kind of economic stimulus. ""This was one of the major fiscal policy tools available to the Administration that didn't require additional spending,"" he writes. ""[T]he Federal Reserve had lowered interest rates, it was merely up to Fannie and Freddie to take advantage of it."" A world where hundreds of thousands of Americans kept their homes because of Democrats is--potentially--one where Republicans don't win waves in two consecutive midterm elections. For now, a Republican-controlled Congress means Democrats will have an impossible time winning any legislation, much less moves to distribute the gains of our economic growth to ordinary people. But that doesn't mean the party should sit on its hands. Now--as would-be presidential candidates build their platforms and portfolios--is the time to propose new ideas for ending wage stagnation. The time is right to propose something that lives on the edge of the possible, like a new flat Social Security benefit for all retirees or an expansion and reform of the Earned Income Tax Credit that includes middle-class families. Both would boost incomes, and neither is far away from the mainstream of the Democratic Party. The only question is whether Democrats have the courage to stick their necks out for something new, something that gives voters a plan to support, or if they'll just resign the conversation to Republicans and wonder why they keep losing."	What Could the Democrats Have Done Differently?
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/tim_scott_won_south_carolina_s_senate_seat_the_first_black_republican_senator.html	"Since the beginning of the Obama era, we've seen the rise of a group of black Republicans, including figures like Allen West, Herman Cain, and Ben Carson, who defined themselves with extreme politics and outlandish rhetoric. Each was a flash in the pan--popular with conservative audiences but irrelevant to everyone else. Tim Scott was the exception. A South Carolina state legislator who became a congressman--the first black Republican representative from the state since 1897--Scott has been in the U.S. Senate since 2013, when Gov. Nikki Haley chose him to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Jim DeMint. Last Tuesday, Scott completed his first campaign as a senator, and he won, entering history as the first elected black senator from the South since Reconstruction. It's worth a little background. Before his turn to national prominence, Scott had a modest history in South Carolina politics. He served on the Charleston City Council for 14 years until 2008, when he won a seat in the state House of Representatives. In 2010, following a vacancy, he announced a run for the 1st Congressional District, which includes his Charleston stomping grounds as well as most of the South Carolina coastline. Scott entered the primary as a Tea Party politician. He opposed the Affordable Care Act and immigration reform, called for a flat tax, and demanded a balance budget amendment be added to the Constitution. On the strength of his campaign and connections to then-Sen. DeMint, he earned wide attention from national conservative groups, with endorsements from Sarah Palin, Eric Cantor, and Mike Huckabee. He won the primary, beating his opponent Paul Thurmond--son of Strom--by 36 points (68 percent to 32 percent) and walloping the Democrat in the general election. Scott was a model Republican House member. He opposed the 2011 debt ceiling deal and the military intervention in Libya. He introduced a bill to strip the National Labor Relations Board of its power to stop employers from punishing workers who join unions by relocating, and another to deny food stamps to families whose incomes were lowered because a family member was participating in a strike. In the Senate, the 49-year-old Scott has followed a similar path, joining the Republican minority on most issues, pushing South Carolina's interests (especially around military installations and veterans) and pursuing his own agenda, which is anti-labor and anti-spending. At the same time, Scott's political orthodoxy belies his overall persona. He's not a firebrand. He doesn't denounce President Obama or indulge the harsh rhetoric of other black conservatives, who win huge applause with attacks on the so-called ""big government plantation"" of the Democratic Party. Instead, he's a happy warrior who connects to audiences with stories and humor, building a sense of shared agreement, not shared anger. ""When I eat my Haagen-Dazs ice cream,"" he joked during a riff against calorie labeling at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, ""I want to enjoy those 1,292 calories, and all 100 grams of fat, in one sitting."" That's not to say Scott can't employ the language of Sen. Ted Cruz and other more dogmatic conservatives. He just tends to avoid it. His preferred conservatism is less ideological and more practical, the kind that's informed by experience more than anything. ""My journey has been filled with potholes--I hit them all,"" said Scott during a 2012 speech to the Republican National Committee, ""But in America a kid born anywhere at anytime can rise to the level that he or she wants to go."" Scott recounted the story of a mentor who helped him as a struggling teenager, and who told him he could ""think his way out of poverty"" and achieve success. His message is focused on education, entreprenuership, and self-reliance. ""Education and hard work are the closest things to magic,"" is a typical Scott-ism, reflective of his entire approach to politics. With that said, Scott isn't pioneering a new kind of conservatism as much as he's channelling an old tradition. Specifically, Scott is speaking in a language of black conservatism that would be familiar to figures like Booker T. Washington. ""Every persecuted individual and race should get much consolation out of the great human law, which is universal and eternal, that merit, no matter under what skin found, is in the long run, recognized and rewarded,"" wrote Washington in Up From Slavery, articulating a belief that could count Scott as an adherent. That is a genuine contrast with other black conservatives, like Allen West, who traffic in a movement conservatism untethered from the black community. Go to a black church or barbershop, and you'll be hard-pressed to find Republican-style boilerplate on taxes and ""tyranny."" But you will hear people talk about self-reliance and community empowerment. Which raises a question: If Tim Scott speaks in terms of a distinctly black conservatism, then why is he unpopular with actual black voters, who overwhelmingly voted against him in last Tuesday's election? Part of the answer is partisanship. Black Americans tend to hold more liberal views on government and are inclined to support Democrats, even if Republicans have a black candidate. Barring an extraordinary turn in South Carolina politics, there's little chance Scott will ever win a substantial number of black voters. But like any other group, black voters respond to rhetoric as much as ideology, and there, Scott has a problem. Scott doesn't just echo Booker T. Washington in his language, he echoes him in his hands-off approach to racial injustice. The black conservatism of Washington doesn't have a critique of white society--it focuses inward on the concerns of the community. In the same way, Scott has said little on the racial controversies and civil rights issues of the last four years, from the killings of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis to the death of Michael Brown and the explosion of anger and rage in Ferguson, Mo. It's possible these omissions have harmed him with black South Carolinians, who might agree with him on an issue like education, but aren't sure that he'll represent their particular interests as black Americans. But while this silence might hurt Scott with blacks, there's a good chance it helps him with whites. It's rare for black politicans to win statewide office, and it's obviously rarer for them to win seats to the U.S. Senate; since Emancipation, only five blacks (including Scott) have been elected to the upper chamber of Congress. One reason for this--besides simple racism--is that black politicians tend to represent black constituencies: Black mayors lead black cities, and black lawmakers are from black districts. In addition to material disadvantages--this often puts black politicians outside important donor networks, for example--it creates a key political problem: Because blacks are much more liberal than the median voter, black politicians are more likely to be outside of the political mainstream, making a statewide bid more difficult. Put another way, the more a black politician is associated with black politics, the less likely she'll escape city- and district-level politics. And the converse is also true--the less a black politician is associated with black politics, the more likely it is he'll succeed beyond the local level. I should say that this goes beyond Scott. Before Barack Obama was a national name, he was a University of Chicago law professor and state senator running against Rep. Bobby Rush for a House seat in a heavily black district. He lost, and afterward helped gerrymander his senate district to include more white voters, giving him a better path to the U.S. Senate. But what if he had won? Could Obama have made his way to statewide office from a House district in the South Side of Chicago? Or would he have been stuck, limited by the liberalism of his community?* Given his start in Newark, N.J.--a mostly black, low-income city--you could call Sen. Cory Booker the exception to this dynamic. Or maybe not. Almost immediately after becoming mayor, Booker worked to raise his national profile, regularly appearing in media and arguably trying to untether his political identity from the city he was leading. The strategy worked, though at the cost of his reputation in Newark itself--the former mayor was all but repudiated in the most recent city election. Tim Scott is a talented politician. But if he were a South Carolina Democrat--representing black voters--he may have never made it out of the statehouse, much less into Congress. His rise was faciliated by his Republican affiliation, his largely white constituency, and an almost colorblind conservatism. Ironically, his historic position as the first black senator from the Deep South since Reconstruction might only be possible because he doesn't represent a black constituency. Which is to say that the examples of Scott, Obama, and Booker raise a question: Can ambitious black politicians represent black people and thrive? Or is blackness a stigma they have to escape? Correction, Nov. 11, 2014: This article originally misstated that Barack Obama ran for state senate after losing a House race. Obama joined the Illinois State Senate in 1997, three years before running for the House of Representatives in 2000. (Return.)"	The Secret of Tim Scott's Success? White Voters.
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/ed_gillispie_super_pacs_virginia_senate_race_why_didn_t_anyone_help_him.html	"This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C. When Ed Gillespie decided to run against Democratic incumbent Mark Warner for a Virginia U.S. Senate seat, his bid was universally hailed as a long shot. No one, though, thought the American Crossroads co-founder, former Republican National Committee chairman, and ex-lobbyist would have trouble attracting big money. Conventional wisdom was wrong on both counts. Gillespie--and Virginia's U.S. Senate race--turned out to be the surprise of election night. Warner, a popular former governor who routinely led in polls, claimed victory by fewer than 17,000 votes, and Republican Gillespie has yet to concede. The election could be headed for a recount. That Gillespie managed to mount such a serious challenge is particularly notable given his token support from outside groups like super PACs, nonprofits, and party committees. Gillespie's surge leaves everyone wondering if he would have upset Warner had such groups invested in Virginia's race like they did in other U.S. Senate contests from Alaska to North Carolina. ""Shame on them,"" said Howard Leach, one of only six donors to the We Can Do Better PAC, a super PAC started to support Gillespie's U.S. Senate bid. ""They should have put some money in Ed's race."" Reported outside spending on North Carolina's U.S. Senate race, the most expensive in history, was $81.2 million. The total spent on Virginia's U.S. Senate race, which appears to be the closest in the country? A measly $2.6 million. The Gillespie campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee did not respond to a request for comment. The Washington Post reported the NRSC spent $675,000 in Virginia, including $100,000 the weekend before the election. Leach gave $25,000 to the We Can Do Better PAC, which raised $140,000, most of which it spent on radio ads in late October. Leach, a businessman and investor, is a former campaign cash bundler for President George W. Bush, who later appointed him as U.S. ambassador to France. His relationship with Gillespie dates back to Gillespie's time at the helm of the RNC. ""I think very highly of Ed Gillespie as an individual,"" Leach said, adding, ""I wish that Ed had had more help."" American Crossroads and its related nonprofit, Crossroads GPS, stayed out of the race entirely. At least two of Gillespie's former lobbying clients ran ads in Senate races, but they didn't show Gillespie any love. The American Hospital Association's political action committee ran U.S. Senate-focused ads in Kansas, Alaska, Mississippi, and Arkansas during the 2014 cycle, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking service, but stayed out of Virginia. The National Association of Realtors Congressional Fund, a super PAC funded entirely by the National Association of Realtors, ran U.S. Senate-focused ads in Mississippi, Alaska, Kentucky, Michigan, and Kansas but also avoided the Senate race in Virginia. Neither organization responded to requests for comment on the election results. The biggest outside spender in the Virginia race was the Virginia Progress PAC, a pro-Warner super PAC that spent $1.8 million and aired about 3,400 ads, or one out of every eight in the race, according media data. The National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action spent the most money pushing for Gillespie: $410,000, still less than a quarter as much as the Virginia Progress PAC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Virginia ""is a rich state for us in terms of members and supporters and donors and we felt that we could make an impact,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA. ""And we could make an impact in a race where there was a clear distinction between Gillespie and Warner. Gillespie would be someone who would support us through thick and thin and Warner ... hadn't."" The NRA paid for an August mailing, and it also made phone calls on Gillespie's behalf in October. Polls consistently showed Gillespie trailing well behind Warner. That and the possibility of the expense of playing in Virginia's media market may have played a part in discouraging other outside groups and donors. Warren Stephens, chairman and president of Little Rock, Arkansas-based Stephens Inc., also gave $25,000 to the We Can Do Better PAC. Stephens, a major political donor, gave more to other groups, including $2 million to American Crossroads, because Arkansas was one of Crossroads' prime target states, he said. ""I donated to [We Can Do Better PAC] because I've known Ed Gillespie a long time and he's a nice man,"" Stephens said. ""I think I'm probably like everyone else. I didn't think he had a chance."" Stephens said he doesn't remember who approached him to contribute to the We Can Do Better PAC, but no other group brought up Virginia's U.S. Senate race when soliciting him. Stephens said he won't second-guess why outside groups, including American Crossroads, didn't put money into the Virginia Senate race. Still, ""when you have a good candidate maybe the lesson there is just go ahead and support him no matter what,"" he said. Steven Law, president of American Crossroads, was not available to be interviewed, a group spokesman said. Law personally contributed $1,000 to Gillespie's campaign on Oct. 17, according to Federal Election Commission records. In an emailed statement, the group said, ""Republicans benefited from an unprecedented late-breaking wave and an abundance of top-flight candidates like Ed Gillespie. The Senate battleground was so broad this year that we would have had to shift resources from other close races to try to take advantage of any new opportunities in the campaign's closing days."" Gillespie's campaign reported raising about $6.8 million and spending slightly less than $6 million through Oct. 15. Warner's campaign reported raising nearly $16.4 million and spending $13.7 million, more than twice as much as Gillespie. The Gillespie campaign was also out-advertised. Warner ran more than one-half the TV ads in the race, according to the Center's media analysis. Gillespie ran slightly more than one-third. The data shows no outside group aired a TV ad in the race after Oct. 11. It's impossible to know whether more outside spending would have tipped the race Gillespie's way, but it seems likely people will write bigger checks for him next time. ""What he told me ... was, I've studied the race and it's winnable and I've never studied a race harder. I'm sitting there going, 'OK, sure, Ed, there's no way you can win the race, but I know you, I'm behind you, we'll do something,' "" Stephens said. ""Lo and behold, when Ed Gillespie tells me something going forward, you'd better believe I'm going to listen to him."""	Why Did No One Listen to Ed Gillespie?

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/obama_immigration_plan_why_it_s_time_to_end_birthright_citizenship.html	"Whether you agree or disagree with President Obama's use of his executive authority to temporarily shield 3.8 million unauthorized immigrants from the threat of deportation (on top of the 1.5 million he shielded in 2012), this much is true: The Obama administration has permanently altered the immigration debate. The president and his lawyers are right to insist that his executive action has not granted these immigrants ""legal status."" Rather, it allows unauthorized immigrants to apply for a three-year reprieve from removal, which comes with a work permit. Though many conservatives, myself included, have questioned the wisdom of this unilateral action, the executive branch is very powerful in our constitutional scheme, and I don't doubt that his actions will be vindicated by the courts. So no, I don't intend to quibble over whether the president had the right to take this step. But I do want to discuss what happens next. One can imagine a scenario in which the president announced this three-year reprieve while also telling unauthorized immigrants to pack their bags: OK, guys, I'm giving you three years to get your affairs in order, but after that you're out of here. Instead, he emphasized the virtues of immigrants, lawful and otherwise. ""These people--our neighbors, our classmates, our friends--they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life,"" Obama said. ""They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to America's success."" Is that really true? It's not obvious to me that impoverished people who choose to cross the border illegally, or to overstay their visas, are thinking first and foremost about contributing to America's success. My guess is that most of them are keen to take advantage of the place premium, i.e., the fact that wages for the same work are much higher in a rich, productive country like the United States than in a poor, less productive one, like Nepal or Peru. I'd also guess that while these women and men are generally grateful for the opportunity to live and work in the United States, they care more about their own families, in the U.S. and abroad, than about some abstract American national community. (This is why remittances from immigrants toiling in rich countries to the relatives they've left behind in poor countries vastly outweigh the overseas development assistance handed out by stingy Western governments.) I don't mean to suggest that immigrants are bad people. I just think that they're ordinary, run-of-the-mill people--a mix of sinners and saints, like the rest of us, who care more about their kith and kin than perfect strangers. Regardless, the president's rhetoric leaves the strong impression that he sees this reprieve as a stopgap measure that will pave the way for a permanent welcome to most of today's unauthorized immigrant population. As Ramesh Ponnuru observes, Obama didn't give us any principled reason why unauthorized immigrants who've been here for a while should stay while those who haven't should go. But again, let's leave that aside. The president's intentions are clear: He wants to grant certain classes of unauthorized immigrants legal status and he doesn't have the power to do so unilaterally, so he's doing the next-best thing. Fair enough. There was something else the president left out of his announcement, though. As we bring large numbers of unauthorized immigrants in from the shadows, so to speak, we must confront a few important facts. Unauthorized immigrants are, with very few exceptions, heartbreakingly poor. They tend to have extremely low levels of educational attainment, and workers with limited skills have been taking a beating in the U.S. labor market for decades. All the available evidence suggests that giving unauthorized immigrants the legal right to work in the U.S. will increase their wages, but not by much. And the children of less-skilled immigrants tend to have poor educational and labor market outcomes--indeed, there is some evidence that is true for the grandchildren of less-skilled immigrants, too. Does this mean that I oppose bringing unauthorized immigrants in from the shadows? No, it does not. What it means is that I take that task very seriously, because I understand that granting unauthorized immigrants legal status--or, for now, temporary quasi-legal status--entails a generational challenge. Given the scale of this challenge, and the fact that today's unauthorized less-skilled immigrants are vulnerable to economic competition from future less-skilled immigrants, we also ought to declare that enough is enough: This will be the last less-skilled wave that we will absorb for the indefinite future, and that this will also be the last amnesty. To demonstrate our seriousness on this front, we should take a step that countries like Australia, Britain, France, Ireland, and New Zealand have already taken: We should end automatic birthright citizenship. If it is wrong to tear families apart by deporting the parents of U.S. citizens--and it really is wrong, in case you were wondering--we ought to establish that only the children of those who are living in the United States as citizens or lawful permanent residents will be granted citizenship at birth. Instead of inviting future waves of unauthorized immigrants by, among other things, allowing birthright citizenship to stand, we should ensure that the less-skilled immigrants who already live among us don't become part of a permanent American underclass. The only way to achieve this goal will be to commit vast resources to upgrading their skills and those of their children, and yes, that will almost certainly mean higher taxes. There was a throwaway line in President Obama's Thursday night address that caught my eye. ""Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government, and at risk any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids."" This is a moving sentiment, but also a confusing one. Having been raised by a single mother who faced more than her fair share of struggles, surely the president doesn't put those who don't take a dime from the government on a pedestal over those who do. The reason the immigrant fathers in question aren't ""taking a dime from the government"" is that, with the exception of public education for their children and a few other benefits, they're generally ineligible for the wage subsidies and work supports that we as a country provide to poor people to better their lives, and to give their children a fighting chance to succeed. For a rich country, the United States has an unusually high level of food insecurity--a polite term for hunger--in part because hunger is so common among unauthorized immigrant families. That's because unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for SNAP benefits, nor are their children unless those kids are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents themselves. When we bring unauthorized immigrants in from the shadows, guess what: Those immigrant fathers who haven't been taking a dime from the government will have every right to ask why their hitherto non-citizen, non-permanent-resident children should be denied full bellies at taxpayer expense.* President Obama never discussed the taxes that you and I will have to pay to guarantee that today's unauthorized immigrants will become full participants in our society, or the challenges they will face as the pace of automation accelerates and people with limited skills struggle to find their economic footing. He celebrated our immigrant heritage without addressing how the immigration slowdown of the 20th century helped earlier generations of immigrants climb the economic ladder. He told us a feel-good story that left out the hard work to come.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/obama_immigration_overhaul_the_most_likely_scenarios_chart.html	President Obama is set to announce his long-promised immigration overhaul on Thursday night, an executive action that is expected to grant temporary legal status to as many as 5 million unauthorized immigrants. How the plan reaches that total, though, will depend on where Obama sets the bar for entry into each eligible group. Take parents of U.S. citizens, one of the largest demographics likely to be affected by the president's plan. If Obama were to expand that group to include parents of U.S. citizens and green card holders, the number of eligible immigrants would grow by more than 1 million. Within that group, where Obama sets the threshold for how long someone needs to have lived the country--15 years? 10? Five?--will have a sweeping effect on how many people qualify. The chart below, based on data from the Migration Policy Institute, will give you an idea of just how many immigrants would be protected under a variety of combinations of the most likely criteria. Alongside these scenarios, Obama is also considering relaxing the eligibility requirements for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which he created in 2012 to allow so-called Dreamers to apply for work permits and reprieves from deportation. Eliminating the program's maximum age of 30, for example, would make 1.1 million additional people eligible for the program, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

We already know the broad brushstrokes: The plan will shield somewhere around 4 or 5 million unauthorized immigrants from the threat of deportation. But the details matter, both in Washington and in the real world, where more than a third of the nation's estimated 11.7 million unauthorized immigrants may be covered by the president's executive actions. Who among that group is given a reprieve--and who is not--will be decided by a series of smaller decisions the president must make. Our video illustrates how the details of Obama's plan could mean the difference between a work permit and the threat of deportation for a huge number of people.

But we do know what Missouri state authorities expect--chaos. ""Regardless of the outcomes of the federal and state criminal investigations, there is the possibility of expanded unrest,"" said Gov. Jay Nixon in an executive order declaring a state of emergency in Missouri. ""The state of Missouri will be prepared to appropriately respond to any reaction to these announcements."" To that end, Nixon is empowered under the order to mobilize and deploy the National Guard. Other officials have followed his lead. In Ferguson itself, for example, Mayor James Knowles has asked residents to ""prepare for the worst."" It's likely that, when Nixon says ""unrest,"" he's referring to the night after Brown's death, when a group of protesters burned down a QuikTrip convenience store and damaged nearby businesses, stealing goods and using the chaos to their advantage. But while many Ferguson residents were disturbed by the damage done during the earliest protests, there's anger over the choice to declare a state of emergency, and rightfully so. Remember, the initial Ferguson protests--which began the afternoon Brown was killed--weren't violent. Instead, at first dozens, then hundreds of people gathered to peacefully protest the shooting and demand answers for why Brown's body was allowed to lie in the sun for four hours before police took action. If there was unrest that day, it was less because of the protesters and more because of police. As soon as residents met to protest Brown's death that day, police brought scores of reinforcements. The Ferguson Police Department called in more than 100 officers from other jurisdictions, with some officers wielding dogs and shotguns. Given the circumstances--an angry community that wanted answers over the death of a teenager--it was an overreaction that engendered mistrust and worsened the situation. We didn't see violence until the next night, when tension boiled over and riots broke out near where Brown was killed. But they were contained, and when protesting resumed the next day, rioting had ceased. Indeed, the community cracked down, with protesters protecting stores from potential looters. But these peaceful protests meant nothing for the police response, which was as disproportionate as it was in the beginning. For almost a week--despite no further violence from Ferguson residents--officers met protesters with tear gas, armored vehicles, sound cannons, and assault weapons. They closed off neighborhoods, blocked streets, and harassed journalists. They escalated the situation, refusing every chance to defuse tensions and retreating from the aggressive approach only when it was clear the world was watching. This isn't to say that violent protesters didn't matter, or that property damage wasn't important. But over the two weeks of the initial Ferguson protests, the vast majority of violence toward people--the violence that counts--came from police and law enforcement. Remove them from the equation--or at least, tone down their response--and you have a calmer Ferguson. Indeed, it's not hard to imagine a scenario in which police could have been forthright with residents after Brown's shooting, defusing the protests before they could even begin. Put simply, the unrest in Ferguson was as much the fault of the police as it was the protesters'. But by declaring a ""state of emergency"" aimed at residents of Ferguson and the broader St. Louis County, Gov. Nixon obscures this fact and smears the community, pretending that it's solely responsible for anything that happens in the wake of a grand jury announcement and all but giving license to law enforcement to reprise its draconian response. What we need from Nixon is a measured, sensitive response that grasps the dynamics of the initial protests and can see the mistakes of the first response. But what we're likely to get--if residents respond to the grand jury with more demonstrations--is a return of the ""unrest"" of this summer, where the police are out of control, and authorities refuse to stop them.

Obama has already made it clear that he won't be waiting for their decision. Instead, he is going to spend his final two years in office exploring the frontiers of executive power. Last week brought two expressions of this new posture: the secretly negotiated agreement Obama announced in China with President Xi Jinping, and a statement he released on net neutrality that advocated regulating Internet service providers as ""common carriers."" As soon as this week, the president is expected to move ahead on a third, more politically volatile issue of allowing millions of illegal residents to stay and work legally in the United States. The first announcement provoked Republican catcalls. The second made them howl. The third is rendering them apoplectic. At the extreme end, Rep. Matt Salmon, a Republican from the border state of Arizona, says Obama's amnesty plan would constitute an ""impeachable offense."" Obama's rationale for taking matters into his own hands is that all three are issues on which the GOP majority has refused to act. On climate change, House Republicans have used Chinese inaction as a pretext for doing nothing to reduce emissions themselves. On net neutrality, they have declined to give the Federal Communications Commission the authority it needs to prevent cable companies from creating fast and slow lanes on the Internet. On immigration, they have tabled comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would address the status of approximately 12 million undocumented long-term residents. Presidential systems, as opposed to parliamentary ones, produce executive-legislative conflict by their nature--see under: Latin America. The irony is that it is Democrats, who dominated the legislative branch between the 1950s and the 1990s, who have historically been most opposed to unilateral action by the executive branch. At the end of the Nixon years, the liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger decried the rise of an ""imperial presidency"" with its expanding zones of secrecy and dubious assertions of executive privilege. Through the Reagan years, Democrats opposed unapproved covert action and demanded respect for Congress's constitutional power to declare war. After 9/11, they again complained about George W. Bush's broad claims of authority around national security and his practice of appending secret signing statements to legislation he didn't like, reserving the right to ignore it. Now the shoe is on the other foot. It is the Republicans who dominate Congress and expect to do so going forward, whereas Democrats hold the White House and hope that Hillary Clinton will retain it for them in 2016. A more powerful presidency that can navigate around congressional obstinacy is in their interest, not just in the short term, but for the foreseeable future. This logic has finally persuaded a liberal president whose previous job was teaching constitutional law, and who did not come to office expecting to be denounced as a dictator. As recently as last year, Obama insisted that he lacked the legal authority to do what he now proposes on immigration. ""I'm not the emperor of the United States,"" he said on one occasion. ""My job is to execute laws that are passed."" The president's recent actions stand in contrast to those of Bill Clinton, who after losing control of Congress in 1994, pursued poll-tested micro-initiatives calculated to show his relevance without upsetting anyone. Obama is invoking expanded authority on issues that do matter, and that are meant to provoke the other side. When it comes to immigration, he intends to make nonenforcement of the law his official policy. He would expand a program to stop issuing deportation orders against illegal residents who were brought to the United States as children, and against parents with children who are citizens. These steps could allow up to 5 million people to stay legally. Congress is already reacting to this by challenging the president's claim of authority in various ways. There's talk again of shutting down the government by holding up annual appropriation bills and of holding presidential appointments hostage. But those steps will highlight the system's current dysfunction, underscoring the rationale for Obama's embrace of unilateralism. A smarter way to respond would be for Congress to assert its own Constitutional authority by finally passing legislation on the issues in question. Sending the president bills on climate change, net neutrality, and immigration--even bills he might veto--would undermine the president's case for acting on his own. A version of this article appeared online in the Financial Times."	The Smart Republican Response to Obama's Executive Action
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/president_obama_s_executive_action_on_immigration_is_a_gop_loss_republicans.html	"One of the great ironies of the Obama administration is that--on several occasions--it was pushed to the left by Republicans. The Affordable Care Act didn't have to have the Medicaid expansion--a huge liberal reform of a major government program. It didn't have to have the generous subsidies, the ""cadillac tax"" on expensive, high-income insurance plans, or the broad coverage for birth control and other contraceptives. At any point during the health care debate--which lasted from the spring of 2009 to the beginning of 2010--Republicans could have bargained with Democrats to remove or weaken those provisions for their support on the final bill. And the White House would have gone along. The president wanted bipartisan support, and with his post-partisan faith still strong, he would have sacrificed a lot to get it. But Republicans refused. Instead, they fought a war, attacking reform, denying their participation--and in the process--marking the right of the Democratic Party as the conservative boundary of discussion over the bill. It's why, after President Obama finally signed the Affordable Care Act into law, former Bush speechwriter David Frum called the occasion ""the most crushing legislative defeat"" for Republicans since the 1960s. ""Barack Obama badly wanted Republican votes for his plan. Could we have leveraged his desire to align the plan more closely with conservative views,"" asked Frum, ""To finance it without redistributive taxes on productive enterprise--without weighing so heavily on small business--without expanding Medicaid? Too late now. They are all the law."" This dynamic--Republicans losing their shot for more conservative policy at the cost of some cooperation--played out with entitlement reform (a small concession on taxes would have won a ""grand bargain"" on Medicare and Social Security), and environmental policy (instead of a market-based ""cap and trade,"" Republicans will get new regulations and a more bureaucratic approach). And now it is about to play out with immigration, too. Last week, administration officials leaked the president's plan to overhaul the nation's immigration system through executive fiat. President Obama, writes the New York Times, ""intends to order changes that will significantly refocus the activities of the government's 12,000 immigration agents."" The most important part of the order is a change that gives protection to millions of unauthorized immigrants, allowing ""many parents of children who are American citizens or legal residents to obtain legal work documents and no longer worry about being discovered, separated from their families and sent away."" In addition, new protections could include unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States as children--the ""DREAMers""--as well as agricultural workers who entered the country illegally but have spent years in farms and factories. According to an analysis from the Migration Policy Institute, this plan--which might build on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program--could reach more than 5 million people, depending on the exact criteria the administration applies. Compared to the Senate immigration bill passed last year--or the guidelines crafted by House Republicans the same year--the White House plan is less far reaching. At the same time, it lacks the border security and enforcement mechanisms of the bipartisan and Republican proposals. Under the president's plan, millions of immigrants will receive legal protection without any of the requirements of the bipartisan Senate bill, from thousands of new border and customs agents, to billions of dollars in new enforcement funding, to strict triggers for when unauthorized immigrants are even eligible to apply for legal status and citizenship. Liberals will have made an important policy advance--and one likely to stick, judging by similar executive orders by previous presidents--without making substantive concessions to conservative priorities. I wouldn't call it a defeat on the same scale of the Affordable Care Act, but it is a defeat. Democrats weren't going to relent on immigration. Latinos are an important part of the Democratic coalition and key to the party's effort to change the partisan dynamic in states like North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, and Arizona. And while Latino disappointment wasn't determinative in this year's elections, it's dangerous for Democrats to delay action through 2016, both on the merits--there's no guarantee of immigration reform in 2017--and on the politics; absent action on immigration, Latinos might just sit out the presidential election, dealing a blow to Democrats in key states like Florida, Colorado, and Nevada. (To that point, it's no surprise that lawmakers from the latter two have urged Obama to move with executive action on immigration.) Given the high priority for immigration reform, there's no question Democrats could have worked with House Republicans to craft a counterpart to the Senate bill. And indeed, there's a good chance they would have made even more concessions if it guaranteed a vote. As with health care, Republicans could have gotten more conservative policy than they otherwise will if they had backed down from their relentless opposition. Now, the obvious reply to this is that the president's executive action is lawless--that it's outside of the bounds of presidential power. And if that's true, then it's hard to pin the outcome on Republicans; unlike health care--where Democrats really could act regardless of what Republicans did--immigration legislation is only possible with GOP cooperation. In normal circumstances, the president backs down when he loses a legislative fight. If, instead, he responds with an illegal executive order, then it's unfair to point the finger at the opposition and say, you did this. But, GOP assertions aside, there's no evidence the president's plan is illegal. Could it create a bad precedent for the exercise of executive authority? Yes. Is it, like Ross Douthat argues for the New York Times, a little hypocritical? Probably. But does it go beyond the president's constitutional authority? Not at all. Which is to say that, when it comes to the prospect of a new, more liberal immigration regime, Republicans have themselves to blame. With a few concessions, they could have gotten more enforcement and tighter security. Instead, we'll have legal status for millions of immigrants, with few Republican fingerprints."	Why Republicans Were Their Own Worst Enemy on Immigration
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/obamacare_faq_everything_you_need_to_know_about_why_conservatives_want_to.html	"Though the Affordable Care Act passed into law in 2010, conservatives continue to fight it at every opportunity: in the courts, in state legislatures, and in Congress. It's a safe bet that as the race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination kicks off, a cavalcade of Republican hopefuls will torment innocent Iowans with tales of how they've fought Obamacare in the past and why they're the ones who can finally drive a stake through its heart. But if you don't read the conservative press, you might have no idea why those of us on the right side of the political spectrum are so worked up about Obamacare. To promote cross-ideological understanding, I've prepared this little FAQ. Why do conservatives oppose Obamacare?
Not all conservatives are alike, and there are at least some, like Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute, who believe Obamacare should be reformed and not repealed. But as a general rule, conservatives oppose the law and would like to see it repealed for several reasons. First, some conservatives oppose it for the same reason that liberals favor it: Through the Medicaid expansion and the exchanges, it subsidizes insurance coverage for people of modest means by raising taxes on people of less-modest means and (in theory) by curbing the growth in Medicare spending. Conservatives tend not to be enthusiastic about redistribution, and they're particularly skeptical about redistribution that isn't transparent. Second, there is a widespread belief on the right that the main driver of the federal government's fiscal woes is the soaring cost of health entitlements, like Medicare and Medicaid. Champions of Obamacare claim that the law will improve matters by encouraging innovative approaches to paying providers, which will yield big efficiency gains. Conservatives are skeptical. They believe that instead of driving efficiency gains, Obamacare's highly prescriptive approach to insurance will stymie cost-saving innovation and that its costs will soar as it expands. Instead of tackling the health entitlement problem, say conservatives, Obamacare will make matters worse. Third, most conservatives believe that America needs a system of market-based health reform that will be cheaper, less coercive, and less prescriptive than Obamacare, and they're convinced that the only way to get from here to there is to repeal Obamacare root and branch. The problem, as we'll see, is that there's not a lot of consensus around what an Obamacare replacement should look like. There are, of course, other reasons conservatives oppose Obamacare, but these are a good starting point. OK, got it--conservatives oppose a new spending program because they're conservatives. But why are conservatives so pissed off about Obamacare?
Many on the right believe the White House sold Obamacare dishonestly. Back in 2009, when conservatives and liberals were duking it out over President Obama's push for a new federal health care law, the president often insisted that if you like your insurance plan, you'd be able to keep it. Predictably enough, many conservatives claimed that if the president's overhaul of the U.S. health system passed, many people would lose insurance plans they like. It turns out that, as the Wall Street Journal reported last fall, White House officials debated the president's pledge because at least some of them feared that it was misleading. Eventually, the dissenters came around. ""Officials worried,"" according to the Journal, ""that delving into such details as the small number of people who might lose insurance could be confusing and would clutter the president's message."" Well, you wouldn't want to clutter the message, now would you? Then there is the matter of how the Congressional Budget Office estimated how much Obamacare would eventually cost--an issue that recently resurfaced when off-the-cuff remarks from MIT health economist Jonathan Gruber went viral. Gruber is considered one of the chief architects of Obamacare, having played a large role in the Massachusetts universal coverage plan that served as its inspiration and as a consultant to the Obama administration during the early stages of the health reform effort. His enthusiasm for Obamacare borders on the absurd--he even wrote a graphic novel touting its virtues. But his loose lips have caused headaches for the White House, and it's no wonder he's being disowned by many of his erstwhile friends. Last fall, Gruber told a smallish audience at an academic panel that the Obamacare legislation was carefully written to ensure that the CBO ""did not score the mandate as taxes."" This is a bigger deal than you might think, as one of the key reasons Bill Clinton's 1993 health reform effort failed is that it featured an astronomically high tax bill. The Obama White House had a few advantages that the Clinton White House did not. The most important one is that it was able to learn from Clintoncare's defeat. Another is that President Obama's first budget director, Peter Orszag, had just served as the head of the CBO, and so he had an excellent understanding of how the CBO would score health reform legislation. With this in mind, Michael F. Cannon of the Cato Institute, an indefatigable libertarian foe of Obamacare, observed back in 2009 that the Democrats' ""tailoring their private-sector mandates to avoid having those costs appear in the federal budget"" made Obamacare look much less expensive than it really was. When liberals say that conservatives should just accept that Obamacare is the law of the land and move on, they fail to understand that conservatives believe that Obamacare only became the law of the land because President Obama misled the public. Wait a second. Isn't Obamacare actually a Republican plan?
While Democrats were pushing for Obamacare, Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican from Wisconsin, was pushing for an ambitious Medicare reform that bore a strong family resemblance to Obamacare. Both Ryan's Medicare reform and Obamacare envisioned giving beneficiaries a subsidy that they could use to purchase insurance coverage on a regulated marketplace or exchange, with an eye toward harnessing the power of competition to hold down costs. So why did Ryan oppose Obamacare if he was so enthusiastic about this approach in Medicare? Was it because he--along with all other anti-Obamacare Republicans--is a hypocrite? Well, no. In Medicare, Ryan hoped to move a single-payer health entitlement in a more market-oriented direction. To put it crudely, the goal of Ryan's Medicare reform was to move from more socialism to less socialism. For better or for worse, there is now a consensus that the federal government should finance a large chunk of medical expenditures for all older Americans, and that's been true for decades. There is no such consensus for non-elderly adults, which is why Obamacare, which sought to move us in the direction of establishing a universal health entitlement, was so hotly contested. The problem with Obamacare, for Ryan and others on the right, is that it moved America's health system in the wrong direction, from less socialism to more socialism. Yuval Levin, the editor of the conservative policy journal National Affairs, has said that the debate over health reform is about ""which way, not how far."" That is, while wonks on both sides agree that the pre-Obamacare health system was royally screwed-up, they disagreed about how to fix it. Liberals wanted to make the system more centralized and orderly--sure, there can be competition, but only insurance plans that meet strictly defined standards set by credentialed professionals can compete. Conservatives wanted to make the system more of a free market, in which government subsidies to help people buy coverage are visible and, ideally, capped. By capping subsidies, consumers would have a strong incentive to shop wisely, and insurers and providers would be pressured into coming up with new ways to offer more value for the money. Another way of putting this: While liberals think health care is too important to leave to the messy, trial-and-error process of the free market, conservatives think a trial-and-error discovery process is the only way the health system can get better, cheaper, and smarter over time. There is nothing wrong in principle with establishing marketplaces where people can buy insurance. There are conservative plans that feature marketplaces too! Yet the Obamacare exchanges do much more than just provide a place where people can compare different plans. They shift responsibility for regulating the individual insurance market from state governments to the federal government, even in the case of the partner exchanges established by states in accordance with federal rules. The Obamacare exchanges aren't best understood as simple marketplaces, where the main role of regulators is to ensure transparency. Rather, they serve as central planning boards that establish coverage mandates and review rates. You might think that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it definitely limits opportunities to offer new types of coverage and new models for care delivery. Of course, the exchanges are only part of how Obamacare expands insurance coverage. Just as important is its mammoth expansion of Medicaid, a program that conservatives have long criticized for delivering poor health outcomes and for its joint state-federal structure, which encourages overspending. When you look at Obamacare as a law that greatly increases federal regulation of the insurance market and federal spending while doubling down on Medicaid, it should be clear that it is not ideal from a conservative perspective. But what about the individual mandate? Wasn't it dreamed up by the right-wing Heritage Foundation?
The individual mandate has a long, tortured history that Avik Roy has described in detail. Conservative wonks did devise the individual mandate as an alternative to an employer mandate, an idea that had been gaining traction for years. Many on the right feared that if employers were forced to pick up the tab for health insurance, we would see less hiring, and an individual mandate was seen as less economically harmful. It is important to understand, however, that the pre-Obamacare conversation about the individual mandate never really reached the conservative grass roots, where infringing liberty is generally seen as a no-no. Just as we can't expect that Arizona Sen. John McCain's support for cap and trade meant that Joseph J. McCoalburner also favored hiking oil prices to save the polar bears, it's not exactly a shock that the Republican masses didn't greet the idea of an individual mandate with wild enthusiasm. Moreover, conservatives have other ideas for addressing the problem that the individual mandate is meant to solve: that if you guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions will be covered, some will only buy coverage when they get sick. One idea is to provide protections for those who've been continuously insured, which would create a strong incentive to get covered early and to stay that way. More controversially, James Capretta has called for low-cost default insurance, in which state governments would automatically sign you up for cheap coverage, but you could opt out at any time. Though many conservatives balk at this kind of soft paternalism, it would almost certainly mean higher coverage levels than a weak individual mandate. Do Republicans have any ideas for replacing Obamacare, or do they intend to repeal it and just leave everyone who needs health insurance in a lurch?
There are a number of reform proposals that have been floating around over the past few years, and I expect we'll see more of them. Yuval Levin and Ramesh Ponnuru have proposed overhauling the way the tax code treats health insurance. One of the craziest things about our current system is that people with high incomes get a bigger tax subsidy from the federal government when they get health insurance through their employers than people with lower incomes do. Obamacare is scheduled to introduce the so-called Cadillac tax in 2018 to discourage employers from offering high-cost plans, but this is an indirect way of addressing the fundamental unfairness of the current system. Levin and Ponnuru, along with many others on the right, argue that this tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance should be capped and that people who don't get their health insurance through their employers should get a refundable tax credit to help them pay for coverage. Medicaid would, eventually, become an add-on payment on top of this tax credit to give poor people more help. James Capretta has gone into greater detail on how Medicaid might be transformed to make it more cost-effective. The problem with this strategy, from a conservative perspective, is that it is pretty expensive. Refundable tax credits don't grow on trees. So when three Republican senators teamed up to release their own health reform plan, broadly similar to the ideas advanced by Levin, Ponnuru, and Capretta, they limited the credit to households earning 300 percent of the federal poverty level or less, a cap that would leave out a decent number of middle-income families. Other conservatives, like Bobby Jindal, the profoundly unpopular Republican governor of Louisiana, have proposed even stingier plans, which will have a tough time passing muster in the post-Obamacare era. This is part of why the aforementioned Avik Roy has argued that conservatives should just accept that Obamacare is here to stay and that they should jiu-jitsu it into the market-oriented reform of their dreams. I'm a firm believer in scrapping Obamacare and starting over. But that's much easier said than done."	Everything You Need to Know About Why Conservatives Want to Repeal Obamacare
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/democrats_can_t_win_white_working_class_voters_the_party_is_too_closely.html	"The Democratic Party styles itself a fighter for the working class. But a substantial part of that class--the white part--wants nothing to do with it. If we count the white working class as whites without college degrees, then congressional Democrats lost them by 30 points in last week's elections, contributing to losses in states as diverse as Iowa, Maine, Colorado, North Carolina, and Florida. But then none of this is new. Democrats lost working class whites by a similar margin in 2010, with almost identical results: A wipeout of Senate seats, House districts, and governorships across the country, in states as liberal as Michigan and Wisconsin. They recovered somewhat in the presidential election--losing working-class whites by just 20 points--and winning the race (and a stronger Senate majority) as a result. Which gets to an important point: The white working class is a huge subset of Americans. ""Close to half of white men and 35-40 percent of white women in the labor force are still essentially 'working class,' "" finds liberal commentator Andrew Levison in his book The White Working Class Today. ""Their occupations are basically blue collar rather than white collar and their earnings fall far below their white collar counterparts."" And in that category are groups of reachable voters: Union members and low-skilled young workers in particular. Democrats don't have to win this group as much as they have to avoid a rout. If they can do that--and hold Republicans to a majority rather than a supermajority--then they can avoid the Republican waves of the recent midterm elections, and strengthen their presidential majority. Hence the recurring debate of how to win these voters, or at least a portion of them. In a recent feature for the Washington Monthly, for example, Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin argue that Democrats can capitalize on the generational divide in the white working class. The key fact is that ""white working class"" is a big category with a large number of different kinds of voters, including millennials, who fall to the left on most national issues. ""Today's young white working-class voters are notably more liberal on issues concerning the role of government"" than their older counterparts note Teixeira and Halpin. And significantly these young whites are ""significantly more open to rising diversity than the white working class as a whole."" The conclusion is straightforward. Democrats don't have to worry about alienating these voters with their cosmopolitanism. If they can just embrace a populist, forward thinking agenda--in which they tackle stagnation and explicitly attack the wealthy engineers of extreme income inequality--they can win these younger whites who are comfortable with diversity and want a more level society. As Noam Scheiber writes for the New Republic, commenting on Teixeira and Halpin's piece, ""The politics of this approach work not just because populism is a 'message' that a majority of voters want to hear. But because, unlike the status quo, it can actually improve their economic prospects."" Implicit in all of this is the assumption voters will believe the pitch. That they'll hear the case for stronger programs, higher minimum wages, and higher taxes on the rich, and believe Democrats are advocating for them, and not some other group. The problem is I don't think we can make that assumption. After all, working-class whites didn't leave the Democratic Party over insufficiently populist policy and rhetoric. The liberal economic reforms of 1960s--and Medicare in particular--paid benefits to white working-class families throughout the 1970s and '80s, even as the group moved to a decisive break with the Democrats. No, the proximate cause of the break was the Democratic Party's close identification with black Americans, who--after the riots of the late '60s and '70s--became identified with urban disorder and welfare. Specifically, whites were bewildered and infuriated with liberals who defended rioting communities--correctly noting the decades of deprivation and abuse that led to those violent outbursts--and pushed anti-poverty programs to address the underlying conditions. Black incomes rose while at the same time, many white incomes were beginning to stagnate or even fall. Why was the government spending our tax dollars on them, working-class whites asked, when they destroy their neighborhoods and refuse to work, and we're losing our jobs and our homes? In Nixonland, historian Rick Perlstein captures the basic attitude by relaying this comment from a white construction worker, directed at George McGovern, ""They're payin' people who are on welfare today doin' nothin'! They're laughin' at our society! And we're all hardworkin' people and we're gettin' laughed at for workin' every day!"" Part of this was just racism. For most of the post-war era, whites were empowered by the federal government to separate themselves and their lives from black Americans. For the white middle class, federal aid built white suburbs and white schools, and for the white working-class, it built segregated housing projects and cities. The civil rights revolution brought blacks and black demands to their doorsteps, and for the white working class--which couldn't just leave for the suburbs--it fueled a backlash. But part of it was something broader. After all, there wasn't a backlash to government programs writ large. Then, as now, working-class whites are ardent supporters of Social Security and Medicare. But to them, our retirement programs came with an implicit social contract: If you work and contribute to society, society will care for you into your old age. By contrast, you didn't have to work to benefit from anti-poverty programs, in fact, you could riot and still receive government benefits. To these whites, the New Deal and its successor programs rewarded self-reliance and independence. The War on Poverty didn't. And they hated it. You didn't have to be an especially astute politician to see this was an electoral winner. Richard Nixon ran--and won--on resentment to black demands for equality, and Ronald Reagan channeled anti-welfare attitudes into two landslide wins for a muscular, hard right conservatism. The grievances haven't gone away, and in era of slow growth and stagnant wages, they've likely gotten worse. It's why, in the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney ran a series of ads--concentrated in the white working-class areas of Ohio and Pennsylvania--attacking President Obama for ""gutting welfare"" and ""cutting checks"" to people who wouldn't work. For as much as this was plainly racial--welfare is still associated with blacks in the public mind--it also reflected a genuine frustration with the shape of the world. Working-class whites are physically closer to the poor. And to them, as Kevin Drum notes, the poor are often ""folks next door who don't do a lick of work but somehow keep getting government checks paid for by their tax dollars."" It doesn't matter that working-class tax rates are relatively low, and that anti-poverty programs are a small part of the federal budget. What matters is that they pay taxes but don't get the same kind of benefits. Again, here's Drum:"	Why Democrats Can't Win Over White Working-Class Voters
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/mary_landrieu_keystone_democrats_should_be_embarrassed_to_indulge_the_louisiana.html	"Sen. Mary Landrieu wasted little time reminding everyone that the Senate's lame-duck session is not a lame-duck session for everyone. The Louisiana Democrat, who will face GOP challenger Bill Cassidy in a runoff next month, took to the floor on Wednesday, less than 30 minutes after the upper chamber convened for the first time since the midterm elections. ""I believe it is time to act,"" Landrieu said, renewing her advocacy for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. ""I want to say 'yes' to [the] majority leader--new Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The time to start is now."" That Landrieu is launching such a Hail Mary is hardly a surprise. Greenlighting the pipeline has long been a goal of hers, and the three-term senator has little reason not to go down swinging now that she's likely to be ousted from office. What is much more of a shock, though, is that Harry Reid--the majority leader for all of two more months--is indulging her, announcing Wednesday that he would bring her Keystone bill to the floor for a vote. That's a baffling decision, not just because it's so transparently politically craven--although it is--but because it risks so much for so little potential gain. Landrieu faces a steep, perhaps even impossible battle to hold on to her seat. She bested Cassidy by 1.2 points on Election Day, but failed to garner the votes needed to avoid a head-to-head runoff. With third-place-finisher Rob Maness--a Tea Party favorite who won 14 percent of the vote--now backing Cassidy, the four-term GOP congressman has become the clear favorite. Landrieu has a history of pulling out wins in races she was expected to lose, but this would be something else--one of the greatest escape acts in recent memory. Given the current political landscape, her eleventh-hour gamesmanship reeks of desperation. Worse yet, it's totally pointless desperation. Landrieu's Keystone bill currently lacks the 60 votes it needs to avoid a Democratic filibuster, and if she finds them before a potential vote next week, the White House has left little doubt that President Obama will veto the bill if it reaches his desk. Even if we suspend disbelief--and, again, we shouldn't--and imagine a world in which Congress passed this Keystone bill and Obama signed it, it's highly unlikely that would be enough for Landrieu to win over the conservative voters she needs to hold on to her seat. Polls show Cassidy winning a one-on-one matchup with Landrieu, and whatever happens in the lame-duck session is unlikely to change that. Adding to Landrieu's woes is the fact that the GOP's midterm successes will strip her of one of her chief selling points: her power as the chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Things are so bleak, in fact, that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has pulled the plug on nearly $2 million worth of ads it had planned to run on her behalf. So what exactly will Landrieu be selling on the stump? Any short-term Keystone job creation wouldn't actually be in Louisiana--the southern portion of the pipeline, which is already built, stops in Texas. And if Landrieu tries to crow that she pushed for a Senate vote, that's likely to be offset by the fact that Cassidy has introduced his own Keystone bill in the House. The most likely outcome is that Cassidy's bill sails through the House (possibly as soon as this Friday) while Landrieu's version stalls in the Senate, allowing the Republican challenger to point to a legislative accomplishment while also painting Senate Democrats as obstructionists. What's befuddling isn't that the Democrats are playing politics with Keystone--it's that they're playing them so poorly. Thanks to their seven-seat-and-counting gain on Election Day, Republicans will take control of the Senate next year for the first time since George W. Bush's second term. More importantly for the Keystone crowd, the pipeline is all but certain to have a filibuster-proof 60-plus votes in the next Senate, whether Landrieu is there or not. As I explained last week, a GOP-passed Keystone bill would back Obama into a tight corner next year. If the president signs it, Republicans can point to the pipeline as proof they're delivering on their campaign promises. If he vetoes it, they can argue ahead of 2016 that it's the Democrats who are responsible for Washington's gridlock. The political price Obama will pay would only grow if Landrieu somehow got her way and he had to veto a bill passed by a Democrat-controlled Senate. Any of these scenarios would be a win for Republicans politically and a blow to the president's larger push to fight U.S.--and global--emissions during his final two years in office. Reid's decision to give Landrieu the vote she wants, then, is absolutely mystifying. Nevertheless, it is squarely in line with Democrats' previous desperate--and transparent--attempts to keep her ensconced in office. In February, Reid orchestrated a game of musical chairs within the Democratic caucus that ultimately landed Landrieu the Senate Energy gavel, in a move that ensured that the oil and gas industry would pour even more money into her campaign coffers. Landrieu has a long history of breaking with her party on energy issues. She has been a high-profile friend to BP in the aftermath of the Gulf Coast oil spill, routinely called for more offshore drilling, voted time and again with Republicans against efforts to curb U.S. carbon emissions, and pushed her Keystone bill out of the Energy Committee this summer. Her liberal colleagues, however, largely held their tongues with the hopes she'd be able to defend her seat and help lock in the Democrats' Senate majority. The political gamesmanship over Keystone hasn't been confined to the Senate. In April the White House announced--again--that it was extending its review of the pipeline. Ostensibly the move was designed to allow the State Department more time to review the project, which would deliver 830,000 barrels of carbon-heavy crude per day from Alberta's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. But the politics of the decision were evident: It allowed the president to avoid what's become a high-profile litmus test in the larger climate debate, while giving Landrieu and other vulnerable Democrats the chance to rail against the delay to score points with the anti-Obama crowd in their home states. The political gifts didn't end there. Liberal billionaire Tom Steyer and other deep-pocketed green groups opted to stay on the sidelines in Louisiana, despite the fact that Landrieu was floated as an early possible target for the pro-climate (or, perhaps more accurately, anti-anti-climate) cash that environmentalists poured into midterm races around the country. All of these concessions weren't enough to keep Landrieu out of a runoff. And yet, Democratic leaders appear willing to give Landrieu an endless supply of political gifts. If they really are willing to send a Keystone bill to the White House to help the three-term Louisiana senator, then they should have allowed it to happen in August, when it could have helped more Democrats than just her. If you're going to be crass and opportunistic, then you might as well be smart about it. Even if Landrieu surprises everyone and wins the runoff, it won't change the Senate math enough to keep Democrats in power. A Landrieu win would add a seat to the minority caucus, but it wouldn't stop McConnell from becoming majority leader. The only real difference, then, if she manages to stick around for another term, is that she'll get a front-row seat as Senate Republicans push to make her pipeline fantasies a reality."	Democrats Should Be Embarrassed to Indulge Mary Landrieu's Desperate Push for Keystone XL
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/republicans_won_t_impeach_president_obama_but_democrats_think_they_might.html	"Sen. Mitch McConnell might want a more bipartisan Senate, but if Republican voters have their way, he won't deliver one. According to a postelection survey from the Pew Research Center, most Republicans--57 percent--think the party should move in a more conservative direction, compared with 39 percent who think GOP leaders should moderate during the next two years. Not that they're interested in legislation. Sixty-six percent of Republicans want leaders who ""stand up"" to President Obama, even if less gets done in Washington. In other words, now that they have control of Congress, rank-and-file Republicans are less concerned with policy and more interested in fighting Obama, even if it derails a conservative agenda. It's this dynamic--apparent from the 2014 midterm campaigns--that prompted a dramatic prediction from Rep. James Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives. ""There will be some reason found to introduce an impeachment resolution,"" said the South Carolina congressman on Tuesday on MSNBC. ""These Republicans have decided that this president must have an asterisk by his name after he leaves office, irrespective of whether or not he gets convicted. It is their plan to introduce an impeachment resolution."" Clyburn may be right that Republicans want an ""asterisk"" by Obama's name. But there's no proof of a plan. Instead, we have disavowals from a large group of Republican leaders, who all say impeachment is off the table. ""We have no plans to impeach the president,"" said John Boehner at a July 29 press conference. ""We have no future plans."" And a few months later, just before the election, a spokesman for the House speaker told Politifact that ""Boehner has taken impeachment off the table. His stance hasn't changed."" (Indeed, he hasn't even moved with his lawsuit against the president, a good sign that he's telling the truth.) If that isn't enough to dismiss Clyburn's claim, there's statements from Rep. Paul Ryan, who said Obama's actions do not ""rise to the high crime and misdemeanor level""; Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who as House Judiciary Committee chairman would play a crucial role in impeachment proceedings if it happened; and presidential contenders like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who, if nothing else, has a real interest in siding with the base on an issue like impeachment. But while Clyburn's assertion is wrong, it's hard to say his concern is misplaced. Beginning with ""birtherism,"" there's been a long campaign from the far right to delegitimize Barack Obama as president of the United States. Important examples are Donald Trump's short-lived rise to political fame on the claim that Obama was hiding his ""long form"" birth certificate, and the film 2016: Obama's America--a project of conservative provocateur Dinesh D'Souza--which portrayed the president as an anti-Colonial Manchurian candidate bent on crippling America and redeeming his father's legacy. (It wasn't very good, but it was awfully popular.) These arguments weren't embraced by Republican candidates in the 2012 elections, but they weren't disavowed either. (The noted exception being Newt Gingrich, who asked: ""What if [Obama] is so outside our comprehension that only if you understand Kenyan, anti-Colonial behavior can you begin to piece together [his actions]? That is the most accurate, predictive model for his behavior."") Mitt Romney embraced Trump during the GOP primaries, even as the latter pushed the idea that Obama was inherently suspect. That's all to say that this idea of Obama's illegitimacy lives on in grass-roots support for impeachment, which has as much traction with the Republican base as birtherism did in Obama's first term. In a July CNN poll, 57 percent of Republicans and 56 percent of conservatives said Obama should be impeached. A more recent survey from Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, found substantial impeachment support from Republicans (50 percent) and incredible support (64 percent) from the Tea Party base that drives GOP politics. Not surprisingly, a healthy number of Republican politicians have--contrary to party leaders--expressed their support for impeachment. Last year, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma declared, ""People may be starting to use the I-word before too long,"" while incoming Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa gave the thumbs up to impeachment during her campaign for the GOP nomination in her state. Immigration hawk Rep. Steve King--also of Iowa--has threatened impeachment if the president makes moves on immigration, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham did the same with regard to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. None of this means impeachment is likely, but it does give context for Clyburn's concern. Republican voters want impeachment, Republican politicians have talked about it, and--above all--there's actual precedent: We're not too removed from the witch hunt of the 1990s, where Republicans impeached a president over pseudoscandals and innuendo. With all of that said, there's one thing that assures we won't see impeachment: the presidential election. Too much is on the line--including the Supreme Court--for Republicans to kneecap themselves with an impeachment fight. Then again, that was true in 1998 too, and look what happened."	No, Republicans Aren't Going to Impeach Obama
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/loretta_lynch_hearings_how_conservatives_could_make_the_attorney_general.html	"If the Obama administration gets its way, the confirmation process for Loretta Lynch, the president's attorney general nominee, will be boring and noncontroversial. But it could instead get extremely interesting, and that depends a lot on what Obama does in the next few weeks on immigration. There's no guarantee--what can we really know in this mixed-up world of ours?--but Senate Republican aides indicate that Lynch's confirmation has the potential to be enormously contentious. Even though Lynch is widely seen as a low-risk pick with a hard-to-attack track record, Republicans are targeting her for what could be a tough confirmation focused more on policymaking than personality. Here's how this could play out. Lynch's confirmation process probably won't move forward until after the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. At Politico, Seung Min Kim notes that Senate Minority Leader (and soon-to-be Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell has said he doesn't think her confirmation should happen during the lame-duck session. And, per an aide she cites, the Senate Judiciary Committee hadn't gotten Lynch's paperwork as of Nov. 10. At the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute gala in early October, Obama promised to take executive action on immigration before the end of 2014. The Washington Post reported in August that the president's aides have discussed a variety of options that could block deportations for up to 5 million undocumented immigrants. If all of that happens, Lynch won't head to the Senate Judiciary Committee for her confirmation hearing until after the president has taken unilateral action to slow deportations. That move is so controversial that he postponed making it until after the midterms in an effort to save vulnerable Democrats. Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee have already promised to ask Lynch in her confirmation hearing about her stance on this executive action. They released a joint statement on Nov. 8 indicating immigration will be central during her confirmation process. ""The Attorney General is the President's chief law enforcement officer,"" the statement reads. ""As such, the nominee must demonstrate full and complete commitment to the law. Loretta Lynch deserves the opportunity to demonstrate those qualities, beginning with a statement whether or not she believes the President's executive amnesty plans are constitutional and legal."" Heritage Action, a branch of the Heritage Foundation that scores votes in Congress and rates members' conservatism, has indicated it has the same concerns. ""There is no doubt that Lynch's confirmation would be easier if the President took his unilateral amnesty off the table,"" writes Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler. ""If Lynch tries to defend the indefensible, she's unlikely to receive conservative support, but she does deserve the opportunity to answer those questions (and many more, presumably) next year."" In other words, conservative leaders are laying the groundwork to make Lynch's confirmation fight about whether the president has the legal authority to take unilateral executive action on immigration. One senior Senate aide working on the nomination process said Republicans' opposition goes beyond just immigration; the question at hand isn't so much whether slowing deportations is a good idea, but whether the president has the unilateral authority to make that call. Conservative charges of executive overreach--which echo many of the criticisms liberals leveled at then-President George W. Bush--are longstanding. Speaker John Boehner made the argument in a CNN op-ed defending his decision to sue the president, and National Review devoted a cover story to the issue. Lynch's confirmation could be the setting of the next skirmish over it. It's a safe bet Obama's attorney general nominee won't say the president is a lawbreaker at her confirmation hearing, which would leave Senate Republicans with three options: 1. They can shrug, confirm Lynch, and move on to other policy battles with the Obama administration. 2. Senate Republicans can put their collective foot down and work to prevent Lynch's confirmation. 3. Some Senate Republicans can put their foot down and vote against Lynch's confirmation while other (more moderate) Senate Republicans vote with Democrats to confirm her. The first option isn't very interesting and also not very likely. Option No. 2 is extremely interesting because it would mean the possibility of a protracted fight between Senate Republicans and the White House over who becomes the next attorney general. (Fireworks! Popcorn!) Option No. 3 is also really interesting, though, because it probably means there would be tense, messy infighting among Senate Republicans. No. 3 happens if Lynch says something in her confirmation hearing that placates the concerns of Senate Republican leadership but isn't sufficient for Cruz, Lee, and their conservative allies in the conference. That could be a tricky line for Lynch to walk. In October, McConnell sent the following statement to Matt Boyle of Breitbart. ""As attorney general, Eric Holder too often put political and ideological commitments ahead of the rule of law,"" he said. ""That's not something the American people expect in the nation's highest law-enforcement official, and it's something Mr. Holder's replacement should commit to avoiding at all costs as a condition of his or her confirmation--whether it relates to the President's acting unilaterally on immigration or anything else."" Saying that kind of commitment is ""a condition"" of her confirmation is pretty strong. Privately, some Republican aides are skeptical that Lynch would make a commitment strong enough to mollify them. ""If she says she supports the president's executive action, then she will not be confirmed,"" said an aide with knowledge of the confirmation process. That aide explains his confidence by arguing that people underestimate the chain of events the president would trigger by taking unilateral action on immigration. Thom Tillis, Dan Sullivan, and Tom Cotton all used the issue to criticize the Democratic incumbents they faced in the midterms (results are still pending in Sullivan's race), and their arguments will be fresh in the minds of the Republican base's immigration hawks. It's also worth noting that Tea Party activists liked the Senate Gang of Eight's comprehensive immigration reform bill about as much as they liked Obamacare. So if Lynch's nomination gets testy, it gives Capitol Hill Republicans a chance to go on cable news and talk up their tough-on-illegal-immigration credentials So the Republican playbook on Lynch (thus far) has little to do with her career and much more to do with repudiating the president on immigration and executive action. How she handles questions on presidential authority in her confirmation hearing could play an outsize role in determining her fate."	How Conservatives Could Make Loretta Lynch's Confirmation Hearings a Skirmish Over Immigration and Executive Action
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/social_conservatives_defeat_pro_gay_marriage_republicans_they_are_targeting.html	"Conservative opponents to same-sex marriage are having a good week. Last Tuesday, voters elected a new class of Senate Republicans who widely share their views. On Thursday, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Constitution doesn't guarantee same-sex couples the right to marry. Then, on Sunday, their nemesis-in-chief, openly gay Republican candidate Carl DeMaio, conceded defeat in his bid for a Southern California House seat. Social conservatives working to stem the seemingly inevitable tide that favors same-sex marriage are feeling good and dreaming big. (Ralph Reed, who chairs the Faith and Freedom Coalition, emailed that the results were ""very heartening."") And they are already working to build on that success. Their next target: Sen. Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who announced in March 2013 that he supports same-sex marriage. Beating Portman in a Republican primary is an extremely long shot, to put it gently. For starters, a candidate willing to face him has yet to emerge, and those looking for one don't seem to be floating any names yet. On top of that, Portman is a formidable fundraiser and has broad support from top national Republicans. Still, the midterm election results have his ideological foes on the right feeling hugely optimistic. That's because for the last few months, things have largely gone according to plan. The plan is what you might expect: Bolster the electoral prospects of Republicans who opposed same-sex marriage and work to undermine everyone who doesn't. On Sept. 25, three leading same-sex-marriage opponents sent a letter to top Capitol Hill Republicans stating that they would actively work against a handful of socially moderate Republican nominees: DeMaio, Oregon Senate candidate Monica Wehby, and Massachusetts House nominee Richard Tisei. DeMaio and Tisei are both openly gay, but the letter--signed by Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, and Tom Minnery of CitizenLink--didn't mention that fact. It did, however, say the three candidates would ""serve as terrible role models for young people"" if elected. DeMaio and Tisei weren't the only Republican House candidates running who favored same-sex marriage, but they were the only two the letter targeted. It didn't take social conservatives gunning for Wehby to derail her chances, and Tisei lost by 14 points--a margin far larger than anything social conservatives could realistically claim as their handiwork. But in California, incumbent Democrat Scott Peters barely defeated DeMaio. Social conservatives argue that their efforts made the difference in that contest. The letter's signers encouraged social conservatives in DeMaio's district to vote for his Democratic challenger. Brown, speaking before the candidate conceded, said his socially moderate stance hobbled DeMaio's prospects. ""Even if DeMaio squeaks this thing out, anyone who's familiar with the district and the nature of this election has to explain why DeMaio didn't crush Peters,"" Brown said. ""The reason is simple. The reason is that his support for same-sex marriage brought him way down."" ""How did Monica Wehby do?"" he added. ""Horrible."" Perkins said the midterms vindicate his side's argument that same-sex marriage isn't a done deal. ""Unfortunately, some in the Republican establishment bought into the media's line that America had moved away from the issue of marriage,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, that's just not the case."" Beyond defeating their top Republican targets, social conservatives are also emboldened by watching several of their heroes win tight races. Perkins pointed to Thom Tillis, the North Carolina state House speaker who beat incumbent Democrat Sen. Kay Hagan in the year's most expensive race. Perkins said Tillis didn't talk about same-sex marriage much until North Carolina's amendment barring it lost in court. ""He stood up and was very aggressive in defending the marriage amendment, and that's when things began to turn for him,"" Perkins said. The state's amendment lost in court on Oct. 10. The Real Clear Politics polling average shows Hagan's lead over Tillis narrowing sharply from Oct. 1, when she was up by 3.8 points, to Election Day, when she lost by about 1.7 points. ""I do not claim that the election results were the sole effect of social issues and marriage; that is not the case at all,"" said Perkins. ""I just think it gave an extra margin of victory to those who were willing to step out."" Brown counts Gov. Sam Brownback's re-election victory in Kansas as another win for his side. The governor--widely regarded as the most vulnerable red-state governor of the cycle--energetically touted his opposition to same-sex marriage in a debate with his Democratic challenger. Brown's group also worked to boost Sen. Pat Roberts, another embattled Kansas Republican who still pulled off a win on election night. ""I'm hopeful that Pat Roberts will be more forceful in the Senate,"" Brown said. Perkins said he thinks Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who beat incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor, will also be a strong advocate for his group's ideals. When asked if he thought Cotton would ever dial back his opposition to same-sex-marriage, Perkins replied, ""I know he won't  because I know him well."" That said, election night wasn't a total rout for Republicans who favor same-sex marriage. Rek LeCounte of Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry pointed out that most of the Log Cabin Republicans' endorsees won. ""I think ultimately this cycle just shows that groups like NOM care more about their narrow, divisive campaign than they do about electing conservatives who govern in accordance with the conservative movement,"" LeCounte said. Either way, social conservatives are laying the groundwork for the next election. So now, the big goal for 2016--as NOM touted Monday morning on its blog--is finding someone who can successfully primary Portman. ""We gotta find a candidate,"" Brown said. ""Obviously that's going to be difficult, but not insurmountable."" Perkins said he isn't actively working on those efforts right now but thinks Portman should be wary. ""I do think that Sen. Portman has reasons to be concerned, especially given the outcome of this election cycle,"" he said. If it sounds like these plans are the result of a lot of coordinated strategizing, that's because they are. Brown said he and others meet every month at the Heritage Foundation to work on the marriage issue and have conference calls together twice a week. The meetings, per Brown, have drawn attendees affiliated with the Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, and the Conference of Catholic Bishops. Congressional staff come too, Brown added, though not as many as he would like. The staff from the offices of Reps. John Fleming and Tim Huelskamp and House Speaker John Boehner have all attended. Jennifer Marshall, who helms the Heritage Foundation's Institute for Family, Community, and Opportunity, said the midterm election results underscore the idea that same-sex marriage ""is a very much open question and deserving of robust debate."" Brown concurs. ""People think the fight's over,"" he said. ""But they're wrong."""	Social Conservatives Worked Hard to Defeat Pro-Gay Marriage Republicans. They Want More.
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/tea_party_feels_vindicated_by_2014_midterm_elections_movement_conservatives.html	"At first glance, the 2014 midterms look like a catastrophe for the Tea Party. Sarah Palin's candidates lost in state after state, conservatives like Louisiana's Rob Maness who proudly embraced the Tea Party label got walloped, and favorites of the so-called RINO surrender caucus--including Thom Tillis and incumbent Sen. Lamar Alexander--sailed to wins in their primaries ahead of their victories last Tuesday. But movement conservative and Tea Party Republicans see it differently. They argue that their strategy for this cycle worked out fairly well--at the very least, well enough for them to see no reason to shift strategy. Prominent conservative activists who backed upstart challengers like Maness and Chris McDaniel in Mississippi are eager to push back against the emerging narrative that GOP gains in the 2014 midterms were the result of establishment Republicans' efforts to ""kick out the crazies""--for lack of a better term. In retrospect, these activists feel little regret for how the 2014 midterms played out; if anything, they feel vindicated. Conservatives' biggest win came early in the cycle, in the Nebraska Republican primary between former Bush administration official Ben Sasse and former Nebraska treasurer Shane Osborn. The ideological differences between those two candidates were a tad inscrutable--the two weren't identical, but they probably had more in common than any other top primary contenders. But that race quickly became a proxy battle between insurgent Tea Party grassroots activists (there's not a simple term to use to describe anyone involved here, alas) and often-more-moderate Washington Republicans with comparatively strong ties to business interests and less interest in ideological purity. Sasse won the backing of the former, while Osborne captured the support of the latter. The tension between those two factions is long simmering and messy. (Jonathan Strong explained it thoroughly for National Review last year.) The short version is that Sasse won support from some of the same groups boosting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's primary challenger. And thus, McConnell looked to bring down the hammer on the upstart. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham also stepped into the fray, supporting Osborne. Sasse, meanwhile, campaigned with Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Mike Lee, and Sarah Palin. The Nebraska race became a McCain v. Palin faceoff of sorts--and Palin's side won. Tea Party leaders point to that victory as a huge moment for them. ""People can't ignore the undercurrent that was going on in that race,"" said Drew Ryun, political director of the Madison Project, a conservative group that backed Sasse. He added that Sasse's race was the only primary that brought together all the deep-pocketed conservative outside groups hungering to back conservative candidates in red-state primaries: Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund, Tea Party Patriots, and Sarah Palin all rallied behind Sasse, and it worked. The other big primary win that outside groups claim is Joni Ernst's, but it isn't as clear-cut. She may be the only candidate that Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin both endorsed this cycle. One top conservative operative said there was significant debate among conservative power- and money-brokers regarding whether to throw their muscle behind Ernst or economics professor Sam Clovis. The general consensus: Clovis was more conservative, but Ernst was more competitive. ""We just thought she had a better chance at winning the general election,"" said the operative. So they picked her. Unlike some terrible endorsement choices in their early history--Christine O'Donnell 2010, anyone?--prominent Tea Party and conservative actors decided to support the candidate who had the best shot of flipping a Senate seat long held by a progressive Democrat. It worked, and everyone is happy. ""We learned a lesson,"" said the operative. Another plugged-in conservative argues that if Ernst hadn't won the primary, some national Republicans would have celebrated her demise. ""Winning cures everything,"" he said. ""Now Joni Ernst is this fantastic candidate. If she'd lost, she's just this crazy lady with the pig ad."" Iowa wasn't the only race where conservative and Tea Party movers showed unusual discretion and restraint. Prominent Republicans cringed as the Georgia primary got rolling; Rep. Paul Broun, who called evolution and the Big Bang theory ""lies straight from the pit of Hell,"" and Rep. Phil Gingrey, who defended Todd Akin's career-ending rape comments, both entered that contest. That could have meant catastrophe: Two hard-right, gaffe-prone, good-ol'-boy Georgians running in a contest to see who's the most conservative--what could go wrong? But, oddly enough, the answer was nothing. Broun and Gingrey's candidacies never got momentum. National conservatives steered clear of them. And nobody said anything insane about sexual assault (at least, nothing that got leaked to reporters). ""Paul Broun's poor performance vindicates the Tea Party vetting process,"" said one conservative operative. ""People encouraging him to run said, 'Don't be Akin and O'Donnell.' And his people were like, 'Awesome, thanks for the advice!' "" Most of the prominent conservative groups also gave a wide berth to Greg Brannon, a doctor who ran against Thom Tillis in the North Carolina Senate Republican primary. Sen. Mike Lee and FreedomWorks endorsed him, and Glenn Beck told him, ""I could tongue-kiss you"" on his radio show. But other organizations were unimpressed, and stayed out of the race. Brannon was dogged by charges that he misled two investors--you can read plenty more on that at WRAL--and was also perceived as goofy and gaffe-happy. At varying points in his career, Brannon had argued for state militias instead of a U.S. Army and floated the idea that the Articles of Confederation could be preferable to the Constitution. (Andrew Kaczynski thoroughly cataloged those insights, as well as many others.) That made it tough for Brannon to win endorsements and cash. ""Brannon just said, 'I am conservative, raaahhhr,' "" said one operative. ""And the other guy said, 'me too.' It's just that his 'me too' had $10 million behind it."" ""Thom Tillis might not be the most conservative person in the world, but he had to run like it,"" he adds. Thus, conservatives who didn't back Brannon still see an upside to his candidacy. They charge that facing a competitive primary made Tillis go on the record with conservative positions on healthcare and immigration--positions they'll be able to cite during his Senate career if he starts moving to the political center. The same thing happened to Joe Miller, the Tea Party activist who won the Alaska Republican Senate nomination in 2010, lost when incumbent Republican Lisa Murkowski launched a successful write-in campaign, and ran again in the 2014 Senate primary. An operative points out that Miller had paltry Tea Party backing. ""OK, we learned our lesson,"" said the operative, explaining why conservative donors snubbed Miller. ""He can say some crazy shit."" On top of all that, conservatives also believe the 2014 election cycle makes a powerful case for the value of primaries as practice rounds. ""You don't want your first fistfight to be in a general election,"" said Jordan Gehrke, a Republican strategist and senior advisor to Sasse's campaign. ""It's good for candidates to have to run races, it's good for them to have to build organizations and have people personally invested in them, and build a massive donor list of donors who are invested. It's good to have taken a shot to the face a couple times and have to get up off the mat to find out who they really are and what kind of candidate we really have."" And Tuesday's results seem to undergird that argument; Tillis, Sen. Thad Cochran, and Sen. Lamar Alexander--all of whom faced Tea Party challengers in primaries with varying degrees of competitiveness--nabbed general election wins. Meanwhile, Michigan Republican Senate nominee Terri Lynn Land and New Hampshire nominee Scott Brown--neither of whom had particularly hard-fought primary races--came up short on Election Day. That doesn't mean that facing a brutal primary challenge is necessarily welcome news for candidates. But it does mean that it's not the death sentence that some national Republican strategists like to pretend it to be. And there may be one last perk for conservatives: Republicans in Congress tend to vote a little differently around primary season. Katrina Pierson, a Tea Party activist who launched an unsuccessful primary challenge against Rep. Pete Sessions in Texas, argues that he toughened up a comparatively soft position on immigration because she challenged him. ""It's definitely been an eye-opener for Republicans,"" she said. Whether Washington Republicans like it or not, contentious Tea Party primary battles aren't going anywhere."	The Tea Party Is More Savvy and Disciplined Than You Think
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/the_disunited_states_of_america_why_demographics_republican_obstructionism.html	"The Republican Party scored a landmark victory on Tuesday night. The GOP didn't just win the safe bets in South Dakota and the mildly competitive races in Kentucky, Kansas, and Georgia. It triumphed in North Carolina, Colorado, and Arkansas--where conservative candidates knocked out Democratic incumbents--and Iowa, where it won an open seat previously held by veteran Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. Republicans saved embattled governors from defeat and scored upset gubernatorial wins in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Illinois. And, to finish the hat trick, House Republicans are on track to win their largest majority since 1928. But before we declare the end of the Obama era, we shouldn't lose sight of something else, even if it runs afoul of the headlines of the past week: Nationally, the Republican Party isn't popular. According to a recent Pew Research poll, 54 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the GOP, compared with 47 percent who feel the same for the Democratic Party. The people who just elected a Republican majority in the Senate are a narrow, unrepresentative slice of voting-age Americans. They're older, whiter, wealthier, and much more conservative than the public at large. Put another way, the midterm electorate that chose this Republican Congress is itself a Republican electorate drawn from a subset of Republican voters. And two years from now, when we gather to choose the next president, it's just as likely we'll have a Democratic electorate--voters who are younger, less affluent, and more diverse--choosing a Democratic president. In other words, the 2014 to 2016 cycle will be a rough copy of the 2010 to 2012 cycle. This is more than a quirk of American elections. It represents a major shift in partisan cycles that, in turn, has serious consequences for our ability to govern the country and respond to the pressing problems of the day. With this seesaw of Democratic presidents and GOP congresses, we may be facing more than gridlock. We may be on the cusp of a generation of political stagnation that will be hardwired into our democracy by our country's shifting demographics and the unwillingness of the Republican Party to compromise with those with whom they disagree. The Demographic Divide Midterms have always been bad for the president's party, but rarely were they wave elections--or near waves--of the kind we saw this year and in 2010. Instead, they were modest shifts in one direction or the other. In 1986, running at the end of Ronald Reagan's term, Democrats won a net five seats in the House of Representatives and eight in the Senate. In 1990, running against President George H. W. Bush, Democrats won a net seven seats in the House and one in the Senate. In other words, until very recently, Democrats didn't always fare poorly in midterm elections. The generational divide in partisanship, for instance, didn't exist 25 years ago, or at least, not in the same way. Take the 1988 electorate that chose Bush for president. There, Michael Dukakis won roughly the same share of seniors (49 percent) as he did voters younger than 30 (47 percent). Four years later, Bill Clinton won 43.5 percent of voters younger than 30 and 50 percent of voters 65 and older. If there was a generation gap, in other words, it was that older voters favored Democrats, not Republicans. The main difference between young and old voters back then wasn't whom they voted for as much as whether they voted in the first place. Grandfather and Grandson might vote for the same party, but the grandfather would show up for every election while his grandson was more likely to only vote every four years in a presidential election. That divide still exists. According to early exit polling, 37 percent of voters in this year's election were 60 and older, compared to 12 percent who were under the age of 30. What's different compared with the past is the partisan divide. Simply put, when young people go to the polls they vote for Democrats and when older people cast their ballots, they vote for Republicans. And the gap is huge. In 2008, Barack Obama won 66 percent of voters younger than 30 compared with 47 percent of voters 60 and older. Likewise, in the Republican wave election of 2010, congressional Democrats suffered their largest losses with older voters and had their best performance with the millennial generation. In 2012, President Obama gave a repeat performance on both scores, winning 60 percent of voters younger than 30 and losing 56 percent of voters 65 and older. This year, Democrats won 54 percent of the youngest voters while 57 percent of senior voters went to Republicans. We're at a point where one electorate--made up of young people and minorities--elects presidents and the occasional Senate majority while another--made up of older people, mostly white--elects the House of Representatives, with an occasional Senate majority as well. But why is there a GOP midterm advantage now as opposed to 20 years ago, when the overall electorate was substantially whiter? The answer is demographics. First, as Ronald Brownstein has argued for the Atlantic, differences between white and nonwhite voters weren't as severe as they are now. In congressional and presidential elections, Democratic candidates performed well with minorities and decently with whites, giving them a cushion in midterm contests--yes, the electorates were older, but they weren't as Republican. This is important. In the 1990s, a substantial number of older voters--if not most older voters--belonged to the Greatest Generation, the men and women who grew up in the Depression and fought in World War II. They were New Deal Democrats in their formative years, and they kept that affiliation through the rest of the 20th century. Those political ties were evident in how they voted over time. According to a massive survey on the ""generation gap"" by the Pew Research Center, voters who turned 18 when Franklin Roosevelt was president were 8 points more Democratic than the average voter in 1994, 1996, and 1998; 11 points more Democratic in 2000; 3 points more Democratic in 2002; and 14 points more Democratic in 2004. By contrast, the next oldest cohort of voters--those who ""came of age"" during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations--were substantially more Republican in most years. The generation gap as we know it--when the oldest voters jumped to the Republican Party and the youngest became solidly Democratic--didn't emerge until the 2004 election. That was partially because of the circumstances of that contest--President George W. Bush was running a campaign of national unity against foreign threats. It is also explained, again, by demographics. The Greatest Generation had shrunk and was in the process of being replaced by senior citizens who were much friendlier to Republican politicians. At the same time, the youngest voters--people who turned 18 during the late Clinton and early Bush presidencies--were just entering the electorate. They were much more diverse, with large numbers of black Americans, Latinos, Asians, and mixed-race people. They were also more likely to be single and to be women, and not surprisingly, they were also far more liberal than their older counterparts. In that same Pew survey, we see that voters who turned 18 during this period were 13 points more Democratic in the 2002 congressional elections. Interestingly, in 2004 voters who came of age during Clinton's presidency were 7 points more Republican, while those who came of age during Bush's were 14 points more Democratic. As we entered the 2000s then, we had several trends coming together at once. The overall voting population was getting younger and browner, and these new voters were more Democratic; older voters, however, were still whiter and becoming more Republican. And young people continued to vote in presidential elections and largely ignore the midterms, while the older generation was consistent, voting in almost every election. It's a simple dynamic that leaves us with vastly divergent electorates. In midterm elections, it doesn't matter that Democrats run the table with young people, single women, and minorities--they're outvoted by the older, whiter voters who actually turn out. And while we had a fleeting moment where Republican dominance with white voters was decisive in presidential elections--the 2004 contest--it's no longer the case. Democrats are so strong with the so-called coalition of the ascendant that they can win with fewer whites than ever before: just 39 percent in the last presidential election. To put it in a sound bite, Democrats don't have enough white voters to consistently hold the Senate or win the House, and Republicans don't have enough minorities to win the presidency Tuesday's election was further proof for the case. Democrats did well with their constituencies, but they weren't large enough to save the Senate. And Republicans cleaned up with older and white voters, crushing Democratic opponents across the board. There's still a lifetime of politics before the 2016 presidential election. But it's fair to say that our demographics will continue along this path, giving us a baseline that favors Democrats and the eventual Democratic nominee. Which means that for the next two years, and the two years after that--and the two years after that--we should expect divided government. The Roots of Dysfunction On its face, this doesn't have to be a bad thing. Yes, as a partial product of these demographic shifts, the parties have all but diverged. The Republican Party is a conservative coalition and the Democratic Party is a liberal one. But there's nothing about these polarized, ideologically distinct political parties that necessitates the stasis or gridlock that we've seen since 2011, when Republicans took the House majority. You can still have cooperation even if both sides are working from different places. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker are on opposite sides of the spectrum, but they can work together on shared concerns like mass incarceration. In the same way, liberals who want a stronger safety net can work with conservatives who want fewer programs to craft something that satisfies both concerns, like a stronger earned income tax credit. If this sounds ludicrous, you only have to look to the Newt Gingrich-era of Congress to see an instance of polarized parties crafting shared legislation. The problem for our present politics isn't ideological division; it's that the Republican and Democratic parties aren't ideological in the same way. The Republican Party isn't just more conservative and more polarized, it's polarized against basic norms of compromise. That began with President Obama. From the moment he entered office, House and Senate Republicans mobilized against his administration, denying votes to all administration initiatives and forcing the Senate into a super-majoritarian institution through use of the filibuster. Legislation couldn't pass--and nominees couldn't win confirmation--without 60 votes, an unprecedented turn in American governance. Part of this was strategy. GOP Senate leaders like incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell understood that voters don't care about congressional squabbles and exact lines of responsibility. The public judges the president on conditions like economic growth and heuristics like bipartisan cooperation. If Congress isn't working together--if Washington seems polarized--voters don't blame the responsible party as much as they blame the president. But part of it was also pressure from the older, white base of the Republican Party, which demanded full opposition to the president. The summer of 2009 was marked by vitriolic ""town halls"" where Democratic lawmakers faced a furious backlash from voters angry over the comprehensive health care bill. This anger--and these voters--gave the GOP a series of electoral wins, beginning with Sen. Scott Brown's election in Massachusetts and ending with a Republican House majority in the 112th Congress. That House majority would exemplify the anti-compromise ethos of the Republican base, lurching from crisis to crisis in an effort to stymie the Obama administration. In the summer of 2011, for example, House Republicans killed a proposed ""grand bargain"" over entitlement cuts and tax increases--pushed strongly by the president--and threatened a damaging debt default in return for massive cuts to federal spending. Liberal commentators denounced this as ""hostage taking"" and nihilism. The founders, wrote Michael Tomasky for the Guardian, ""did not assume ... that one side could become so nihilistic that it could be willing to see the country suffer as long as the blame for the suffering could be fixed on the other guys."" It was an understandable (and correct) reaction. With the grand bargain, Obama offered major concessions, including cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. If Republicans could concede on tax increases, they'd score a huge policy win. They couldn't. Instead, they used the debt ceiling to threaten economic catastrophe. Republican voters were pleased. This is what they wanted: a GOP that wouldn't bend. ""America is rising back up and getting a backbone again, and making our voices heard one way or another, whether it's Tea Party, or whatever else. People are being emboldened,"" said one woman--an evangelical Christian voter from Colorado--in a focus group conducted by Democracy Corps, a liberal-leaning group. The Democracy Corps survey, published in 2013, found a GOP base that was fearful of demographic change and eager for a more confrontational Republican Party. It's a remarkable document, in large part because it shows a deep awareness of the generational divide. These people know younger voters are more liberal and more diverse, and they want to do everything they can to protect their prerogatives before Democrats can capitalize on their demographic advantage. ""There's so much of the electorate in those groups that Democrats are going to take every time because they've been on the rolls of the government their entire lives. They don't know better,"" said one man from Raleigh, North Carolina. Another from Roanoke, Virginia, said: ""I thank God there's enough people getting angry now and it will have to stop. I think people realize that we're going to have to rise up and take control."" You can see this on a broader scale in a 2014 report from the Pew Research Center on political polarization. Among ""consistently conservative"" voters, 63 percent wanted Republicans to ""stick to their positions,"" compared with just 14 percent of ""consistently liberal"" voters who said the same about the Democratic Party. Across the board, conservatives opposed compromise, leading New York magazine's Jonathan Chait to quip that conservatives ""Hate all deals."" This attitude is how we got the now-infamous scene from the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, where a whole suite of candidates refused to endorse a fiscal deal weighted in their favor, where Democrats offered $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new taxes. And it's also responsible for former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's stunning loss to an obscure challenger in the 2014 congressional Republican primaries. His opponent, libertarian Dave Brat, had a single charge: Cantor was too friendly with Democrats. It worked. All of this is to say one thing: The GOP is broken. And with its dominance in midterm elections, it's poised to break American government for the foreseeable future. The 2013 shutdown--when House Republicans shuttered the government over the Affordable Care Act--is just the beginning. Indeed, there's a good chance the 2014 midterm election results will worsen the ideas and factions that brought us to the brink. For extremist Republican figures like Sen. Ted Cruz (and now Sens. Joni Ernst and Tom Cotton), the confrontations of the past two years were a success. They vindicate a stance of implacable opposition. Far from cooperation, we should expect two years of even worse dysfunction. The Republican Remedy And it's not clear when that will end. Let's do a quick forecast of the next few election cycles. In 2016, if the economy is growing and the electorate is more diverse, we can expect--or at least, fairly predict--a Democratic win for the White House. And since that's the year Republicans are defending Senate seats in blue states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire, we can also expect a Democratic Senate. In 2018, however, the picture flips. Not only will the Republican electorate return en masse, but Democrats will be defending 25 Senate seats--several in red states--while Republicans will be defending just eight. We'll likely get another Republican Senate, leading into another presidential election, where the incumbent Democratic president has a good chance of winning re-election and bringing a Democratic Senate with her. This whole time, because of the size of the Republican House majority and its base in the rural and exurban parts of the country, the House will remain in GOP hands. In other words, the dysfunction of the Obama era--driven by the asymmetrical polarization of the GOP versus the Democratic Party--is likely to remain locked in place for the rest of the decade, perhaps longer. And while the country, and specifically liberals, might pass some legislation during periods after a presidential election--a higher minimum wage or minor action on climate change--the anti-deal norm in the Republican Party means more stasis and gridlock. Years could pass, for instance, where the Senate doesn't confirm a nominee out of ideological pique. (In fact, we should expect as much in the next Congress.) This past year, frustration with congressional inaction on immigration--and public pressure from immigration activists--pushed the White House to float the possibility of taking unilateral action to create a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. The result was a primal scream from conservatives, who accused the president of flouting the Constitution. Even more moderate Republicans, like Ross Douthat of the New York Times, warned of presidential ""Caesarism."" And while the Obama proposal fell within the president's authority, it's also true that Republicans weren't completely wrong. There is a point at which presidential action violates congressional prerogatives. Which is to say that divided dysfunctional government can have other, more dangerous consequences. Next year, Republicans will have a duly elected congressional majority. But Barack Obama will still be president and will still have the legitimacy of a presidential election. Let's say Republicans refuse to fix a legislative problem--like a fatal wound to the Affordable Care Act, inflicted by the Supreme Court--and President Obama decides to fix it unilaterally, with executive authority, rather than let his namesake law fall to pieces. By the letter of the law, this is illegitimate. But the Republican majority wasn't elected by a clear majority of the American people, Obama was. And the president is committed to preventing an insurance death spiral or broken exchanges that could result from a full attack on the law. Whose authority is more legitimate? I don't expect this to happen in Obama's final two years in office, but it's not an idle question. If a new Republican majority stymies a Democratic president in 2019--refusing to, for example, confirm a Supreme Court nominee--we could find ourselves in a constitutional crisis, as the president acts despite Congress. The longer the Republican Party stays on its path of anti-compromise, the more likely these scenarios become. There's a chance this predicament will solve itself. Twenty years from now, midterm electorates might be so diverse--filled with people who cut their political teeth during the Bush and Obama years--that Democrats regain the momentum in these off-year elections as well. But I wouldn't make that bet. To take us off this path, someone--and I mean the Republican Party--will have to take action. One choice is to abandon the norm against deals, or marginalize the anti-deal makers in the Republican Party. This happened before--during the 1980s and 1990s--and it can happen again. After all, the anti-compromise norm isn't universal among conservatives. With notable exceptions--like Texas Sen. Cruz--Republicans with statewide constituencies are more amenable to compromise than their House counterparts. If Republicans do have a durable, long-term majority in the House, then the GOP Speaker should have space to buck hardliners in favor of pragmatists and violate the informal rule that Republicans need a majority of the majority to move with legislation. The current speaker, John Boehner, has done this two times without serious consequences. A future speaker could be even bolder and block hardliners altogether. Often, trends don't change political parties, individuals do. And they do so with the heft of the White House as leverage--if you follow me, I can win us the presidency. That is how Bill Clinton transformed the Democratic Party in the 1990s, and it's how a future Republican could transform the GOP and bring it into the 21st century. A person who--through ambition for national office--uses power, patronage, charm, and coercion to modernize the Republican Party and steer it from its most destructive urges. The other option is for Democrats just to win. Again, however, that requires substantial turnout from groups that don't vote in midterm elections. For now and the near future--absent an unlikely major institutional change, like automatic voter registration--the Democrats are simply the party of occasional voters. But then, that might suggest another strategy for taking us off the path to political stagnation. Rather than wait for Republicans to change--or for Democrats to essentially get lucky--maybe liberals need to reorganize their politics to advocate for institutional change. If there's been an underlying current to the Obama years, it's the degree to which liberals have been stymied and frustrated by institutional barriers, most famously the filibuster, which helped ensure a smaller-than-needed stimulus, the death of ""cap and trade,"" and a ramshackle health care bill passed at the eleventh hour. In some sense, our divergent electorates are just another barrier. Which means liberals will have to find some way to account for them. Whether it's through institutional change--a national voting holiday, for instance--or something else, we have to change the dynamics of American politics. Otherwise, we can look forward to a future of dysfunction where our government will fail to do the most basic tasks. And while we can muddle through for a little while, it's not a condition we can survive for a generation."	Why Our Democracy May Be Hardwired to Fail for a Generation
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/keystone_pipeline_republicans_finally_have_the_votes_to_force_president.html	"The environment took a beating on Election Day, but what happens next could be even more painful for green groups and their climate-conscious allies. Republicans, who will control both chambers of Congress next year for the first time in nearly a decade, wasted little time this week making it clear that approving the Keystone XL pipeline is at the top of their legislative to-do list. Greenlighting the 1,700-mile pipeline has been a Republican priority for years. Now they finally have the votes to do it. That's a significant problem for President Obama, who has gone to great lengths to avoid tipping his hand on whether he'll approve the $8 billion project that would carry 830,000 barrels of carbon-heavy crude per day from Alberta's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. Obama has maintained that he can't decide one way or the other until his administration is finished reviewing the proposal, a noncommittal answer that has frustrated nearly everyone involved in the debate, and one he repeated during Wednesday's post-midterm press conference. ""There's an independent process that's moving forward, I'm going to let that process play out,"" Obama said, referring to a federal review that has been going on for six years. The White House maintains that the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency need more time to weigh the benefits of the pipeline against its environmental impacts. But the delay has also allowed Obama to avoid, albeit somewhat awkwardly, having to take a high-profile litmus test in the larger climate debate. The president won't have the luxury of waiting any longer after Republicans take over Congress in January. Environmentalists and their climate-conscious allies argue that the pipeline would significantly accelerate the development of oil sands, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet. They want Obama to block the project to send a clear message that he's serious about curbing U.S. carbon emissions. Industry groups and their more business-focused friends, meanwhile, can't fathom putting concerns about the climate above the nation's near-term economic and national security interests. They contend that the oil deposits will be exploited one way or the other, so the United States would be silly not to get in on the action. The pipeline's approval, its backers contend, would boost U.S. energy security while also creating thousands of construction jobs at home. (Just how many jobs remains in dispute: TransCanada, the company behind the project, claims it will create as many as 20,000, but a report from the Cornell University Global Labor Institute pegs the number at fewer than 5,000.) In the grand scheme of global emissions, the pipeline would have only a marginal impact. But it's shaping up to be the opening climate skirmish in what will likely be a series of them in the next Congress. Chief among the depressing realities facing climate-conscious Democrats is that a GOP Senate majority means that Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California liberal, will have to hand over the Environment and Public Works gavel to Sen. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who has written a book called The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future. Senate Republicans won't have the votes to strip the EPA of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases, but they are expected to make life hell for the agency by hauling officials in front of Congress on a regular basis and taking aim at its budget. That could have major global repercussions at next year's U.N. climate convention in Paris, where the president will have to convince other world leaders that the U.S. government does not think that global warming is a hoax or a conspiracy. The oil and gas industry, meanwhile, can hardly wait for 2015. The GOP has already signaled that it will push a number of production-friendly energy policies. ""I think you're going to see us bring up energy legislation right away and Keystone will be one of the first things we pass,"" North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven predicted late Tuesday night as the electoral map turned redder by the minute. The GOP-controlled House has already passed a number of Keystone bills in recent years, and won't have a problem doing so again next year. In the past, such efforts would languish in the Senate, where Democrats had the votes to prevent a binding resolution from coming up on the floor. That firewall won't exist once the incoming class of senators is sworn in early next year. Even before the GOP's midterm gains, most informal Senate whip counts showed the pro-pipeline crowd with 57 votes, a total that included all 45 Senate Republicans and a dozen moderate Democrats. Now, pipeline support should climb. The next Senate will include Iowa Republican Joni Ernst, who takes over for retiring, anti-pipeline Democrat Tom Harkin; West Virginia Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, who will replace retiring Sen. Jay Rockefeller; and Colorado Rep. Cory Gardner, who ousted Sen. Mark Udall. Meanwhile, South Dakota Republican Mike Rounds will take over for retiring Sen. Tim Johnson, who was on the fence about the pipeline but appeared willing to leave the final decision to the Obama administration. Add it all up, and Team Keystone appears likely to have a filibuster-proof majority of at least 61 votes, a number that could still grow if a handful of other Democrats break with the White House once it becomes clear the bill is heading for passage regardless of their opposition. Once a Keystone bill arrives at the White House, the president will have a very tough call to make. The most likely option would be for Obama to veto the bill, justifying such a move by pointing to the ongoing review. Republicans don't have the 67 votes they'd need to override a veto--but they could and likely would go on every talk show in the known universe to paint the president as obstructionist. If there's any hope at all that the White House and congressional Republicans could play nice and work together during Obama's final two years--and honestly, there probably shouldn't be--then this early fight would crush those dreams. The other option would be for Obama to relent and approve the pipeline--either by signing the Keystone bill or potentially even signing off on the project later this year before Republicans take control of the Senate. That, however, would enrage environmentalists, who are already skeptical of what they see as Obama's lackluster climate record. It would also make the president's U.N. sales pitch that much more difficult. The only people with nothing to lose politically are congressional Republicans, and they seem to know it. If Obama signs their bill, the GOP can point to the pipeline as proof they're delivering on their campaign promises. If the president vetoes it, he allows the GOP to argue ahead of 2016 that it's the Democrats who are responsible for the gridlock in Washington. Pipeline or no pipeline, then, the new GOP-controlled Congress will be off to a running start."	Obama Has Been Stalling on the Keystone Pipeline for Years. Now He Has to Make a Decision.
