Specifically, they've broadcast their interest in helping Donald Trump follow through on his vow to fix the nation's ailing roads, bridges, and grids. Congressional Democrats' foremost public faces, everyone from Bernie Sanders to Elizabeth Warren to Nancy Pelosi to Chuck Schumer, have sung the same tune: We are willing to help Trump rebuild American infrastructure, and to work with him to improve the lives of working people. When it comes to the more bigoted aspects of his campaign, though, they will fight him tooth and nail. These conciliatory words have sparked a fierce backlash among many members of the liberal commentariat, as well as a handful of legislators. ""If Democrats support elements of Trump's agenda,"" New York's Jonathan Chait wrote, ""it will make Trump more popular and lift the popularity of his party, enabling Republicans to entrench their majorities."" Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat representing Phoenix, said that Trump's ""infrastructure plan is really a privatization scheme, rife with graft and corruption, whose real purpose is to enrich the Trump family and his supporters."" The nascent anger about this collaboration was further inflamed by a Thursday New York Times article suggesting that Senate Democrats' ""surprising strategy"" was to ""align with Trump,"" a headline that may not have captured precisely what that ""strategy"" entailed. ""On infrastructure spending, child tax credits, paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements, Democrats are looking for ways they can work with Mr. Trump and force Republican leaders to choose between their new president and their small-government, free-market principles,"" Jennifer Steinhauer wrote. ""Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, elected Wednesday as the new Democratic minority leader, has spoken with Mr. Trump several times, and Democrats in coming weeks plan to announce populist economic and ethics initiatives they think Mr. Trump might like."" The strategy the Times describes here is not to turn the Democratic Party into a coalition of Trump acolytes. There is a middle ground between total resistance and total acquiescence. All of the arguments--legislative, political, moral--against working with Trump on anything are well-taken. But I'm frustrated by how easily some seem to have arrived at the conclusion that the only path for Democrats is absolute obstructionism, as though this is the obvious choice and there aren't any trade-offs. It's not so easy. As Jeff Spross writes at the Week, the Dems are looking at some profound trade-offs either way: between the improvements to people's lives that a quality infrastructure or child care bill could produce, and the popularity such victories might give to a figure who does not deserve it. So, let me argue the case for working with Trump on select issues if the conditions are right. Much of the opposition to working with Trump on infrastructure stems from the belief that the plan he's put forward is terrible. Policy writers are working off of a late October infrastructure proposal from one of Trump's economic advisers that hinges on private-public partnerships to create a sort of supply-side infrastructure plan. ""What Trump has right now is an idiosyncratic proposal for Congress to offer some $137 billion in tax breaks to private investors who want to finance toll roads, toll bridges, or other projects that generate their own revenue streams,"" Vox's Brad Plumer explains. ""But this private financing scheme, experts across the political spectrum say, wouldn't address many of America's most pressing infrastructure needs--like repairing existing roads or replacing leaky water mains in poorer communities like Flint."" It's a narrowly targeted plan that doesn't match what Democrats think of as an ""infrastructure bill,"" i.e., spending public monies to improve roads and bridges. As Slate's Jordan Weissmann wrote earlier this month, ""the main beneficiaries, in all likelihood, are the Wall Street investors who would love to skim some cash off your ride to work."" Sounds like a crap bill that Democrats shouldn't ""align with Trump"" on, right? If Chuck Schumer and his team really were tripping over themselves to line up behind this sort of thing, it would indeed amount to policy and political malpractice. But a senior Senate Democratic aide tells Slate that Trump's current infrastructure proposal is not the infrastructure proposal they're talking about collaborating on. If that's true--and we'll see once the actual debate begins--then the argument that Democrats shouldn't collaborate with him on this terrible proposal is irrelevant, because that's not what they're doing. Chait and Gallego also argue that Trump is corrupt, and so whatever bill he produces will be a con designed to serve his business interests. Chait argues that Democrats might ask as a price of cooperation that Trump ""insist that any dealing with Trump be conditioned upon him selling off his family business and placing the assets in a blind trust, and attaching a law requiring presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns."" That's a good idea! No one's arguing that Democrats can't set conditions. Then there's the political concern. I'm getting the sense that a lot of liberals, after having suffered under the reign of Sen. Mitch McConnell, are ready and eager to give the majority leader a taste of his own foul-tasting medicine. McConnell, in the 2011 quote I'm seeing re-circulating everywhere this week, explained his strategy of noncooperation in the majority-Democratic Senate of 2009/2010 like so: ""We worked very hard to keep our fingerprints off of these proposals,"" he told the Atlantic in 2011. ""Because we thought--correctly, I think--that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisan. When you hang the 'bipartisan' tag on something, the perception is that differences have been worked out, and there's a broad agreement that that's the way forward."" McConnell also recognized that most of the credit for passing major laws would accrue to the president--and if that law worked out poorly, most of the blame would fall on the Oval Office, too. In other words, now that the positions have switched, there's no political benefit for Democrats in working with Trump but plenty for Trump himself if the Dems play ball. McConnell took advantage of the sad realities of a broken political system, and Democrats should do the same. Mitch McConnell is a gifted proceduralist, but we shouldn't overstate what he was able to accomplish. McConnell was not able to keep Republican fingerprints off of the ""stimulus"" act and the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, which each got three Republican votes to push them past a filibuster. No Republicans voted for the Affordable Care Act, because--even though some GOP senators entertained the idea early on--the party as a matter of ideology doesn't agree with spending large amounts of money to achieve universal health insurance. It was impressive that Democrats could get three votes for Dodd-Frank, because Republicans don't believe that a lack of regulation caused the financial crisis. Similarly, congressional Democrats do not consider giving out tax credits to build toll roads as a great starting point for an ""infrastructure bill,"" so they would vote against it. If, however, Trump was interested in spending billions or even $1 trillion--either wholly borrowed, offset by a fee on repatriated corporate money, or via some other source of funds Democrats could live with--to fund identified infrastructure projects, that would be a Democratic idea. It would be a good bill that they want to pass, and good bills are worth voting for. Trump would get credit for it, yes--assuming small-government conservatives allowed it to move through the House and Senate. But there are a lot of Democrats in the Senate, too, ones who need something to show their constituents ahead of 2018. Democratic senators are up for re-election in 10 states in 2018 that Trump won, some more deeply red (Montana, Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, West Virginia) than others (Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida). They will all be difficult races, and Republicans will have an opportunity to pick up a supermajority. It would be mightily helpful for, say, Sens. Jon Tester, Heidi Heitkamp, and Claire McCaskill to have some sort of new bridge or highway to point to, because otherwise Republican-favoring midterm electorates in Republican states have little reason to vote for Democrats. (It might be so helpful to them, by the way, that they would tune out Schumer even if he tried to unite them in opposition. That may be part of the calculus in making overtures toward Trump in the first place.) The most difficult part of working with Trump is the moral component and what, exactly, Democrats would be rewarding by collaborating with this particular president. My colleague Jamelle Bouie laid it out on Wednesday. ""Supporting a Trump-branded infrastructure initiative as a discrete piece of policy where two sides can find common ground only bolsters a white-nationalist politics, even if you oppose the rest of Trump's agenda,"" he wrote. ""It legitimizes and gives fuel to white tribalism as a political strategy. It shows that there are tangible gains for embracing Trump-style demagoguery."" I don't have any nifty Actually! reply to this. If an infrastructure bill passes, and Trump's approval rating goes up as a result, it would still seem ... undeserved. But I also don't think it's tenable for Democrats--especially if Democrats were to advertise it as their strategy!--to keep their hands off every single thing that might make Trump look good, especially if the things that are making him look good include people getting good construction jobs and improved access to child care. To whatever extent Democratic senators work with Trump on these proposals, they should work extra hard to block the rest of his agenda. They should fight mass deportations, hard. They should fight appointments, like Jeff Sessions' for attorney general, hard. They should walk out of Congress if Trump moves forward with a ""Muslim registry."" They should use all the leverage they can possibly muster in the appropriations process to block rollbacks of the social safety net. If they do it right, they can show that they'll work with Trump on areas where he meets their interests, on their terms, while also making it known that they're not, in any way, interested in seeing this president serve a second term."	Should Democrats Work With Donald Trump?
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/donald_trump_is_bringing_america_government_by_the_worst_men.html	"What would it look like to live under a kakistocracy, Greek for ""government by the worst men""? You would have grifters and cronies and unqualified loyalists, but what else? What does it mean for someone to be the worst, and what does it mean for those people to have the reins of power? After this presidential transition, we are going to find out. Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump said he would hire ""the best people"" to staff his administration. If ""best people"" means experienced politicians, dedicated experts, or even skilled businesspeople, then he's stretching the truth. Few people with those qualifications are on board for an appointment to the Trump White House. But if ""best people"" means the hangers-on of the Trump campaign--the white nationalists, petty authoritarians, and conspiracy-mongers--then we're on target. Here, so far, is whom we have on the table. We have Stephen Bannon, the former head of Breitbart known for his open ties to white supremacists, anti-Semites, and foreign reactionaries in France and Russia. Bannon is a Svengali of sorts for the ugliest forces in American and international politics, a man who believes the Western world is in a fundamental struggle with Islam and who sees multiculturalism and liberal openness as a threat to the future of the West. As of this moment, he is chief strategist to President-elect Trump, with an office in the West Wing. The Washington Post gives a glimpse of what this might mean, in a story describing Bannon's role in moving Trump toward anti-Muslim policies and a larger ethnocentric vision. Chief strategist Bannon is joined by retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whom Trump has reportedly offered the job of national security adviser. On one hand, Flynn has a long and decorated career in military intelligence. On the other, his public statements reveal a conspiratorial mind, anti-Muslim beliefs, and a tolerance for anti-Semitism. And indeed, the Washington Post reports he was removed from his position as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for fostering a ""destructive climate."" Flynn has backed Trump on the renewed use of torture and refuses to rule out targeted killings of the families of suspected terrorists. He has stated, on Twitter, that ""fear of Muslims is rational"" and has peddled fake news, conspiracy theories, and anti-Jewish warnings. There's also the fact that when Flynn began receiving classified national security briefings as part of the Trump team, he was also working as an intelligence consultant for international clients, including a Dutch company owned by a wealthy Turkish businessman with ties to Turkey's autocratic President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. What makes this more alarming, in terms of tolerance for autocracy, is Flynn's friendliness with Russia. He's been criticized for appearing on Russian state-controlled media and for attending a dinner with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. And, it should be said, Flynn's son (who is also his father's chief of staff) has also pushed conspiracy theories and racist memes on social media. Rounding out this list is Alabama Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions. On Friday, various news outlets reported that Sessions was Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions--then serving as a United States attorney in Mobile, Alabama--to be a federal district court judge. At a time when confirmation was a given, Sessions' nomination stalled, then failed after testimony from those around him revealed a man with a dim view of black Americans. According to one federal prosecutor, reports the New York Times, Sessions suggested that a prominent white lawyer was a ""disgrace to his race"" because he'd represented black clients. Sessions had also referred to the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP as ""un-American"" for ""trying to force civil rights down the throats of people."" Another prosecutor, this one black, testified that Sessions had called him ""boy"" and joked that the Ku Klux Klan was ""OK until I found out they smoked pot."" According to the Times, ""Sessions denied calling the lawyer 'boy' but acknowledged or did not dispute the substance of the other remarks."" In recent years, Sessions has been an advocate for strict immigration laws and other ""tough on crime"" measures. Earlier this year, he cited Trump's 1989 advertisement calling for the execution of the Central Park Five as evidence of the president-elect's commitment to ""law and order."" He has also denied the existence of voter suppression in his state, arguing instead--like many Republicans--that there is an epidemic of voter fraud. Sessions, who was too contemptuous of civil rights groups and black Americans to be confirmed as a federal judge by a panel of Republican senators in the 1980s, is poised to lead an agency tasked with defending the civil rights of millions of nonwhite citizens--an agency founded, in part, to combat the Ku Klux Klan in the Reconstruction South. If confirmed, Sessions will be tasked with defending voting rights; investigating rogue police departments like the one in Ferguson, Missouri; and pushing standards that ensure fair treatment for all Americans, regardless of background. It's possible that Sessions would take up the mission of the DOJ and its Civil Rights Division. But given his history, the likely outcome is the reverse. Under Sessions, the Civil Rights Division would likely wither and die. And in the absence of federal oversight, states would pass voter suppression and disenfranchisement laws with impunity. Conservative lawmakers in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Texas--all scrutinized by Eric Holder's and Loretta Lynch's DOJ--are surely salivating. Now, let's step back and look at the big picture. Thus far, to staff his administration, Trump has chosen a white nationalist provocateur; an anti-Muslim conspiracy-monger; and an apologist for a regressive, anti-black politics (and this is before we get to potential appointee Rudy Giuliani, who embodies many of Flynn's and Sessions' worst qualities). These are ""the worst people,"" yes. But they also represent a coherent ideology and perspective: white nationalism. The thread that ties Bannon's alt-right advocacy to Flynn's clash-of-civilizations worldview to Sessions' skeptical eye toward civil rights enforcement is a belief in the political and cultural dominance of white Americans. Their America isn't a tapestry or a melting pot; it is simply white. Judging from the presence of men such as Bannon and Sessions, we should expect a Trump administration to roll back any progress this country has made toward inclusion and participation. We should also expect it to empower states to pursue discriminatory policy on voting, to empower local police departments to operate with impunity against communities of color, and to empower those who see Muslims--citizens or otherwise--as threats to contain or eliminate. As we step into this world--as we enter the age of kakistocracy--we should remember one thing. This isn't a departure from Trump's populism. It's the foundation of it. This is what Trump campaigned on. It's what he promised. And millions of Americans either wanted it or were willing to look past it. For the targets and victims of Trump's administration, there's not much of a difference there. Whether his voters wanted this or didn't, Trumpism is what they've wrought and what America will have to reckon with for generations to come."

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/i_cannot_stand_to_think_about_donald_trump.html	"I'm terrified by Twitter. Facebook freaks me out. Every time I check my phone, the appalling facts from yesterday have devolved into today's even more atrocious news. A climate-change denier may be in line to run the Environmental Protection Agency. A soft-drink lobbyist has the inside track for the Department of Agriculture. A man who doesn't think there's evidence for Darwinism could be in charge of education. A sheriff known for bringing back the chain gang might take the reins on national security. And now Steve Bannon, the publisher and propagandist beloved by white-power types, has been tapped to serve as one of Donald Trump's top lieutenants. It's even getting hard to keep the bad news straight. Earlier this week, I saw that Rudy Giuliani would be Trump's attorney general. But before I'd had the chance to wallow in my outrage, I got an update from a friend: ""now he's favored for sec of state,"" she texted me. Well, that's ... still terrible. Will Trump destroy the global economy? Will he bomb Iran? What's going to happen to gay marriage and abortion rights? Is the climate toast? What if, God forbid, there were another terrorist attack--would that be enough to make our country over as a fascist state? There's no way to know, so we can only talk about our fears, dwell on them, spiral, and obsess. The other day I walked by the protests on Fifth Avenue, where tens of thousands of people shouted ""Not my president!"" in the direction of a building. I need a break from all this dread and anger, a week or two where I can pretend that Donald Trump does not exist, if only to preserve my sanity and to save my strength for what's to come. Last year, I made a browser plug-in that blocked stories about the presidential campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and about a dozen major news sites. This week I've reconfigured it for Trump. Social media, Washington Post, New York Times, Slate--I love you all, but you're stressing me out right now. Information hurts more than it helps. Goodbye. But wait--surely, this is not the time to look away. Our nation is at a crossroads. It's not insane to throw yourself into a sea of anxious rumor, if it helps ward off enervation and despair. Resistance to autocracy must be stubborn, outraged, and uncompromising, wrote Russian dissident Masha Gessen in a searing piece for the New York Review of Books. ""It is essential to maintain one's capacity for shock,"" she said. ""This will lead people to call you unreasonable and hysterical, and to accuse you of overreacting."" Yeah, we're not overreacting. This shit is real. Pay attention, and do something. I understand that, but I actually do think we might be overreacting. Politics always causes the most distress during and right after an election. Political campaigns are designed to be instruments of fear. Their purpose is to rile; they traffic in outrage and the invocation of end times. For months, Trump insisted that terrorists and rapists were creeping across our borders, that crime is going up and jobs are going down. ""People are scared,"" he said. And the Democrats were just as wedded to the politics of existential dread. ""A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,"" Hillary Clinton warned us at the Democratic National Convention. Anti-Trump campaign ads showed mushroom clouds and called the candidate ""a threat to humanity"" with ""ties to foreign espionage."" A vote for Trump was a vote for Armageddon. Now that he won, is it any wonder we're worried the world might end? Perhaps we shouldn't be so panicked, at least right now. We're talking about talk, and then we're talking about the talk about that talk. Should Trump be taken seriously or literally, or both, or maybe neither? It's impossible to say; the man is not in office yet. He may yet deport 11 million immigrants. He and the Republican majority could repeal Dodd-Frank, build a wall, start a trade war, break up NATO, and purge Jews from public office. Any and all such things could happen, but we won't know for sure until he gets to work. For the time being, anxious flailing at imagined outcomes only saps our energy. That's not resistance; it's shadowboxing. Sorry, I'm not convinced. Maybe I'd feel differently if everyone hadn't spent the last year telling me that none of this would ever come to pass. I saw that thing on Twitter, quoting the New York Times profile of Adolf Hitler from 1922: ""Several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler's anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded."" Even Mike Godwin--the guy who freaking invented Godwin's Law--says it's not crazy to compare Trump to Hitler. Or if you'd rather not go that far, how about comparing Trump to Narendra Modi in India, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, or Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines? Pretending this isn't happening would be the worst thing we can do. OK, let's say we're headed somewhere very, very bad. What the hell are we going to do about it now, before Trump has taken any major steps in that direction? That protest on Fifth Avenue was totally unfocused, an incoherent mess of impotent rage. Not my president? If only. I'm seeing friends break down over things that haven't happened yet, and which they can't prevent. What good is that? Doing something is better than nothing. Doing what? Reading news, getting migraines, losing sleep? Well, what's the other option--living in denial? It doesn't make me any calmer if I shut my eyes, turn off the news, and hide from social media. When I go dark I'm left with this image in my mind: a black cloud spreading over the country like ink in water. I'm floating there beside it, swimming in place. Yeah, I've been inside that oil spill. It's called depression. How about this: If we're going to defend the nation's institutions, we must protect ourselves. Anything to keep the Babadook at bay. How about sending letters to Chuck Schumer, ranting to my friends, crying on the subway? Maybe those are better ways to keep the stain from growing in my mind. I'll go with my blackout, thanks. But what if I'm right? Yeah, what if you're right? That's what worries me. Then let's figure it out tomorrow."	Is It Shameful to Hide From the Reality of the Donald Trump Presidency?
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/why_the_democrats_need_keith_ellison.html	"Three days after the calamity of Donald Trump's election, Bernie Sanders took to the New York Times to say I told you so. ""I am saddened, but not surprised, by the outcome,"" he wrote. ""It is no shock to me that millions of people who voted for Mr. Trump did so because they are sick and tired of the economic, political and media status quo."" Treating Trump's victory as a repudiation of neoliberalism--rather than a repudiation of cosmopolitanism--he offered to collaborate with the president-elect. ""I will keep an open mind to see what ideas Mr. Trump offers and when and how we can work together,"" Sanders wrote, adding, ""If the president-elect is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families, I'm going to present some very real opportunities for him to earn my support."" It's easy to see why Sanders feels vindicated right now. The election did not prove he could have beaten Trump, but it proved that Clinton, who made her case partly on electability, could not. Nevertheless, it was shocking to see him take this conciliatory tone toward Trump, treating him as a man with a common set of values. As much as Sanders wants to represent the beleaguered white working class, the people who really need a champion now are those under direct and imminent threat from Trump and Trumpism. So far Sanders has shown himself unable or unwilling to lead the anti-Trump opposition, except in one way: by pushing Keith Ellison for Democratic National Committee chairman. Ellison, who announced his candidacy Monday, is the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He was the first Muslim elected to Congress, as well as the first black congressman from Minnesota. Ellison was the second sitting congressman to endorse Sanders but became an indefatigable Clinton surrogate as soon as the primary ended. He is uniquely positioned to unite progressives, carrying the passion of the Sanders movement into the party while representing the racial and religious minorities endangered in the Trump era. ""I don't think this can be understated: There is a divide in our party right now,"" said Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and a longtime Ellison supporter. ""There are a lot of people who are looking for a new voice and a new vision and a fresh perspective. We need someone who can heal that wound and bring everyone together, get all of those stakeholders and survivors to buy into the DNC and buy into our party and start putting our energies into fighting Republicans instead of fighting each other."" Howard Dean, who led the DNC from 2005 to 2009, is running against Ellison to get his old job back. His analysis of the election actually sounds a lot like Sanders': ""What this was was basically a populist revolution,"" he said on NPR. ""Luckily, we have a democracy here, so nobody got killed. And you saw a lot of people who have been left behind in globalization and they're unhappy about it."" Dean was a very good DNC chairman, but as a strong Clinton backer, he doesn't have the same sort of credibility with young, grassroots activists that he did 10 years ago. Unlike Ellison, he can't serve as a symbol of the party's future, and he's not properly articulating the peril of the present. Right now there's a howling need for leadership among Democrats. More people cast votes for Democratic Senate candidates as well as for the Democratic presidential candidate, yet because of the way our system advantages rural voters, this majority has no power in the federal government. ""Every day for the past week, the majority of American voters have awakened to a difficult reality,"" Nevada Sen. Harry Reid said in a floor speech on Tuesday. ""Not only did the man who lost the popular vote win the election, but his election sparked a rise in hate crimes and threats of violence."" Reid is one of the few politicians speaking for this majority, but he's about to retire. The people who are terrified by Trump's victory--not white working class Trump voters--need Democrats to represent them. They need politicians who will see them, acknowledge their horror, and fight to muster whatever still exists of our democratic institutions on their behalf. The job of progressive leaders is to say no to Trump, not search for areas of cooperation. Ellison understands that. On Thursday, he took part in a conference call with members of Democracy for America, the grassroots political organization founded by Dean, where he spoke about opposing ""Trump and Trumpism at every turn."" He emphasized Trump's lack of a mandate: ""Most people who voted didn't vote for him. He may be technically the president, but most Americans didn't vote for him. This is key for us to understand in terms of our legitimate opposition."" There are many arguments one could make for why Ellison should be DNC chairman. Martin speaks about his skills as an organizer and his understanding of how to rebuild the party at the state and local level. As a representative of one of the country's most safely Democratic districts, says Martin, Ellison could coast to re-election, but instead he's worked hard to increase voter turnout and build the party's strength in each election. ""He's partnered very closely with the state party and the local party committees, and he understands how important it is to build that infrastructure,"" said Martin. But what matters most of all is that Ellison himself has so much at stake. He can be trusted to pour himself into the resistance because his own future in this country depends on it. ""I want to acknowledge the pain and the fear that people have,"" he said on the conference call. ""I myself am an adherent of one of the faith groups that he has identified as a target. But I'm telling you, we have to see through our tears at this moment, dig down into our faith, and really lace up sneakers and really get out there on the streets."""	The Democrats Don't Need to Cooperate With Donald Trump. They Need Keith Ellison.

Two of my friends, both of them principled and talented conservatives, told me they were approached by members of the Trump team about possible posts in the incoming administration. Both of them find Trump horrifying and did not vote for him. Both had the same initial reaction: No way. Both would have been willing, maybe honored, to take posts in a different Republican administration. All this was before the election. Now, both recognize that they face an ethical dilemma: If the transition team approaches them again, should they say yes? A similar dilemma faces career lawyers in government service who object to the new president and fear what they might be asked to do. Should they look for new jobs? As for law students and other lawyers considering government service, including anti-Trump Republicans: Is joining the administration a moral obligation, in order to fight for the rule of law and fact-based decisions in the administration of an erratic president? Or is it an unacceptable moral sellout? Should you go into the administration because it needs your voice? Or is exit, not voice, the principled option? Of course, what lawyers and officials might be asked to do in the Trump administration is at this moment a complete cipher, so perhaps it's too soon to say. Trump has walked back some of his most horrifying campaign boasts. Given his indifference to truthfulness and inconsistency, we have no idea what his real positions are on many issues or even whether he has real positions. (Remember that last May he promised to commit war crimes, then quickly reversed and expressed respect for international law.) Nor do we know what role he sees for himself--decision-maker or, as this July article suggests, star-of-the-show who leaves policies to others in his administration. And much depends who those others are. Ross Douthat, writing in the New York Times under the creepy headline ""You Must Serve Trump,"" makes the case for morally responsible Republicans to go into the new administration to combat Trump's worst impulses. If not morally responsible Republicans, then who? The argument makes eminent sense. But Douthat adds a caveat:"	The Case Against Serving in the Trump Administration
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_good_trump_voter.html	"Donald Trump ran a campaign of racist demagoguery against Muslim Americans, Hispanic immigrants, and black protesters. He indulged the worst instincts of the American psyche and winked to the stream of white nationalists and anti-Semites who backed his bid for the White House. Millions of Americans voted for this campaign, thus elevating white nationalism and white reaction to the Oval Office. Understandably, critics of Trump have used this to condemn Trump voters, tying them to the likely consequences of their vote, blaming them for foisting Donald Trump on the country and the world. To this, there's been a pushback. ""[P]lease understand what is happening here,"" writes Michael Lerner in the New York Times in a column titled ""Stop Shaming Trump Supporters."" ""Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality."" He continues: ""The left needs to stop ignoring people's inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans."" On Twitter, Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post gave his version of this argument. ""The assumption that 'Trump voter = racist' is deeply corrosive to democracy. Also wrong,"" he said, adding that there ""is nothing more maddening--and counterproductive--to me than saying that Trump's 59 million votes were all racist. Ridiculous."" Meanwhile, more than 300 incidents of harassment or intimidation have been reported in the aftermath of Trump's election, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. NBC News confirmed several, including incidents where vandals spray-painted slurs (""Heil Trump"") and swastikas on churches serving Hispanic or LGBT communities. At San Diego State University, a hijab-wearing Muslim student says she was confronted and robbed by two men who made comments about Trump, and at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, a Muslim student says a man approached her and threatened to set her on fire unless she removed her hijab. At the University of Pennsylvania, black members of the freshman class were added to a racist social media group, where students were threatened with lynchings. Millions of Americans are justifiably afraid of what they'll face under a Trump administration. If any group demands our support and sympathy, it's these people, not the Americans who backed Trump and his threat of state-sanctioned violence against Hispanic immigrants and Muslim Americans. All the solicitude, outrage, and moral telepathy being deployed in defense of Trump supporters--who voted for a racist who promised racist outcomes--is perverse, bordering on abhorrent. It's worth repeating what Trump said throughout the election. His campaign indulged in hateful rhetoric against Hispanics and condemned Muslim Americans with the collective guilt of anyone who would commit terror. It treated black America as a lawless dystopia and spoke of black Americans as dupes and fools. And to his supporters, Trump promised mass deportations, a ban on Muslim entry to the United States, and strict ""law and order"" as applied to those black communities. Trump is now president-elect. Judging from his choices for the transition--figures like immigration hardliner Kris Kobach and white nationalist Stephen Bannon--it's clear he plans to deliver on those promises. Whether Trump's election reveals an ""inherent malice"" in his voters is irrelevant. What is relevant are the practical outcomes of a Trump presidency. Trump campaigned on state repression of disfavored minorities. He gives every sign that he plans to deliver that repression. This will mean disadvantage, immiseration, and violence for real people, people whose ""inner pain and fear"" were not reckoned worthy of many-thousand-word magazine feature stories. If you voted for Trump, you voted for this, regardless of what you believe about the groups in question. That you have black friends or Latino colleagues, that you think yourself to be tolerant and decent, doesn't change the fact that you voted for racist policy that may affect, change, or harm their lives. And on that score, your frustration at being labeled a racist doesn't justify or mitigate the moral weight of your political choice. In the same way that the election-year demand for empathy toward Trump supporters obscured the consequences of Trump's support for his targets, this demand for empathy does the same. It's worse, in fact. In the wake of Trump's win, the United States was hit with a wave of racist threats, agitation, harassment, and violence, following a year in which hate crimes against Muslim Americans and others reached historic highs. With Trump in office, millions of Americans face the prospect of a federal government that is hostile to their presence in this country, and which views them as an intrusion, even if they are citizens. Even if they've lived their entire lives as Americans. To face those facts and then demand empathy for the people who made them a reality--who backed racist demagoguery, whatever their reasons--is to declare Trump's victims less worthy of attention than his enablers. To insist Trump's backers are good people is to treat their inner lives with more weight than the actual lives on the line under a Trump administration. At best, it's myopic and solipsistic. At worst, it's morally grotesque. Between 1882 and 1964, nearly 3,500 black Americans were lynched. At the peak of this era, from 1890 to 1910, hundreds were killed in huge public spectacles of violence. The men who organized lynchings--who gathered conspirators, who made arrangements with law enforcement, who purchased rope, who found the right spot--weren't ghouls or monsters. They were ordinary. The Forsyth County, Georgia, sheriff who looked the other way while mobs lynched Rob Edwards, a young man scapegoated for a crime he did not commit, was a well-liked and popular figure of authority, as described by Patrick Phillips in his book Blood at the Root: A Racial Cleansing in America. And the people who watched these events, who brought their families to gawk and smile, were the very model of decent, law-abiding Americana. Hate and racism have always been the province of ""good people."" To treat Trump voters as presumptively innocent--even as they hand power to a demagogic movement of ignorance and racism--is to clear them of moral responsibility for whatever happens next, even if it's violence against communities of color. Even if, despite the patina of law, it is essentially criminal. It is to absolve Trump's supporters of any blame or any fault. Yes, they put a white nationalist in power. But the consequences? Well, it's not what they wanted. ""One can be, indeed one must strive to become, tough and philosophical concerning destruction and death, for this is what most of mankind has been best at since we have heard of man,"" wrote James Baldwin in his seminal work, The Fire Next Time. ""But it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime."" We can hope Trump was bluffing about his promises. If not, then the next four years will be hard for the Americans he plans to target. What we cannot do is pretend this wasn't a choice, that no one was responsible.

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/can_the_secret_government_save_us_from_donald_trump.html	"In October 2014, the Ideas section of the Boston Globe published a piece under the headline, ""Vote All You Want. The Secret Government Won't Change."" The story, based on an interview with Tufts University professor Michael J. Glennon, quickly became a runaway hit on social media. In it, Glennon explained that President Barack Obama had failed to follow through on some of his key campaign promises--for instance, closing down Guantanamo Bay and ensuring Americans' privacy was protected during the war on terror--because a legion of professional government bureaucrats prevented him from doing so. These individuals, Glennon said, steered policy to an extent that most Americans, with their idealistic assumptions about the power vested in elected officials, could not imagine. Glennon has credibility. He's the former counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as well as a consultant to a number of congressional committees and the State Department. As the Globe pointed out, his book, National Security and Double Government, was blurbed by people who had worked in the Department of Defense, the White House, and the CIA. That's part of why the interview--in which Glennon stated that the ""American people are deluded"" in their belief that ""when they vote for a president ... policy is going to change""--was such a hit. It seemed like proof that there really was a secret government calling the shots--at least in the realm of national security, which Glennon focused on--while the politicians whose faces we know paraded in front of us on television like so much window dressing. I thought about Glennon's thesis last week, after it sank in that Donald Trump had won the presidency and would soon be installing his pack of pet goons at the top of the country's federal agencies. It struck me as a reason for optimism: If in 2014 the notion of a ""secret government"" felt like dismaying evidence that the system was rigged against Obama's ambitious vision for change, in 2016 it feels like a promise that Trump won't manage to single-handedly destroy America's institutions. I called Glennon at his office at the Tufts Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy to find out if I was right to feel reassured by his thesis. At first, I got exactly what I had come for. Then, to my chagrin, Glennon stopped saying things I wanted to hear. Our conversation, which has been condensed and edited for clarity, is below. Leon Neyfakh: In your book, you argue that there are essentially two governments in Washington. There's the one made up of elected officials, who are put there by the people, and then there's this other group that is composed of, basically, professional government workers who are actually in charge of setting policy. Do I have that right? Michael J. Glennon: My book is an application of a theory devised in the 1860s by Walter Bagehot in his book The English Constitution. According to the theory, there were two sets of institutions in Britain. The so-called dignified institutions--the House of Lords and the monarchy--presented a facade of authority and decisional power that enjoyed legitimacy in the eyes of the British people, and a set of concealed institutions--""efficient"" institutions--that operated behind the scenes and actually formulated and implemented governmental policy. I take this theory in the book and ask whether the progeny of England might also be analyzed through this dualist framework. And the suggestion in the book is yes. The ""dignified"" institutions are the ones that are constitutionally established: the presidency, Congress, and the courts. And in the realm of national security, the ""efficient"" institutions actually engage in the process of defining national security and formulating measures to safeguard it. And what are those institutions? They are not, in fact, institutions so much as a network of managers made up of several hundred individuals who direct the intelligence, national security, law enforcement, and military departments and agencies of the U.S. government. [Their existence] explains the strange continuity in national security policy from the Bush administration to the Obama administration. The first three pages of the book are a list of policies--from drone warfare to prosecutions of whistleblowers to the invocation of state secrets privilege, mass surveillance, you name it-- which have been, for all intents and purposes, virtually identical through the two administrations. That in a nutshell is the nub of the thesis of the book. The obvious question it poses, which I suppose may be impelling your call to me, is what are the implications of this for the Trump presidency? And to what extent can we look to this managerial network to serve as a check on potentially repressive policies in a Trump administration? Before we get to that, I'm wondering: Who are the people in this managerial network? What are their jobs and where do they come from? The short answer is they come from several different sources. Some are careerists. Some are in and out-ers, meaning they're people from law firms or academia who get appointments in the national security bureaucracy at managerial levels for a specified period of time. There's no one career path. Some are presidential appointees, but that number is fairly small in the national security realm. It's much lower than most people realize. And among those appointees, many, many are carry-overs from the prior administration. The list of people in the Obama administration who also worked in these jobs in the Bush administration is long. And those who did not were heavily influenced by the carry-overs. One thing that's surprising about your thesis is that you're suggesting these people are more powerful than the elected officials who are putatively in charge of directing them. Why is that? Most people aren't more powerful than their bosses. The short answer is that policy in these sorts of organizations is not top-down. That's the myth under which the public operates. Policy proposals percolate up from within the bureaucracy, and inevitably policy proposals that are generated at the top are met with resistance for a wide variety of reasons. The authors of the extant policies typically are still present in the organization, or their proteges are. They have a vested interest in the continuation of policies that they helped create. So the policies develop a life of their own. I would have assumed that when a new administration takes power, a lot of the people who staff federal agencies are replaced with people whose thinking is more in line with that of the new president. Is that not true? It's largely untrue. It is true, of course, that there is a turnover among the most visible appointees, be it a new national security adviser and secretary of defense and secretary of state and director of the CIA. But the second- and third-level jobs are not going to have any turnover for a long period of time, and may not have any turnover at all. Charlie Savage's book describes this brilliantly, in case after case after case. Read the chapter on Greg Craig and Eric Holder sitting down for the first time with the leadership of the NSA and CIA to learn about the mass surveillance programs. They have virtually none of their own people under them who can brief them on what they're about to hear or what questions to ask. So you know, [James] Clapper and his crowd comes in and unloads with lots of jargon and references to programs Craig and Holder have never heard of before. They don't have time to engage in tracking down the citations and references to figure out whether any of these programs are legal, what the history of them is, who's thought them up, where they originate. They're still trying to figure out where the bathroom is. I'm sure that's exactly how it's going to be at the outset of the Trump administration. They've got to rely very heavily on the bureaucracy for these answers, and people who have been there and had experience and have participated in the formulation of these policies. So that gets us to Trump, who, as someone who has never worked in government before, certainly doesn't know where the bathrooms are. What should we expect in terms of continuity on national security when he takes office? Well, the first question is, what does he want to do? And what does he tell the bureaucracy to do? He's told us at various points during the campaign some contradictory things about what his policy directives are going to be. So take a worst-case scenario. Suppose he really tries to deliver on the most draconian policies he has described, like reinstituting waterboarding or ""taking out the families"" of people he suspects of being terrorists, both of which he has said he'd do. What is the effect going to be within the agency? What happens if he tells the intelligence services to institute these sorts of policies and they say no? I mean, the short answer is he fires them. He fires whoever says no and causes those people to be replaced with people who say, ""Yes, Mr. President."" And there's no difficulty in finding people who will say that. There's a long line of individuals willing to replace somebody who is insubordinate. And there is a strong incentive to be subordinate and compliant, because you could lose your job, lose your income, be ostracized by your friends and professional associates. How many people in Washington are really going to stand up and say no? That just really doesn't happen. If it did happen somehow that the directors of these programs ended up successfully defying a presidential order, what would happen to the legitimacy of democratic government? Suddenly you'll have reversed the power flow that is set out in the Constitution. Instead of having power flowing from the constitutional institutions to the departments and agencies created by the president and Congress, you have power flowing from them to the presidency. There are other twists and possibilities we can talk about, but I just don't see it working. I don't see bureaucratic checking as a realistic way of stopping a populist authoritarian president. OK. That is not what I expected you to say. Everything you've told me up to this point made it sound like there's this bureaucratic inertia that comes from having this network of managers that we can count on to create continuity. Well, let me continue. There's another possibility, and that is that the managers would not engage in direct defiance of a presidential order, but rather that, backstage, behind the scenes, they would slow-roll what the president wants to do. They would effectively present the president with an intensified form of the bureaucratic inertia and torpor that has, in the past, caused the bureaucracy to be such an impediment to changing national security policy. So the question is, would that work as a check? Yes. That phenomenon is present. Whether it's intended or not, that's the way bureaucracy works--it's part of the plumbing, and you can't turn it off by twisting the faucet. The sluggishness and slowness is part of the system and it could be more protracted if there's a measure of intentionality behind it. However, while that could work in the short term, it's doubtful it would work in the long term. Ultimately, the leadership of the bureaucracy--the Trumanite network, as I call these several hundred people--does have essentially the same overarching objective as the leadership of the Madisonian institutions, and that objective is to appear in the eyes of the public to be on the same page. Because when there is a public dispute between the two, they lose legitimacy. So there's a strong incentive to remain in sync, and over the medium and long term, you would most likely find a kind of power-sharing arrangement in which the leadership of the national security institutions comes to adapt and accommodate themselves to president Trump's policies. I don't really understand what you're saying. Wasn't the point of your book that Obama was overpowered by this network of managers, in terms of following through on his objectives going into his administration? It sounds like you're saying now that Trump will be able to impose his will on them. Well, it's purely hypothetical at this point, but the situation you're imagining is that the managers of the national security institutions in a Trump administration would seek to play the role of a check and to do so publicly, by defying a presidential order. They haven't done that in the Obama administration. The Obama administration and the Trumanite network have been on the same page. But we're hypothesizing a situation in which these institutions play a very different role, and that they are not publicly in sync. When that condition ceases to obtain, in Bagehot's theory, the consequences are that the whole structure falls to earth. That's really the situation that we're speculating about, in which the national security bureaucracy stands up and says no. And that did not happen during the Obama administration. So then why didn't he do all the things he said he wanted to do? Weren't you just telling me this bureaucracy, this network of managers, was the reason Obama didn't close Guantanamo and all the other things on his list? As I understood your question, you're raising the specter of a public confrontation in the Trump administration versus the normal, quiet bureaucratic inertia. No, I'm asking if that quiet bureaucratic inertia will be enough to rein him in. If we were having this conversation eight years ago and I was someone who was terrified of Obama's proposals on Guantanamo and Afghanistan and the NSA, you would have told me, ""Well, he probably won't be able to do those things,"" right? What's different is you're speculating about the occurrence of a public split between the network of managers and the president. That never happened in the Obama administration. We're talking about the network of managers publicly, overtly, possibly with great fanfare saying ""no."" And that goes to the core of the condition required to make double government work, which is that the dignified and efficient institutions operate on the same page, that they operate in sync. If there's an open split between the two, the legitimacy of each is undermined. That's the difference between the situation we're speculating about and the one that prevailed during the Obama administration. There was no public split. Why not? Why did the Obama administration not stand up to the NSA or the CIA? If you buy Bagehot's theory, one of the principal reasons is that the dignified institutions--the Obama administration--would have lost legitimacy by publicly splitting with the efficient institutions, and it's essential to the maintenance of legitimacy that they appear to be operating on the same page. OK. I guess I don't understand why the Obama administration made that calculation but you don't think the Trump administration will. Is it specific to Trump? Are you saying he, specifically, is the kind of leader that would overpower this network of managers? Well, according to your hypothetical, the one we've been talking about, it's not the Trump administration that jumps off the page--it's the CIA or the military that says no, right? Sure, but didn't they say no with Obama? Isn't that the whole point of your book? That their inertia was so powerful that they could prevail over the president's will? I wish I could send you a copy of the book before you write this. I don't know if that would help. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but the thesis of your book is that there are these people who work for the government, and they're gonna do what they're gonna do, and they're gonna do it regardless of what the elected officials want, because they have these quiet ways of asserting themselves. But you're saying that won't hold under Trump. Right? If Trump directs the Central Intelligence Agency to resume waterboarding and people say no, or President Trump directs the military to take out the families of suspected terrorists ... You're saying there's no quiet way to oppose that? It's very difficult to speculate about what hasn't happened yet. OK. Well, I am not reassured. You're not reassured in which direction? I thought you were going to tell me that there's enough power in this network of managers that we don't have to worry about the prospect of the Trump administration realizing our worst fears. I'm sorry to disappoint you. I'm sorry too. I think the reason that interview in the Globe was so resonant with people is that it suggested our government is much less democratic than it seems--that we elect these people but actually they're relatively powerless against the bureaucracy they oversee. With Trump in power, I would actually like that to be the case. A lot of people would like that to be the case. I think it's a false hope."	"Can the ""Secret Government"" Save Us From Donald Trump?"
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/why_did_some_white_obama_voters_for_trump.html	I did not grow up in a place where black Americans predominated. Where I lived, whites were the clear majority. And while I moved through black spaces, my day-to-day world was filled with white people: My neighbors were white; my teachers were white; many of my friends were white. I can attest only to my experiences, but I suspect I'm not alone in what this environment meant for my life. It meant I had close, loving relationships with white people. And it also meant that some of those same people were racists. They hugged me hello, and they locked their car doors when an unfamiliar black person walked by. There's nothing novel in this dichotomy. There's no point in American history where racists haven't loved, and been loved by, people of color. At every point in our past, people committed to white racial superiority have also admired the minds and bodies of black Americans. And why wouldn't they? Most racists aren't Ben Tillman or Bull Connor. They're not monsters. They're just people. And on the other side, black Americans--whether in the South or outside of it--have always had relationships, even close ones, with white racists. Part of being black is navigating the reality of white Americans who show kindness and care in one breath and say nigger in the other. Understand this fact, and you have a better grasp on one of the key dynamics that put Donald Trump in the White House. Election Day exit polls are unreliable for understanding the shape of an electorate. Why? Because exit polls don't measure the actual composition of an electorate; instead, they relay the shape of exit poll respondents. And while that can come close to representing the pool of people who voted, it isn't an exact match. But that doesn't make them useless; exit polls still tell us something about how Americans voted. And the results are somewhat surprising. It's clear that Donald Trump won on the strength of white voters. But he also performed somewhat better than his predecessor, Mitt Romney, among black and Hispanic voters (although Latino Decisions, a polling firm, disputes the latter finding). And a decisive portion of his voters--working-class whites in the states of the industrial Midwest--voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Even if these numbers aren't exact, they're still important. Taken together, they seem to complicate one narrative around the election of Donald Trump: that it represents a swift backlash borne of white tribalism and white resentment. If some nonwhites voted for Trump and if some Trump-backing whites voted for Obama, how could it be racism? What does white nationalism have to do with it? During the 2008 election, FiveThirtyEight relayed an anecdote from the campaign trail:	Why Did Some White Obama Voters Go for Trump?
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/where_slate_s_election_day_partnership_with_votecastr_went_wrong.html	"On Tuesday, Slate--in partnership with the data startup VoteCastr--published running estimates of which candidate was leading and by how much in seven battleground states. The real-time Election Day experiment did not go smoothly. Technological problems prevented VoteCastr from providing us with those estimates for much of the morning, which made it impossible for Slate to present that information to readers as we had promised. Although we launched the day at 10:30 a.m. with VoteCastr's estimates of the early vote split, it wasn't until early afternoon that the turnout data started flowing in from polling places and our vote-tracking visualizations were updating correctly. Even then, there was enough lag time in the process that the information we displayed was updating more slowly than we would have liked--roughly every 30 minutes rather than minute by minute. We knew presenting a stream of Election Day data would pose technical challenges. Nevertheless, we hoped our partnership with VoteCastr would provide Slate readers with insight into what was happening on the ground and how campaigns assessed turnout in real time. How did VoteCastr do on that front? Not great. The most obvious way to assess VoteCastr's performance is to judge its estimates against the actual election results. As you'll see in the tables below, in most cases those estimates did not match reality when the polls closed. A direct comparison between the last VoteCastr estimates published on Slate and real-world vote totals isn't entirely fair, however. The numbers presented on Slate portrayed VoteCastr's assessment of the current state of the race at any given moment on Election Day, not a projection for the final outcome in each state. VoteCastr collected its final batch of field reports in the East Coast states it was tracking at 5 p.m. EST, two hours before polls started closing there, and pushed its final batch of data to us at 6:45 p.m. EST. Why stop in the early evening? VoteCastr says it opted to deploy more field workers for fewer hours rather than use fewer field workers for more hours. Given that one of the project's goals was to show the public how a campaign boiler room operates, that makes some sense--campaigns are far less interested in the data that comes in toward the end of the day, because there isn't much they can do with it in those last few hours. What campaigns do is gather robust data early in the day and use it to project both the current state of play and to make projections for the eventual result. Still, VoteCastr's decision to pull its trackers is difficult to square with its promise of providing civilians with a ""play-by-play"" look at Election Day. Voting in those final hours accounts for some of the gap between VoteCastr's estimates on Slate and the real-life results. In presenting VoteCastr's data on Slate, we made the editorial decision to show which candidate held the estimated lead in each state at a particular moment in time, not to project who would win once all votes had been cast. But VoteCastr also made end-of-day projections, which it provided to its other media partner, Vice. That set of numbers, like the ones we presented on Slate, also missed the mark in most of the states VoteCastr was tracking. In the following table, you'll see the last current vote split estimates that VoteCastr gave to Slate on Tuesday evening: In this next table, we've compiled the final estimated projections that VoteCastr says it presented to Vice on Tuesday evening. These end-of-day numbers represent how VoteCastr believed the vote split would shake out if the trends it had observed up until that point continued until polls closed. (VoteCastr also analyzed the vote in Colorado, where Hillary Clinton won by 2.9 percentage points and where VoteCastr estimated Clinton had a 2.7-point lead after counting a portion of ballots cast early. But since the majority of votes are cast by mail in the state, VoteCastr did not track real-time turnout there, so Slate did not include those estimates in our interactive.) The leader in VoteCastr's end-of-day projections went on to win in five of the seven states it was tracking on Election Day. Five of seven has a nice ring, but it's difficult to see these results as a success. In only two of those battleground states were VoteCastr's projected splits within 3 points of the final results. In three, by contrast, its projections were off by 8 points or more. The main takeaway from the numbers above, then, is that in more than half of the states VoteCastr was watching, what it believed it was seeing at 5 p.m. had little in common with how those races looked when they reached the finish line. In Wisconsin, VoteCastr saw a comfortable 8-point lead for Clinton. In reality, Donald Trump pulled out a 1-point squeaker there. In Ohio and Iowa, VoteCastr saw dead heats. When the final votes had been counted, Trump had won those states by roughly 9 and 10 points, respectively. And in Florida, VoteCastr saw Clinton up by nearly 4 points, a larger margin than Barack Obama won the state with in both 2008 and 2012. In the end, Trump beat Clinton by a little more than 1 point. Meanwhile, even one of VoteCastr's apparent successes came with an embarrassing footnote. Of all of its end-of-day estimates, VoteCastr was closest to the final results in Nevada. The company's model for the state, though, had included Jill Stein despite the fact the Green Party nominee did not appear on the ballot there. What went wrong? We've spoken with several members of the VoteCastr team during the past few days. While none were ready to draw any firm conclusions, they suggested they'd likely been felled by the same Clinton-favoring pre-election polls that caused so many of their fellow number-crunchers (as well as most journalists) to underestimate Trump's chances. The VoteCastr model involved multiple moving parts, including tracking turnout in select precincts on the ground, then extrapolating those numbers to estimate turnout in areas they were not observing. But Ken Strasma, who served as the microtargeting chief for the 2008 Obama campaign, told us the morning after the election that although there might have been other contributing factors, he believed the difference between his team's estimates and the actual results ""could be entirely due to the polls overestimating Clinton's support."" That's a simple answer to a complicated question, but it strikes us as generally credible. While VoteCastr carried out its own proprietary, large-sample polls, the team told us prior to the election that its numbers were generally tracking with public surveys. The VoteCastr team was up front about the fact that its estimates would only be as good as the models that made them, which would only be as good as the polling data they used. This isn't Wednesday-morning quarterbacking: When we spoke to the team before Election Day, it said inaccurate polling was one of its biggest concerns. If respondents weren't being honest with the pollsters about who they were going to vote for--or if there were a late shift that occurred after the pollsters left the field--any poll-based projections would be doomed. In that regard, at least, VoteCastr has plenty of company. The New York Times' Upshot, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, and every other major poll-based prognosticator saw Clinton as the clear favorite heading into Election Day, and at least one went as far as to suggest a Clinton victory was nearly inevitable--a far more concrete prediction than VoteCastr ever made on Election Day. ""It's not going to be VoteCastr that's going to explain why everyone's polling was off,"" CEO Ken Smukler told us Thursday morning. ""There are huge polling firms with egg on their face today."" Complicating things, however, is that the accuracy of VoteCastr's end-of-day projections didn't all vary from pre-election polling in the same way. In Pennsylvania, VoteCastr's projection (which saw Trump winning by 2.6 points) was closer to the final returns (Trump by 1.2 points) than an average of pre-election polling in that state (Clinton up 3.7 points). But VoteCastr's projections were further from reality than the polls were in four of the other states it tracked (Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Florida), while it missed by roughly the same margin as the polls in the remaining two (Nevada and New Hampshire). It's possible that the polling problems weren't spread out uniformly across the nation. Poll respondents, for instance, could have been more honest in some states than others. Right now, all such theories are unproven. Regardless, it's clear that there's no specific, one-size-fits-all polling answer to explain the discrepancies between what VoteCastr thought it was seeing and what ultimately happened. There are other potential reasons for error. VoteCastr's project was premised on the idea that microtargeting and Election Day tracking could solve one of the biggest challenges faced by pollsters: figuring out how many people would actually show up to vote. By counting turnout at a preselected sampling of precincts on Election Day, VoteCastr believed it could make informed guesses about who was turning out in the rest of that state. That method might have failed to produce reliable results for any number of reasons, from problems with how the field workers collected the data, to a failure by the model to accurately predict which specific voters were the ones turning out. One potential reason for the latter: VoteCastr did not attempt to account for the reality that campaigns and their respective parties prioritize get-out-the-vote operations differently in different places in different elections. Right now, there are many possible explanations for what happened on Tuesday, but the case remains unsolved. ""Thirty-six hours doesn't provide the right vantage point to assess this stuff,"" Sasha Issenberg, the onetime Slate columnist and campaign data expert who helped found VoteCastr, told us on Thursday. He said the company remains committed to performing an empirically sound postmortem to figure out what happened but that it won't be complete until states update their voter files, a process that can take months. From the start, we've considered the VoteCastr project to be an experiment. It was based on two ideas: First, that there's no sound reason to keep real-time information from voters on Election Day. Second, that the methodology used by campaigns could prove more valuable and accurate than exit polling in anticipating election results. In the end, VoteCastr wasn't able to nail the election outcome. But the larger journalistic theory here--that voters who spend elections tracking public opinion polls and assessing analyses of early vote numbers can handle information about their fellow voters' preferences on Election Day itself--remains intriguing. VoteCastr didn't work perfectly this time. We still believe it was an experiment worth trying, and we remain open to presenting data to our readers on Election Days to come."	Where Slate's Election Day Partnership With VoteCastr Went Wrong

To delight in his comeuppance. To observe his passionate fans' last moments in the sun, and to suss out where Trump's true believers would turn in the throes of postelection despair. Things didn't turn out as planned. I'll leave it to others to determine how Trump won. All I can report is what I saw from the most excited, energized chunk of his base. The adoring fans who stood in endless lines outside rallies, shuffling through the hot midday sunshine or the shivery nighttime cold. The red-hatted masses who packed drafty airport hangars and musty minor league hockey rinks--all because they hated me, and maybe you, too. * * * Monday, the last day of Trump's 2016 campaign, began with a typical rally in Sarasota, Florida, in an arena thundering with chants of ""Lock her up"" and ""CNN sucks."" I was huddled in the media pen with the traveling press, awaiting the moment Trump would point at us and incite his 5,000 minions to jeer. When the boos did rain down, they were as loud as I'd ever heard them--home stretch, final sprint, leaving-it-all-out-there boos. Trump pushed the same button again minutes later, and the boos were louder still. One lady leaned up against the pen's barrier, flashing double-thumbs-down and a disquieting scowl. When Trump arrived at the line in his stump speech about ""the first 100 days of the Trump administration,"" it was the press pack's agreed-upon cue to gather up laptops and cameras and hustle onto the bus idling outside. We motorcaded through the streets with police lights twirling at every corner, slowed to a stop on the airport tarmac a few yards from the rolling staircase, scrambled aboard the charter 737, and roared aloft within moments. So began a five-state, 15-hour, end-game dash. Raleigh, North Carolina. Scranton, Pennsylvania. Manchester, New Hampshire--where the entire Trump family took the stage amid laser lights and smoke. And then the last, postmidnight rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The identical routine each time: wheels down, motorcade to event, security herds us into the pen. Sit through boos from the crowd and ridicule from the stage. Security herds us out, back to the plane, wheels up, repeat. By the third rally of the day, I'd begun to question why we were there. Yes, reporters were dutifully recording Trump's outlandish promises, shameless untruths, and ignorant fuck-ups. (Unless they weren't worth the ink amid the other, bigger fuck-ups. At one point on Monday, Trump referred to Haitians as Hispanics--a flub that I think went unreported but might have dogged Mitt Romney for half a news cycle.) Still, any Americans who hadn't yet cared about this shit weren't going to start now. No, there was something else. An uncomfortable suspicion taking hold in me. I became convinced we weren't at these rallies to observe. We were there to be observed. Ever since the first Trump event I attended back in March, I'd wondered why his campaign was so intent on impounding us inside these press pens during his speeches. Was it to prevent us from speaking to rallygoers? If so, it was ineffective--you can chat with them all you want before or after the event or by beckoning them to the edge of the pen. Maybe it was meant to keep us from filming protesters up close? Again, didn't work, as violent abuse of these dissenters was caught on camera again and again. The campaign itself has always claimed it was a security protocol, which made little sense, as everyone inside the venues has been swept by Secret Service--and if journalists can handle war zones, they can handle a little shoving. Perhaps I'd been naive, but it only now dawned on me, in the final week of the campaign, to my great horror, that the real reason they put us in the pen was so they could turn us into props. We were a vital element in Trump's performance. He never once failed to invite his crowds to heckle us. He was placing us on display like captured animals. And it worked. The press pack, collectively, looked nothing like the crowds at Trump events--particularly in more rural towns. We'd file into these places with our sleek luggage and our expensive tech gear and our better haircuts. We were far more diverse than the people in the stands. When the crowds lustily booed us, we'd sit there impassive and stone-faced, and this only further served to convince the rallygoers that we were snobby, superior pricks. The pen was an amazingly efficient means of othering us. Behold, Trump said to his fans, I've rounded up a passel of those elites you detest. And I've caged them for you! Allow me to belittle them for your delight. Here, now you take a turn--go ahead, have at it! Do it again, don't be shy! Under President Trump, the other elites will be in cages, too. We'll lock them up, just like the chant goes. Just like you wanted. You'll be their captors. In retrospect, this was the core message of Trump's campaign. * * * It's so tempting to reduce Trump diehards to an angry composite. But each time I met individual rallygoers--I saw Trump speak in about 20 cities over the course of the campaign and would guess I've interviewed at least 200 people at his events--I'd be reminded that Trump's core is in fact an angry tapestry. In Denver alone, I met a woman who'd gone to Caltech and had a Ph.D. in planetology; a man who was a director-level executive at a medical devices company; another fellow who was a V.P. of finance at a college. There were plenty of women, a fair amount of Latinos, and a handful of blacks. (The very first Trump supporter I interviewed, back in March, was a black woman who buttonholed me to say, ""Donald Trump tells the truth."") There's no denying racism is in the mix at Trump events. You'll very rarely hear it explicitly stated (except maybe from the man on the stage), but you'll hear a lot of coded language. The thing is, there has always been coded language coming from the right. In 2012, it was ""lazy takers"" mooching off ""makers."" In 1988, it was Willie Horton coming for your family.* In 1980, it was the proverbial ""welfare queen."" The flood of Islamophobia this year, spurred by fear of terrorism, does feel new and is horrifying. (In Hershey, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 4, I spoke to a military vet who said, ""We need to nuke the Muslims before they nuke us, or one morning we're gonna wake up and New York and Tel Aviv are gonna be vaped."") But from my own experience interviewing the hardcore Trump ride-or-die'ers at rallies, I just don't think this was the driving emotion behind their entrancement. Nor do I think it was all about NAFTA and TPP for the in-the-tank Trumpers. Not a single Trump supporter I spoke to, even at the Rust Belt rallies, brought up protectionism. They might say Trump will ""bring our jobs back,"" but they mean that in a general sense--they believe he's a brilliant businessman with a nose for economic success. I honestly think Trump might have done just as well with these folks had he never mentioned NAFTA and simply promised, in his vague way, to get the economy humming again. His campaign was in no way about policy. It was the singer, not the song. The one notion shared by every wildly enthusiastic Trumpist I met--both in my earlier stint covering his campaign and in this last week on the trail--was a firm conviction that Donald Trump is on their side in a war against elites. That he'd fight for them in their battle against the preppy eggheads who run the government, the financial system, and the media. I heard it over and over. On Nov. 2 in Orlando: ""He's being honest about what's going on behind the scenes. There's so much corruption. I think even if he loses we have an awareness of that corruption now."" On Nov. 3 in Jacksonville, Florida: ""He's not an insider politician. He's gonna change stuff up. That's what we need. No more insider deals in politics."" On Nov. 4 in Hershey: ""Donald Trump isn't the establishment. I voted for Obama because he said he'd get rid of lobbyists, but he didn't. Trump really is a people's revolution."" On Nov. 5 in Denver: ""Fuck the federal government. Fuck them all. I have friends that are planning a tax revolt. I'll move to the first state that secedes."" A Rand survey in January, prior to the primaries--before Trump's bandwagon had swelled with reluctant Republicans who'd preferred Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz--found that one criteria above all others predicted support for Trump (emphasis mine):"	How Trump Conned America
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/what_america_looks_like_under_president_trump.html	"After Republicans won control in Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, they embarked on a vast project of ideological governance. Free from any checks or balances, they went to war with the idea of the ""public""--anything that couldn't go into the pockets of businesses or wealthy individuals was gutted, slashed, and left for dead. There's a strong chance that, under President Trump and a GOP Congress, we will see the same for the nation at large. And depending on the appetite of the Republican Party--and the willingness of President Trump--we may see a sweeping repudiation of liberal-democratic governance, with an end to the guarantees of the New Deal and the Great Society. Americans who think the change of government means little for their lives are in for a surprise. With a Republican president in the White House and majorities in the Senate and the House, Speaker Paul Ryan has the fuel he needs to enact his ""road map,"" an expansive plan to roll back the American welfare state, such that it exists. Essentially, to replicate for the country what Sam Brownback and Bobby Jindal have done for their respective states. What should we expect? With President Trump's signature, Ryan will repeal the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and much of the legislative legacy of the Obama administration. He will craft and pass a massive package of tax cuts and ""tax reform"" that will deprive the federal government of revenue and fundamentally change the relationship between it and the American public. It's still unclear what the executive branch will look like under President Trump. But he'll be responsible for thousands of appointments in countless federal agencies. Given his promises--to build a wall on the Mexican border, to ban Muslims from the United States and surveil those within our borders--Trump's most important appointments may be in federal law enforcement. What does the Department of Justice look like under an Attorney General Rudy Giuliani? Does it maintain the present effort to address racial inequities in policing, or does it embrace the police and their most reactionary elements, bestowing impunity on those who abuse their state-sanctioned right to kill? Judging from Giuliani's record, Trump's DOJ does the latter. We can ask the same question of Trump's proposed nominee for the Department of Homeland Security, Sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee, infamous for his attacks on Black Lives Matter and his near-insurrectionist rhetoric. When a president runs on the use of state power against disfavored minorities, what can we expect from his nominees and his agencies? The most monumental change will be in the character of the Republican Party itself. After the 2012 election, Republican reformers begged the party to expand--to include the groups that were repulsed by Mitt Romney and his campaign. The only way the GOP could succeed, they argued, was to reconcile itself to the changing demographics of the country. This was wrong. There was a way the Republican Party could succeed: by abandoning the ideal of racial equality and reshaping itself as a party of white reaction and white backlash. Rather than win nonwhites, Republicans could radicalize whites through demagoguery and race baiting. They could activate white racism and shape it into a potent political force. It's not a new strategy--it was old hat in the age of Jim Crow, where Southern aristocrats ran populist campaigns of ""nigger baiting""--but it was untested in the 21st century, an antiquated relic of a less civilized age. We now know this works. With a racist campaign, Republicans can win a decisive share of white voters, from working-class whites--who voted on Tuesday like an ethnic bloc--to college-educated whites and younger, ostensibly ""tolerant"" whites. Political parties almost always take the path of least resistance. And for the Republican Party in 2016, that path has been paved with a message of white nationalism and herrenvolk democracy. Of government for Us, not for Them. If there's anything to expect going forward, it's that other politicians will emerge who follow Trump's lead and adopt elements of his approach. And not just on the right. Now that white nationalism sits at the center of our politics, figures on both sides will reconcile and accommodate themselves to it. They will grasp the opportunity that he and his presidency represents. Trump has shown the explosive power of white reaction in American politics. Soon, others will wield it for themselves.

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/trump_beat_romney_s_popular_vote_count_by_2_points.html	The title of this post says it all. A 2 percent shift in public opinion is not so large and usually would not be considered shocking. In this case the race was close enough that 2 percent was consequential. Here's the background: Four years ago, Mitt Romney received 48 percent of the two-party vote and lost the presidential election. This year, polls showed Donald Trump with about 48 percent of the two-party vote. When the election came around, Trump ended up with nearly 50 percent of the two-party vote--according to the latest count, he lost to Hillary Clinton by only 200,000 votes. Because of the way the votes were distributed in states, Trump won the Electoral College and thus the presidency. In this earlier post I graphed the Romney-Trump swing by state and also made this plot showing where Trump did better or worse than the polls in 2016: Trump outperformed the polls in several key swing states and also in lots of states that were already solidly Republican. Various online poll aggregators were giving pre-election probabilities ranging from 66 percent to 99 percent in favor of Clinton winning. These probabilities were high because Clinton had been leading in the polls for months; the probabilities were not 100 percent because it was recognized that the final polls might be off by quite a bit from the actual election outcome. Small differences in how the polls were averaged corresponded to large apparent differences in win probabilities. Hence sociologist Pierre-Antoine Kremp and I argued that the forecasts that were appearing were not so different as they seemed based on those reported odds. The final summary is that the polls were off by about 2 percent (or maybe 3 percent, depending on which poll averaging you're using), which, again, is a real error of moderate size that happened to be highly consequential given the distribution of the votes in the states this year. Also we ignored correlations in some of our data, thus producing illusory precision in our inferences based on polls, early voting results, etc. Several explanations for what happened have been offered. It's hard at this point to adjudicate among them, but I'll share what thoughts I have:	Trump's 2-Point Popular Vote Gain Over Romney Is What Mattered
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/how_liberals_can_channel_their_post_election_anxiety_into_action.html	"The shocking results of Tuesday night's election have left Hillary Clinton supporters in varying states of despair. Many are filled with sadness, fear, and anger, with little sense of what to do with their emotions. One option? Put those feelings to good use. Below, Slate writers and other staffers offer their suggestions for what voters can do with their post-election anxieties. If you are worried about reproductive rights:
 Support an abortion clinic by donating money, volunteering, or escorting women to clinics. Reproductive rights will be under dire threat during a Donald Trump presidency, and protesters at clinics will try to make it even more difficult and threatening for people to access necessary health care. Volunteers often escort patients through proselytizing, woman-shaming crowds outside abortion clinics, lending support and courage to people who sometimes don't have a friend or family member to accompany them. Women of means will always be able to access abortions across state or national borders. Poor women, rural women, and a disproportionate number of women of color will bear the bulk of the burden of an anti-abortion Trump administration. The National Network of Abortion Funds compiles a list of organizations around the country that offer abortion funding, places to stay, child care, transportation, and other types of logistical support for patients who need it. People committed to reproductive justice can donate money, a couch to sleep on, a meal, a car ride, or a supportive presence at the clinic. --Christina Cauterucci If you want more women in government:
 Support Emily's List and other groups working to get more women and minorities into office. Emily's List's vision of a government that reflects the people it serves is noble and needed now more than ever. Women and people of color need a bigger say in the way our nation is governed. Instead of solely focusing on the presidency every four years, those seeking change should put real energy and support behind qualified, diverse candidates at the local level. --Faith Smith If you're concerned about the climate:
 Change your eating, drinking, and energy consumption habits to live more sustainably. The climate stakes of last night are so huge as to be almost unfathomable. Hundreds of years, dozens of generations. We can't get around that fact. The future of humanity--and all the species we share this planet with--is much murkier now than it was 24 hours ago. Yes, we'll need systemic change to preserve a habitable planet for future generations, but that change begins with small steps in our own daily lives--and Trump can't keep you from starting that today. --Eric Holthaus If you are a non-Muslim who's worried about Islamophobia:
 Fight misinformation by reading the Quran and learning more about Islam. Muslims have been here before. We've become a very resilient minority group in the wake of 9/11 and America's never-ending war on terror. Our biggest enemy right now is misinformation, so reading an English translation of the Quran is a good start to understanding your Muslim neighbors. I recommend the Quran translated by the Institute of Islamic Knowledge in Houston. I also recommend Moustafa Bayoumi's How Does It Feel to Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America, a collection of short stories on the lives of Arab Americans living in Brooklyn, New York. --Aymann Ismail If you're worried about the freedom of the press:
 Pay for journalism. Buy a subscription for yourself and/or for a Trump supporter. The GOP now controls every branch of the federal government, and the president-elect has already declared an intention ""to open up libel laws"" to make media organizations more vulnerable and ""have people sue you like you've never got sued before."" If you still believe in checks and balances, it's time to invest in and fortify the fourth estate. Many of the country's largest publications subsist on fragile business models that remain overly dependent on advertising revenue or venture capital. Before the internet, people paid for journalism and there were no ad blockers. Yes, journalism deserves some blame for the outcome of this election. But people who don't pay for journalism shouldn't feel entitled to simultaneously bemoan paywalls, clickbait, and the decline of shoe-leather reporting. It costs money to publish good journalism that runs counter to the interests of powerful people and institutions. Ask Gawker. --Jeff Friedrich If you are worried about bridging cultural divides:
 Volunteer with Big Brothers Big Sisters. In my experience, making a difference means starting in your own community, your own neighborhood. To that end, I have found that volunteering on a 1:1 basis with Big Brothers Big Sisters has been one of the most rewarding decisions I've ever made. That one-on-one relationship, in my opinion, is so crucial as we build real relationships and understanding in our communities, across cultures and invisible divides. My ""little"" and I have been matched for almost two years. She is 15, goes to a STEM high school, wants to be an engineer, and is wise beyond her years. This organization is a beacon of light for me when I'm feeling down, selfish with my own time or thoughts, and particularly in this political climate. The mutually beneficial aspect has been surprising to me, and I'm grateful to the organization for having such a strong presence and track record of success. If you find yourself fumbling through the day, I implore you to channel what you might be feeling by checking out Big Brothers Big Sisters and looking into applying to be a youth mentor. --Stephanie Pollok If you are worried about income inequality and our schools:
 Support nonprofit education programs. Education reform didn't get anywhere near the attention it deserved in this ridiculous election season. Trump's stances on the subject thus far have been vague and frequently ill-conceived. Meanwhile, the U.S. education system continues to fail us, and especially fail those who come from low-income families. Not everyone can or should become a teacher, but there are many other ways to make up for our government's shortcomings, like for example, supporting local nonprofits that directly provide education and programming for kids at high-need schools. (I'm part of a board for an organization that educates kids in performing arts after school, and their school attendance and graduation rates are impressive.) There also may be opportunities to volunteer your time or fundraise for these programs--you can find some through Charity Navigator or by Googling nonprofit expos being held in your community. --Aisha Harris If you are concerned about immigration:
 Volunteer for organizations like these. It seems very likely that immigrants will suffer a great deal under Trump's presidency, as he's already expressed a lot of anti-immigrant sentiment during his campaign. So the time is now to make sure that immigrants are supported adequately and have access to things like legal services, government agencies, schools, housing, health care, and--perhaps most importantly--the knowledge of their own rights. So what can you do? Donate and volunteer your time to organizations that provide these resources to immigrants. If you know another language, offer to become a translator or a court advocate. Teach a citizenship class, or a conversation class, or offer to become a conversation partner. Become an advocate for workplace justice and the right to a living wage. Figure out what the organization might need or lack, and offer up your skills--it'll make a difference. If you're based in New York City, check out Make the Road NY, which provides resources to immigrants in the form of a community center. Volunteer to be an English conversation partner via Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow in Bushwick. Or figure out how you can volunteer to be a teacher at either Citizenship through English at Long Island City Adult Learning in Queens or Citizenship through English at Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow in Bushwick, Brooklyn. --Jennifer Lai If you care about hunger and poverty:
 Donate to a food bank. There's a strong chance that over the next four years, much of the American social safety net will be badly damaged, if not outright shredded. Congressional Republicans have been waiting for the entire Obama era to enact a fairly radical restructuring of American government. They would like to slash taxes, particularly on the wealthy, and slash spending on the poor. House Speaker Paul Ryan has claimed that his proposed reforms to anti-poverty programs ""is not a budget-cutting exercise."" But the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that the latest House budget plan would eliminate $3.7 trillion from programs that benefit low- and moderate-income households over a decade. ""In 2026,"" the think tank notes, ""it would cut such programs overall by 42 percent--causing tens of millions of people to lose health coverage and millions to lose basic food or other support."" It's not a given that President Trump would sign such a plan. But I wouldn't bet against it. So, how do you respond? I'd say donate to your city's food bank, for starters. They have strong infrastructures for delivering help efficiently to people in need, and frankly, getting a family food is often the next best thing to getting them cold hard cash. If you're worried about people going hungry, make sure they have dinner. --Jordan Weissmann If you are worried about the future of liberal governance:
 Run for local office. If you are worried about the future of liberal governance and frustrated by the craven centrism of a Democratic Party still in thrall to a discredited brand of liberal capitalism: Run for school board. Run for city council. Get some friends together and put up for local office whichever one of you didn't get popped for possession in college. From the start, the genius of the conservative movement was to work from the ground up, to put people sympathetic to the cause in local office after local office. That's partly why even the most optimistic scenarios Tuesday night gave Democrats little chance of seizing control of the country's statehouses; as a matter of state politics, we are a deeply Republican country. Channel your rage now into changing that. --Tommy Craggs Read more of Slate's election coverage."	10 Productive Things Clinton Supporters Can Do With Their Trump-Fueled Anxieties
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/debunking_myths_about_trump_voters_with_exit_polls.html	"How did Donald Trump, the worst major-party nominee in memory, get elected president of the United States? What were his voters thinking? A lot of theories and accusations are flying around, but many don't square with the best available evidence: surveys of voters as they left their polling places. Unlike pre-election polls, which missed many voters, exit polls by definition are a survey of the electorate. So, with an understanding that exit polls can have biases or errors of their own, let's take a hard look at the data. 1. Did the FBI decide the election? On Oct. 28, FBI Director James Comey said the FBI might have found new evidence in the probe of Hillary Clinton's emails. On Sunday, he said the FBI had examined the evidence and found no reason to reopen the inquiry. That's a nine-day stretch. The exit poll asked people when they had finally decided for whom to vote, and the first options on the list were ""in the last few days"" or ""in the last week."" Six percent of voters said they had decided in the last week but not in the last few days, and Clinton lost these voters by 12 percentage points. So she lost 1 percentage point of the total vote during that time, and we can't be sure how much of it was due to the FBI. The total effect of Comey's letter is unclear, but it seems small. 2. Did the debates help Clinton? Not as much as pundits expected. I thought Clinton's superior preparation, demeanor, truthfulness, and wisdom were obvious in these debates. Press accounts largely agreed. But voters didn't see it that way. In the exit poll, 26 percent of voters said the debates were the most important factor in their decisions, and Trump lost these folks by only 4 percentage points. Reporters and voters don't seem to be judging debates by the same criteria. 3. Hunger for change trumped other considerations. The exit poll asked voters, ""Which one of these four candidate qualities mattered most in deciding how you voted for president?"" The options were ""has the right experience,"" ""has good judgment,"" ""cares about people like me,"" and ""can bring needed change."" Fifty-six percent of voters picked one of the first three categories, and Clinton won these voters handily. But 39 percent of voters picked the fourth quality--""can bring needed change""--and Trump got 83 percent of those votes. The ""change"" factor overrode everything else. 4. Dislike of Trump wasn't enough to sink him. Each candidate won virtually all the voters who had a favorable opinion of that candidate. Clinton's favorable rating was higher, so she came out ahead. But 18 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of neither candidate, and those voters broke for Trump, 49 percent to 29 percent. That made the difference. Given a choice between two candidates they didn't like, they picked the outsider. 5. Bad temperament wasn't enough to sink Trump. Forty-three percent of voters said Clinton lacked ""the temperament to serve effectively as president."" A much higher number, 63 percent, said the same of Trump. That was expected to be a big advantage for Clinton. But while Clinton won only 5 percent of the 43 percent who flunked her temperament, Trump won 20 percent of the 63 percent who flunked his. So Trump came out well ahead. Many voters saw that his temperament was bad, but voted for him anyway. 6. Nearly half of Trump's voters admit his treatment of women was troublesome. Fifty-five percent of Trump voters said his ""treatment of women"" bothered them not much or not at all, but 45 percent said it bothered them ""a lot"" or ""some."" The 45 percent weren't saying that his sexism didn't exist. Nor were they saying that it didn't trouble them. They were saying that other factors, to them, were more important. 7. Trump did surprisingly well among groups he was thought to have fatally offended. He got 8 percent of blacks (Mitt Romney got only 6 percent in 2012), 29 percent of Latinos (Romney got 27 percent), and 41 percent of moderates (Romney also got 41 percent). Trump trailed Clinton among women by 12 percentage points, but that wasn't much worse than Romney, who lost them by 11 points. Trump also got 31 percent of voters who said they hadn't been born as U.S. citizens. These figures complicate the theory that racism and sexism carried Trump to victory. 8. Trump's voters didn't support deportation. They agreed with him about building a wall on the Mexican border. But when they were asked whether ""most illegal immigrants"" should be deported or ""offered a chance to apply for legal status,"" 53 percent chose legal status. 9. Terrorism was a crucial factor. The exit poll asked, ""Which one of these four issues is the most important facing the country?"" Sixty-five percent of voters picked the economy or foreign policy, and these voters went for Clinton. Thirteen percent picked immigration, and those voters went for Trump. The backbreaker was the fourth issue, terrorism. Eighteen percent of voters picked that issue, and they broke for Trump, 57 percent to 39 percent. That gap, fatally, cost Clinton slightly more than 3 percentage points of the total electorate. 10. Trump's voters are headed for disappointment. Many analysts think this electorate was driven by anger. That's not quite true. Only 23 percent of voters said they were angry about the way the federal government was working. Trump won 77 percent of their votes, but that wasn't enough to match Clinton's advantage among the 29 percent of voters who said they were satisfied with, or enthusiastic about, the way the government was working. What tilted the election was the 46 percent of voters who said they were ""dissatisfied but not angry."" They went narrowly for Trump, 49 percent to 45 percent. These people, having voted out one party based on disappointment but not anger, might do so again in four years if Trump can't help them much more than President Obama did. In fact, there's already a sign of trouble in the Trump coalition: 17 percent of voters said the next president should change from Obama's agenda to ""more liberal policies,"" and 23 percent of those voters cast ballots for Trump. That's 4 percent of the electorate. When these folks see Trump applying conservative policies, they're likely to be disappointed. Maybe even angry. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Trump's Voters Don't Support Deportation, and Other Surprises From the 2016 Exit Polls
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/a_muslim_in_trump_s_america_i_m_not_shaving_my_beard.html	"Close friends didn't wait for the election to be called to text me warnings. ""I am sorry for this."" ""Be careful."" ""Don't stand too close to subway platforms."" I still hadn't processed what we had just done, and already I was being given practical advice on how to be a Muslim in Donald Trump's America. Tuesday was a slow-dawning personalization of the election for me. First came a wave of anxiety at the thought of Trump in the Oval Office. Then came the nausea, realizing what it means for our nation's moral compass. Then, at least, was an overwhelming need to head to Trump HQ at the New York Hilton to see it for myself. The train ride into Manhattan gave me that same feeling every Muslim got in post-9/11 New York. Looking out for anyone who didn't share my complexion. Not putting on headphones, lest I make myself vulnerable. Keeping my eyes on the ground, wanting to be invisible. I've been around Trump supporters before. I was at the Republican National Convention, defending my religion to misinformed Republicans. The vibe outside Trump HQ at the Hilton was different. The discussion was over. This was settled doctrine. Trump is the president-elect, and his bigotry in every form had been ratified. ""Does this mean grabbing pussies is legal?"" one white twentysomething joked to his friends. (I wasn't the only person who heard some version of this joke.) They laughed. One guy frighteningly told a black card-carrying veteran that he should consider finding another country to live in. All he and his friends sought was to ""peacefully separate from you,"" he told the man. A few miles from where I was born, I felt like a man standing on foreign soil. I spoke to a few of Trump's supporters outside the Hilton. I identified myself as Muslim to 30-year-old Vjekoslav Grgas, decked out head to toe and from consonant to consonant in Make America Great Again gear, and tried explaining to him what a President Trump could mean to American Muslims. ""You need three things to have a country,"" Grgas explained. ""Borders, language, and culture. Why is it so wrong that Americans want a border, a culture, a language?"" He went on to assure me that Trump couldn't possibly hold bigoted views because of his success in international business. I shook his hand and begged him not to forget me. What else can you do as a Muslim desperately trying to convince someone you aren't out for global domination. Like many Muslims right now, I'm very worried about Trump's newly galvanized white nationalist supporters. George W. Bush at least paid lip service to the notion that we were not at war with Islam. This time, we have someone who has made it abundantly clear that he believes Islam is at war with the United States and that regarding your neighbor with suspicion (and perhaps even hostility) is not just a protected right but a moral imperative. Why wouldn't his supporters lash out at us? Who is protecting us? Young Muslims in overwhelmingly red states are going to school Wednesday alongside their vindicated Islamophobic bullies. Muslim women are looking at themselves in the mirror, figuring out if it's safe or not to continue wearing a hijab. Men are shaving their beards. Well, I'm keeping mine. Many of the people Trump insulted in his campaign are much stronger than he and his supporters believe. We've inherited something from our parents and grandparents. Immigrants live in a suspended state between opposition and assimilation, and this requires a kind of toughness and adaptability. I called my mother to ask for some of her reliable Egyptian guidance. What she told me, I want to share with everyone who is anxious about the prospect of losing our rights as Americans. She said to me in Arabic: ""Aymann. We never know where goodness can come from, and we never know what will be good for us right away. Goodness can come from anywhere, but it will always be found within."" For the next four years, during what promises to be a time of intense social reaction, we will not be able to depend on our government to guide us. Our strength will have to come from within.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/white_won.html	"Around 11:30 on Tuesday night, I left CBS News studios in New York City to take a walk and call my wife. We talked about the election. We talked about the very real chance of President Donald Trump. We talked, just to talk. But we didn't talk long. We had to do work. I had to write. And she had to figure out what she would say to her students, many of them Hispanic, most of them young children of immigrants. Heading back, I walked past a conversation between two cops. They were outside the building, on duty. They were black. And out of some need to keep talking, I walked over and jumped into their conversation. Neither officer questioned me or shooed me away. Instead, they invited me to commiserate with them. ""I can't believe this. I just can't believe it,"" said one of the officers, the younger of the two. The other just shook his head. I asked the younger officer what he thought about all of this--about President Donald Trump. ""This is deep, man. This is deep. Who am I supposed to be protecting now?"" He looked down at his uniform. ""Why am I wearing this?"" He didn't need to explain. The Donald Trump who won the presidency on Tuesday is the Donald Trump who demanded execution for five boys, wrongly accused of a crime. He is the Trump who ran on a platform of ""law and order."" The age of Trump will be an age in which police can act with impunity. And as an officer of color, he knew, perhaps better than anyone, that it's people who look like us--who are brown and black--who will face the brunt of that impunity. Pundits and observers will attribute Trump's win to ""populism"" or his ""anti-elite"" message. This is nonsense. Trump ran for president as a nationalist fighter for white America. He promised to deport Hispanic immigrants. He promised to ban Muslims from the United States. He refused to acknowledge Barack Obama's legitimacy, casting him--until the end--as a kind of usurper of rightful authority. When faced with the fetid swamps of white reaction--of white supremacists and white nationalists and anti-Semites--he winked, and they cheered in response. And for good reason. More than anything, Trump promises a restoration of white authority. After eight years of a black president--after eight years in which cosmopolitan America asserted its power and its influence, eight years in which women leaned in and blacks declared that their lives mattered--millions of white Americans said enough. They had their fill of this world and wanted the old one back. And although it's tempting to treat this as a function of some colorblind anti-elitism, that cannot explain the unity of white voters in this election. Trump didn't just win working-class whites--he won the college-educated and the affluent. He even won young whites. Seventeen months after he announced his candidacy, millions of white Americans flocked to the ballot box to put Trump into the White House. And they did so as a white herrenvolk, racialized and radicalized by Trump. There's an easy rejoinder here: How can this be about race when Trump won some Obama voters? There's an equally easy answer: John McCain indulged racial fears, and Mitt Romney played on racial resentment, but they refused to go further. To borrow from George Wallace, they refused to cry ""nigger."" This is important. By rejecting the politics of explicit racism and white backlash, they moved the political battleground to nominally colorblind concerns. Race was still a part of these clashes--it's unavoidable--but neither liberals nor conservatives would litigate the idea of a pluralistic, multiracial democracy. Looking back, I thought this meant we had a consensus. It appears, instead, that we had a detente. And Trump shattered it. With his jeremiads against Hispanics and Muslims--with his visions of dystopian cities and radicalized refugees--Trump told white Americans that their fears and anger were justified. And that this fear and anger should drive their politics. Trump forged a politics of white tribalism, and white people embraced it. Here's what we need to understand: This has happened before. For 10 brief years after the Civil War, a coalition of ex-slaves and white farmers worked to forge democracy in the former Confederacy. With the help of the federal government, they scored real victories and made significant gains. But their success spurred a backlash of angry whites, furious at sharing power with blacks and their Northern allies, murderous at the very idea of social equality. Those whites fought a war against Reconstruction governments, and when they won, they declared the South redeemed. Decades later, another group of blacks and whites--this time in North Carolina--banded together to topple reactionaries and establish democracy. For a short moment, they succeeded. Working together as ""fusionists,"" they built schools, brought relief, and established true representative government in the South. And the backlash came. Some whites would relinquish white supremacy. Most wouldn't. Using violence and terrorism, they toppled the fusionists and established a rigid white rule that would last into the 20th century, eventually dismantled during our Second Reconstruction, the civil rights movement. As soon as that Reconstruction ended, there was a backlash. But it wasn't as strong as previous ones. It brought leaders who nodded to problems of racism and racial discrimination, even as they played on white fears and white anxieties. After years of struggle, we had come to some agreement: We believed in equality. And when a black man won the presidency--the symbolic pinnacle of white power and white prerogative--we celebrated as a nation. Fifty years after the black freedom movement forced the United States to honor its ideals, at least on paper, it's clear this was premature. Like clockwork, white Americans embraced a man who promised a kind of supremacy. We haven't left our long cycle of progress and backlash. We are still the country that produced George Wallace. We are still the country that killed Emmett Till. Americans are stubbornly, congenitally optimistic. And the millions who backed Trump see something in his visage. Something that gives them hope. Here's what I see. I see a man who empowered white nationalists and won. I see a man who demanded the removal of nonwhite immigrants and won. I see a man who pledged war crimes against foreign enemies and won. I see a man who empowers the likes of Rudy Giuliani and others who see blacks as potential criminals to control, not citizens to respect. After the redemption of the South, black Americans--and nonwhites around the country--faced the nadir. Whites imposed new kinds of discrimination and turned a blind eye to the pogroms and racial terrorism that was scarring the American landscape. In a few hours, millions of Americans will wake up in the age of Trump. I, and millions who look like me, will open our eyes to a second redemption. We can only hope--we can only pray--that we won't reach a new nadir. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	We Are Still the Country That Produced George Wallace.

What would lead the losing side to take such calls seriously? President-elect Trump giving a speech against hate crimes and repudiating the Muslim ban he floated during his campaign, yes. But here are four more suggestions for Donald Trump. I offer them without illusion that they are likely to be adopted. They would be sensible steps, however, for a new president who actually did want to bring the country together. 1. President-elect Trump should propose an independent bipartisan commission to investigate FBI interference in the 2016 election. It appears that rogue elements within the FBI used the extraordinary powers of federal law enforcement to attempt to influence the presidential election. Damaging leaks came from the Bureau, seemingly timed to inflict maximum political damage. For example, FBI Director James Comey referred in his first letter to Congress only to an ""unrelated investigation."" It was presumably an anti-Hillary Clinton group within the FBI that unlawfully leaked the link to an investigation of Anthony Weiner's alleged sexting with a 15-year-old girl. The selective leaking by an element of FBI to influence an election is a crime against democracy. We cannot ""move on"" without addressing it. 2. President-elect Trump should propose an independent bipartisan commission to investigate interference by Russian secret intelligence in the 2016 election. There is no doubt that Russian civilian and military intelligence invaded and unlawfully appropriated internal documents from the Democratic National Committee. And there is little doubt, as politically damaging information was selectively released, that this operation was done to influence the U.S. presidential election. How could investigating this not be a matter of the highest national priority? The debates in Philadelphia in 1787 reflected the framers' enormous concern that U.S. politics would become playthings of European governments. They feared French and British parties would be a staple of American politics. In our time we may need fear having Russian- and Chinese-influenced parties. Ordinarily, our political losers should simply accept their losses in this election and look ahead to the election four years from now. But why would we expect the next election to be fair, as long as the FBI and KGB interference in this election goes unexamined and unresolved? If FBI elements can undertake such actions in a Democratic administration with a Democratic attorney general, why would we not expect them to engage in similar or worse actions to re-elect a sitting President Trump? And if Russia can meddle in our election even as a Democratic administration can threaten retaliation, what will stop them from re-doubling their efforts to re-elect Trump? 3. President-elect Trump should propose an independent bipartisan commission to investigate voter suppression in the 2016 election. I offer this suggestion without opinion as to whether unjustified barriers to voting played a significant role in the election. But we ought to know. What would a study of this election show about whether there was any voter fraud avoided? What would it show about whether the newly enacted restrictions made voting unfairly more burdensome? When the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, it expressly assumed that racial discrimination was behind us and that political actors could be trusted to see that unjustified barriers would not be tolerated. We need to make good on that expectation. I should pause here to say: Independent commissions are not the only mechanism for addressing these three problems. House and Senate committees could undertake these inquiries themselves, of course. There was a time when we could expect the legislature to be a check on executive malfeasance. But the era of hyperpartisanship has undercut the role of Congress as a check, as increasingly members see themselves as party members first and officers of a separate branch of government a distant second. Sen. Lindsey Graham is a welcome exception, calling on Tuesday for his fellow Republicans to investigate Putin's seeming interference in the American election. The press could and should also undertake these inquiries, but the media lacks the critical power to compel documents and testimony. And of course where leaks are the weapons of partisan warfare, the press is conflicted. The New York Times was a recipient of leaked information from ""three law enforcement officials,"" which I would presume likely included someone from the FBI group that was attempting to influence the election. The Washington Post featured gossip and worse from Russian interference attributing the information to what it called the ""anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks""--an oddly benign description of one of the most secretive and least transparent organizations around, one that now appears to be a conduit for Russian military intelligence. So bipartisan commissions may be our best hope. And President Trump could make them happen. 4. President-elect Trump should urge the Senate to vote on Merrick Garland. I hesitate to include this fourth suggestion since it is hard for political realists to imagine that it would be adopted. But consider how appropriate it would be. President-elect Trump--whose rise in politics was based in some measure upon his birtherism denial of Obama's legitimacy--could atone for that by asking the Senate to treat Obama's nomination of Judge Garland as the act of a legitimate president. The vacancy arose with nearly a year left in President Obama's term. In a step unprecedented in all of American history, the Senate majority refuses even to provide a hearing. On Sunday, the president-elect's adviser Kellyanne Conway said, ""It's time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters, 'This man is our president.' "" How deep is the irony in those words? The man who is our president is Barack Obama. How can those on the losing side take seriously calls to avoid obstructing the next president while the president we have now is still actively being obstructed? I'm not sanguine about the chances that these proposals will come to pass. But they would be taken serious by anyone who wanted to make a credible argument that we should put the election behind us and support the legitimacy of an elected president."	A Few Things Trump Could Do to Unite Us (if He Really Wanted To)
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/the_democrats_are_already_screwing_up_the_trump_resistance.html	"Democrats are still managing their response to the next four years of a President Donald Trump. Will they work with his administration? On that score, two of the most prominent Democrats in the country, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have an answer. ""There are millions of people who did not vote for Donald Trump because of the bigotry and hate that fueled his campaign rallies. They voted for him despite hate,"" Warren said in a speech after the election. ""They voted for him out of frustration and anger--and also out of hope that he would bring change."" Writing in the New York Times, Sanders had a similar take. ""Millions of Americans registered a protest vote on Tuesday, expressing their fierce opposition to an economic and political system that puts wealthy and corporate interests over their own,"" he wrote. ""Donald J. Trump won the White House because his campaign rhetoric successfully tapped into a very real and justified anger, an anger that many traditional Democrats feel."" Both Warren and Sanders emphasize that bigotry was part of Trump's message. But they want to separate the ""deplorables"" from the larger group of more ordinary Americans who just wanted a change of pace. And to that end, they both promise to work with Trump provided he chooses a populist agenda. Said Sanders: ""If the president-elect is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families, I'm going to present some very real opportunities for him to earn my support."" Said Warren: ""When President-elect Trump wants to take on these issues, when his goal is to increase the economic security of the middle-class families, then count me in."" If Trump embraces the bigotry and hatred of his campaign, however, both Sanders and Warren promise to fight him without compromise. ""We will not give an inch on this,"" said Warren. At first glance, this seems well and good: a firm commitment to winning victories where they are available, tied to an absolute line against policies targeting immigrants, Muslims, or any other group. But there's a problem here, and it's found in the cast given to Trump's campaign and Trump's voters. Both Warren and Sanders describe Trump's effort as a populist campaign with an almost incidental use of racial prejudice. In this version, most Trump voters simply wanted a stronger, fairer economy. The attacks on immigrants, Muslims, and black Americans were regrettable, but not a part of the appeal. Warren and Sanders are wrong, and in a way that signals a significant misreading of the landscape on the part of the most influential Democrats. The simple truth is that Trump's use of explicit racism--his deliberate attempt to incite Americans against different groups of nonwhites--was integral to his campaign. It was part and parcel of his ""populism"" and told a larger story: that either at home or abroad, foreigners and their ""globalist"" allies were cheating the American worker, defined as a white working-class man with a factory job. To claw back the dominion he once enjoyed--to ""make America great again""--Trump promised protectionism and ""law and order."" He promised to deport immigrants, register Muslims, and build new infrastructure. This wasn't ""populism""; it was white populism. Writes historian Nell Irvin Painter for the New York Times: ""This time the white men in charge will not simply happen to be white; they will be governing as white, as taking America back, back to before multiculturalism."" It seems reasonable for Warren and Sanders to make a distinction between Trump as blue-collar populist and Trump as racist demagogue. But that distinction doesn't exist. Supporting a Trump-branded infrastructure initiative as a discrete piece of policy where two sides can find common ground only bolsters a white-nationalist politics, even if you oppose the rest of Trump's agenda. It legitimizes and gives fuel to white tribalism as a political strategy. It shows that there are tangible gains for embracing Trump-style demagoguery. Likewise, it seems reasonable to want to recast support for Trump as an expression of populism. But Trump's is a racial populism--backed almost entirely by white Americans, across class lines--that revolves around demands to reinforce existing racial and status hierarchies. That's what it means to ""make America great again."" It has nothing to offer to working-class blacks who need safety from unfair police violence just as much as they need higher wages, or working-class Latinos who need to protect their families from draconian immigration laws as much as they need a chance to unionize. To gesture at individual voters and say they aren't racists--the usual rejoinder to this argument--is to miss the point. White voters backed Trump as a bloc. They ignored his bigotry and elevated his call for a new nationalism, centered on white Americans. Whatever their actual intentions--whether they were partisan Republicans, hardcore Trumpists, or simply disgusted with Hillary Clinton--they voted for white nationalism, full stop. The more Democrats obscure that, the more they run the real risk of being co-opted, of bolstering the political prospects of ethno-nationalism in the name of a broad ""populism"" that isn't actually at play. An infrastructure bill doesn't outweigh the impact of Trump's attacks on communities of color, even if it's influenced by the left. Communities of color need physical and economic security. Strong wages and freedom from discrimination. Without the latter, a rising tide will not lift all boats. There is an alternative to the rhetoric of Warren and Sanders that gets you to the same place without the same pitfalls. Following Trump's election, outgoing Nevada Sen. Harry Reid issued this statement."	Led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Democrats Are Screwing Up the Resistance to Donald Trump
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/welcome_to_the_paul_ryan_presidency.html	"What a peach that Paul Ryan is. Never underestimate his aggressive modesty. Right now, he's even letting Donald Trump think that he runs the country. Every member of the House Republican conference found a traditional red ""Make America Great Again"" hat waiting on their seats Tuesday morning before a Capitol Hill meeting. ""Welcome to the dawn of a new unified Republican government,"" Ryan announced at a news conference. ""This will be a government focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people."" I like both of those sentences. The first, because he sounds like he's moments from giving the order to destroy a planet with the Death Star. And the second is a nifty parse. He pays proper deference to ""President-elect Trump's victory,"" but not to Trump's vision. He situates Trump's victory as the last puzzle piece Republicans needed to achieve what Ryan would categorize as ""real progress for the American people."" He speaks of what the new ""government"" will do as though we're in a parliamentary system. That would make Donald Trump the figurehead monarch, and Paul Ryan the prime minister. Let Trump be head of state, if that flatters him. Ryan will gladly assume head of government. The head of government has done his homework and knows what he wants to achieve, while the head of state is still in the period of processing that he's the head of state. Ryan has the legislative strategy, the legislative numbers, and the legislation itself ready to go. Sure, there may be a few procedural hiccups along the way--nothing his procedural fixer Mitch McConnell can't take care of in the Senate, either through reconciliation or merely by eliminating the filibuster--and he'll have his agenda ready for President-elect Trump's signature by spring break or thereabouts. Ryan won't need Democratic help. ""The conservative policy agenda is designed to not require any Democratic votes,"" as the Roosevelt Institute's Mike Konczal writes. ""It's been engineered to pass through reconciliation on a party line vote. All those times liberals made fun of Republicans for passing party-line bills that would get vetoed Republicans were simply doing test runs for what they would do with unified government, testing the boundaries of their members and the institutions themselves."" The test runs were productive. Now it's time to blow up some goddamn planets. The contrast in preparedness with Trump's team is striking. First: What is Trump's team right now, beyond the few communications and strategy folks he'll carry over from the campaign? Even the team that's supposed to pick the team, as of Tuesday morning, was in chaos. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had for months led the presidential transition effort, has been booted. (All of the appointee vetting Christie's team had done went out the window when Trump decided to use the appointments process as a punishment-and-reward process.) Former Rep. Mike Rogers, one of the supposed adults in the room who had been handling the national security transition, resigned Tuesday morning. No one from the transition team appears to have gotten in touch with a minor bureau called the ""Department of Defense"" yet. The Trump team does not know what it's doing. The head of state is not familiar with the demands of the job, and so the demands of the job will flow elsewhere. Vice President-elect Mike Pence and incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus are set to take over all of these things--the daily management of the presidency, that is--if they ever get their paperwork submitted. And Priebus and Pence are each allies of Paul Ryan, who knows what he's doing. Trump did sign off on much of this arrangement early in the process. As the New York Times Magazine reported in October, Trump delegated the better part of his would-be power to Ryan in a May 12 meeting, shortly after Trump had become the presumptive nominee. Ryan briefed Trump on ""federal budgetary issues,"" sharing ""a sheaf of charts relating to unfunded liabilities, the long-term debt problem and the growing share of mandatory spending in federal outlays."" Trump got bored very quickly and ""said that Ryan obviously knew what he was talking about and would therefore be in charge of managing 'this stuff' in a Trump administration."" ""This stuff"" is the steering wheel of the country, and our president-elect wants to sleep in the passenger seat while someone else drives. He just needs to be assured that monies for his high-ticket rhetorical priorities, like the wall, are appropriated, and then he'll sign by the X when he's awoken. The only hope for anyone not smitten with the Ryan agenda is that Trump's penchant for retribution--his most animating force--prompts him to veto several of Ryan's bills solely to hurt Ryan's feelings. We can probably expect one of these big troll vetoes just to settle the score, like a pitcher beaning a hitter. And then the game will go on. Our national obsession with the presidency blinds our ability to track power. Much of the discussion about how Ryan had wounded himself by taking the speakership last year focused on the gig as a poor launch pad for the presidency. What would he need the presidency for, though? He already runs the country."	Welcome to the Paul Ryan Presidency
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/screw_your_feelings_trump_voters.html	"A great self-comforting fallacy is often deployed in discussing American racism: One has to intend racism to be a real racist, which is to say that without intention, there is no racism. This belief in the legitimacy of intention is directly related to the sacrosanct status of feeling in America, to the notion that feeling is more authentic and true than fact or thought. (This is hardly news. The idea is spread wide and thick all across this good land: In today's America if people felt that gravity didn't apply, they'd feel free to fly.)  If feelings are sovereign and unassailable, so are the intentions that come out of them--one's agency is rooted in feelings, realized in intentions. Thus, for instance, the ethical legitimacy of voting for a Donald Trump who intends to forestall the nonexistent rise in crime would be unquestionable because it's rooted in feelings. (Newt Gingrich unabashedly expressed the idea here.) The ethics of feeling align with the belief, deeply embedded in a population far exceeding the number of Republican voters, that the good intentions of America are forever inscribed in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and thus congenitally imbue all those who feel American. Never mind slavery, systemic racism and exploitation, disenfranchisement of women, frequent wars of aggression. The Founding Intentions are good and there for all to see, and the acts don't matter; American history is rife with crimes dismissed as honest mistakes. Most recently, the lies of the Bushist regime, which created systems of torture and surveillance, came out of the feeling that the country was endangered after 9/11--who could deny the truth and legitimacy of that? The self-congratulating American ethos allowed for an immoral and criminal enterprise to avoid prosecution. One of the benefits of that immunity was that Americans could continue to feel as decent people, despite all the contrary evidence. The election of Barack Obama confirmed the feeling, while he, in return, graciously eschewed addressing in any substantial way the ethical (and financial) bankruptcy of the Bushist America.* American culture went fully along with it, because, no matter what we've done, we're a great people (We elected a black man!), all of us born and bred as citizens within the exceptionalist ethics. Even now, after Trump passed a national job interview while his psychopathic tendencies were manifest, the Democrats, beginning with President Obama, cannot accept that the idea of American decency is no longer viable. So here comes Donald Trump. He, as they say, tells it like it is, which is true only if what is is determined by feeling. He is but a Viagratic bundle of incoherent aggression clustered around a single bullshit intention: to make America great again. Once his supporters' feelings empowered the intention, no fact or thought could ever matter. Trump's election confirmed the ethos, and neither the Trumpist voters' hurt feelings nor their decent intentions could after that be diagnosed as racist. Who in their right mind would argue that they intended to endorse the discourse of white nationalism, or to reconfigure American democracy as an autocracy? The insurmountable advantage of the intentionalist ethos is that one can assign the moral value to one's act by way of negotiating one's intentions. Presently, among the white citizens of this country, a vast reassessment of what constitutes a ""real"" racist is taking place. The Trumpist white voters counter the claim that Trump intends to discriminate against nonwhites by invoking his good intention to make America great. In the same turn, they reject being called racist, as might their white Clintonite friends and family, because, you know, they can't be ""real"" racists. The convoluted interpretations of the electoral outcome centered around the foggy feeling of economic anxiety serve the same purpose. Many a Thanksgiving dinner will be spent conducting such ethical negotiations, all the negotiators stuffed with the same turkey. The common outcome, other than indigestion, will be the normalization of racism: We agree to disagree, fuck the darkies and their friends the Jews. The grand negotiation amounts to a whitewash operation. The majority of white Trump voters (as distinct from those who like to light up crosses and have no problem with racism) are presently invested in conceptualizing ethical positions in which they can feel not racist while fully and willingly enjoying all the benefits of an openly racist system wherein whiteness has an immense value. This is not new either. Indeed, this is how white America has operated for a long while. What is relatively new is the blatant aggression of Trumpian racism and, with it, a new value of whiteness, all of which requires some crafty renegotiation. Trumpist voters (and their Thanksgiving guests) would like themselves to feel that they're unintentionally white within an intentionally white-nationalist political operation, soon to take over the American state apparatus. But the only ethics that matter are act-based ethics--it's what you do that matters, not what you feel. After all, the legal system in this country, as yet based in reason and belief in the rationality of law, is contingent upon the ethical value of the act. And an act is a fact--what you do is what is. The Trump voters committed an act of voting for an unabashed racist, whose hate speech is an act and a fact in public space. There is, of course, more than a distinct possibility that white Trump voters knew exactly what they were voting for and they wished for it. After all, Trump kept promising it, over and over again, and it's already here. But even if they didn't intend their racism, those who voted for Trump must reconcile with his acts. These might include deporting millions of people, which is not possible without violence, or legally discriminating against Muslim American citizens. If such acts come to pass, those who have already committed the initial act of voting for Trump, whatever their intentions may have been, will have undeniably given him a mandate for radical racism. A citizen's basic responsibility is to be aware of the consequences of his or her acts. The feelings that led tens of millions to vote for Trump have been rendered morally irrelevant by their vote. Perhaps those feelings and intentions might be interesting to psychiatrists and historians, but an immigrant family or a woman in a hijab being chased down might care less. The racist act of voting instantly converted Trump supporters into racists, and now they're as real as can be. They might or might not want to deal with that fact, but what's left of the decent America must. *Correction, Nov. 15, 2016: This post originally misspelled Barack Obama's first name. (Return.)

On Sunday, he announced his chief of staff: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who stood his ground as one of Trump's most vocal defenders. Like House Speaker Paul Ryan, another Wisconsin Republican, Priebus never wavered or bowed to pressure to abandon the GOP nominee. Throughout the Sturm und Drang of the campaign, Priebus has been there as adviser and advocate. Chief of staff is his reward, even as he enters the position with little experience in the business of government. But that's not the major decision. The banner news here is that Trump's other adviser, campaign strategist Stephen Bannon, will be installed in the White House as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president. According to the campaign press release, Bannon and Priebus will work ""as equal partners to transform the federal government."" This means that Trump is serious about the racist and white nationalist rhetoric he deployed in his bid for the Oval Office. Where the RNC chairman is vocal and visible, Bannon is the opposite. He prefers the shadows, where he has been a vital and influential force on Trump and his campaign. Relative to other members of Trump's inner circle, Bannon is almost anonymous. But his place at the president's side is significant. Before joining the Trump campaign in August, Bannon was executive chairman of Breitbart News LLC, the parent company that owns the eponymous website. Named after Andrew Breitbart--a famed right-wing provocateur who died in 2012--Breitbart is a far-right news site that traffics in racism, anti-Semitism, and anti-immigrant hysteria. Typical Breitbart headlines are inflammatory, feeding fears of black criminals and Muslim refugees. ""Europe's Rape Epidemic: Western Women Will Be Sacrificed at the Altar of Mass Migration,"" reads one Breitbart story, tweeted by Donald Trump Jr. in September. But Breitbart is more than a clearinghouse for racist propaganda. It's also a forum and community space for neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and anti-Semites, all under the sanitized banner of the ""alt-right."" As the Southern Poverty Law Center notes, Breitbart under Bannon has ""been openly promoting the core issues of the Alt-Right, introducing these racist ideas to its readership--much to the delight of many in the white nationalist world who could never dream of reaching such a vast number of people."" Breitbart's most prominent columnist, Milo Yiannopoulos, is an ambassador of sorts for the movement, traveling to college campuses with a message that blends virulent, old-fashioned racism with a flamboyant persona and a nominal commitment to ""free speech."" Breitbart has a simple message: that Muslims and Hispanics are infiltrating America and robbing it of its cultural heritage; that blacks are responsible for most crime and disorder; that feminists have established a near-matriarchy that has disadvantaged men; that ""globalists""--embodied by George Soros--are erasing national borders and sapping prosperity from the United States (a classic anti-Semitic smear that eventually surfaced in Trump's rhetoric). There's evidence Bannon shares these views. In a 2007 court document, Bannon's ex-wife Mary Louise Piccard accused him of anti-Semitism, saying he didn't want their daughters attending the elite Archer School for Girls in Los Angeles because of its high Jewish enrollment. ""The biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend,"" Piccard said in a statement signed June 27, 2007, where she also alleged domestic violence from Bannon. According to conservative writer Ben Shapiro, who worked as ""editor-at-large"" of Breitbart for four years before his anti-Trump views brought waves of anti-Semitic harassment, Bannon ""openly embraced the white supremacist alt-right,"" strategically pushing ""white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness."" If Shapiro's allegation is true--if Breitbart's content reflects the character of its leadership--then Stephen Bannon is substantively indistinguishable from David Duke and other white supremacists. For all practical purposes, he is one of them. Trump allies like Newt Gingrich have protested the comparison. ""You get this all these smears of Steve Bannon,"" said Gingrich during a CBS interview with Face the Nation host John Dickerson. ""Steve Bannon was a naval officer. He was a managing partner of Goldman Sachs. He was a Hollywood movie producer. The idea that somehow he represents--I had never heard of the alt-right until the nut cakes started writing about it."" Those ""nut cakes"" it seems, include Bannon, who has bragged that his website was ""the platform for the alt-right."" We still don't know what Trump's administration will look like. We do not know his full priorities, and we do not know what he will pursue upon inauguration in January. But putting Bannon in the White House gives us a clue. The same white nationalist thinking that drove the Trump campaign will soon have a prominent place in the West Wing, working--in Team Trump's words--to ""transform the federal government.""

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/the_people_who_look_at_trump_and_don_t_see_a_racist.html	"""It's time for reporters and journalists to be honest with the American people,"" warned Harry Reid on the floor of the Senate six weeks ago. ""They owe America the truth. Through his words and deeds, Donald Trump is a racist."" For months, Donald Trump's racism and sexism have served as Exhibit A in the case against his fitness for the presidency. In spite of Reid's remark, the press has made Trump's bigotry very clear, publishing countless articles, explanatory timelines, and listicles on the topic. And yet, on Tuesday, the American people went to the polls and made racist Donald Trump their president-elect. How could this happen? People like me--members of a desperate and discombobulated coastal elite--have floated a number of different explanations for this outcome. Maybe Americans don't mind that Trump is racist because we're racist, too. We live in a racist, sexist country, and Trump has given the racists and the sexists the chance to vote their true beliefs. But what about all the counties and states that went for Trump after having voted Barack Obama into office? Maybe Americans are more sexist than they are racist, in the end, and their votes for Trump were really votes against Hillary Clinton. A third explanation blames white women for the outcome, given that a majority of them voted for Trump in spite of his misogyny. Or perhaps it's the case that millions of people--including, for example, the third of Latino voters who lined up for Trump--are living in a world built from outright lies and fake news reports from Macedonia. Perhaps these people didn't know, or would not believe, the truth of what Trump has said and done. They failed to understand that he's a racist pig, and so they elected him. Here's my theory: Tuesday's surprise had less to do with dueling facts than rival definitions. I suspect that many Americans--an electoral college victory's worth, at least--would agree that we shouldn't elect a racist to the presidency. By that logic, Trump should have been defeated easily; he failed a basic moral test. But if racist is to be a decisive and disqualifying label then we need to have consensus on its meaning--my understanding of what it is to be a racist must be the same as everybody else's. What happened Tuesday tells me that it's not. You could see the disagreements over racism--when and how the term should be applied--throughout the course of the campaign. Trump's abhorrent message was clear from the outset. ""They're bringing drugs,"" he said of Mexican immigrants on the day that he announced his candidacy. ""They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Before that, of course, he'd spent years proudly championing the racist birther movement. Yet for many months to follow, the question of Trump's status as a racist--whether he had officially earned the label--remained a topic for discussion. He's just ""careless and undisciplined,"" his defenders said. ""Donald Trump seems racist,"" Andy Samberg said at the Emmys in September 2015. In a televised debate in March, Hillary Clinton dodged the question of whether Trump deserved the scarlet R: ""I was the first one to call him out"" for his ""deeply offensive rhetoric,"" she said, adding that ""trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system."" But is he, in fact, an actual racist? ""People can draw their own conclusions,"" she said. That waffling ended for many in June, when Trump announced he'd been victimized by Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University--because ""he's a Mexican."" (Judge Curiel was born in Indiana.) For those with Hillary, this moment was decisive. ""Donald Trump Finally Admits His Campaign Is Racist,"" declared the Huffington Post. ""Trump's Attack on a Federal Judge Is an Open Appeal to Racism,"" said Slate. ""Trump's Attack on Judge Curiel Is Clearly Racist,"" wrote Newsweek. In an interview the following week, CNN's Jake Tapper gave cathartic voice to this idea: ""If you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?"" he asked Trump, in what would come to be seen as a kind of Welch-McCarthy moment for the Never Trump movement. But as Tapper said, it came down to definitions. ""No, I don't think so at all,"" Trump said in answer to Tapper's charge. ""He's proud of his heritage. I respect him for that."" Some commentators agreed: He wasn't calling Judge Curiel inferior, only saying that he might be biased on account of his ethnicity. Brown University economist Glenn Loury pointed out that in other contexts, we're happy to acknowledge that a person's background can inform her judgment and perspective. Still, a consensus was emerging, at least among elites, that Trump had indeed crossed the racist line. Even Paul Ryan, now the president-elect's toadie on the Hill, went after Trump in June, calling the attack on Curiel the ""textbook definition of a racist comment."" Ryan's choice of phrase was revealing. In defining racism, he did not cite the dictionary. That's where one would expect to find the most common understanding of the word. But Trump's attack on Curiel does not fit so neatly into, say, the first definition that you'd find on Dictionary.com: ""the doctrine that one's own racial group is superior or that a particular racial group is inferior to the others."" Instead, Ryan appealed to the textbook meaning of racism, which is to say, the one that derives from academic expertise. When racism first came to be examined as a social problem, starting in the 1920s, the term referred to something plain to see: an explicit ideology of domination, as expressed by individuals. By the 1960s, though, this old-school, overt racism seemed in decline and the term was broadened to include more subtle agents of discrimination, exploitation, and inequality. Entire institutions could be racist, and systems could be racist, separate from the people who composed them. In the past few decades, scholars have stretched the boundaries of the term even further. Now we understand that people, too, can be racist in subtle, systematic ways. Even if you disavow white supremacy, you might still be subject to its influence, as well as the unintentional form of racial prejudice that social scientists call ""implicit bias."" You and I are racist, essentially, in ways we're not consciously aware of. The broader definition of racism as something systemic or implicit has flourished on the left and in academia. That's for good reason: It allows us to talk about the nation's most important social problems--police shootings, for example--in the most impassioned moral terms without labeling specific people as evil or malicious. (Maybe cops mean well, as a rule, but like the rest of us they suffer from implicit bias.) This more nuanced understanding of racism calls attention to persistent racial injustice while at the same time framing it in broader, more communal terms. It calls out the problem and invites solutions. But textbook racism, however useful it might be as rhetoric, comes into conflict with the more old-fashioned dictionary definition of the word. Last year, social scientist Patrick Forscher reviewed the most-cited studies on prejudice from the past quarter-century and found that almost every single one of them treats bias as something implicit and unconscious rather than malicious and intentional. This puts the literature at odds with a public understanding of prejudice as the product of malicious feelings, the source of hate crimes, and an ingredient of classic racist ideology. ""The gap between common and researcher understandings of 'prejudice,' "" Forscher wrote, ""can create problems when researchers attempt to communicate their findings to the public."" That's exactly what happened in the 2016 election. Journalists and even politicians like Paul Ryan examined Donald Trump and announced he was a racist. But millions of Americans looked at the same facts and came to a different conclusion. He was not a racist, at least as they understood the term. The breakdown of communication was never more apparent than during the first debate, when Lester Holt asked the candidates how they might improve race relations. Trump gave his standard, crude response, proposing greater use of stop-and-frisk policing and more policing overall. ""We have to protect our inner cities,"" he said. Then Clinton went to her textbook definition: ""We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system,"" she said. ""I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police."" Systemic racism and implicit bias: On Twitter, racial justice activists rejoiced. Finally, she said the words out loud! But how many people truly understood what she was saying? A few weeks later, the Washington Post published a video in which Trump confessed to habitual sexual assault, boasting to Access Hollywood's Billy Bush that he routinely grabs and kisses women against their will. Soon, numerous women had accused him of engaging in exactly this behavior. This, again, was deemed an automatic disqualification: Trump had shown himself to be a misogynist--a sexual predator, even. Surely he was finished. How could any woman vote for him? But polling soon revealed that lots of women were unmoved by these revelations. More than half of non-college-educated white women agreed that ""grab them by the pussy"" should be understood as harmless ""locker room talk"" rather than threatening hate speech. How could that be possible? Back in 2009, Yale University's Dan Kahan ran a study of a notable date-rape case from 1988, in which the woman--a college sophomore--had repeatedly said ""no"" during a sexual encounter. For his experiment, he gave the facts of the case to 1,500 people along with one of five different legal definitions of sexual assault (including a ""no means no"" condition), and then asked them whether they believed the defendant should have been convicted of a crime. In the end, he found the legal definitions made less of a difference to the subjects than their cultural backgrounds. Women, in particular, were the most sharply divided in their understanding of the case, according to their identities as either egalitarian (more likely to be liberal) or hierarchical (more likely to be conservative). Whatever the explanation for this result--Kahan's is rather subtle--it shows that fundamental disagreements over the meaning of rape can persist even in the face of explicit legal standards, and especially among the class of people who are most directly affected by the crime. It follows, then, that women would not respond to the Access Hollywood revelations in unison, as a clear example of a candidate who crossed a line. Rather, voters would draw on different definitions of misogyny so they could make different judgments of the facts. This is the lesson of the racist, misogynist candidacy of Donald Trump. We thought these labels, once applied, would stop him in his tracks--that if we could only ""prove"" that Trump was racist and sexist, we'd reach some common ground of moral decency, and all but the most extreme Trump supporters would have to back away from him. In the end, though, we misunderstood the vagueness of those terms. Labeling Trump didn't work, because there is no common ground in America when it comes to what those labels mean. No matter what Trump said about women or Muslims or black people, millions of Americans will never see him as a racist and misogynist. That's not about to change."	Donald Trump Is a Racist. Here's Why Many Americans Don't See Him That Way.

As a country, we have no template for responding to this. The temptation among mainstream journalists and politicians is to treat Donald Trump as a normal Republican. Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to strike a note of defiance in their postelection speeches. People magazine, whose own reporter was assaulted by Trump, has a gauzy cover story on ""President Trump."" Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren issued a sort-of olive branch, saying in a statement to the Boston Globe, ""President-elect Trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people, and I offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task."" It is true that, to preserve America's tradition of peacefully transferring power, we have to acknowledge that Trump will be president. But to preserve our morality and our sense of reality, we also have to acknowledge the incredible danger we are now in, and the terror many of our people are feeling. Retiring Sen. Harry Reid did that in his perfect statement on Friday. ""We as a nation must find a way to move forward without consigning those who Trump has threatened to the shadows,"" he wrote. ""Their fear is entirely rational, because Donald Trump has talked openly about doing terrible things to them. Every news piece that breathlessly obsesses over inauguration preparations compounds their fear by normalizing a man who has threatened to tear families apart, who has bragged about sexually assaulting women and who has directed crowds of thousands to intimidate reporters and assault African Americans. Their fear is legitimate and we must refuse to let it fall through the cracks between the fluff pieces."" All over this country, the deplorables are wilding. ""US Hate Crimes Spark Anxiety in the Wake of Trump Win,"" says a Financial Times headline. Reports CNN, ""Fears of heightened bigotry and hate crimes have turned into reality for some Americans after Donald Trump's presidential win."" Fliers at Texas State University said that in the wake of Trump's victory, it's time ""to organize tar and feather vigilante squads and go arrest and torture those deviant university leaders spouting off all this diversity garbage."" Social media is full of people describing Trump-inspired threats and attacks. Trump has taken time to denounce the protesters filling city streets to express their horror at his election but not the people committing violence in his name. He has not, for example, said a word about the Trump victory parade that the Ku Klux Klan is holding in North Carolina. In this climate, Democrats need to lead the resistance. This is true for strategic as well as ethical reasons; consider how much power Republicans amassed by resisting everything Obama tried to do and channeling the rage and terror of those who abhorred him. Going forward, the only criteria for judging Democrats will be what they do to protect those in Trump's crosshairs. Reid's statement should be a model for them all.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/trump_s_win_is_nothing_like_what_s_happened_in_the_middle_east.html	"Like millions of other Americans, I watched Tuesday night's election results first with cautious optimism, then creeping foreboding, followed by mounting alarm giving way, ultimately, to utter horror. A uniquely unqualified, unfit, and potentially dangerous man has been swept to power by outraged rural and exurban voters drawn to his populist demagoguery. The disdain with which virtually the entire urban and educated population, left and right, view Donald Trump is evident from the fact that hardly any newspapers, not even the most committed and doctrinaire Republican ones, around the country endorsed him. So the sense of dismay and profound concern ran deep throughout American society that night. Unlike most other Americans, however, I drew on a set of personal and social experiences that contextualized it all very differently. Half of my family is deeply rooted American, drawn from some of the founders of Brooklyn. Indeed, the 17th-century house of my direct ancestor, Jan Martense Schenck, is a permanent installation in the Brooklyn Museum. The other side of my family is Middle Eastern. Though born in Beirut, Lebanon, I'm not an immigrant. I have a State Department birth certificate for an American citizen born overseas. But I acquired Lebanese and Syrian citizenship at birth as well. This Levantine heritage and the personal and collective experiences it represents have given me a different perspective on this truly regrettable election outcome. Tuesday may have felt like a disaster to many Americans, and in some senses, no doubt it was. But when I was 12, in 1975, my hometown of Beirut erupted in the brutal violence of a civil war that dragged on until 1990. Many of the places and people I knew were destroyed, and I had personal brushes with danger and destruction. The apartment building in which I grew up no longer exists, and I retain virtually no artifacts from my life before adulthood. Since the early 1980s, I have lived in the United States. But without the war, it's extremely unlikely that I would be here today. I was very attached to the society and the city in which I was raised, left it reluctantly, and abandoned dreams of returning only after many years. But the fact is that we Lebanese--with the generous help of our neighbors to the north and south, and other regional and international malefactors--blew up our own society and burned our city down. A simulacrum of Beirut still exists in the same place, but it's not what it once was. Many people worry about the coarsening effect of the recent campaign and the impact of a Trump administration on American culture, and with good reason. However, the culture in which I was raised--an Arab and Muslim-majority one that was open, generous, cosmopolitan, and fundamentally progressive--is also long gone. A series of calamitous events in 1979, including the Iranian revolution, the war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, the takeover of the grand Mosque in Mecca, and a number of other developments, unleashed a wave of politicized religiosity and sectarian intolerance that have completely transformed the culture of the Arab world. There is, of course, a disturbing extremism in parts of the Trump ""movement,"" particularly the so-called alt-right, with its resurrection and repackaging of white supremacy, ethnic nationalism, racism, and anti-Semitism. It is indeed disturbing, but it still largely restricted to Pepe the Frog memes and similar hate speech on social media and beyond. The wave of extremism in the contemporary Middle East, though, has involved torrents of unthinkable violence, usually in the name of religion. Beginning with Hezbollah in Lebanon, continuing to al-Qaida, and most recently Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, sectarian terrorist groups have unleashed a tidal wave of mayhem and killing. The contents of Breitbart and 4chan are indeed repulsive, particularly when they are associated with a president-elect. But it's really child's play compared with contemporary Middle Eastern extremism. The Trump election is truly regrettable and could have some very negative consequences, possibly fairly quickly. But it could also be just a moment of collective weirdness on the part of many Americans that doesn't actually end up changing that much about life in this country for most people. The Middle East has seen a collective auto-da-fe, the self-immolation of society after society, with no end in sight. Even though the Lebanese civil war played itself out in 1990, the region only intensified its freefall into mayhem. Lebanon was the canary in the coal mine, with larger and more influential Arab states falling victim to the virus of disintegration and national cataclysm. Following the 2003 American invasion, Iraq fragmented into several pieces and is mired in endless internal conflicts. Syria has caught fire and shattered, creating one of the worst refugee and humanitarian crises since World War II. Libya is burning. Egypt has turned inward in a paroxysm of paranoia and chauvinism. Even the Palestinian cause is now relegated to an afterthought, with its leadership characterized by world-class incompetence and corruption. So, on election night, the American in me, like so many of my compatriots, wanted to curl into a fetal position and moan. But the Middle Easterner in me shrugged and said, ""Meh, I've seen worse. Much, much, much worse."" Yes, Americans elected a ridiculous person with dangerous authoritarian tendencies and the attention span of a scallop. But they did it in an orderly, free and fair, and democratic manner, without violence or intimidation, cheating or fraud, or any other distortions. We made our mistake openly and honestly, and in the best democratic traditions. And now the transition of power to this ridiculous person is proceeding with propriety, dignity, and as much graciousness as all the reasonable Americans can manage in the face of such a preposterous election result. In the greater scheme of things, it's actually something to be proud of. And from a Middle Eastern perspective, at least an honest one, American politics and culture--yes, even in the era of President-elect Trump--still looks really great."	What Trump's Win Looks Like to Someone Born in the Middle East
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/the_democrats_are_leaderless.html	"The Democratic Party was decapitated Tuesday night and is now leaderless. The plan for President Obama to serve eight years and then for Hillary Clinton to serve the subsequent eight ran into some trouble at halftime. Losing the presidency to Donald Trump is a disaster. But being leaderless has its benefits. It clears the stage for all the arguments Democrats, as a party, never got around to resolving after the financial crisis--the conversations about what they wanted the party to be and to stand for. Don't rush to find a new leader. Argue, and let the leader emerge out of that argument. Chances are, if the process is healthy, that the next leader will be someone no one expected. The connotation of leaderless party is entirely negative when it's applied in media or political operative circles. To be ""leaderless"" in Washington is to be humiliatingly incapable of keeping your unruly masses in line. It symbolizes coalitional chaos, chaos being another word that's even more overtly assumed negative. Chaos is what's led the Republican Party in recent years, and all of this was assumed to be a crushing negative for the party's future. Now we're looking at a party that will control the vast majority of state legislatures and governors' mansions along with the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the presidency. It is a complete reversal of where the party stood eight years ago, when it too was decapitated. Barack Obama took the presidency under circumstances he didn't envision when he started running in 2007. A month-and-a-half before he was elected president, the global economy collapsed. It was so much more than the global economy that collapsed, though. Faith in the political establishment went with it. Democrats, just about to take the presidency, had little time to properly reckon with this. They had to clean up the mess. Republicans, those lucky duckies, had time to process the shock and digest it. They had the time to destroy their party establishment and build something new. The story of Tuesday was expected to be that the Republicans' destruction of their own establishment was an ongoing, unresolved process with savage electoral consequences: that they would lose a presidential election they should've won. When all the numbers were counted, though, we learned a different and extraordinarily consequential story: The Republican rebuilding was complete. It's a crap situation for Democrats now, and there's no way to make it feel better. Take no solace in the popular vote win. It doesn't matter, except as a metric for how geographically screwed Democrats are, and there is a zero percent chance that the Electoral College will be eliminated. The new Republican electorate, even when led by a candidate as flawed as Donald Trump, has proven itself the stronger coalition to win on the state and federal levels. (Are we still thinking he was a flawed candidate, by the way? There's another assumption we'll have to toss on the long list of Things to Revise.) The silver lining of this Democratic crap-storm isn't that Clinton racked up a really big margin in California to put her over the top in a meaningless metric. The silver lining is that, as a leaderless party, it's free now to debate what it wants to be in the post-financial crisis era just as Republicans did after 2008. This release of suppressed emotions began during the primary between Sanders and Clinton, but the post-primary need to stop Donald Trump bottled them up again, and the fight was never resolved. Should the Democratic Party seek to be the ""sane"" party that offers modifications to liberal capitalism, or should there be--say--a ""political revolution""? Should Democrats try to inch the ball forward on policy goals in the existing paradigm or eschew immediate gains to blow up that paradigm altogether? The fight is going to resume now, and how. The arguments of the primary are going to look like an Up With People halftime show compared with what's about to go down. It's going to be messy. People are going to get so pissed. It's going to be embarrassing. It's going to be great. We're not a parliamentary system in which a party always has a leader, and so there's no need for Democrats to rush to find one. It's not Elizabeth Warren's party or Bernie Sanders' party or Nancy Pelosi's party or Chuck Schumer's party. No single figure has a lock on the Democratic Party right now. No one person meaningfully synthesizes its competing components or has properly negotiated the coalition that can win up and down the ballot across the country. It's a jump ball.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/how_journalists_failed_in_2016_and_what_we_must_do_to_cover_president_trump.html	"Donald Trump's catastrophic victory on Tuesday night poses the single greatest threat in generations to what we Americans quaintly call our way of life. Trump's maniacal self-centeredness, his attraction to authoritarianism, and his blatant contempt for the truth combine to form a standing reproach to everything decent about American politics and culture. The more liberal version of American exceptionalism has always rested on the belief that although the United States may not protect its most vulnerable citizens the way that many European countries do, it is at least insulated from the type of xenophobic populism which has plagued--and plagues--that continent. But those of us who assumed, before the presidential primaries, that our institutions would surely spare us from frothing rage and bigotry were proven to be dangerously naive. We have now lived through the rise and victory of Trumpism; it can happen here, and it has. This isn't just my opinion; it's also the opinion of many of my colleagues at Slate and of journalists I know at other publications. For op-ed columnists and ideologically disinclined news reporters alike, Trump elicits a palpable disgust and a heretofore unknown variety of fear. This wasn't initially obvious in the media's coverage of Trump, however. Though many journalists recoiled from Trump, as an institution journalism failed to treat his rise with the seriousness it deserved. This is no longer an option. There was, however, a brief moment when something undeniably changed. The revulsion many of us felt privately began to be reflected in the coverage of the man and his campaign. As Margaret Sullivan, the Washington Post's media columnist, told me, by the late summer ""the mainstream media was more willing to say what everyone in newsrooms was saying, instead of being so careful and so cagy and speaking in journalese."" The television networks, belatedly, began to treat Trump less as a joke and ratings magnet and more as a threat to American norms and institutions (and a ratings magnet). Newspapers like the New York Times and the Washington Post used their news pages to expose his frightening behavior and beliefs, from his shady ""charitable"" endeavors to his authoritarian tendencies. On social media, journalists displayed a contempt for Trump that would have been unimaginable to someone following politics before 2016. ""I do think we saw a norm change in the mainstream print press in which they really got away from the old false equivalence idea and would say, 'Major party presidential candidate said something that was not true, that was a lie,' "" Nicholas Lemann, professor at the Columbia School of Journalism and staff writer at the New Yorker, told me. For the first time in a generation, there was a spirited debate about the ideal of ""balanced"" coverage. Perhaps it wasn't the solution to covering a candidate who represented a peculiarly American strain of quasi-fascist white nationalism. It was good while it lasted. But in the final weeks of the campaign, after the debates had passed, the press (including ""old"" media like the Times) again decided that the most consequential election in generations should be contested largely over the issue of Hillary Clinton's emails. (One study found that in 2016 the combined nightly network newscasts spent more time examining Clinton's server than every other policy issue combined.) If this wasn't bad enough, the coverage of Trump continued to be judged, at least in part, by his ability to stay ""on message"" at rallies. When Trump appeared relatively sane (it's a sliding scale), the media seemed to forget the severity of the threat he posed. Even the Washington Post, which has pursued Trump with unrivaled vigor, last week congratulated the candidate on being ""back on script."" The danger of Trump was and remains twofold: There is the man and there is the movement. There is the unstable narcissist who will head a federal government that possesses nuclear weapons (and the intelligence-gathering apparatus of the NSA), and there is the ugly ideology he espoused when he wasn't busy contradicting it with his erratic pronouncements. This division between Trump and Trumpism raises two questions going forward for the press. The first is how to cover the man. He can no longer be laughed off as a buffoon, an idiot savant, or a sideshow act. The absurd personality, the ridiculous ego, the titanic self-regard: All of it matters. The personal really is political--and this personality now commands massive power. The media is of course multifaceted and hard to define. The reporters at the New York Times and Washington Post are members of the media; in 2016, thanks to CNN, so was Corey Lewandowski. Traditional print media handled Trump's candidacy more ably than cable news, which relished the spectacle the candidate created and the ratings that came with covering it. But the first year of Trump's candidacy was a disaster for the profession no matter how you define it. We treated Trump as the gloriously entertaining distraction and pop-culture figure that he admittedly once was. We occasionally stood up to defend democratic values from his encroachments, but we were unsurprisingly if indefensibly quicker to counter his attacks on freedom of the press than on other liberties. The second question is how the media deals with Trumpism, which is now the reigning ideology of the country's dominant political party. The press has been no better on this score, covering the Republican Party of recent years as if it were a normal political party in a Western democracy. It isn't and hasn't been for a long time. But the media had become so accustomed to the ideals of balance and parity in coverage of the two American parties that it continued covering the GOP as if it hadn't descended into quackery and madness. Trump's takeover of the party thus came as a shock when it might well have been contextualized earlier on, if not predicted. Trump's embrace of babbling nonsense on the subject of climate change, for example, is a direct outgrowth of the party's long-standing disdain for intellectualism and for science. It is horrifically new for a modern major party nominee to express racism so openly, but virtually the entire GOP has been engaged in a dedicated effort to keep black people from voting for decades now. And when you spend years telling your voters that the media peddles nothing but lies and that the president is illegitimate, you are eventually going to be saddled with someone who simply raises the stakes: The media isn't just dishonest; it's part of a worldwide conspiracy. The president isn't just illegitimate; he's a Kenyan usurper. The GOP's pre-Trump Trumpism allowed a dangerous demagogue to take command of the party, and now the country. Republicans may not have willed Trump, but they established the conditions for a man like him, in all his grotesque incompetence and know-nothingness, to be born. And Trump didn't merely overwhelm the party; he was first appeased, then welcomed by opportunists and the weak-willed. He was ultimately supported by the vast majority of Republican politicians. In the wake of this bitter campaign, it might seem like common sense for the media to do its best to reach out to Republican voters--to earn their trust by showing respect for their voting preferences. CNN anchor Brian Stelter, who has been one of the network's few bright spots this year, wrote in a column this week that the big question facing the media is how it can go about offering a hand to voters who feel their lives and concerns have gone uncovered by the mainstream outlets. But even if that were possible--something I have my doubts about--it's not the solution. It may be true that too many reporters, cozy in their coastal cities, lost touch with the kinds of voters that fueled Trump's rise. But many of those voters, while suffering legitimately, hold views that should not be countenanced in a liberal democracy and are not excused by economic hardship. Covering this segment of the electorate is crucial, but the danger is doing so in a wrongheaded effort at some ideal of objectivity. ""If you have one side that says the Earth is round and the other side says the Earth is flat, you don't say, 'Although some people say the Earth is round, others say it's flat,' "" Daniel Okrent, former public editor of the New York Times, told me. ""But you do say that there are others who say it's flat. They're wrong, but they say it is flat and that is news. If you have a white nationalist Republican Party, you say they are a white nationalist party, but you still report what they are saying and doing."" Will this happen? When I spoke to the Post's Sullivan on the eve of the election, she told me that she thought the media had turned a corner of sorts. ""I do think that what happened with Trump will have a lasting effect,"" she said. ""Some sort of bridge was crossed."" What this crossing entails, she said, is ""being more straightforward and bolder in calling things as we see them. I think it's a perfectly good development."" Lemann agreed and thought the change was not merely the result of Trump. ""It's partly Trump, and partly that the media world is changing so rapidly. The establishment represents a smaller and smaller percent of the total media with a smaller and smaller percent of the audience. Within that tiny world, the percent of that world that is devoted to coming across as neutral is also shrinking. The New York Times in recent years is more Guardian-esque, at least as I read it."" It's hard to imagine the Times surrendering its hallowed objectivity for a relationship with the Democratic Party akin to the Guardian's relationship to Britain's Labour Party, at least at the moment. Perhaps that will change. Arguably the strangest aspect of this election was how it made you feel as if everything was changing under your feet--and that nothing was changing at all. That was certainly true of the press: Every time you thought the press had turned a corner, it soon reverted to form. The GOP has become an extremist party without much of the media identifying it as such, and now it's installed a volatile novice with disdain for our democracy in the White House. If we in the media return to pretending that we are not in the midst of a domestic and international crisis, we will be complicit in it."	How Journalists Failed in 2016--and What We Must Do When Trump Takes Office
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/who_can_rein_in_president_trump.html	"Once Donald Trump takes office, he will be the most widely loathed president in modern American history. Yet he will also have far more room to maneuver than any of his recent predecessors. That's precisely what's freaking so many people out. There is no way to predict what Trump will do or say in the months to come, and that's left many Americans anxious and afraid. Normally, you'd expect a successful presidential candidate to be at least somewhat attuned to the interests of his political allies, including his donors. Mitt Romney likely would have run a very different campaign in 2012 had he not depended on the support of wealthy donors. Trump faced no such constraint. His early success was driven largely by the saturation media coverage he generated with his bombastic rhetoric. This difference shows in Trump's fundraising totals. Through mid-October, his campaign committee spent roughly half as much as Hillary Clinton's. And while Romney attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in support from Super PACs, Trump's Super PAC allies raised a far smaller sum. Several large donors who had enthusiastically backed Republicans in previous elections and who supported Trump's rivals in the race for the GOP presidential nomination, favored Clinton over Trump. This was particularly true of donors who had contributed to Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and Marco Rubio, three candidates perceived, fairly or otherwise, as especially deferential to the interests of the financial services sector. If Trump won't be tied down by large donors, might he instead by hemmed in by the Republican Party? Probably not. Unlike the centralized, disciplined political parties found in many other democracies, America's major parties are loose coalitions. Campaign finance regulation has hollowed out central party organizations, and power has shifted to individual candidates, their fundraising networks, and a congeries of Super PACs and pressure groups. The party that controls the presidency has the distinct advantage of having a very visible figure who is unambiguously at the top of the partisan totem pole. Without such a focal point, these loose coalitions have a way of descending into anarchy. That's basically what's happened to the GOP in the Obama years. But now the GOP has a focal point, and it's not Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, or Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House (for now, at least). It is Donald Trump. Instead of Republicans reining in Trump, it is Trump who will play the central role in defining what it means to be a Republican. Until recently, ambitious young Republicans knew exactly what they had to do to make their way in the GOP: Invoke the memory of Ronald Reagan at every turn, even if you were but a small child when Reagan was in the White House, and make sure everyone in the party knew you were a conservative's conservative devoted to conservative conservatism. Witness the careers of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, two 40-somethings who hold different perspectives on policy issues and who have entirely different styles. And yet both men endeavored to convince their fellow Republicans, and particularly Republican donors, that they were Reagan's Latino heirs. Trump's victory has almost certainly brought the era of Reagan worship to an end. If donors won't guide the president-elect, and the party apparatus won't constrain him, then who will steer the president-elect? Heavy responsibility will fall on the shoulders of Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, Trump's closest confidantes, and the as yet unknown people who will staff senior roles in his administration. Trump has been consistent on one point over the course of his decadeslong flirtation with national politics: his skepticism about free trade and his commitment to economic nationalism. On almost everything else, from the tax code to universal health insurance to the size of the military to unauthorized immigration--his signature issue this campaign cycle--he's taken any number of positions. On most of these questions, with the notable exception of immigration, Trump is a blank slate. Indeed, one of his recurring themes has been that, unlike the Republicans he trounced in the primaries, he is no ideologue. He's promised to do ""whatever works"" to make America great again. Who will serve in a Trump administration? We can expect that Trump's most enthusiastic surrogates--former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani--will be given prominent roles. Trump's most devoted cheerleaders have been has-beens (like Gingrich and Giuliani) and never-weres who were unafraid of the reputational consequences of backing Trump either because they were so devoted to his cause or, in some cases, because they felt they had everything to gain and nothing to lose. If loyalty is Trump's chief criterion for hiring, he'll run into a serious problem. There are countless roles that will need be filled at the Trump White House and in executive branch agencies, most of which offer sleepless nights and hardly any glory. Because his campaign was so small and because it alienated so many elite Republicans, it will be difficult for President Trump to limit himself to loyalists. He will have to reach out to at least some of the men and women who opposed him. One of the biggest challenges facing Republicans in the post-Reagan era is that as the party has grown more stridently anti-elitist, it has hemorrhaged college-educated professionals. Though the GOP has compensated for this loss in electoral terms, it's contributed to an asymmetry in the realm of policy expertise. Whereas Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign had vast numbers of credentialed policy experts at its beck and call, the Trump campaign had a small, tight-knit coterie of contrarians, who zagged when other Republicans of their social class zigged. That's not a terrible thing when you're waging war on the conventional wisdom. But it makes life far more difficult when you need warm bodies to fill staff positions. Most people are conformists, not renegades. And in intellectual circles, including in conservative intellectual circles, full-throated support for Trump has been a minority position. In the weeks and months to come, many policy professionals will face a dilemma. Are they willing to put aside their doubts about Trump to serve in his administration? Doing so will mean taking on a not-inconsiderable risk. Trump was the most polarizing presidential candidate in recent memory. It is easy to imagine that he will be just as polarizing a president. He is untested as a public servant, and it's not at all clear that he has the discipline or the experience necessary to serve as the nation's chief executive. That is precisely why it is so important that those asked to serve in the Trump administration give very serious consideration to doing so, regardless of their political proclivities. This is particularly true of those with national security expertise, but it is not limited to them. America is entering a very uncertain moment, and our new president will need calm voices and steady hands around him."	The Only People Who Can Rein In President Trump Are the Ones Who'll Work for Him
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/why_trump_is_terrifying_for_the_freedom_of_the_press.html	"It is hard to imagine what good will come for the vulnerable among us during a Trump presidency, the fruits of a reactionary, xenophobic, hateful campaign. The health of the planet will suffer as climate change goes unaddressed. There is a long list of nightmares that are now poised to come true. Among them: Life might soon become very ugly for journalists. As a voice for the weak and powerless, a free press is important especially in neo-authoritarian conditions, and it should be obvious by now that Trump wants to curb its efficacy. As a candidate, he consistently maligned the mainstream media as corrupt and dishonest. He portrayed the press as a group of ethically compromised elitists colluding to thwart his candidacy and stifle the voices of his supporters. He represents a group of people who see a strong independent press not as a necessary check on accumulated power in America but as a bothersome impediment to the accumulation of that power. And he will almost certainly use the office of the presidency to bring the press to heel. Within limits, of course. As far as I know, the freedom of the press is still guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. But even within those constraints, there's still plenty that Trump could do to vitiate the media. He could start with the nation's legal protections for the press. While campaigning, Trump promised to ""open up"" libel laws, making it easier for powerful people to sue the reporters who scrutinize their lives or fail to show them the proper deference. The rich and vindictive will be newly emboldened to use lawsuits--and the threat of lawsuits--to intimidate journalists into silence and inaction. Trump has a lifelong habit of suing journalists who cover him unfavorably. One of his big donors, the tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, bankrolled the lawsuit that successfully put Gawker out of business. (Among the litigious entities that are certainly cheering a Trump presidency: the Church of Scientology.) In an October interview with CBS 4 Miami, Trump praised England's libel system--in which people being sued for libel must affirmatively prove that what they said is true--and suggested that the United States should follow suit. ""[The media] can say anything they want about you or me and there doesn't have to be any apology,"" said Trump. ""England has a system where if they are wrong things happen."" Things happen. The first thing that will happen, if Trump gets his way, will be an uptick in libel lawsuits. Of course, successful libel lawsuits rely on judges who are sympathetic to the claimants, and Trump cannot remake the entire judiciary in one stroke. But many journalists and their employers don't have the wherewithal to fight lawsuits, even baseless ones, to the end. Perhaps the worst thing that could happen to the press under a Trump administration might not be that he will try to shackle it, but that it will sometimes choose to shackle itself. I have no doubt that many, many journalists will continue to investigate and report critically on Trump, and will be backed to the hilt by their editors. But I fear there will be others who weigh the costs and benefits of hitting Trump hard, and ultimately decide the story isn't worth it. As president, Trump will almost certainly foster an atmosphere that normalizes the vilification of the media and forces reporters into a defensive posture. He regularly taunted journalists on the campaign trail. He publicly mocked the disability of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. At a campaign rally just last week, he menaced NBC reporter Katy Tur from the stage. As president, he will be newly empowered to retaliate against journalists whom he deems hostile. This retaliation, in many cases, might be subtly enforced: encouraging federal agencies to stall or ignore Freedom of Information Act requests, holding limited press briefings and refusing to take questions from unfriendly reporters, curbing reportorial access to relevant events and personnel. It's true that Trump will often grant interviews to reporters who have uncovered dirt on him; it's also true that his campaign enforced a black list on some organizations. To be fair, Trump's recent presidential predecessors haven't been especially friendly to the media, either. The Obama administration has aggressively prosecuted government whistleblowers. The George W. Bush administration saw the press as just another special interest and treated reporters with evident contempt: stalling on FOIA requests, skimping presidential press conferences. When the New York Times broke the warrantless wiretapping story, some conservatives called it treason. The difference between Trump and his predecessors is that, if the Times were to break such a story under his administration, there's every reason to think he might actually try to have the reporters prosecuted for treason. Trump has surrounded himself with people who themselves clearly disdain the press, and his behavior has emboldened his fans and surrogates to indulge their worst impulses. Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, assaulted a reporter who was trying to ask the candidate a question. His campaign messages were amplified by a corps of hateful frogs who used Twitter to issue misogynistic, anti-Semitic threats to journalists who reported critically on the Trump campaign. These threats will likely continue and intensify over the next four years. In Trump's America, it will not be unreasonable for adversarial reporters to fear vigilante justice meted out by violent eggs who now feel safe to show their true faces. Trump owes his presidency to millions of Americans who apparently deem Alex Jones and racist email forwards more credible than the Washington Post and the New York Times. ""Things"" ought to ""happen"" to reporters who are ""wrong,"" Trump said, and the imprecision of all three terms is reason for dread. Trump will take office in January. Between now and then, the cable news networks that traffic in vacuous false equivalencies and aided Trump's rise by giving him so much uncritical attention should subject themselves to a long dark night of the soul. More broadly, the media must reckon with the fact that all of its reporting and investigations and editorializing and polls and data visualizations could not forestall this outcome. Almost every mainstream media outlet editorialized against Trump, and their exertions seem to have had little effect on voters. The best stories of this election cycle did not reach or resonate with the general public, and the media needs to figure out why. But, most of all, the media needs to prepare itself for the next four years. Its work will soon become more difficult, but it has never been more important. See more Slate coverage of the election."

Somebody else was going to write that check, make that phone call, knock on that door. The Clinton campaign was a machine. They had it down. I didn't need to do these things, because somebody else was doing them. I could sit and watch. I could bitch about how Hillary wasn't really progressive. I could rag on her Wall Street speeches. I could talk about how beating Trump wasn't enough. I knew she was going to win, because the polls said so. All those folks were going to vote for her. So I didn't have to. I could hold out for Bernie. I could vote for Jill Stein. I could cast a bag of weed for Gary Johnson. She had a lock on the Electoral College. If she didn't win Ohio, she'd win North Carolina. Or Florida. Or Pennsylvania. Michigan and Wisconsin were already in the bank. Every state was expendable. Some other state would be there to pick up the slack. Hell, I could vote for Trump if I wanted to. Yeah, he was kind of nuts, and he didn't seem to have much idea of how to do the job. Come to think of it, I didn't have much idea of how he'd do the job. But I didn't have to, because he wasn't going to win. So I could send a message. I'd give him another vote to stick it to the establishment. Or just to vent. Somebody else would elect the boring politicians who keep the government running. I didn't have to. The establishment always wins. That's how it is. Clinton, Bush, Obama, they're all the same. They cut their deals, they shake hands with dignitaries, they stand in front of the flag. It doesn't matter. The system goes on. Somebody makes it work. Doesn't have to be me. Jim Comey, smart guy. He knew Hillary would win. After the debates and the polls, she had it in the bag. No harm in sending that letter. There wasn't any precedent for doing it, so maybe it was a little unfair. But it wouldn't change the outcome. The media knew the score, too. Trump won the primary, but he couldn't win the general. He was too nutty, too boorish, too patently unfit. We could spend our time on Clinton's emails. We could give Trump all the free airtime in the world. It was just ratings. Voters would do the right thing. Republican bosses saw it coming, too. Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell--those guys knew Trump had no chance. All that nonsense he spouted about a wall and a secret plan to defeat ISIS? And the weird bromance with Putin? None of it mattered. Trump would never be president. The important thing was to hold the party together, get through the election, and lose as few seats as possible. And that meant backing the nominee. Keeping him out of the White House was the Democrats' job. It's always somebody else's job. They always come through. They hold the country together. They keep us out of trade wars. They keep the economy humming or stumbling along. They keep the world safe from tyrants. They keep us from turning on one another. They keep peace in the streets. They keep the planet from burning up. And that's why I stayed home on Election Day. Or didn't help register voters. Or didn't talk to the guy down the block who said he might vote for Trump. Or kept my silence about the jackass at the top of our ticket. Or wrote that article about Hillary's hair instead of explaining what would happen if we slapped a 35 percent tariff on China or pulled out of NATO. I knew somebody would come through. But they didn't. The pollsters, the media, the Republicans, the Democrats, the FBI, the blacks, the whites, the establishment, the phony politicians--they all let me down. They let this monster get elected. Maybe I should leave the country. Maybe I should leave these bastards behind, to stew in what they've done. It's their own damned fault. I don't blame myself.

30	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/the_democratic_party_establishment_is_finished_after_trump.html	"The Democrats will now control next to nothing above the municipal level. Donald Trump will be president. We are going to be unpacking this night for the rest of our lives, and lives beyond that. We can't comprehend even 1 percent of what's just happened. But one aspect of it, minor in the overall sweep, that I'm pretty sure we can comprehend well enough right now: The Democratic Party establishment has beclowned itself and is finished. I think of the lawmakers, the consultants, the operatives, and--yes--the center-left media, and how everything said over the past few years leading up to this night was bullshit. The midterm losses? That was just a bad cycle, structurally speaking; presidential demographics would make up for it. The party establishment made a grievous mistake rallying around Hillary Clinton. It wasn't just a lack of recent political seasoning. She was a bad candidate, with no message beyond heckling the opposite sideline. She was a total misfit for both the politics of 2016 and the energy of the Democratic Party as currently constituted. She could not escape her baggage, and she must own that failure herself. Theoretically smart people in the Democratic Party should have known that. And yet they worked giddily to clear the field for her. Every power-hungry young Democrat fresh out of law school, every rising lawmaker, every old friend of the Clintons wanted a piece of the action. This was their ride up the power chain. The whole edifice was hollow, built atop the same unearned sense of inevitability that surrounded Clinton in 2008, and it collapsed, just as it collapsed in 2008, only a little later in the calendar. The voters of the party got taken for a ride by the people who controlled it, the ones who promised they had everything figured out and sneeringly dismissed anyone who suggested otherwise. They promised that Hillary Clinton had a lock on the Electoral College. These people didn't know what they were talking about, and too many of us in the media thought they did. We should blame all those people around the Clintons more than the Clintons themselves, and the Clintons themselves deserve a ridiculous amount of blame. Hillary Clinton was just an ambitious person who wanted to be president. There are a lot of people like that. But she was enabled. The Democratic establishment is a club unwelcoming to outsiders, because outsiders don't first look out for the club. The Clintons will be gone now. For the sake of the country, let them take the hangers-on with them. What was the line? Hillary Clinton would do well in a general election, because she'd been ""vetted"" for 20-some years and there was nothing new Republicans could try? Just writing that, I recognize that it's the funniest line I've ever seen, and yet it was the exact argument Clinton used in two separate campaigns for the Democratic nomination. The ace ground game, the brilliant ad-makers, the top Hollywood talent, and the best analytics operation ever assembled? This was all a joke. The best analytics team in the world, apparently, couldn't find in their numbers that it was worth making a single stop to Wisconsin following the convention in a campaign against a Republican whose base appeal was in the Rust Belt. Not that an extra visit would have changed the result. Think of how wrong the entire national media conversation was--and yes, I contributed my fair share--about how the Republicans were being torn apart as a party. I prewrote a piece Tuesday afternoon, to be published in the event of the expected Clinton win, pushing back against both myself and other members of the media, arguing that Democrats and Republicans were both in existential trouble and that, in the short-term context of a decaying political system, Republicans might even have the edge: Democrats could win the presidency most of the time but never a majority of state governments or the House; while Republicans could always win the majority of state governments and the House, and occasionally--probably in 2020, I thought--the White House. This was wrong. Republicans don't have a slight edge over Democrats in a decaying political system. Republicans are ascendant. Trump has given them a mission. The country is now theirs. Whoever takes over what's left of the Democratic Party is going to have to find a way to appeal to a broader cross section of the country. It may still be true that in the long term, Republicans can't win with their demographics, but we found out Tuesday that the long term is still pretty far away. Democrats have to win more white voters. They have to do so in a way that doesn't erode the anti-racist or anti-sexist planks of the modern party, which are non-negotiable. If only there were a model for this. The few Democratic leaders who remain are going to say that it was just a bad note struck here or there, or the lazy Bernie voters who didn't show up, or Jim Comey, or unfair media coverage of Clinton's emails, to blame for this loss. I am already seeing Democrats blaming the Electoral College, which until a few hours ago was hailed as the great protector of Democratic virtue for decades to come, and Republicans were silly for not understanding how to crack the blue ""wall."" They will say, just wait for Republicans to overreach. Then we'll be fine. Don't listen to any of this. Everything is not OK. This is not OK. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."
