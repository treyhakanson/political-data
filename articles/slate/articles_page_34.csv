Farhan al-Jassem is not a reluctant soldier, but sadness lurked behind his smile and deep brown eyes when he talked about the last 21/2 years he spent trying to fight what he considers the good fight in Syria. On a sultry July night in a tea garden in southeastern Turkey, Jassem, 29, leaned back in his plastic chair and gulped down several bottles of water as he told the story of how he came to lead a key Syrian brigade receiving training and equipment from a U.S.-organized military coalition in the battle against ISIS. As he spoke, 54 members of the larger division his brigade belonged to were finishing their training with U.S. Special Operations soldiers at a base located roughly 200 miles to the northwest. Jassem got his first taste of the country's roiling civil war in early 2012, when he was conscripted into Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army, but he hated it and bought his way out, paying $400 for permission to visit his hometown of Manbij, 40 miles northeast of Aleppo. There he quickly joined the anti-regime Free Syrian Army, before moving to a smaller Turkmen brigade and then to the so-called 30th Division, created by the United States and its allies as the vanguard of Washington's effort to roll back ISIS's territorial gains. When he spoke to the Center for Public Integrity in July, Jassem had passed an initial round of vetting to join the training and said he expected to participate in the next class--so long as the U.S. coalition kept its promises to the first set of graduates, especially a promise to ""protect us against our enemies after the program ends,"" he said. But Jassem's fate suddenly took an uncertain turn on July 28, when he was captured by a rival anti-ISIS militia, known as the Nusra Front, which is affiliated with al-Qaida and therefore an enemy of any Syrian working with Americans. Captured alongside Jassem near the northern Syrian town of Azaz were his division's commander, 16 graduates of the allied train-and-equip program, and two other division soldiers, according to Aziz Abu Mohammad, a 30th Division commander based in Turkey, who was interviewed by telephone. This capture was a cataclysmic event for the division, by all accounts, and a grave setback for the U.S. train-and-equip program, which will face steeper challenges in recruiting new fighters and maintaining their morale. But Jassem's story--the arc of his military service and its apparently grim end--is also a lesson for America's deepening involvement in this complex territorial conflict. It comes with many risks, both political ones and for the fighters, personal ones, since any association with the United States or the West can carry a fatal stigma on the other side of Turkey's border with Syria. Fighting for his country was not always part of Jassem's plan. He briefly studied Arabic literature at a university before dropping out to move to Greece and work there for several years. When protests against Assad began back home in Syria, he joined similar demonstrations in front of the Syrian embassy in Athens, where he began to make contacts within the nascent armed Syrian opposition. Jassem, who has a medium build, playful grin, close-cropped black hair, and bushy black eyebrows, said he was aware of the risks of joining the U.S.-led coalition effort. Graduates of the train and equip program would be returning to Syria ""with targets on their backs,"" he said. Nusra and other rebel groups, they knew, targeted recipients of foreign aid not just because of their anti-Western ideology, but also because they coveted the M16s and anti-tank guided missiles that coalition forces provided fighters. Even though their handlers from the Pentagon had promised to protect the trainees, Jassem said, it was a purely verbal agreement. But Jassem said he signed up when one of his superiors from the Turkmen brigade, Col. Nedim al-Hasan, told him last March that the coalition wanted to create a new rebel group that would unite several of the anti-ISIS brigades that had splintered off of the Free Syrian Army and scattered across eastern Syria after being forced out of their homes by ISIS. The colonel, a man he'd fought with for three years, would lead the entire division, which would eventually number more than 1,000 fighters. The division would be composed of brigades from parts of Syria east of Aleppo, where ISIS had become a greater scourge than the Syrian regime, such as Jassem's hometown. Most were ethnic Turkmen, but some, like Jassem, were Arab. The aim, he said, was to create a force that could funnel recruits into the train-and-equip program. The vetting process was intensive, he said, and discomfiting for many. The reason, he was told by fellow recruits, is that candidates for training were interviewed in the second stage while attached to polygraph machines by wires wrapped around their fingers. The questions were simple--had they ever fought for Nusra, for example? But the candidates had heard that similar-looking machines were used to administer electrical shocks to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, and so the experience was frightening. Being subjected to eye and fingerprint scans added to their fears. ""They felt like laboratory rats,"" said Jassem. But the program also had its allure. Most enticing to the recruits, Jassem said, was the prospect of getting satellite phones connected to vehicles, with which they could call in airstrikes from coalition warplanes when needed. They were also promised M16 rifles, and Jassem said there ""had also been talk"" of anti-tank weapons and ammunition. ""The coming days will prove whether the coalition is really going to help us"" defeat ISIS, Jassem said. If the coalition forces keep their promises to protect the first set of trainees, ""we expect the number of people in the second training group to increase,"" he added. Jassem emphasized that the coalition's promises only covered the 54 graduates of the train-and-equip program. But when those trainees re-entered the battlefield, he said, they would rejoin their fellow fighters from the division already fighting ISIS, including about 200 men who had applied for the train-and-equip program but had been rejected. At the time of his abduction, Jassem was awaiting a second round of vetting to join the program, having already passed the first. He was meeting his colleagues who were heading back to Syria after visiting relatives in Turkey, but they first had to pass a Nusra checkpoint several miles south of the Turkish border. They thought they had gotten permission to do so from an Egyptian Nusra leader 10 days earlier, Abu Mohammad said. That promise proved false. Mohammad said he heard from a friend in the town of Azaz, where the group was taken after being stopped, that they were paraded through the town with the backs of their shirts pulled over their heads as Nusra fighters shouted that they had ""collaborated with the crusader coalition."" Two days after the group's capture, a militia group affiliated with Nusra directly attacked the 30th Division's headquarters, killing five other graduates of the program, according to Abu Mohammed. Coalition warplanes retaliated to both incidents by bombing the headquarters of Nusra in Azaz, he added, a claim that the Pentagon declined to confirm. Hours after the raids, he told the Center for Public Integrity through an interpreter that Nusra's reaction will likely be to execute the detainees it already has in hand and ""finish"" the 30th Division. ""Especially now ... their fate is sealed."" Pentagon spokeswoman Elissa Smith contested Abu Mohammad's claim that any graduates of the train-and-equip program were detained in Tuesday's kidnapping but said she had no further information to provide. She acknowledged that the 30th Division and its trainees were also attacked on Friday and said that the coalition had supported them with defensive airstrikes, but she would not confirm that it occurred in Azaz and said the attacking force was ""unknown."" U.S.  Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Kevin J. Killea, chief of staff of the U.S. combined joint task force carrying out anti-ISIS operations, told Pentagon media on Friday that he had no knowledge of any abducted or injured trainees. All anti-ISIS forces in Syria ""that are credible, reliable partners,"" said Killea, ""will receive coalition support as is required."" This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington."	America's Effort to Train Syrian Fighters to Combat ISIS Just Suffered Its First Major Defeat
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/donald_trump_may_be_a_choir_boy_in_the_first_republican_debate_being_polite.html	"Donald Trump has changed the rules of campaigning. In no area has he done more pioneering work than in the field of insults. He has insulted countries, political opponents, senior Republican leaders, and entire classes of people--from Mexican immigrants to POWs. So it would be reasonable to expect that when he takes the center lectern next week for the first Republican debate, he'll continue true to form--a knee to the groin here, a sweeping denunciation there. The word stupid is no doubt already limbered up and bouncing around his verbal ready-room. But isn't the obvious gambit restraint? Shouldn't we expect the Republican front-runner to show up and behave like a choir boy? That possibility rewards imaginative analysis. I only wish I could speak as well as Jeb does about my love for immigrants. Gov. Christie reminds me of myself. Trump could bring everyone plush bathrobes from one of his resort properties. That Trump is likely to be on his best behavior is the conclusion of several advisers working for Trump's challengers. Next Thursday's debate will be the first great test of his capacity to bridle his natural inclinations in the service of a tactical goal. Trump is running on the No Restraint ticket, so why start biting his tongue now? There's a practical reason and a political one. The practical reason is that he will get more notice in the debate from being polite than from offering the predictable string of zingers. Anyone watching Thursday night who has heard only about Trump the self-promoting blowhard who is ruining the GOP will be pleasantly surprised. ""They'll say, 'Oh, he's not that bad, it's just the media,' "" says one top strategist, who's advising another candidate who will be on the stage that night. The next day Trump can go back to throwing elbows. As a political matter, Trump has to find a way to shed some of the Louis Vuitton cast-iron baggage he carries around with him. He is at the top of the polls, but those same polls show that he isn't likely to stay there. The recent Quinnipiac poll highlights the dilemma. In the political horserace among candidates, Trump gets 20 percent of the support of GOP voters. The only other competitors in double digits are Gov. Scott Walker (13 percent) and Jeb Bush (10 percent). But Trump also has the highest unfavorable rating: 59 percent. Only 27 percent of voters polled have a favorable view of him, and 30 percent of Republicans say they will never vote for Trump. That's the highest of any candidate. By comparison, Christie, the competitor with the second-highest score on this scale, turns off only 15 percent of voters. Hillary Clinton has a terminal problem with only 9 percent of voters. As a result, when those Quinnipiac respondents are asked about the general election, Trump loses to Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Vice President Joe Biden in head-to-head match-ups.* That's not true of any other Republican candidate. Carrying this gambit would take some skill, especially for a candidate who believes so thoroughly in his own instincts. When people regularly praise you for telling it like it is, it will be hard to stow that trait for a full 90 minutes. On the other hand, Trump is selling himself as a great negotiator. Then he is no doubt familiar with the black-hat/white-hat approach, whereby a negotiator moves from tough and unyielding to generous and compromising. Pull this off and the person on the other side winds up feeling a little gratitude for you giving him what he wants. Trump has been downplaying expectations for a few days, saying that he's never really been in a debate. Presumably there is some debate in negotiation, but never mind: That rare bit of modesty is proof he has the capacity to play-act for effect. If Trump can pause his natural, driving impulses for the good of a larger strategy, it might be the first time in this campaign that he's elevated himself by making himself smaller. *Correction, August 1, 2015: This article originally misstated that Trump lost to Martin O'Malley in a hypothetical general election match-up. The third Democratic opponent against whom Trump was tested and lost was Joe Biden. (Return.)"	Why Donald Trump May Play the Choir Boy in Next Week's GOP Debate

This year SarahPAC has depleted much of its once prodigious cash reserve, spending about a quarter-million dollars more than it raised, according to new filings with the Federal Election Commission. SarahPAC's financial malaise coincides with Palin's own star power dimming: Fox News in June declined to renew Palin's contract as a commentator, and the Sarah Palin Channel, a subscription-based online TV feed Palin launched in 2014, is going dark this week. While SarahPAC's $562,000 cash-on-hand figure is better than what most political committees could boast, it's the PAC's lowest total since mid-2009, the year Palin founded the operation. Since late 2009, SarahPAC has almost always carried more than $1 million on its books and never less than $800,000. So where'd the money go? Unlike many political action committees, very little of the $753,000 it spent from Jan. 1 to June 30, 2015, went directly to political candidates and committees. Instead, SarahPAC's top expenditures largely helped fortify its own existence--or helped Palin personally. Federal rules governing spending by ""leadership PACs""--committees run by current or former elected officials--are notoriously permissive, with both Democrats and Republicans regularly using the cash to fund lavish travel, pricy gifts, or just about any other self-indulgent expense. Some of the top recent SarahPAC expenditures have included:"	Sarah Palin's PAC Is Spending More on Hotels and Travel Than on Republican Candidates
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/donald_trump_john_kasich_and_private_sector_how_to_judge_the_republican.html	"We interrupt the Donald Trump cavalcade to present you with a story you will not read. It's about Ohio Gov. John Kasich and not Donald Trump. It's not that I don't want you to read it. I just fear that what's true of the polls is true of readers. Trump sells, as the Washington Post's Philip Bump points out. So this piece might suffer the same fate candidate John Kasich faces for the moment. It's going to languish at the bottom of the rankings--Trumped. Gov. Kasich announced his presidential candidacy Tuesday. It was overshadowed by the good ship Trump. The real estate mogul gave out Sen. Lindsey Graham's cellphone number after Graham repeatedly called Trump a ""jackass."" Trump took umbrage at being called a jackass, but he didn't have to. Lyndon Johnson suggested that being that brand of barnyard animal is good training for the presidency. ""Being president is like being a jackass in a hailstorm,"" LBJ said; """"There's nothing to do but to stand there and take it."" Trump's rise in the polls and Kasich's position near the bottom offers a stark demonstration of the difference between campaigns as entertainment and campaigns as a vehicle for selecting qualified presidents--which is nominally what campaigns are supposed to be but never really have been. (Donald Trump would have loved how William Henry Harrison did things in 1840 in what was arguably the start of our modern circus.) ""A total lightweight,"" Trump said in reference to Graham. ""Here's a guy--in the private sector he couldn't get a job."" Trump heralds his own private-sector greatness as proof he would make a good president. If his competitors would never last a day in the private sector, perhaps we should turn to the private sector to guide us. What if we evaluated Trump and Kasich as a hiring committee would evaluate job applicants? We would look at the skills required for the job and measure whether either one of them had those skills. If this were really the way we did things in a presidential campaign, Kasich and not Trump would be getting the attention. Both men have executive skills. They can make decisions. But Kasich has executive decision skills in a venue that approximates the one we're hiring him for. Trump has made decisions in the private sector, but the public sector doesn't approximate the private one. This is a lesson all titans of the private sector learn when they come into government. Secretary of State George Shultz put it best: ""I learned in business that you had to be very careful when you told somebody that's working for you to do something, because the chances were very high he'd do it. In government, you don't have to worry about that."" The promise of a Trump presidency is that he will be able to do things simply by asserting that he can--he'll whip China, terrify ISIS into surrender, pacify Putin, and fence the border. To say it is so is to make it so. That's the way it works for Trump in business. But presidents from Lincoln to Reagan to Clinton to Bush have testified that the greatest surprise of the office is when they learn how little power they have. This isn't because these past presidents are weak, it's just that the job as the founders designed it is not all powerful. It's possible that Donald Trump could adapt his talents to the new environment, but he's not making the case that he will be able to. He's saying being a deal maker is all he needs to be. In Trump, we have a job applicant who is selling himself for a job by trying to convince us the job is different than the one we're hiring him for. This should make the hiring committee suspicious. It's also important for a president to know how to work within a vast organization. Trump has done that and so has Kasich. You must know how to convey your will to other people and put yourself in their shoes. Clearly Trump knows how to convey his will (and his id). It's the second part that is a problem. The people a president deals with are politicians. Kasich has worked as both an executive and a legislator. He was budget chairman in Congress the last time the budget was balanced and he served on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. Since the presidency requires familiarity with politics and politicians, he has to be given the advantage in dealing with the kinds of people he'll be forced to deal with in Washington. Trump, on the other hand, has spent the last several weeks torching Republicans he's running against. He started this cycle by shredding Reagan's 11th commandment, ""Thou shall not speak ill of a fellow Republican."" He's not showing us that he plays well with others who cross him (as politicians regularly do) or has the capacity to. According to polls, Trump has a higher disapproval rating than approval rating among general election voters. Kasich has a 60 percent approval rating in Ohio, a key general-election battleground state. Political popularity is not exactly an attribute of being president, but being popular sure helps get the job done. In 2014, Kasich won re-election with 64 percent of the vote, running essentially unopposed, with 60 percent of the female vote and 51 percent of union households. Trump's most attractive quality is that he could be disruptive. But we're hiring him for a job where we know people are risk-averse. Though people are unsatisfied with American politics, they're not keen on massive shake-ups, roiled markets from whipsaw decisions, and lots of exciting brink-of-disaster gambles. ""You're fired!"" doesn't work in the presidential context. It makes people feel like the ship doesn't have a crew. Just ask Jimmy Carter, who in the summer of 1979 asked for the resignation of his cabinet and senior White House staff--34 people in all. Carter thought it was a great house-cleaning act of management. Most people thought it was delusional. Kasich has plenty of weaknesses. As with Trump, his speeches are rambling and long. Like Trump, he has trouble with self-discipline. He may have other flaws that will come out during the campaign. But for those who like the private-sector flavor that Trump brings to the race, there's another way the private sector might inform our election choices--by encouraging us to think about whether the fellow asking to get the job actually has any of the required skills."	If We Listened to Donald Trump, John Kasich Would Be Our Front-Runner
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/donald_trump_doxes_lindsey_graham_insults_john_mccain_why_his_latest_antics.html	"On Saturday, during a Republican presidential forum in Iowa, candidate Donald Trump questioned the heroic bona fides of former nominee and Arizona Sen. John McCain, a naval aviator who spent five years in a North Vietnamese prison camp. ""He's not a war hero,"" said Trump, whose own service record includes a poorly explained medical deferment during Vietnam, ""He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured."" Almost immediately, Republicans condemned his rhetoric as offensive and beyond the pale. ""Donald Trump owes every American veteran and in particular John McCain an apology,"" said former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, upon taking the stage at the event. ""I unequivocally denounce him,"" said Scott Walker while campaigning in Iowa. Jeb Bush called the remark ""slanderous,"" and in a statement on Saturday, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee said that: ""Senator McCain is an American hero because he served his country and sacrificed more than most can imagine. Period. There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably."" One thing that stands out in the response is the odd partisanship around military service. In 2004, for instance, there was a place in the Republican Party for comments that disparage those who served honorably. Many Republican leaders and officials, like then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, supported the ""Swift Boat"" attacks against John Kerry's war record. (McCain was a notable exception at the time). More significantly, there's the fact that this was the tipping point for anti-Trump Republicans, and not his aggressive xenophobia. For the past month, Trump has used racist invective and know-nothing nativism to build a platform in the Republican presidential primary. Like the most famous provocateurs of the Obama era--from Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck to Rush Limbaugh and Dinesh D'Souza--he's indulged the worst, most paranoid parts of the Republican base, feeding the fear and anxiety unleashed by economic insecurity and rapid social change. The whole time, mainstream Republicans were silent. The same figures who pounced on their opponents for slight missteps were unwilling to denounce Trump for his racism. Up until his attack on McCain, the collective Republican Party response to Donald Trump was somewhere between silence and qualified defense; at Politico Magazine, for example, National Review editor Rich Lowry wrote that Trump ""had a point"" when he said Mexico isn't ""sending their best,"" ignoring Trump's claim that those immigrants are violent criminals. But now, Republicans are criticizing Trump and for most observers, this means the beginning of the end for his stunt campaign. ""The Trump portion of the 2016 race may be long remembered, though like the birther saga of the last cycle, there will be little of use to reflect upon,"" writes Rick Klein of ABC News. ""In any event, it's winding down now, or so it would appear, in predictable if not quite painless fashion."" But as much as this seems true, I think it's premature, even after Trump doxed fellow GOP candidate and close McCain friend Lindsey Graham on Tuesday. At this point, there's no hard evidence that pro-Trump Republicans have left his stable. While there's still time for an anti-Trump backlash, the present fact is that he was more popular than ever when he attacked McCain. According to a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was the favorite for 24 percent of registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, the largest lead of any GOP candidate this year. There are caveats: It was a weekend poll, and we don't have a full response to the McCain remarks. Also, his support dropped over the course of the survey. And there's the broader point that Trump's surge is as much about media attention as it is about his campaign or his rhetoric. At the same time, Trump isn't a meaningless sideshow that will disappear after a few offensive remarks. ""He has exposed and exploited the Republican Party's two great weaknesses,"" writes Ryan Lizza for the New Yorker, ""the fact that many of its voters don't agree with Party leaders on immigration and the fact that the Party is powerless to do much about it."" I'll add something else: For the past eight years, an ecosystem of pundits, politicians, and provocateurs has spun a web of conspiracies about the president. Barack Obama wasn't a mainstream politician from the center-left of American politics, he was a ""Marxist"" consumed by ""anti-colonial ideology,"" an ""Alinskyite radical"" who would confiscate guns and send opponents to re-education camps. Trump does more than come out of this fever swamp; he's a conduit for its views, and evidence that it's more than a fringe--it's a substantial portion of the GOP electorate. It's why Texas Sen. Ted Cruz won't denounce Trump like his colleagues. ""You know I recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican-on-Republican violence, and so you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump, or bad about John McCain or bad about anyone else,"" he said. ""I'm not going to do it."" If and when Trump leaves the field--and, as a vanity candidate, he will eventually--Cruz can win his voters. As for Trump's trajectory after his McCain remarks, this would be the beginning of the end if the backlash were universal, but it isn't. On Monday morning, Fox News' Fox & Friends defended Trump, and later that day, notes the New York Times, Rush Limbaugh rallied his listeners to Trump's defense. ""Trump can survive this, Trump is surviving this,"" he said. ""The American people haven't seen something like this in a long time. ... They have not seen an embattled public figure stand up for himself, double down and tell everybody to go to hell."" As long as conservative media defend him, there's a decent chance Trump can survive, especially given that so many conservative voters distrust their leaders. If Trump stays in, then we--the public--can see what happens when a political party meets--and can't beat--an agent of chaos."	Why Trump's Comments About McCain and Doxing of Graham Won't End His Candidacy
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/netroots_nation_black_lives_matter_protest_hillary_clinton_needs_to_take.html	"If you were plotting a fissure point for liberals in the 2016 election, you might look to the divide between Hillary Clinton supporters and everyone to their left. But so far, that's been a quiet divide. Clinton has refrained from attacks on her liberal critics, and the left-wing candidate in the race--Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders--has focused more on issues than the competition. In the meantime, a fissure has emerged that could have a profound influence on the shape and tenor of the primary. With a new protest movement against police brutality and a social democratic candidate for president emerging at the same moment, an old liberal split--between focusing on race and focusing on class--has moved back to the fore. This was illustrated in dramatic fashion over the weekend at Netroots Nation--the annual gathering of liberal, lefties, and Internet activists. For most ordinary participants, Netroots is a safe space of ideological camaraderie. For politicians, not so much. In 2007, attendees jeered Clinton when she refused to join her opponents, Barack Obama and John Edwards, in a pledge to reject contributions from lobbyists. In 2009, a liberal blogger heckled Bill Clinton over ""don't ask, don't tell."" The next year, Harry Reid promised to repeal the measure after activist Dan Choi confronted him during a panel discussion. Anti-surveillance activists confronted Nancy Pelosi at 2013's conference, and Vice President Joe Biden was interrupted by immigration activists at last year's event. Clinton skipped this year's gathering in Phoenix--she hasn't been to the event since her first, disastrous experience eight years ago. But her most visible primary opponents--Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley--made a trek to the conference. Again, the politicians in attendance stumbled and, in the process, brought the intraleft divide to the center of attention. Ironically, the struggles of O'Malley and Sanders offer an opening for Clinton on vital issues within the Democratic coalition. This year's disruption came from Black Lives Matter, the anti-racist movement sparked in the aftermath of Ferguson and fueled by the steady drip of police violence against black Americans. Midway through O'Malley's remarks, demonstrators marched toward the stage, chanting names of black women killed by the police or who died in police custody. After a few minutes of protest, organizers handed protesters microphones, and they used the opportunity to question and challenge O'Malley on police brutality. O'Malley, notes BuzzFeed's Ruby Cramer, was supportive, nodding his head in assent to the questions and concerns. He erred, however, when protesters shouted their slogan, ""Black lives matter!"" O'Malley responded, ""Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter."" The demonstrators booed. The reason is easy to understand. ""Black lives matter"" is a statement of specific concern; police violence is most acute against black Americans, and so activists stress the importance of their lives. To reply with ""all lives matter"" is to suggest there's no specific problem of police abuse targeted at black Americans. It's as if someone responded to an annual breast cancer drive with ""Breast cancer matters. Prostate cancer matters. All cancer matters."" It sounds like a dismissal, and that's how it was received. If this was a miscue, then the confrontation with Sanders was a fiasco. Whereas O'Malley adjusted to protesters, Sanders tried to barrel through them. ""Whoa, whoa, let me talk about what I came to talk about for a minute,"" he said. Speaking over shouts of ""say her name"" and ""black lives matter,"" Sanders tried to establish his civil rights bona fides. ""Black lives, of course, matter. I spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights and for dignity,"" he said. ""But if you don't want me to be here, that's OK. I don't want to outscream people."" Even if that response was understandable, Sanders only made things worse. When he tried to cite Obamacare as something he's done for people of color, protesters responded with jeers. One woman said, ""We can't afford that!"" When he talked up free college and opportunity for black Americans, a heckler yelled ""Public college won't stop police from killing us!"" In the wake of all of this, O'Malley seemed to get his error. He apologized for using ""all lives matter"" and tried to account for his misstep by interacting with activists. Sanders, by contrast, went silent. He canceled his meetings, canceled an appearance, and sidestepped further questions on the subject. Eventually, he would make a response on Twitter, but not before critics launched a hashtag called #BernieSoBlack mocking the Vermont senator and his most vocal online supporters. Some might want to dismiss the whole fracas as left-wing infighting, with no relevance for any but a small slice of American voters. Or they might dismiss it as New Left narcissism--the kind of identity politics that alienates ordinary Americans. The latter description is flat out wrong; say what you will on the optics of protests, but the fact remains that there is a genuine and serious problem of police violence against minorities, and blacks in particular. As for the former critique, I think this episode was more significant than mere infighting. Regardless of where you stand on the wisdom of the direct action against Sanders and O'Malley, it showed the limits of Sanders' brand of liberal coalition-building, which hinges on the idea that we could ameliorate serious injustice if we just achieve--or move toward--economic justice. It's why he touts college education and affordable health care in response to questions on police discrimination and criminal justice reform. For Black Lives Matter activists, this is almost an insult. To them, racism is orthogonal to class: They're two different dimensions of disadvantage, and to improve the picture on one isn't always to improve the picture for the other. Jim Crow, for instance, coexisted with strong unions, high wages, and an active welfare state. When that heckler said ""Public college won't stop police from killing us,"" that person was right. To combat racism, you have to fight it on its own terms. Moreover, there are times when fighting racism in policing and other areas is necessary for headway on economic justice. Ending ""stop and frisk"" in New York City, for example, lowers the odds young men of color will lose their jobs because of unfair stops. And in Ferguson, Missouri, aggressive policing on small infractions essentially served as an additional tax paid largely by black citizens. An effective and broad-based left has to have answers for anti-racist activists. The question is whether Sanders can see this. Is he adaptable enough to build a new platform that tackles these concerns? Can he include other conversations around fair and affordable housing--and employment--that intersect with anti-racist activism? If he can, then Netroots might stand as a valuable learning experience for the remainder of his campaign. And if he can't--if Sanders is too stubborn to abandon the pitch he's used for decades and adopt one more suited to today--then we may have seen the beginning of the end of Berniemania. (To his credit, it already appears as though Sanders is learning.) As for Hillary Clinton, who avoided the whole kerfuffle? Even with her speeches on criminal justice and voting rights, she still has work to do. Indeed, this might be a more acute area of concern for the former Secretary of State, who stands the best chance at winning the Democratic nomination but needs to rally black Americans to her side if she plans to win a general election. It would be in her interest, and to her advantage, to craft a detailed agenda on police, prison, and criminal justice reform, as well as plans to reduce racial gaps in wealth and unemployment and further enforce anti-discrimination laws. If she pounces in the right way, O'Malley and Sanders' stumbles could be her great gain."	Why Hillary Needs to Take the Black Lives Matter Netroots Fracas Seriously

He doesn't just say conservative things, he has the endurance to back them up under pressure. ""He doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk,"" says Larry Baker at Mutt's BBQ joint, where Walker was wrapping up a one-day visit to South Carolina on Wednesday. He's referring, of course, to Walker's battle against the unions. This is perhaps the most oft-quoted line from voters at Walker's rallies. Fate and weather conspired to put the Wisconsin governor's grit front and center. After announcing his candidacy in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Monday night, Walker woke up at 4 a.m. and headed to Nevada. From there he flew east to South Carolina. Thunderstorms forced his plane to reroute to Memphis, Tennessee. There he waited to be rerouted to Atlanta. Unfortunately, Walker and his family arrived three minutes late for their connecting flight to South Carolina. So they rented cars and drove, arriving in time for Walker's early morning visit in Charleston, South Carolina, to a Harley store. By the time his last event of his daylong South Carolina trip was over, he had been up 36 hours. (Unlike the rest of us, he somehow resisted the urge to chronicle his travel woes on Twitter.) He should have been a baggy, pasty mess. When candidates get tired, their stump speeches lose their connective tissue. They mix up Iran and Iraq. They forget what state they're in. They snap at their staff. Walker didn't do any of these things. His stump speech at the end of the day was almost identical to the one he gave at the start of the day (when he'd already been up for 24 hours). Walker memorized his 30 minute announcement speech Monday night, according to his staff, giving an address that almost exactly matched the pre-released printed copy. The stump speech also seems to have been committed to memory. Even the mannerisms, gestures, and jokes feel like they're traveling a well-worn groove. When Walker speaks it isn't a jazz performance with improvisation and solo flourishes. He doesn't tell any heartbreaking stories or dramatic tales. He doesn't rumble like Gov. Chris Christie or seek to soar like Sen. Marco Rubio. He doesn't have the obvious practiced approach of Sen. Ted Cruz. But that doesn't mean he bores his crowds. Walker is like a local musician who plays a solid version of the old standards. People get up and dance not because he is a virtuoso, but because they like the tunes. ""What a Wonderful World"" is our wedding song! Walker received loud applause more than a dozen times from his overflow crowds in upstate South Carolina. Audiences aren't brought to a crescendo release through oratory, they respond because they seem primed. He presses the buttons--opposition to Common Core, support for voter ID, drug testing for welfare recipients, repealing Obamacare, defunding Planned Parenthood, standing up to Vladimir Putin, and no immigration amnesty--and the crowd responds with big applause. (He doesn't mention same-sex marriage.) Walker's challenges on Wednesday's whirlwind of campaigning came from his comments the day before about the Boy Scouts, where he seemed to suggest the decision to allow gay scout masters would make the boys unsafe. ""I have had a lifelong commitment to the scouts and support the previous membership policy because it protected children and advanced scout values,"" he said. Conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin criticized Walker for gay bashing. In Lexington, South Carolina, on Wednesday morning, he clarified his remarks. ""The protection was not a physical protection,"" he said, but rather about ""protecting them from being involved in the very thing you're talking about right now, the political and media discussion about it, instead of just focusing on what scouts is about, which is about camping and citizenship and things of that nature."" It's not a stunning political achievement for a politician to whip up an eager crowd. People willing to stand in the heat in the middle of the day arrive at the event ready to clap. One man was so eager that he stood for parts of Walker's speech with his hands poised to clap, which gave him the appearance of a wide receiver waiting to be thrown the ball. Still, the response Walker has conjured rivals any I've seen the other candidates receive this season and far surpasses the ones I've seen for Jeb Bush and Christie. And they almost certainly had gotten far more sleep than the man from Wisconsin."	Scott Walker Hits All the Right Buttons in South Carolina
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/scott_walker_announces_his_presidential_campaign_the_wisconsin_governor.html	"WAUKESHA, Wisconsin--Bold was the word of the day at Scott Walker's formal announcement of his presidential campaign.  Repeatedly the word was ladled over the sweltering supporters gathered in a local expo center that took on the close and aromatic aspect of a sweat lodge. Speaker after speaker testified to Walker's boldness before he walked the runway to his place in the middle of the boisterous crowd. The candidate used the word a couple of times himself. But when Walker spoke there was nothing terribly bold about what he said. He supports growth, security, and America. He supports a garden-variety Republican platform--repealing Obamacare, building the Keystone Pipeline, removing regulations, and lowering taxes. There's nothing revolutionary in that set of prescriptions. It's actually less bold than what some of his opponents are offering. But Walker is the boldest Republican candidate running. Anyone can offer ideas and policy proposals. With Walker, GOP voters can easily imagine that he'll follow through. In this modern age of hyperpartisan combat, no one running has consistently succeeded when fighting for conservative principles the way Walker has. Actually fighting and winning conservative fights is what voters are hungry for. That's why Walker used the word ""win"" six times. Where the candidates announce their candidacies tells you about their campaign. Jeb Bush chose Miami Dade College so that the tableau of diverse faces could speak to his effort to expand the Republican Party. Bush has since talked about the makeup of that crowd and how it doesn't look like the typical Republican electorate. Walker's crowd was 99 percent white, and he spoke in Waukesha County, a bright red Republican stronghold. Wisconsin is purple, but Walker has won by making the red parts redder. Unlike Bush, who seeks to be a synthesis candidate reaching out to new constituencies, Walker's promise to Republicans hungry for a presidential win is that he'll amp up conservative turnout. Walker never mentioned same-sex marriage, and he only quickly referred to abortion, but his pitch had echoes of what you would expect from a culture warrior. He is the one who not only beats liberals, but puts them in their place. The audience cheered most loudly when he mentioned requiring a photo ID to vote, a concealed-carry handgun law that he had passed, and one establishing the castle doctrine. Those are policy positions, but they are also fault lines with liberals. The crowd wasn't just rooting for Walker; they were rooting for a vision of America where the advancing liberals are vanquished. In the video montage that played before Walker appeared in his casual-Friday shirtsleeves, liberals like Ed Shultz and Rachel Maddow were shown despondent that Walker had survived the recall election so easily. Walker's recall was presented not just as a victory for him but the moment ""when America, got her voice back,"" as one speaker put it. If there's one candidate Walker is aiming at with all of his talk of winning, it's Sen. Ted Cruz. Walker and Cruz are the two best-funded competitors running to be the conservative standard-bearer. Walker's argument is that while Cruz may talk a good game, he has no concrete accomplishments. Walker made an unmistakable reference to Cruz in his announcement video. ""In the Republican field there are some who are good fighters, but they haven't won those battles,"" he says. ""There are others who've won elections, but haven't consistently taken on the big fights. We've shown you can do both."" Voters usually make their choices in primary campaigns based on two criteria: whether a candidate has the right ideological positions and whether he can get elected. Usually voters have to give up on one criterion. Walker argues that this time they can have it all. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Scott Walker Wants to be the GOP's Bold, Safe Choice
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/scott_walker_s_experience_as_wisconsin_s_governor_isn_t_great_preparation.html	"After six months of speeches, fundraisers, and cattle calls, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is making it official: He's running for president. Unlike most other candidates in this overstuffed melee of a nomination fight--thus far, there are 15 formal candidates for the GOP crown--Walker is a candidate to beat, and perhaps the candidate to beat. Like Ted Cruz or Mike Huckabee, Walker appeals to conservative Republicans. But his vehicle is action, not petty outrage or high-wire antics: With every successful fight against liberal interest groups--from unions to academics--he wins more acclaim from the right's rank and file. At the same time, his restrained rhetoric and cautious demeanor gives him an opening with Republican elites, who want a strong--but measured--nominee. Add his fundraising prowess to the mix and you have a base-driven candidate with ""establishment"" bona fides who doesn't alienate the other factions of the Republican Party--a potent profile for a presidential hopeful. In terms of stagecraft, the most important fact about Walker is his affable, if boring, presentation. Despite his right-wing views on everything under the sun--from worker's rights and economic regulation to climate change and voter access--he seems like an ordinary accountant or middle-manager who just wants to put a few things in order. And to bolster that image, Walker touts his ""everyman"" bona fides--his reliance on the Kohl's department store for clothing and other everyday items--and stresses his experience in the Wisconsin governor's mansion. For Walker, there's nothing he might face as president that doesn't have an analogue in Madison's statehouse. When asked how he'd handle ISIS, for example, Walker told an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February that if he can ""take on 100,000 protesters""--a nod to the 2012 recall election--he can ""do the same across the globe."" Indeed, he's all but summarized his pitch to Republican voters--and the nation writ large--with a single line: ""Governors,"" he said in a 2014 interview, ""make much better presidents than members of Congress."" Unfortunately for Walker, it's not clear that the GOP public agrees. Of the past six Republican presidential nominees--Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney--three were governors, and three were lawmakers of one shape or another. Likewise, it's also unclear if this assertion--key to Walker's general pitch--is true, period. Since the end of World War II, we've had 12 presidents. Four were governors before entering the White House (Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush), two were senators (John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama), four were vice presidents (Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush), and two had unusual pre-election backgrounds: Dwight Eisenhower was a general, and Gerald Ford was House minority leader turned replacement vice president turned incumbent after Nixon's resignation. It would be one thing if the governors had stellar records and their peers were less successful. But the truth is that we're looking at a collection of mixed records. Among the gubernatorial presidents, neither Carter nor Bush had successful presidencies, at least judged in political terms: Carter blundered through four years and lost re-election, while Bush led the country into two wars and an economic crisis, nearly crippling the GOP in the process. On the other side, Reagan and Clinton had considerable political success but mixed records of terrible inaction and foolhardy changes to the status quo (although Reagan stands as one of the most substantively conservative presidents of the postwar period). The senators, likewise, have mixed records. Despite his huge presence in America's political mythology, Kennedy was a middling president whose stature owes more to his sudden death than it does to any actual accomplishment. It's still too early to judge Obama's administration, but at the moment, it's fair to say that he's been a consequential steward of the United States, shepherding the nation through a global recession, a large expansion of the federal government, demographic changes, and seismic shifts to American cultural life. It seems obvious, but if there's any experience with a clear connection to presidential success, it's vice presidential experience. Even the worst-off vice presidents--estranged from their presidents and burdened with trivial responsibilities--gain valuable skills from their experience in close proximity to the Oval Office. They build strong political networks, hone their ability to speak to large crowds, and most importantly learn to engage and operate in the federal bureaucracy. The least glamorous part of the presidency is the bureaucracy; a given White House is responsible for staffing thousands of positions across every department of the federal government. At the same time, however, this is vital to the effective exercise of presidential power. A president who isn't able to exert his will through the bureaucracy is a president who is hamstrung in his ability to make policy and potentially vulnerable to mistakes, missteps, and disasters in those federal agencies. The catastrophe of healthcare.gov--which wounded the Affordable Care Act at a critical moment--is a perfect example of the perils of a weak hold on the bureaucracy. (Obama, in fact, has been unusually bad at using and utilizing bureaucratic power.) What's striking about the presidents with vice presidential pedigree (and Eisenhower, for that matter, who served at the highest summit of the military bureaucracy) is that they were highly effective with bureaucratic levers as well as political and congressional ones. It is a consistent fact of their administrations in a way that isn't true of every president with gubernatorial experience (George W. Bush is the possible exception). Johnson entrenched his Great Society and civil rights reforms with agencies devoted to accomplishing these goals; Nixon defused political opponents by co-opting them and their goals into his administration; and George H.W. Bush entrenched conservative priorities at the judicial level of American government, appointing more judges in a single term than any president other than Franklin Roosevelt. To get back to Walker, there's nothing about his experience as governor that makes him plainly superior to his competitors from the Senate and elsewhere. In fact, he may have the one glaring weakness of governors-turned-presidential candidates: micromanagement. On Saturday, the New York Times described a Walker who has ""long been his own strategist,"" who thinks like a ""political operative,"" and who has a tendency to ""play consultant."" In the context of state governance and state campaigns, the hands-on approach can work well. But at the national level, it can lead to big missteps and larger mistakes. Just ask Jimmy Carter. Or Michael Dukakis. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Being Governor Doesn't Prepare Scott Walker for the Presidency
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/donald_trump_mexican_immigrant_comments_american_society_has_failed_hispanic.html	"Over the past week or so, Donald Trump's claim that Mexican immigrants commit violent crimes in large numbers has been thoroughly debunked. If anything, we have good reason to believe that Mexican immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than native-born Americans. But while Mexican immigrants aren't the menace that Trump imagines them to be, there is another threat to our society that has been almost entirely ignored: the threat that America poses to immigrants and their children. Consider the extraordinary fact that while immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born Americans, their children commit crimes at rates that are virtually indistinguishable from other native-born Americans. Why are we seeing such a sharp increase in criminal activity from one generation to the next? In an article published in Crime & Delinquency in 2014, the sociologists Alex Piquero, Bianca Bersani, Thomas Loughran, and Jeffrey Fagan offer a number of possibilities. It could simply be that immigrants fear the consequences of law-breaking more than their native-born children. For unauthorized immigrants in particular, criminal activity might lead not just to punishment, but to deportation. Another explanation is that while immigrants tend to trust the American criminal justice system, which they see as more trustworthy than the authorities back home, their children are more cynical. I would argue that they are more cynical for a good reason. In The Collapse of American Criminal Justice, William Stuntz argued that the 14th Amendment guarantee of ""equal protection of the laws"" ought to be taken literally, as it was for a brief period during the Reconstruction era. To Stuntz, this phrase meant that all citizens, regardless of race or economic status, had the same right to the law's protection. In his view, the concentration of violent crime in a handful of urban neighborhoods ought to be understood as not just a regrettable policy failure, but as a constitutional violation that governments at all levels should be forced to address. That is not the world we live in. The fact that some Americans enjoy greater protection from violent crime than others is taken for granted. So what might this mean for second-generation Americans, and particularly for Hispanics? Recently, Robert VerBruggen of RealClearPolicy drew on Justice Department data to offer an analysis of crime rates across ethnic groups. He found that while Hispanics commit crimes at a rate 30 percent higher than non-Hispanic whites, some of this discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the Hispanic population is younger than the white population, and the young commit crimes at a higher rate than the old. (It is also worth noting that almost half of Hispanic adults are foreign-born, and that this statistic captures all Hispanics, whether foreign- or native-born.) Yet VerBruggen also observed that Hispanics are twice as likely to be murdered as whites, and they are far more likely to be shot. Given that many Latin American immigrants come from very violent homelands, it is entirely possible that their offspring are safer here by virtue of having been raised in the United States. Nevertheless, their physical safety is at far greater risk than that of white Americans. This inequality of physical safety has larger consequences: Young men living in violent neighborhoods often have an adversarial relationship with the police, who crack down on petty infractions even as homicides routinely go unpunished. When people do not enjoy the law's protection, they are likely to grow cynical about the law. If a person believes that law enforcement authorities are fair and impartial in their dealings with the community, he will be far more likely to cooperate with them. If he perceives the authorities to be callous, indifferent, or indeed hostile, he will be far more inclined to commit crime. As Mark A.R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at NYU, has argued, ""[l]iving in chaos makes people more present-oriented and less averse to risk, two characteristics that make crime, with its immediate and certain gains and its deferred and uncertain losses, appear more attractive."" That seems to be at least part of what's happening with the children of immigrants living in dangerous environments. The Mexican immigrants Donald Trump so blithely condemns settle in this country with a sense of hope and purpose. Their children, particularly those raised in disadvantaged neighborhoods by virtue of the fact that their parents aren't in a position to command middle-class incomes, grow up with a much bleaker perspective on the American Dream. Merely growing up on American soil is enough to ensure that second-generation Americans earn more and spend more time in school than their immigrant parents. But economic progress for Mexican-Americans seems to stall from the second to the third generation. Could this reflect the fact that while immigrants are grateful for the opportunity to live in America, their children and grandchildren have a less romantic sense of what it means to grow up on the bottom rungs of our society? I suspect that the answer is yes. Different people will draw different conclusions from the fact that the children of immigrants commit crimes at a much higher rate than their parents. My own view is that it serves as a reminder that immigration policy is about more than immigrants: It is also about the children of immigrants, and whether we as a country are willing to do what it takes to ensure that they will become full participants in our society."	Mexican Immigrants Pose No Threat to America. But America Poses a Threat to Its Immigrants.
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/republicans_can_still_win_on_gay_marriage_the_gop_should_go_back_to_being.html	"For two weeks, Republicans have been moaning about Obergefell v. Hodges, the June 26 Supreme Court decision that declared gay marriage a constitutional right. Even presidential candidates who claim to represent the party's next generation are pledging to continue the fight. Sen. Marco Rubio says marriage ""should be between one man and one woman."" Gov. Scott Walker wants a constitutional amendment to overturn the court's ruling. Sen. Ted Cruz says Republicans should campaign against the court, because its decision is ""radically out of step with public opinion."" These men are leading the GOP in the wrong direction. There's a simpler, saner way for Republicans to regain their footing on social issues. Go back to being the party of lifestyle conservatism: marriage, parenthood, community, faith, commitment, self-discipline, and social order. Recognize same-sex marriage as part of that tradition. Now that the fight for ""marriage equality"" has been won, the next fight is about what that victory means. Are we welcoming same-sex couples, like different-race couples, to an enduring institution? Or are we rethinking the rules of marriage and its place in society? That's a debate to which social conservatives should contribute. And it's a fight the GOP can win. Republicans are right to worry about redefining marriage. But their decision to draw the line at sexual orientation was a profound mistake. They thought homosexuality was a lifestyle. In reality, the only lifestyle at stake is marriage itself. By locking gay people out of that institution, Republicans disserved their party's mission: a well-ordered society. And by asserting that there was no logical stopping point between homosexuality, polygamy, and infidelity, the right helped the left. Today Republicans find themselves in a de facto alliance with people who want to eliminate all discrimination among family structures. Some social liberals are claiming that if you support marriage equality for same-sex couples, you have to support it for multiple partners as well. Some right-wing groups agree. Both sides want to make Americans choose between lifestyle liberalism and rolling back gay marriage. That's where a younger, wiser generation of Republicans needs to step in. They must break the link between same-sex marriage and lifestyle liberalism. Not all family structures are equal. Divorce, single parenthood, and promiscuity are real problems. So is the replacement of marriage by cohabitation or domestic partnership. To be heard on those issues, Republicans have to build a middle ground in which Obergefell is welcomed and understood, not as a gateway to equal recognition and benefits regardless of how you live, but as an affirmation of marriage. In the short term, this will be hard. Republicans will have to admit that they were wrong. But in exchange, they'll be freed to fight for their values. And whatever support they lose on the right will be offset by a fresh appeal to the center. The public is ready for this message. That's the silver lining in the GOP's defeat on gay marriage: The fact that Republicans misunderstood the issue means that they never lost what was important. Americans didn't sign up for lifestyle liberalism or for dissolving the meaning of matrimony. If you study polls, you'll see what really happened: People embraced same-sex marriage not because they saw homosexuality as a matter of personal choice, but because they didn't. In 2004, 37 percent of respondents in a Gallup poll said homosexuality was ""something a person is born with."" Forty-one percent said it was ""due to factors such as upbringing and environment."" Since then, the numbers have reversed. Two months ago, 51 percent of respondents told Gallup that gay or lesbian orientation was inborn; only 30 percent attributed it to upbringing or environment. If you focus on the set of respondents in Gallup's samples who say that homosexuality is environmentally influenced, you'll find that they're more sympathetic to gay marriage, on average, than they were 11 years ago. But you'll also find that the percentage of Americans who think homosexuality is environmentally influenced, and who nonetheless support gay marriage, has increased by only 1 point. By contrast, the percentage of Americans who think homosexuality is inborn, and who also support gay marriage, has increased by 20 points. Gallup's question isn't ideal, because people who attribute homosexuality to ""upbringing and environment"" don't necessarily think it's immutable. The Pew Research Center has a question that nails this down: ""Do you think a gay or lesbian person's sexual orientation can be changed or cannot be changed?"" In 2003, Pew's respondents were evenly divided on this question. Since then, the numbers have diverged. In surveys taken in 2006, 2012, and 2015, the percentage who said orientation could be changed steadily declined, from 42 to 39 to 36 to 33. Meanwhile, the percentage who said orientation couldn't be changed steadily grew, from 42 to 49 to 51 to 60. Support for same-sex marriage has risen in both categories. But overall, the percentage of Americans who think homosexuality can be changed, and who support gay marriage, is only 3 points higher than it was in 2003. The remainder of the national increase in support for gay marriage--more than 23 percentage points--is attributable to people who think homosexuality can't be changed. The best way to get at lifestyle liberalism is to ask about homosexuality as a choice. The only survey I've found that has posed this question consistently over time is the ABC News/Washington Post poll. In 1994 the poll asked: ""Do you think being homosexual is something that people choose to be, or do you think it's just the way they are?"" From 1994 to 2004 to 2014, the percentage of respondents who said homosexuality was a choice fell from 40 to 33 to 25. Meanwhile, the percentage who said it was ""just the way they are"" rose from 49 to 57 to 65. In these surveys, people who say homosexuality is a choice are no more supportive of gay marriage today than they were two decades ago. In 1994, 25 percent of these respondents said ""homosexuals should ... have equal rights to marry one another."" In 2014, only 23 percent said yes to a more sympathetic version of the question: ""allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally."" Overall, the percentage of ABC/Post respondents who think homosexuality is a choice and endorse same-sex marriage is 4 points lower than it was in 1994. Together, these polls make a strong case that lifestyle liberalism has not driven the massive surge in public support for gay marriage. Instead, many Americans have decided that homosexuality is an immutable trait, and they have adjusted their views accordingly. If homosexuality isn't a choice, it can't be a sin. We can't make gay people straight, but we can let them marry. That doesn't mean lifestyle liberalism hasn't been spreading. It has. If you look at Gallup's table of attitudes on moral acceptability over the last 14 years, you'll see a 16-point increase in acceptance of ""having a baby outside of marriage,"" a 15-point increase for ""sex between an unmarried man and woman,"" a 12-point increase for divorce, and a 9-point increase for polygamy. But nothing matches the 23-point increase on ""gay or lesbian relations"" or the 25-point increase on same-sex marriage. To find a question on which the public has moved as dramatically as it has on same-sex marriage, you have to scroll down the page to this one: ""Do you approve or disapprove of marriage between blacks and whites?"" On that question, public support has risen by 22 points since 2002. The magnitude of the shift on gay marriage mirrors the magnitude of the shift on interracial marriage, perhaps because Americans are coming to believe that sexual orientation is more like the color of your skin than like the content of your character. I'm not a big fan of using the government to reward or punish sexual behavior. It's a clumsy tool, and when the rules it applies are equally clumsy, it does more harm than good. But lifestyle liberalism can also do a lot of damage. It can overrun and erode moral institutions. We need a party that speaks that truth. Republicans should be that party. They just need to catch up to the rest of us. Read more of Slate's coverage of same-sex marriage at the Supreme Court."	How Republicans Can Still Make Gay Marriage a Winning Issue
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/hillary_clinton_doesn_t_like_legitimate_questions_about_her_private_email.html	"On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton talked to CNN's Brianna Keilar for her first national interview as a 2016 presidential candidate. The Democratic front-runner addressed some of the questions surrounding her use of a private server to house her State Department emails while she was secretary of state. The conversation wasn't about the content of those emails as much as whether Clinton's special ad hoc system for storing her emails--and her previous explanations about what messages she shared and what messages she deleted--were at the root of voters' distrust of her. Clinton's answers won't put questions about her trustworthiness to rest. She said the issue of the emails ""is being blown up with no basis in law or fact."" Whether it is being blown up depends on whether you think her original decision to set up her own private server is a serious breach or not. But leaving that question aside, there's no doubt that there is a sound basis for the questions being asked of Clinton. Take a look at the fine print. According to the 2009 National Archives and Records Administration regulations in effect when Clinton was in office, ""Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record-keeping system."" That regulation does allow for storage on private servers. Clinton says she made a practice of emailing officials on their official email accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured by the government's servers. Maybe, but this was her own system and it didn't meet the standard of ""appropriate agency record-keeping system,"" which is why when the State Department tried to complete document requests, they missed the emails held on Clinton's private server. While other officials have used private email accounts in the past, no one used them exclusively as Clinton did. The substantive reason this matters is that congressional investigators want to know if they really have access to all of the former secretary of state's emails. As a matter of trust, voters have to determine whether Clinton's claim to CNN that there's nothing to see here matches her bespoke practice, which was outside the boundaries of rules and custom. Since Clinton acted as the judge of what should be turned over and what shouldn't, it's legitimate to ask whether the standard she used for deleting or passing on emails meets the spirit of the rules. The spirit of the rules was to keep all correspondence related to the job. That's why the presumption is that employee records are automatically retained and personal email accounts in which official business is conducted happens less frequently. Clinton's arrangement was the opposite. At her press conference addressing her online habits in March, Clinton said that in deciding which emails to turn over she wanted to ""err on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work related."" She wasn't just being careful, she said, she was being extra careful. ""Out of an abundance of caution and care, you know, we wanted to send that message unequivocally."" She reiterated that claim this week: ""I turned over everything that I could imagine."" But we know that some of her emails were not turned over to the State Department. Those were work related it would seem. Either that, or her definition of ""work related"" has some expanse in it. However, there's also evidence that Clinton's definition of ""work related"" was too constricted. More than 1,200 emails were returned by the State Department for being too personal. This is just the kind of confusion that the government's retention system requirements were set up to minimize. Clinton also said in her CNN interview that she ""didn't have to turn over anything"" and ""[she] chose to turn over 55,000 pages because [she] wanted to go above and beyond what was expected of [her]."" Later, she repeated that she had ""no obligation"" to turn over her emails to the State Department. That isn't true. It leaves the impression that since handing over the emails was completely voluntary, the candidate can't fall short of any standard. But as Secretary Clinton said in her first press conference about this issue in March, she did have an obligation to turn over the emails. ""That was my obligation,"" she said of turning over the emails. ""I fully fulfilled it."" It was not only State Department practice that employees were to keep their emails in the system, the State Department also made a special request of all former secretaries of state after Clinton left. She could not deny that request. The public may not care about Clinton's email server.

Not Howard Dean, but not Dennis Kucinich, either. During the past week, however, the Vermont senator has become a bona fide phenomenon. Take last week, when the self-described socialist spoke to a packed arena in Madison, Wisconsin, detailing his plans to break up Wall Street and pass universal health care. At 10,000 people, his crowd was the largest of any candidate in the presidential race so far: Hillary Clinton drew 5,500 people to her speech on Roosevelt Island in New York City, while Jeb Bush drew just 3,000 people to his announcement event at Miami Dade College in Florida. (Sen. Ted Cruz spoke to 11,000 students at Liberty University, but they had to be there--Cruz announced at the school's convocation, which is mandatory for students living on campus.) Before Madison, Sanders spoke to a packed auditorium of 700 people in Iowa, and before that, he spoke to 5,000 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After the crowds, there's the polls. In the vital primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders takes 33 percent and 31 percent, respectively. He's far from ahead--Clinton has 52 percent and 51 percent--but it's a strong showing nonetheless. And after the polls, there's the cash. Since joining the Democratic race in April, Sanders has raised $15 million from nearly 250,000 donors, compared with Clinton's haul of $45 million. For comparison's sake, that's more than Sanders has raised in either of his two Senate campaigns combined, and just $7 million short of all the cash Sanders has raised in his entire career as a politician, from 1989 to the present. In just a few months, Sanders has moved from the periphery of American politics to the mainstream, as the most visible and popular alternative to Clinton, vastly outpacing former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who recently announced his candidacy. But visibility isn't viability, and there's almost no chance Sanders will become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, even if he sustains his momentum into next year. Despite the polls and the voting, presidential primaries aren't popularity contests. Instead, they're closer to negotiations, where interests and individuals work to choose a leader and representative for the entire group. That person has to appeal to everyone, from ideological factions and political power centers to wealthy donors and ordinary voters and activists. The candidate also has to show that he or she can do the work of a national campaign, from winning debates to raising money. Clinton has done this. She came close to winning the 2008 nomination and spent the next seven years--right up to the present--building her stature in Democratic politics. A moderate liberal committed to most of Barack Obama's domestic and foreign policy agenda, she's acceptable to almost everyone in the party--in a national poll of the Democratic field from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, she has a whopping 75 percent of the vote. Which brings us back to Bernie. Sanders is a fascinating candidate with a vital, underrepresented message in American politics. But the same qualities that make him unique--relative independence from the Democratic Party, a foundational critique of American politics--make him unsuited for a major party nomination, much less the Democratic one. The more moderate and conservative parts of the Democratic coalition won't support a left-wing candidate like Sanders, and the more strategic voters--party stalwarts like black Americans--will be skeptical that Sanders could win the White House, even if they agree with his ideas and policies. To appeal to the party overall, and not just an ideological faction, Sanders would have to tailor himself to the priorities of the Democratic coalition beyond its most liberal members. But the cost of that change is to shed the things that make him unique. And Sanders knows it. It's why he won't engage in traditional fundraising--it's hard to speak truth to power when you're catering to millionaire fundraisers. Obama could beat Clinton and win the nomination because, in every crucial respect, he was a conventional Democrat with strong ties to the party establishment. He could capitalize on anti-Clinton discontent, tap into elite networks of activists and donors, and show stalwart voters--and blacks in particular--that he was a realistic and viable alternative to the Clinton candidacy. So, when he won the Iowa caucus, he had more than the momentum of victory--he had the support of a crucial bloc of the Democratic Party.* Sanders, for all of his present success, doesn't have that. If he wins the Iowa caucus, he won't have the allies--or the institutional resources--to turn a victory into a viable national strategy. Put differently, if Clinton lost the Iowa caucus, then--as one Democratic strategist told the New York Times--her team would just ""ride out the punditry and people with their hair on fire"" and capture the nomination. With the establishment on your side, you can lose and still win. Sanders won't be the Democratic nominee. But that doesn't mean he won't be important. Here, it's useful to think of Ron Paul, the former Republican representative who ran for the GOP nomination in 2008 and 2012. Paul drew large crowds and raised huge sums for his campaign but couldn't translate that success into votes. Nonetheless, his splash mattered. He helped bridge the divide between libertarians and the Republican right, and he inspired a new group of conservative and libertarian activists who have made a mark in the GOP through Paul's son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. If Sanders can sustain and capture the left-wing enthusiasm for his campaign, he could do the same for progressives. He could bring their issues onto a presidential debate stage and into the Democratic mainstream, and bring them into the process itself. No, Democrats won't change overnight, but with time and effort, the Sanders revolution could bear real fruit. See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign.

Chris Christie has launched a ""telling it like it is"" campaign for president. It's his theme. ""I mean what I say, and I say what I mean, and that's what America needs right now,"" he says. The appeal of such a campaign is obvious. Voters are fed up with politicians who ladle out small doses of pap. Christie is presenting himself as an antidote to the voluminous and meaningless talking points. But here's the problem with such a campaign: Embedded in the boast is the undoing of the boast. Regardless of what you think of Christie or his policies, any politician who says he is telling you the truth is almost certainly engaging in a deception. When you ""tell it like it is,"" you are suggesting that you're unimpeded by spin, calculation, or narrative creation--all the things that make other politicians lesser beings. But (in truth) you're making a calculated pitch to seem like you're not calculating, which is a claim that eats itself. Secondly, ""telling it like it is"" suggests that you're breaking new grounds of candor--it raises the bar beyond merely telling the truth. You're saying things that stop the conversation. For example, a traditional politician would say, ""We are working to encourage our coalition partners in Iraq."" A candid politician would say, ""The Iraqi army is a mess."" A politician telling it like it is would say, ""We're putting American lives at risk for a failed strategy in an ungovernable country."" Perhaps this is what Christie is going to offer, though that's unlikely. He has offered some policy proposals about modifying Social Security that have caused his opponents to criticize him, but that is more of a sign of the emptiness of political debate, not unprecedented candor. So it's more precise to say that Christie is ""telling it like it is (by today's standards)."" Christie may not be truth teller and may still be more candid than his opponents. For those taking a candor reading at home when determining their vote, you'll have to decide how much to deduct for using candor as a stratagem (rather than using candor as a way to deliver a deeper truth). You may also want to weigh that Christie is also using candor as a way to soften the criticisms against him. I've spoken to voters who worry about his temperament and his tendency to bully those who disagree with him. Christie's defense against these charges is that if he's a little brusque it's just in the service of that noble goal of ""telling it like it is."" The lure of authenticity and truth telling is embedded in the history of the presidency. The story of George Washington coming clean about chopping down the cherry tree wasn't true, but it told us something about what we wanted to see in a president. After Watergate, Jimmy Carter repeatedly promised the country on the campaign trail, ""I will never lie to you."" Sen. John McCain called his campaign bus the Straight Talk Express. As a candidate, Barack Obama promised in 2008 that he was telling hard truths, but he never really told that many. Part of Sen. Bernie Sanders' appeal among voters is that he isn't scripted and says things voters have longed to hear. All these candid candidates are trying to approximate President Truman. In the election of 1948, Truman embarked on an extemporaneous speaking style that was new for him, and it delighted the press and some in his audience. He trained a lot of his fire at Republicans, but he also gave it to the voters right in the kisser. ""If you send another Republican Congress to Washington, you're a bigger bunch of suckers than I think you are,"" Truman told voters. ""Two-thirds of you stayed home in 1946 and look at what Congress we got! That is your fault, that is your fault!"" He didn't just do this regularly during his 33-day whistle-stop train tour, he did it at the Democratic convention when he accepted the nomination. ""If farmers don't do their duty by the Democratic Party, they are the most ungrateful people in the world! ... I say to labor what I have said to the farmers; they are the most ungrateful people in the world if they pass the Democratic Party by this year."" It's hard to imagine any politician saying anything remotely that abrasive about voters he wanted to vote for him. Well, that's not exactly right. Donald Trump, it would seem, has that kind of free expression in him. He appears to be engaged in a kind of candor experiment with the purpose of unwinding his business relationships. Univision, NBC, Macy's, and Serta have cut their ties with him after his remarks about Mexicans. What would Christie say about Trump? That's a real test of whether a politician can tell it like it is."	"Why Christie's Campaign to ""Tell It Like It Is"" Isn't the Whole Truth"
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/chris_christie_presidential_announcement_why_he_should_have_run_in_2012.html	"With his announcement Tuesday to a gymnasium full of supporters in the Livingston, New Jersey, high school he once attended, Chris Christie is the 14th Republican to enter the presidential race. Americans, he said Tuesday, are ""filled with anxiety"" that can be ""swept away by strong leadership and decisiveness to lead America again."" But with 3.3 percent support, he is near the bottom of the polls. Worse, he's hit rock bottom among New Jersey residents, with the lowest approval ratings of his career, battling a still-beating scandal over lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. But, for all his troubles, Christie isn't Carly Fiorina or Ben Carson; he's a sitting governor with mainstream conservative views. That is to say, he's a viable candidate with legitimate odds for success. And in a world where his direct competitors--Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, John Kasich, and especially Jeb Bush--stumble out of the gate in January 2016, he could win. That world, however, is likely not this one. Christie's prospects have changed sharply from three years ago. Then, Christie was the strongest commodity in the Republican Party. Uncompromising and pugnacious, he fought pitched battles against public sector unions before Scott Walker had ever touched the national stage. He killed a stimulus project and won conservative fame for his town hall performances--posted to YouTube--where millions watched his passionate attacks on teachers and other public workers who opposed his benefit cuts and anti-union policies. By early 2011, top Republican donors were begging Christie to enter the race. They wanted a credible and exciting alternative to the milquetoast Mitt Romney and his lackluster challengers. Christie refused. ""You don't make a decision to run for president of the United States based on impulse. I don't feel ready in my heart to be president,"" he explained in an April interview with Diane Sawyer. ""Unless I do, I don't have any right offering myself to the people of this country. It's much too big a job. And so you have to first feel in your heart that you're ready and that you want it more than anything else."" The question came again in the fall, as Herman Cain rose--and the GOP primary collapsed into farce. Donors, activists, and ordinary voters were desperate for a new candidate, terrified that Barack Obama would win a second term. ""I mean this with all my heart,"" said one audience member, pleading with Christie to join the race after he gave a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. ""We need you. Your country needs you to run for president."" ""I hear exactly what you're saying and I feel the passion with which you say it, and it touches me,"" Christie replied. ""I'm just a kid from Jersey who feels like he's the luckiest guy in the world to have the opportunity that I have to be the governor of my state."" We'll see how Christie's story ends. But thus far, it illustrates an important rule--perhaps the only real rule--of presidential politics: If you have a shot, you should take it. The United States has an endless supply of people who want to be president; by waiting, you up the odds that one of them will get in your way, or surpass you entirely. The classic example is the popular former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who sat out of the 1988 presidential race and considered the '92 one, only to lose his momentum to a younger face. Even if you stay ascendant or at least relevant, you have to deal with the damage that inevitably comes with tenure in public office. The longer you're governor, the more chances you have to disappoint your constituents, court a scandal, or just get stuck in the inevitable, everyday grumpiness of governing. A Chris Christie who jumps into the race in 2011 is a Chris Christie who never has to deal with Bridgegate. The same goes, in fact, for Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who also sat out the 2012 race. No, there wasn't a groundswell of support for his candidacy, but he was a well-liked governor with the kinds of credentials that lend themselves to a presidential race. He could have done well, or at least laid groundwork for a future run. Instead, like Christie, he's stepped into a crowded field tarnished by years of uneven governing, with nothing to set him apart from the pack and a host of scandals at his heels. It's tempting to treat Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as an example of this as well, but Ryan took his chance when it came--he joined Mitt Romney's presidential ticket. After losing, however, he made a retreat back to congressional politics, where he's thrived. If you want to know what it looks like when you take the jump and succeed, you need only look as far as the White House. By traditional measures of qualifications, Barack Obama had no business in the 2008 Democratic primary. But, a sitting senator, he had sufficient support from Democratic elites, a powerful public presence, and the skills to raise a lot of money. He had the opportunity, and he took the shot. It's this dynamic, incidentally, that makes Florida Sen. Marco Rubio so interesting to watch. He is a man in a hurry, and like Obama, he won't let his youth and inexperience get in the way of his ambition. If there's a reason to bet on his bid, it's that for all of his mistakes, he's politically fearless in a way his opponents can't match. And that matters. Running for president is difficult, grueling, and often thankless work. And for a fresh-faced official like Christie was in 2011 or Rubio is now, it comes with serious risks: If you fail, you won't just hurt your ""brand,"" you'll look vulnerable to opponents and lose valuable political capital, as voters--and even allies--see you as a climber, uninterested in the job voters chose you for. The things you wanted to do as a lawmaker or an executive might go by the wayside. But that's a sacrifice you make if you want to be president. In 2011, the party--or at least, some of its most powerful members--wanted Christie. He could have been a contender. He could have won the nomination. He could have been president. Now, he's fighting from low ground, against strong opponents with wide support in the Republican Party. Plenty of conservatives like Chris Christie, but no one needs him, and that's why he'll almost certainly fail."	Never Wait to Run for President: The Chris Christie Story

Many of them, running for president or aspiring to leadership roles in Congress, are trying to block the nuclear deal with Iran. This would be a good time for these leaders to show that they're ready for the responsibilities of national security and foreign policy. Instead, they're showing the opposite. Over the past several days, congressional hearings on the deal have become a spectacle of dishonesty, incomprehension, and inability to cope with the challenges of a multilateral world. When the hearings began more than a week ago, I was planning to write about the testimony of Secretary of State John Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. But the more I watched, the more I saw that the danger in the room wasn't coming from the deal or its administration proponents. It was coming from the interrogators. In challenging Kerry and Moniz, Republican senators and representatives offered no serious alternative. They misrepresented testimony, dismissed contrary evidence, and substituted vitriol for analysis. They seemed baffled by the idea of having to work and negotiate with other countries. I came away from the hearings dismayed by what the GOP has become in the Obama era. It seems utterly unprepared to govern. If you didn't have time to watch the 11 hours of hearings conducted on July 23, July 28, and July 29, consider yourself lucky. Here are the lowlights of what you missed. 1. North Korea. In all three hearings, Kerry explained how the inspection and verification measures in the Iran deal are designed to rectify flaws that led to the failure of the North Korean nuclear agreement. He spent much of his opening statement outlining these differences. This made no impression. When the Senate held its next hearing a week later, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presiding Republican, dismissed the Iran agreement with a quip: ""How did that North Korean deal work out for you?"" 2. Israel. As evidence that the Iran deal is bad, Republicans point to criticism from Israel. But they seem more interested in the rhetoric of Israeli politicians than in the judgments of Israeli security experts. At the July 23 hearing, Kerry read from an article that quoted supportive statements about the deal from the former leaders of two Israeli intelligence agencies. Republicans batted the quotes away. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming scoffed, ""That wasn't even in the newspaper. That was a blog post."" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina dismissed the statements as irrelevant because they didn't come from elected officials. Why listen to experts when you can rely instead on quotes from politicians? 3. The IAEA's ""secret deal."" Kerry and Moniz have repeatedly explained that the International Atomic Energy Agency, which enforces nuclear conduct agreements, publicly evaluates each country's compliance but keeps some details about inspection logistics private. The IAEA briefs other governments about its procedures but doesn't give them the logistical documents. Republicans, having shrugged at this policy for decades, are suddenly outraged. Many of them seem to think the Obama administration is colluding with Iran and the IAEA. They claim that Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, has seen the IAEA's Iran documents but won't show them to Congress. In the House hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Ted Poe of Texas asserted that Rice ""said that she has seen this deal with the IAEA."" Kerry corrected him: ""Susan Rice's quote is, 'We know their contents, and we're satisfied with them. We will share the contents of those briefings in full and classified sessions with Congress.' She has not seen them. She has been briefed on them."" Kerry's clarification should have settled the matter. But it didn't. The next day, Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma grilled Kerry:"	The Iran Hearings Prove It: The Republican Party Can No Longer Be Trusted With the Presidency
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/interstate_highway_system_how_to_fix_a_broken_expensive_harmful_system.html	"I hate the Interstate Highway System. I realize that this is an awkward time to bring this up. Many of you are no doubt planning road trips, and I'm sure you're grateful for the fact that you do not have to traverse dirt roads in your Conestoga wagon en route to the Grand Canyon. Though I don't know how to drive myself, I can absolutely see the appeal of barreling down the highway at top speed, singing along to Top 40 radio between bites of my delicious egg and cheese biscuit taco. I don't begrudge you your love of the interstate, nor would I dream of dynamiting it into oblivion. Now that we have these wildly expensive marvels of modern engineering, we shouldn't allow them to crumble, to the point where only Imperator Furiosa and Mad Max would have the guts to drive them. But we have to do something about the interstate highways, because as things stand, crumbling highways are exactly what we're going to get. In case you've missed the latest highway news, the Senate and the House have been battling it out over which idiotic short-term fix we ought to settle for in order to keep federal highway funding flowing for the next few months or the next few years. One group of lawmakers, led by Sens. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, and Barbara Boxer, D-California, has devised a grab bag of revenue-raisers, from selling off oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to hiking various custom fees to funky maneuvers involving the Federal Reserve that I won't even pretend to understand. This deal, backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, would have financed the highways for the next three years. Another group, led by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wants to link highway funding to a broader overhaul of corporate taxes, with an eye toward encouraging U.S. multinationals to bring profits back home from their foreign subsidiaries. For now, however, Republicans in both chambers appear to have coalesced around a short-term solution that will fund the highways for the next three months to buy time. What's so awful about these stopgap proposals? For one thing, they don't fully account for the fact that most of the Interstate Highway System needs to be rebuilt, as the highways were built to last about 50 years, and the system was first established in 1956. Even with the best maintenance money can buy, you can only extend the life of these old roads by so much. How much will it cost to rebuild these highways, and to expand them to accommodate increases in traffic? Robert W. Poole Jr., a transportation expert at the Reason Foundation, estimates that it will take roughly $1 trillion. Others have estimated that reconstruction and modernization could cost as much as $3 trillion. You will be shocked to learn that Congress has barely begun to think through what it will take to rebuild and upgrade our highways. But our real challenge is not squeezing out just enough money to keep our existing interstate highways in good working order. Nor is it figuring out how to find a trillion, or trillions, of dollars to pay for an upgrade. It is facing up to the fact that the Interstate Highway System has helped drain the life out of our big cities and figuring out a better, smarter, more sustainable way to connect Americans from one end of the country to the other. Though the Interstate Highway System was first established in 1956, it was inspired by a miserable journey that took place decades earlier. In 1919, the U.S. Army sent a truck convoy from Washington, D.C., down a long, winding, and occasionally treacherous path to San Francisco. The convoy took just over two months to reach its destination, and the general crappiness of the roads was a memory that one of the young officers along for the ride, Dwight Eisenhower, would never forget. Decades later, after Eisenhower had helped vanquish Nazi Germany in part by taking advantage of its autobahns, gleaming superhighways far more advanced than almost any of the roads then in use in the United States, he decided to make the construction of a vast national highway network his first priority as president. What you might not know, however, is that according to Helen Leavitt, author of the felicitously titled Superhighway-Superhoax (somehow I suspect Leavitt feels the same way about the interstate highways as I do), Ike didn't realize that the interstate highways would slice through America's biggest cities until it was too late. The result of building a centrally planned highway system that doesn't just connect cities (an inter-metropolitan system) but that also runs through them (an intra-metropolitan system) has been a bona fide disaster, as Marlon Boarnet explained in an article published in Transport Policy in January of last year. Essentially, proponents of the Interstate Highway System decided that they needed to make its benefits tangible to urban lawmakers, so they included a number of urban highways in their plans. What they failed to reckon with is that a one-size-fits-all approach to highways that might make sense for routes connecting cities across vast distances would by definition have to ignore the particular local challenges found in each individual city. Before the interstate, local transport plans were local. That is, they were sensitive to the particularities of different cities and regions, and they were responsive to issues of particularly local concern, like limiting traffic congestion and integrating automobiles with other modes of transportation, including public transit. For political reasons, local transportation authorities had little choice but to accept that new highways had to minimize disruption in existing neighborhoods. Moreover, planners in this era had to be thoughtful about how this new infrastructure was going to be paid for. The interstate changed all of that. In the pre-interstate era, most of America's superhighways were turnpikes, financed by tolls. Because these roads had to pay for themselves, there was a powerful incentive to avoid building more road than was strictly necessary. Early plans for a national highway system involved tolls as well. Yet lawmakers in the Deep South and sparsely populated Western states objected to the idea, fearing that their highways wouldn't generate enough toll revenue to make them financially viable. Thus was born the idea of financing the entire Interstate Highway System through a federal tax on gasoline, which would redistribute resources from states that generate a lot of gasoline tax revenue to those that generate very little. This new federal tax would fund a Highway Trust Fund, and through it the federal government would meet 90 percent of the cost of new highway construction, including local highway construction. Since the Interstate Highway System was almost entirely funded by the federal government, local policymakers found it hard to resist going along with plans that tore neighborhoods apart. Who in their right mind would turn down ""free"" money? Who would turn it down if the neighborhoods that were being destroyed were full of people who didn't have a ton of political power, as was frequently the case? While this approach seemed to work pretty well in the first few decades of the interstate, it has proven destructive in the long term. Over time, as the cost of maintaining the federal highways has crept upward, lawmakers have been reluctant to raise the gas tax to a level high enough to keep up with rising costs. And so every few years Congress has to scramble to find some clever way to prevent federal highways from falling into utter decrepitude. It turns out that redistributing gas tax revenue from states with lots of drivers to those with very few also means redistributing gas tax revenue from states that need more transportation infrastructure than they have to states that have more transportation infrastructure than they need. In the late 1950s and 1960s, most observers didn't see new federally funded urban highways as a problem. Rather, they saw them as an exciting new tool to revitalize downtowns and to raze so-called slums, some of which were in fact living, breathing, tightknit neighborhoods. This optimistic take proved wildly off-base. Nathaniel Baum-Snow, an economist at Brown University, analyzed the effect of highway construction on U.S. cities from 1950 to 1990. By comparing cities that received many new highways over this period with those that did not, he estimates that one new highway passing through a central city reduced its population by roughly 18 percent. Where did these people wind up? In the suburbs, of course. Furthermore, Baum-Snow estimates that while the aggregate population of America's major cities declined by 17 percent in the wake of the construction of the Interstate Highway System, this population would have grown by 8 percent had the interstate highways never been built. Being a sober and responsible scholar, Baum-Snow never rails against suburban sprawl. In other work, he's offered reason to believe that sprawl has yielded some modest economic benefits. I take a different view. In a counterfactual interstate-free world, Americans would likely be living in denser, more compact communities, where they'd spend more time walking and less time driving. We'd still have suburbs, to be sure, but I'm guessing they'd feature more apartment buildings and fewer cul-de-sacs. Local infrastructure would have needed to be financed locally, and so cities that had mastered the art of building and maintaining infrastructure efficiently would enjoy a huge advantage over those that had not. Instead, our central cities have shrunk, our suburbs have sprawled, and we've grown dependent on a gargantuan federal highway system that has grown frighteningly expensive. In a perfect world, we could hop in a time machine and convince Ike that the Interstate Highway System was in fact a terrible idea. Let state governments keep building turnpikes. Let states and cities build their own local infrastructure, financed by local drivers and guided by local wisdom. If poor states wanted to build gleaming new superhighways, well, encourage them to issue bonds to pay for them, to be paid back through their own gas taxes. Assuming time travel is off the table, let's learn from our mistakes. First, let's get the federal government completely out of the business of maintaining the interstate highways crisscrossing our big metropolitan areas. Hand these roads over to state governments as soon as possible, and free state governments to finance these roads in any way they see fit, from higher state gas taxes to variable tolls they could use to reduce traffic congestion. Second, for interstate highways that connect cities across deserts and cornfields, let's replace the federal gasoline tax with per-mile tolls. One of the many problems with the gas tax is that as gas mileage improves, and as a small but growing number of drivers turn to electric vehicles, gas tax revenue is not keeping up with the needs of the highway system. Per-mile tolls can solve that problem by charging drivers according to how much they actually use the highway system, regardless of the kind of vehicle they're driving. And as Robert W. Poole Jr. explains, they can be pegged to the cost of each road and bridge, which will help ensure that roads and bridges are adequately financed. After adopting this approach, we will see states investing in the infrastructure projects that best meet their needs, with some states, like California and New York, choosing to invest more heavily in urban mass transit while others, like Texas and Utah, build bigger and better highways. What remains of the federal highway system, meanwhile, will evolve over time, as the routes that attract the most traffic will grow in line with their per-mile toll revenue while those that attract the least will stay the same size, or perhaps even shrink. We'll have an infrastructure worthy of a bigger, denser, more decentralized America--the kind of infrastructure that Ike, in his infinite wisdom, would be proud of. *Update, July 29, 2015, at 1:17 p.m.: Due to a production error, an outdated version of this article was originally posted.

Judging from the most recent polls, the answer is yes. That is, if you ignore all the lessons of the last presidential election. On Wednesday, Quinnipiac University released ""swing state polls"" in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. Far from leading or running even, Clinton was far behind her Republican rivals. Against Marco Rubio, she trailed 8 points in Colorado (38 percent to 46 percent), 8 points in Iowa (36 percent to 44 percent), and 2 points in Virginia (41 percent to 43 percent). Versus Jeb Bush, she trailed 5 points in Colorado (36 percent to 41 percent), 6 points in Iowa (36 percent to 42 percent), and 3 points in Virginia (39 percent to 42 percent). And matched up with Scott Walker, she trailed 9 points in Colorado (38 percent to 47 percent), 8 points in Iowa (37 percent to 45 percent), and 3 points in Virginia (40 percent to 43 percent). Driving this decline are terrible numbers on honesty and trustworthiness. In each state, solid majorities--62 percent in Colorado, 59 percent in Iowa, and 55 percent in Virginia--say that the former secretary of state is neither honest nor trustworthy. Smaller, but still substantial majorities say she doesn't care about their ""needs and problems."" On all scores, Clinton is outperformed by Democratic primary competitor Sen. Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden, who isn't in the race. There's no denying that Clinton is among the most polarizing figures in American politics, with staunch opposition from almost every Republican in the country. Add modest Democratic discontent--evidenced by the surprising popularity of Sanders--a series of highly publicized scandals, and Clinton's legitimate problems with secrecy, and you have a recipe for her low ratings. But that, I think, is as far as we can go. Beyond a few generalities about Clinton's present media narrative and the overall landscape of the race, these polls just don't tell us much. If anything, the breathless media coverage of the results is a good reminder of how not to interpret polls and what everyone should have learned from coverage of the 2012 presidential election. The big thing is that this early in an election cycle, polls don't tell us anything. They aren't predictive or especially useful. For example, at roughly this point in 2011, Barack Obama was a goner. With a net negative job approval rating, he was behind in key swing states and losing to a generic Republican in a nationwide matchup. But the election came, and the picture changed: Discontented Democrats returned to his corner, and the race tightened to a virtual tossup. With economic growth on his side, Barack Obama won, with a victory that matched those fundamentals. With that said, if you're going to pay attention to polls at this stage of the election, then national ones are more helpful than state-by-state rankings. Simply put, what's true nationally tends to be true in the states as well. If a candidate holds an overall lead, then odds are good she holds it in swing states as well. By contrast, it's hard to extrapolate from the other direction--a poll of swing states doesn't tell us much about the national picture. In other words, whether Clinton is unpopular in three particular swing states is less important than whether she's unpopular nationwide. As it stands, the most recent national poll--from the Washington Post and ABC News--shows her well-placed versus the other side. But this brings us to another lesson: Ignore stand-alone polls. Any given poll could be an outlier or contain an odd result. Your best bet is to look at aggregates, which give you a better sense of the actual picture. To that point, the HuffPost Pollster aggregate national polls show Clinton with a solid lead over every Republican in the race: 49 percent versus 39 percent against Rubio, 50 percent versus 40 percent against Walker, and 51 percent versus 41 percent against Bush. These numbers will change as the Democratic and Republican primaries heat up, and by next summer when we have our respective nominees, the race should narrow considerably. In all likelihood, 2016 will be another tossup. Indeed, partisanship will drive voters to choose a side and to improve their personal opinions of their chosen candidate. Democrats who don't like Clinton now may see her as a worthy successor to Obama come October 2016. The same goes for Republicans who might hate one of their candidates, but would support him full-heartedly if he became the nominee. At least one question comes out of all of this: If present polls are meaningless--and if we should ignore most of the ones we see--what should we look for to predict the shape of the election? The answer is the economy. ""We consider the economy fundamental, or foundational, to presidential election outcomes,"" write John Sides and Lynn Vavreck in The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election. There's an almost linear relationship between economic growth and political success: If an incumbent party has growth, it wins; if it doesn't, it loses. Yes, this is mediated by other variables, from foreign conflicts to tenure in office. But the overall pattern holds. And what does 2016 look like? According to a range of economists, ""The median forecast for the unemployment rate when voters go to the polls in November 2016 was 4.8 percent,"" which would be the ""lowest it has been during an election since George W. Bush and Al Gore faced off in 2000, when it stood at 3.9 percent."" No, this doesn't guarantee a Democratic victory, but it doesn't hurt either. Read more coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why You Should Ignore All Those New Polls That Say Hillary Is Doomed

According to surveillance video, a guard saw her alive at 7 a.m. that morning, and she spoke to jail staff an hour later about making a phone call. At 9 a.m., however, guards found her in a ""semi-standing position"" hanging from a metal-shaped hook, with a plastic trash can liner around her neck. Authorities say it was a suicide. Bland's family is skeptical. While Bland had said in a Facebook post that she suffered from ""a little bit of depression as well as PTSD,"" relatives said they saw nothing to indicate despair or suicidal intent. At most, one of her sisters said she did not have any ""medically diagnosed clinical depression"" but did have ""good and bad"" days. Which is all to say that--official account notwithstanding--we don't know exactly how Bland died. But we do know how she got to jail to begin with. A minor traffic stop. And what's clear from the evidence is that, while Bland's ultimate death was a tragedy, her stop and arrest is a scandal, a testament to biased procedures and troubling problems in American policing. In the dashboard footage of her arrest released on Tuesday, Trooper Brian Encinia sees Bland--a black American woman from Chicago who had come to Texas to take a job at Prairie View A&M University--in her vehicle, speeds to catch up with her, and pulls her over after she fails to signal a lane change. When he comes to her door to give her a ticket, Encinia says she seems ""very irritated."" Bland says she is--""I am, I really am""--and explains herself: ""I was getting out of your way ... so I move over, and you stop me. So I am a little irritated, but that doesn't stop you from giving me a ticket."" Encinia asks if ""she's done"" speaking and follows up with another question. ""You mind putting out your cigarette?"" he asks impatiently. ""I'm in my own car. I don't have to put out my cigarette,"" she says in response. She's right--cigarette smoking is legal, motorists aren't obligated to obey ancillary commands, and police can't detain you longer than it takes to process a ticket, absent reasonable suspicion of a crime--but that doesn't stop Encinia from escalating and extending the encounter. He demands she leave the car, and when she refuses, he says he will ""yank"" her out of the vehicle and threatens to use a stun gun. ""I will light you up,"" he says. At this point, it's worth saying, we enter a legal gray zone. It's true that, as my colleague Mark Joseph Stern notes, ""The Supreme Court has held that during a routine traffic stop, officers may ask drivers to exit their cars for the sake of safety."" But Encinia was giving Bland a ticket to sign when he asked her about the cigarette and didn't have any reason to suspect her of another crime or of being a threat. Still, according to Stern, ""by verbally refusing to comply with Encinia's detention, Bland resisted arrest under Texas law, thereby committing a misdemeanor."" And even if that arrest was illegal, Texas law declares that it's no excuse. When Encinia says he is ""giving a lawful order,"" he's right. Soon after this, Bland is outside of the car, handcuffed and shouting insults at the officer. In the part of the stop that's outside the view of the camera, the two get into a scuffle, which ends with her on the ground. ""You just slammed me, knocked my head into the ground,"" she says. When Bland curses and says she has epilepsy, Encinia replies, ""Good."" In his arrest report, Encinia doesn't mention the cigarette but says that Bland was ""combative and uncooperative"" and placed in handcuffs for ""officer safety."" That this contradicts the dashboard camera is evidence against the wide view that video surveillance will alter bad officer behavior. Mandatory cameras won't stop officers who want to use force under the pretext of a person resisting arrest. Indeed, there's growing evidence that many ""resisting arrest"" claims are a cover for bad police behavior. Texas law enforcement officials repudiated Encinia's behavior, stating he had violated ""procedures regarding traffic stops and the department's courtesy policy."" With that said, this encounter fits with what we know about traffic stops. Nationwide, police use two kinds of vehicle stops: traffic safety stops to deal with violations like speeding or driving under the influence, and stops to root out crime and criminal behavior. In the former, according to Pulled Over: How Police Stops Define Race and Citizenship, police target the behavior and move on, regardless of race, gender, or age. In the latter, police use more discretion. They search for minor infractions--driving too slowly, malfunctioning lights, failure to signal--which become pretext for an intrusive search of driver and vehicle. ""Virtually all of the wide racial disparity in the likelihood of being stopped,"" note the book's authors, ""is concentrated in one category of stops: discretionary stops for minor violations of the law."" Because these stops come with searches and impromptu interrogations, they are far more likely to end in arrest. It's what happened with Walter Scott in South Carolina (pulled over for a broken tail light and subsequently shot in the back by an officer), and it seems to have happened with Sandra Bland, who changed lanes without the proper signal. On top of all of this, there are the less dramatic--but still egregious--elements to the story. Why did Encinia omit parts of the encounter in his report and pin escalation on Bland? Likely because he could ordinarily get away with it. Why was Bland in jail for three days? Because in many jurisdictions, it is impossible to get bail on a weekend. There are also larger questions: How often does this happen? How many people are placed in jail by aggressive cops for traffic stops and ""resisting arrest""? And assuming Encinia's actions were legal, should we rethink the scope of legality for officer conduct? Is it OK that, in the face of excessive and capricious police demands, you have little recourse? Encinia has been placed on administrative duty, and Sandra Bland's family has asked for an independent autopsy of her death. The FBI is also investigating, as are the Texas Rangers. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas has asked the Justice Department to open an inquiry, and activists want greater oversight for the state and local investigations, citing past allegations of racism against the Waller County sheriff. A grand jury will decide whether Bland was murdered or she died of a suicide. Unfortunately, the best odds are that no one will face consequences or accountability for her arrest, jail time, and death. Either way, the police bear moral responsibility for Bland's death. Trooper Encinia chose to pull her over for a minor infraction. He chose to escalate the situation, and he chose to go from writing a ticket to making an arrest. Yes, Bland could have been less irritated, and she could have obeyed the command to put out her cigarette. But it's not illegal to be frustrated with the police, and it's not a crime to smoke. Moreover, it's an officer's job to remain calm and resolve situations without additional conflict. It's not an imposition to expect as much from men and women entrusted with the right to detain and to use lethal force. Think of it this way: If you are inclined to blame Bland for her arrest (and by extension her death), then you're sanctioning an America where police command total deference, where you have to obey regardless of what you've done or what's the law. You might want to live in that America. I don't."	The Sandra Bland Video Proves the Police Are to Blame for Her Arrest and Death
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/donald_trump_the_presidency_and_modesty_he_doesn_t_get_it.html	"I thought I was done covering the McCain campaign, but Donald Trump has revived some recollections of McCain's battles for the presidency in 2000 and 2008. Donald Trump said over the weekend about John McCain: ""He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured."" McCain, who spent five years as a POW, would agree. When he was a presidential candidate and the local official introducing him went on about McCain's heroism--the refusal of early release, the broken bones, the defiance of his captors--McCain would say that he was no hero, but he served in the company of heroes. McCain also used to boast at almost every stop about how he finished near the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy. (But when Trump pointed this out, Trump says, McCain supposedly was furious about it.) As a candidate, McCain regularly chronicled his imperfections both on the record and off. Some of this was false modesty--which McCain would admit--but at least McCain was acquainted with the idea of modesty and how it relates to the presidency. There are many reasons why Donald Trump is not likely to put his name on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Among them is that, in an office where modesty was once the central virtue, he would be the first elected president who never makes public displays of it. The swipe at John McCain was efficient. It insulted McCain's service and denigrated the service of every POW who happened to get captured. It invited brutal investigations into Trump's lack of service to his country. And it showcased a brilliant facet of Donald Trump's ego--one of many that have shined brightly since he became the first candidate to join a presidential campaign by escalator. Trump lashed out because he was irritated at McCain and peeved at interviewer Frank Luntz for interrupting him. Called on it afterward, he tried to turn the moment into a debate about McCain's treatment of veterans. On the Dana Loesch radio show on Monday Trump proclaimed, ""Nobody has done more for the vets than I have""--which, according to Trump, means serving as co-chairman of the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial Commission, contributing over $1 million, and financing and serving as the grand marshal of the 1995 Nation's Day Parade. It's likely that a few more people have done more for the vets, but this is a familiar retort from the candidate whose usual response to controversy is to reflect on his own personal greatness. Upon concluding the interview Trump boasted to Luntz: ""I get standing ovations, the other candidates don't."" In future press appearances, Trump has insisted he won ""the biggest standing ovation"" of the day, and his press release continued this point: ""Mr. Trump left to a long lasting standing ovation, which will be by far the biggest ovation of the weekend, and much congratulatory praise."" That isn't so, says pollster Luntz, who says other candidates received bigger ovations. (Video evidence supports Luntz's account.) This would seem an insignificant point, but no measure is too small when it comes to heralding the greatness that is Donald Trump. When Trump filed his financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission last week, the first line issued an advisory: ""This report was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump's massive wealth."" It then printed his purported net worth in all-caps: ""TEN BILLION DOLLARS."" This attention to the self would shock the founders and the first dozen or so American presidents. They never campaigned for the office of the presidency. To pursue the office meant you cared more about yourself and your ambition than the people. Modesty was the key sign of virtue for a president. ""Popular campaigning was not only dangerous,"" writes Gil Troy in See How They Ran, ""it was improper, illegitimate, and unnecessary. Candidates ... simply had to allow those who knew them to recognize their virtue."" That has changed, obviously. In many ways, modern presidential candidates live a life that Donald Trump has already lived as a civilian. They spend their time in places where their names are plastered on all available surfaces. They speak in the first person and boast about their achievements. They spend time in the company of the vastly wealthy. But that's where the similarities end. The traditional candidate puts him- or herself forward in order to promote a program of ideas. For Donald Trump, he is the program. As Hank Sheinkopf said in the New York Times Monday: ""His real business is giving out his name as a franchise ... His business is being Donald Trump."" Or, as the Wall Street Journal put it, ""His only discernible principle is the promotion of his personal brand."" The reason the founders cared so much about modesty, and the reason we expect a sliver of it today in candidates, is that presidents have enormous power. When they are alone with that power, we hope they exercise it in the service of the nation and not in their personal ambitions, grudges, or flights of fancy. The founders also recognized that only ambitious men would rise through the political ranks, so a president needed some internal governor in addition to the structural ones the founders created through the separation of powers. Two hundred and twenty-six years ago, George Washington didn't want to be president but took the job because he cared more about his country than himself. That's a different way to get your name on a slab of granite. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/donald_trump_coverage_why_it_s_important_for_journalists_to_cover_his_bigoted.html	"First things first: Donald Trump is a vitriol-spewing, media-manipulating, self-aggrandizing, bigoted publicity hound who has no realistic chance of winning the Republican nomination next summer or any other. While a growing number of national polls currently have the once-and-future reality television star atop a historically crowded GOP field, Trump's candidacy is destined to fade away just as countless other novelty candidates have in primaries past. None of that, however, is any reason for the media not to seriously cover Trump's campaign today. The Donald may be a Twitter troll in a $5,000 Brioni suit, but he's also the avatar of choice for a significant subset of the American electorate who sees themselves in his particular brand of belligerence. That view and those voters won't disappear when Trump does. The press ignores that fact at its own peril--and at the public's own loss. On Friday, the Huffington Post announced that from this point forth it will relegate its coverage of all things Trump to its entertainment section. ""Our reason is simple: Trump's campaign is a sideshow. We won't take the bait,"" editorial director Danny Shea and Washington bureau chief Ryan Grim wrote in a note to readers of one of the largest news outlets in the nation. ""If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette."" The Huffington Post so far stands alone in officially declaring itself above Trump as a news story, but it's clear there are plenty of working journalists who would be happy if their bosses made a similar decision. Politico's Ben White, to pick but one example, made his feelings known Thursday. ""Trump's time in the lead will fade as the debates begin and the Republican Party starts to get serious,"" White argued. ""And then all this coverage of the big-mouth billionaire will be exposed as largely ridiculous."" (As someone who is paid to write about the campaign every day, I've been guilty of my own type of Trump dismissal; I began much of my early coverage of Trump's campaign with the word Ugh, a knowing wink meant to make it clear that I, too, would prefer to be writing about more traditional candidates.) Such arguments against spilling digital ink on Trump are built on the idea that he can't win the nomination. That premise is correct, but the conclusion that follows--The media shouldn't waste its resources covering him--is false. For evidence, we have to look no further than those very same candidates that Trump dismissers rightly point to as proof that his time leading the GOP field will be short lived: Herman Cain and Sarah Palin. Both Cain and Palin spent time at or near the top of national polls four years ago but flamed out soon after. Does the fact that the pair ended up with zero primary or caucus victories between them mean the media should have ignored them from the get-go? Hardly. Their rise was an important story line in the 2012 election. They provided clear evidence of conservative skepticism of Mitt Romney, while also reminding the GOP establishment that primary voters crave simplicity in message. For Cain, reforming the U.S. tax code was as simple as ""9-9-9""; for Palin, addressing the nation's energy needs was as simple as ""Drill, baby, drill."" Four years later, Trump has surged past the establishment favorites by adding his own simplistic policy plank to the conservative platform: the promise of solving our immigration problems by building a fence along the Mexican border that we won't even have to pay for. Cain, meanwhile, is a particularly helpful example of why these flash-in-the-pan candidates require immediate coverage. It was the increased scrutiny that the press provided that ultimately spelled his downfall. (The same could be said for Palin's disastrous vice presidential run in 2008.) Without that all-in coverage, voters would have never known that Cain was unable to answer basic foreign policy questions or that he faced a series of troubling sexual harassment allegations. It was only by treating the former Godfather's Pizza CEO as a legitimate candidate that the press was able to prove that he wasn't one. Similar vetting of Trump has yet to erode his support, but without it his faulty and xenophobic claims about immigrants would have gone unrefuted, and his hypocritical business dealings would have remained unrevealed. Yes, the deluge of free press is responsible for some of Trump's rise, but in the long run it will also be what is responsible for his demise. Meanwhile, intentionally ignoring Trump--who had the support to qualify for the Fox News debate even before the current media storm--would risk having the opposite of the intended effect: A lack of serious scrutiny from the mainstream media wouldn't cut short Trump's ongoing infomercial--it would prolong it. If the media took as its mission the task of only covering candidates who have a realistic shot at winning their party's nomination, then countless more legitimate candidates would also need to be ignored as well. Sorry, Ted Cruz. See you later, John Kasich. This if-they-can't-win-we're-not-covering-them logic doesn't seem to have been applied to conservative candidates in the past either and for good reason. Ron Paul was never going to win the GOP nomination in 2008, yet his campaign was one of the first clear signs of the emerging strength of the libertarian wing of his party. Likewise, a similar dynamic is playing out this year on the opposite end of the spectrum: first with Elizabeth Warren and now with Bernie Sanders. The former was adamant she was never going to run for the Democratic nomination, and the latter has almost no shot of defeating Hillary Clinton in the primary. Yet what they do and say on the stump clearly matters for the future of the Democratic Party. The press might not like it, but Trump, too, is already shaping the 2016 election. He's now a lock to crash the first Republican presidential debate, where he'll force establishment favorites like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio outside of their comfort zones on immigration. Both men can still play the grown-up card, but how they choose to interact with Trump will help decide whether they ultimately win over the immigration hardliners in their own party and if they're even willing to try. Trump's current surge also raises interesting questions about what it is the GOP base wants the face of its party to look like; his popular retrograde rhetoric is a counterpoint to the argument that voters want Republicans to rediscover their compassionate sides. And in the longer term, his rise embodies the larger challenge facing the Republican Party: Will it evolve in the face of inescapable demographic trends? Or will it continue to ignore them? It stands to reason that those questions are ones that campaign journalists would be interested in. None of that is to say all Trump coverage is good Trump coverage. When TV reporter after TV reporter after TV reporter asks Trump whether he wants to apologize for branding Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, they're not hoping he backs down, and they aren't setting him up for a fact-based challenge either. They're simply hoping he says something even more jaw-dropping, handing them a viral video clip in the process. Of course the media fails when it goes chasing clicks only for the sake of clicks. But we can't fix a series of smaller journalistic errors by committing a larger one. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Case for Covering Trump
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/hillary_clinton_and_scott_walker_s_vision_for_america_the_two_candidates.html	"On Monday, if you were paying attention, you caught a glimpse of our ultrapolarized future. Specifically, you saw two speeches from two candidates on opposite ends of the ideological divide. First was Hillary Clinton's marquee speech on the economy, in which after months of silence, she addressed a major question of her candidacy: Was she committed to the neoliberal path of her husband's administration and her first campaign, or would she follow the progressive economic zeitgeist of the present-day Democratic Party? The answer, in short, is that she'll follow the zeitgeist. ""The defining economic challenge of our time is clear: We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country."" At the same time, said Clinton--distancing herself from Bill Clinton and Barack Obama--""Today is not 1993 or 2009. We need solutions for the big challenges we face now."" To that end, Clinton wants a constellation of interventionist policies that directly use government to raise incomes, regulate financial firms, shape the pre-distribution of wealth, and secure middle-class families. Among her proposals are tax reform to encourage long-term business investment instead of short-term spending (like higher CEO pay); comprehensive immigration reform to bring undocumented workers into the formal economy; new federal investments in renewable energy and medical research; paid family leave, earned sick days, and subsidized child care; higher minimum wages and protection against wage theft; enhancements for Social Security and the Affordable Care Act; middle-class tax relief and greater support for young, contract, and low-income workers; and finally, new measures to strengthen and expand Dodd-Frank financial reform. Even with the missing details and unanswered questions--where does Clinton stand on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, does she support a Bernie Sanders-style financial transactions tax--this is a progressive vision, informed by the last five years of liberal populist activism, from Occupy Wall Street to the rise of Elizabeth Warren. Once a Democratic Leadership Council Democrat who cut her teeth in the age of Reagan, Clinton is now near the helm of a party that's turned left from its 1990s centrism toward a neo-New Deal liberalism.* Mirroring this nod to the left of the Democratic Party was Scott Walker's wave to the right wing of the Republican Party. On Monday evening, in his home state, the conservative Wisconsin governor announced his campaign for the White House. ""Americans deserve a president who will fight and win for them. Someone who will stand up for the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Someone who will stand up for our religious rights and all of our other constitutional rights. Someone who will stand up for America."" If Clinton gave an agenda for liberal America, Walker sketched a wish list for its conservative counterpart. As president, Walker wants to devolve Medicaid to the states; repeal the Affordable Care Act in full; drill for oil, including completing the Keystone pipeline; cut taxes on ""job creators""; and reduce regulations across the board. Likewise, he wants to bring key Wisconsin policies to the country writ large. ""Since I've been governor,"" said Walker, touting his record, ""we passed lawsuit reform and regulatory reform. We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed Castle Doctrine and concealed-carry. And we now require a photo ID to vote in the state of Wisconsin."" He continued: ""If our reforms can work in a blue state like Wisconsin, they can work anywhere in America."" Beyond concrete policy ideas, Walker stuffed his speech with red meat. He blasted public assistance--""The people I've met tell me that they didn't come here to become dependent on the government""--and touted America as a place where ""the opportunity is equal for all, but the outcome is up to each and every one of us,"" as if the poor are poor because of their effort (they earned it) and not their circumstances. He praised supply-side economics and promised that tax cuts would ""grow the economy,"" despite the poor results in Wisconsin. He touted mandatory drug tests for welfare recipients, and denounced Common Core as a ""nationwide school board."" Walker is a top-tier contender for the GOP nomination. If he wins, he won't just bring a conservative agenda; he'll bring one from the hard right that aims for the vulnerable (cuts to services), plays to resentments (voter identification and drug tests), and appeals to his base of working- and middle-class white men. These dueling speeches are clear: There is no middle ground or overlap between Walker's America and Clinton's coalition of blacks, Latinos, women, and young people. Which means that there's no amount of ""leadership""--of rhetorical restraint, of triangulation, of closed-door maneuvering--that would yield a ""governing majority"" that's capable of serious progress. Indeed, there's no national--or at least, no bipartisan--agreement on what ""progress"" means. Like Obama in 2008, Clinton has promised to bring the country together, but this divide is solid. If she's elected president, she'll face the same entrenched opposition as her predecessor. Which, in a way, makes Walker a bit of fresh air. He has no pretenses. ""For years, the conventional wisdom was that Americans want divided government,"" said Walker in 2013. ""I think they've seen in the last few years that that's not necessarily a good thing."" What works, he said? Unified, one-party control. And that's what he promises. He says he'll fight for conservatives, and he'll win.

Why Our Politics May Be on the Verge of Ultrapolarization
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/scott_walker_announces_his_candidacy_he_looks_like_the_perfect_gop_candidate.html	"On paper, Scott Walker is the perfect GOP presidential candidate. He is a governor, so he can claim to have the kind of executive experience one needs to take on the rigors of the presidency. Having first been elected to statewide office in 2010, Walker also passes Jonathan Rauch's admittedly arbitrary but surprisingly useful ""freshness test."" That is, he hasn't been on the national political stage so long that we've grown tired of him. Walker is from the Upper Midwest, a region that has historically been fairly liberal but has grown more politically competitive in recent years. To get elected and re-elected as a conservative in a monolithically conservative state in the Deep South isn't nearly as impressive as getting elected, beating back a recall effort, and then getting re-elected in a state like Wisconsin, which has backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1984. Because Walker has devoted almost his entire adult life to public service, he hasn't built the kind of fortune that made Mitt Romney and John McCain seem so out of touch with middle-income voters. Again, there's nothing all that special about not making tens of millions in private equity, as Romney did, or not marrying into wealth, as McCain did. Yet there's a lot of political appeal in having a Republican standard-bearer who buys his clothes at Kohl's. Most interesting, to me at least, Walker never finished college. Though falling a few credits shy of a college degree isn't a qualification in itself, it is striking that while more than 20 percent of America's working-age population started college without finishing, these women and men are massively underrepresented in the uppermost echelons of our political ranks. Indeed, we haven't had a president without an Ivy League degree since Reagan. Walker would break that mold, in a good way. Then there is Walker's disarming political style. Last summer, Tim Alberta of National Journal offered a comprehensive look at Walker's tenure as governor and noticed that even Walker's most determined opponents found him to be rather pleasant. Again and again, Walker is described as unpretentious, easy-going, soft-spoken, and self-effacing, qualities we'd associate more with a genial high school guidance counselor than with a man with a burning desire to be the leader of the free world. His Democratic opponents have routinely tried to rile him up with over-the-top personal attacks, to which Walker has responded with an almost unnerving calm. In the end, his fiercest critics have wound up making Walker look the part of the sober adult. So why shouldn't Republicans unite around Walker straight away? For one thing, recent winning presidential candidates enjoyed wider support in their home states than Walker currently enjoys in Wisconsin. George W. Bush won re-election as governor of Texas with more than 68 percent of the vote in 1998, and Barack Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate in Illinois with 70 percent of the vote. Every one of Walker's statewide victories has been a squeaker by comparison. This could be a sign that Walker doesn't wear well over time, and that one shouldn't overstate the significance of Walker's swing-state appeal. For many conservatives, however, the fact that Walker has proven such a polarizing figure reflects his willingness to sacrifice short-term popularity to achieve policy goals that will pay off over the long haul. More concerning are the questions that have been raised about Walker's failure to surround himself with high-quality personnel. Eliana Johnson of National Review reported back in March that the Wisconsin governor relies primarily on his own political judgment when making decisions, and that this self-reliance was undermining his embryonic presidential campaign. She pointed to botched hires and awkward flip-flops on a number of hotly debated policy questions, from the legal status of unauthorized immigrants to ethanol mandates, as indications that he was not quite ready for prime time. Jonathan Martin, writing for the New York Times, offered a similar assessment earlier this month, adding that Walker's tendency to ""think like an operative"" might make him seem opportunistic and unprincipled. All of this rings true to me. Walker has seemed oddly unmoored in his first few months on the campaign trail. The contrast between the Walker who refused to back down on limiting collective-bargaining rights, despite ferocious opposition from organized labor in Wisconsin and around the country, and the Walker who struggles to give a straight answer on issues like immigration and taxes out of fear of offending this or that GOP microconstituency is discouraging. One charitable explanation is that Walker simply hasn't thought through his position on national issues. Just a few years ago, Walker was the executive of Milwaukee County, a role in which he didn't have to have detailed positions on what to do about Social Security or ISIS or the fallout from Puerto Rico's debt crisis. Unfortunately for Walker, that's not going to be much of an excuse a month or two from now, when he'll be subjected to scrutiny far more intense than anything he's faced so far. My fear is that instead of thinking through the most important policy questions facing the next president for himself, and offering a serious and substantive reform agenda, Walker will simply tell the most vocal pressure groups within the Republican coalition what they want to hear. That might be enough to help him secure the GOP presidential nomination, but it won't be enough to win him the next election, even with all the blue-collar charisma in the world.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/republicans_are_scared_of_what_donald_trump_will_say_at_the_fox_news_debate.html	"OKATIE, South Carolina--The Republican establishment is terrified of Donald Trump. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is more or less begging Trump to tone down his inflammatory rhetoric about immigration, GOP megadonors want to make sure he never makes it to the first primary debate, and even Fox News is doing all it can to give the once-and-future reality TV star second thoughts about showing up to that opening debate in Cleveland on Aug. 6. Conservatives have good reason to be scared. Given his poll numbers, Trump is looking like a lock to crash the GOP's first debate and bring his particular brand of bloviated bigotry along with him. For a party that wants to attract Latino voters in 2016--or, at the very least, not actively repel them like it did in 2012--Trump's the last man it wants in front of the camera. Lost in all the Republican fretting about what Trump's bombastic brand will do to the party's own image, though, is another potential wild card who could shake up the debate as much or more than the carnival barker with the $100 million private jet. John Kasich, the popular two-term Ohio governor who has been dismissed as a Jon Huntsman-like moderate afterthought, might actually do more damage to mainstream Republicans than Trump. While Trump's caustic comments about immigrants may leave Republicans with a general election hangover, it's Kasich's more nuanced views of reform that could spell bigger headaches for the establishment favorites. Kasich, of course, has to make it on the debate stage first. He currently sits three places and about two points away from snagging the 10th and final invite to a primetime event that will take place in his own backyard. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Kasich is due for a surge. For starters, he'll most likely get a bump after he makes his campaign official on July 21, a burst that doesn't have to be lasting or large to be meaningful since Fox News will send out debate invites two weeks later. Meanwhile, the three candidates he'll probably need to pass have largely stalled: Carly Fiorina is short on cash, Rick Santorum is short on fans, and Chris Christie's bid appears to have come four years and one traffic jam too late. Add to that the boost Kasich will get from the $1 million statewide ad blitz that his allies recently launched on his behalf in New Hampshire and the former House budget chairman is a decent bet to be on stage when the curtain rises. And if that happens? Well, then what promises to be a circus may have some unexpected substance to go along with it. All eyes will still be on Trump, of course, but it'd be Kasich who could make things truly uncomfortable for Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and the rest of the mainstream candidates who are trying to appeal to the disaffected white working-class voters they'll need to win the GOP nomination while still not completely alienating Latino and moderate voters ahead of the general election. Consider what will happen when Trump trots out some version of his xenophobic and incendiary comments about many Mexican immigrants being rapists and criminals on the debate stage: Bush and Rubio can score a few easy points by simply admonishing him and moving on. In the process, they'd come off looking responsible and compassionate--who isn't compared to Trump?--while not having to actually talk about specifics that divide the base. But if Kasich is up there on stage, too, there'd be no such easy out for Bush, Rubio, or even Scott Walker, all of whom have struggled to fully explain their shifting immigration views. Kasich is an outlier among Republicans less for what he believes about immigration and more for what he's willing to say and how he's willing to say it. Like most of the field, he's not pushing a path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants who are currently in the country illegally. Unlike many of his rivals, though, Kasich is vocal about not ruling it out completely. ""I don't like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line, [but] we may have to do it,"" he said at the Republican Governors Association late last year. ""Everybody in this country has to feel as though they have an opportunity."" Asked about his views on the unofficial campaign trail this past week in South Carolina, Kasich remained on message: ""I'm not for it, but I wouldn't take it off the table because I want to get an immigration deal."" If Kasich has the chance to make the same case on the debate stage, the rest of the field will have to get specific in ways they never would if the conversation were to be led by Trump. Are they completely ruling out a path to citizenship? Or do they believe it belongs in the conversation? Mainstream candidates can tack right to help themselves in the primary and possibly hurt themselves in the general, or they can inch left with an eye on the general election and possibly damage their chances of even winning the nomination. This is the dance that inspired Mitt Romney's infamous ""self-deportation"" line during the 2012 primary debates. The immigration issue could be a major headache for the GOP's Big Three this time around as well, and Kasich could make it worse. Bush was once for a path to citizenship and as recently as last year described the act of coming to the United States illegally as ""an act of love."" Today, he's more difficult to pin down but says he wants a path to ""earned legal status,"" not full-on citizenship. Rubio helped write the Senate's immigration bill that included a path to citizenship in 2013 and once thought immigration would be his signature issue. Today, he's distanced himself from the deal that many conservatives derisively dubbed ""amnesty"" and, those rare times he does talk about immigration, prefers to discuss ""securing the border."" Walker, meanwhile, was once for a path to citizenship like many of his fellow governors but today is talking about curbing legal immigration. If these guys are going to have to talk about immigration during the primaries, they'd much rather have a shallow debate with Trump than a more complicated one with Kasich. None of this is to suggest that Kasich can mount a real challenge for the GOP nomination. Most likely, he can't. As Huntsman's doomed 2012 campaign illustrated, conservative apostasy is rarely the way to win over the conservative base, and Kasich has committed his fair share. But Kasich doesn't need to be a legitimate challenger to avoid being largely ignored on the debate stage like Huntsman was. The attention Trump will bring to immigration gives Kasich a clear opening to make some noise in the opposite direction if he wants to. Perhaps just as important, Kasich has already proven that, unlike Huntsman, he's able to land his punches. Consider what he said two years ago when facing criticism from conservatives for taking billions of federal dollars as part of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion: ""Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he's probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer."" That defiant stance didn't change his party's mind about Medicaid expansion, but it presented a new, grabby, muscular argument for a moderate position on a key issue for Republicans that also co-opted traditional conservative reasoning. If he offers such frank talk about immigration on stage in Cleveland, Bush and Rubio won't have the luxury of looking compassionate by default. Trump is the bizarrely coiffed straw man that mainstream GOP candidates can actually somewhat safely denounce. Kasich, though, is an actual foil they'd rather never have to deal with. If he makes it on stage, the White House hopefuls will--for the first time this year--have to define themselves against their party's center as opposed to just the fringe. That might not be as fun as watching The Donald playing a parody of himself, but it might just be a whole lot more meaningful. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The GOP Is Terrified of Trump--But He's Not the Dark Horse Jeb Bush Should Be Worried About
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/donald_trump_s_brand_is_suffering_the_real_estate_tycoon.html	"Remember when Sen. Barack Obama campaigned as No Drama Obama? Donald Trump is following the opposite strategy. There's no fracas he won't join. When he's not defending his characterization of Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, he's exchanging charges of racism with op-ed writers, slagging his opponents, and launching counterstrikes against companies who abandon him. When there were reports that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called him to tell him to tone down his comments about Mexico because it was hurting the party's image, Trump took to Twitter to rebut press characterizations. Occasionally voters give presidential candidates the single-finger salute for blocking traffic in primary states. You can imagine Trump stopping his motorcade to return fire. This isn't the normal behavior of a presidential candidate--which is exactly the ticket that Trump is running on. He's not a candidate; he's a brand. He has exchanged the normal politician's cliches for cliches about his high-end real estate holdings. He can't mention one of them without testifying to its luxuriousness--the ""magnificent ballroom at Trump National Doral in Miami,"" or his golf course in Los Angeles that's ""perhaps the most valuable parcel of land in all of golf."" Because his company's name is his name, his campaign placards are also marketing material for his fine and luxuriant properties, which are the envy of discerning travelers accustomed to high thread-count amenities. But the brand is taking a hit. It's not just that companies are leaving him because they don't want to be associated with someone so offensive. One of the latest is Jose Andres, the D.C.-based chef with a growing national brand, who dropped a deal to open the flagship restaurant in Trump's Washington hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. What's happening now is that companies find it profitable, or at least to their public relations advantage, to get in the news cycle for abandoning Trump. In a recent Trump press release, the tycoon calls out NASCAR and ESPN for making a big story about dropping their relationships with him. ""The disassociation of ESPN and NASCAR with the Trump Organization was covered by the press in headlines all over the world as though it was a major setback for me. Really? What were the losses?"" he asks. He then goes on to say that all he lost were commitments to use one ballroom and a golf course. Puny stuff, he argues, though not so puny that he doesn't take the chance to point out that he's pocketing the deposits for each cancellation and making money off the properties now that they are freed up. ""I get two fees instead of one,"" he boasts. Shouldn't Trump, the consummate marketer, know what's going on here? People are willing to boast about abandoning their associations with him no matter how small because the bandwagon is rolling and they want to do the cool thing. It's so hip to drop Trump, it's amazing that it didn't start in Brooklyn. He's pocketed some extra cash, perhaps, but surely as a born salesman he knows that the expense that can't be tallied on a bill of sale is that his name is becoming something people flee from. With each new divestiture, no matter how small the underlying deal, it cements this image. This isn't about votes. There is a group of Republican voters who like what Trump is saying, how he says it, and don't mind that the political clowns are being ruffled by this party-crasher. So the controversy could help Trump in a limited way politically. Still, his chances of becoming president are less than infinitesimal. However, he will still be Trump the brand after the race is over. He's rich, so he can suffer the blow to his brand. Maybe he can withstand becoming toxic for a little while. If that's so, we're getting a sense of just how committed he is to this political venture. There's nothing in his behavior that suggests he takes slights to his brand lightly, no matter how bulging his bank account is. That's the key to his success! So if he's willing to endure the pain, he must have a higher level of commitment than his detractors thought. Though the political class may not take his candidacy seriously, the fact that Trump is willing to let his business brand be tarnished in the service of his campaign is a sign that at least he takes his candidacy seriously.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/the_gop_s_two_latino_problems_it_is_alienating_latinos_and_some_white_voters.html	"With his angry rants against undocumented immigrants, Donald Trump is a stark reminder of the GOP's terrible problem with Latino voters. In short, Latinos don't like--or trust--the Republican Party. But Trump also illustrates a second, more complicated problem. As long as his rhetoric has a place in Republican politics--as long as it has defenders--it won't just alienate Latinos. It will offend and turn off voters who have conservative ideas and beliefs but won't sanction or support anti-immigrant sentiment. Before looking at this other side to the ""Latino problem,"" it's worth examining the first one. In the past two presidential elections, Democrats have won more than two-thirds of Latino voters, reversing and eroding gains made during George W. Bush's administration. Part of this is anti-Republican backlash after the 2008 recession and the tail end of the Bush presidency, but even more is the intense anti-immigration wave that swept the GOP in the wake of the Tea Party's rapid rise to prominence. In the past six years, GOP states have targeted Latinos for greater scrutiny, GOP officials have called for ""self-deportation"" of undocumented immigrants, and GOP presidential candidates have stood with nakedly anti-immigrant politicians. And although there are smart, reasoned arguments against comprehensive immigration reform and other permissive immigration policies, the rhetoric that counts--that resonates with actual Republican voters--comes from figures such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, who once warned that a path to citizenship would ""destroy our republic."" At this point, Latinos don't just oppose particular candidates, such as Mitt Romney. They disdain the Republican label itself. According to a 2014 survey from the Pew Research Center, just 10 percent of Latinos say that the Republican Party ""has concern"" for their communities, compared with 50 percent who say as much about the Democratic Party. Few agree with Republicans on policy--especially immigration--and just 27 percent of Latinos identify with the Republican Party, compared with 63 percent who identify with Democrats. Not surprisingly, this has carried over to the 2016 GOP presidential field. As of October, notes Latino Decisions, just 32 percent of Latino voters would consider a vote for Jeb Bush, just 35 percent would consider a vote for Sen. Marco Rubio, and just 24 percent would consider a vote for Sen. Ted Cruz. Writing for the Washington Post--and prompted by Trump and the qualified defense he received from writers such as Rich Lowry of the National Review--conservative columnist Michael Gerson examines the two Republican camps for dealing with this ""Latino problem"" ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The first camp, best represented by Jeb Bush, wants to expand the Republican brand into Latino communities. It believes the GOP is ""too closely identified with the boardroom and the country club,"" Gerson writes, and wants to fix that with outreach to new constituencies. If Republicans could return to their earlier performance with Latino voters, they could win Colorado and Nevada, or at least make them competitive again in national elections. But this isn't a costless strategy. In reaching for Latino voters--with greater support for immigration reform or redistributive policy--Republicans risk alienating core supporters in the white working class who associate immigration with economic insecurity. Which brings us to the second, and arguably dominant, camp. These reformers also believe that the GOP ""has been too dominated by corporate interests and needs to identify more directly with the economic frustrations of working-class voters,"" Gerson writes. Their solution, however, is a greater focus on the white working class. If a Republican could win 65 percent, or more, of the white vote, he would carry places such as Ohio and Iowa, as well as Democratic states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. Not only does it make up for Colorado and Nevada, but it also makes up for Florida, another vital state where Latino voters are concentrated and critical to success. In some ways, notes Gerson, Trump is the extreme version of this strategy. He speaks to the anxieties of working-class whites, channeling fear and discomfort with angry, belligerent nationalism. But there are other ways to make this pitch. In his successful campaigns for governor, Scott Walker mobilized huge numbers of supporters in the reddest counties of Wisconsin to win narrow victories over Democratic opponents. Part of this was raw partisanship--galvanizing conservative voters against unions and public employees. But part of it was playing the suburbs against the cities--Milwaukee in particular--and harnessing the racially polarized politics of the area. And on the stump in the Republican primary, notes the New York Times, Walker ""wins applause by noting his efforts to require drug tests of people receiving public assistance, and uses language reminiscent of old, loaded appeals about indolent welfare recipients."" As one conservative writer told the Times, his is a ""populist strategy that doubles down on turning out disaffected white men."" But this brings us back to the second problem. The appeals the GOP uses to turn out disaffected whites--and maximize white support writ large--could backfire, both with Latinos and with other whites, who have nonwhite friends, neighbors, spouses, and partners and see themselves as tolerant. In working to maximize their share of the white vote, Republicans who take this path could lower their ceiling. It's not clear that there's a way out of this dilemma. But if there is, his name is Marco Rubio. There's no evidence the Florida senator can pull Latinos back to the Republican Party, but as a young Spanish-speaking politician of Cuban descent, he projects the same cosmopolitanism of Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. Even if he abandons immigration reform and tries to maximize the party's share of the white vote, he doesn't trigger the same anxieties from white voters as a more traditional politician might. Rubio bridges the gap between the two camps and lets the GOP change its look without changing its tune. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The GOP's Two Latino Problems

Their sparring stems from Trump's remarks at his June 16 presidential announcement about the kinds of people who come to America from Mexico. ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" Trump said. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems ... they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Trump has since stood by those remarks even as companies from NBC to NASCAR have cut their business ties with the real estate tycoon. Friday, Trump pointed to the death of a San Francisco woman, Kate Steinle, the victim of a random shooting by an undocumented worker, as proof of his claim. Bush, several weeks after Trump's original remarks, joined a chorus of GOP voices distancing themselves from Trump. The former Florida governor said Trump's remarks were ""extraordinarily ugly"" and ""not reflective of the Republican Party."" Bush also speculated about Trump's motives. ""He's doing this to inflame and incite and to draw attention, which seems to be the organizing principle of his campaign."" Trump has been relentlessly critical of Bush, but this isn't just a slap fight between two rivals.

Well, let me set the record straight: The man has no chance of winning the election. Disregard this recent poll: Trump is still the most reviled of the GOP candidates. (Two weeks ago, he even tried to hire actors who would cheer for him when he announced his White House bid.) In spite of his irrelevance,  ""news"" of Trump's progress--his racist speeches, his angry tweets, the PR meltdown that ensued--have appeared in nearly every outlet in America. NPR even went so far as to offer up ""5 Things You Should Know About Donald Trump""--an impossible and self-negating promise that might be taken as a journalistic cry of uncle. With 16 months to go until Election Day, the campaign press has all but given up. Can you blame them? The Democratic race has been more or less decided for at least a year (if not since 2008), and we're told the field of GOP candidates isn't nearly as chaotic as it looks. Yet the Internet is still awash in coverage of the candidates: who's kicking off her run for president, who's announcing his, who's still exploring the idea, who hasn't given up. It seems there's no excuse too thin for campaign punditry, no angle too inane, no staged event too contrived to make its way to print. Have you heard what Mike Huckabee has to say about transgender rights? Did you see that Bobby Jindal had himself painted with white skin? How about the fact that Hillary Clinton is polling well with rappers? Doesn't Jeb Bush look fit and trim? I don't mean to be a downer, but this is just the start. As New York's Jaime Fuller noted several months ago, the candidates have already coalesced into cliches: Hillary is ""polarizing,"" and Jeb is an ""introvert;"" Marco Rubio counts as ""young,"" Rand Paul qualifies as ""interesting, and Chris Christie has been certified as ""brash."" Yet a long parade of campaign news still stretches out ahead--six seasons and three equinoxes, 500 days of bummer--a march of candidates and press events, mini-scandals and minor bouts of umbrage. Needless to say, none of this is likely to determine whom you'll vote for next November, or even who might end up on the ballot. What if you could press a button to quiet all this noise? What if you could shut off the din of election season, if not until Election Day then at least until next year? Wouldn't it be nice to have a few more months of peace and quiet before we're thrust into the stressful antics of the campaign trail? Wouldn't it be nice to hit the snooze bar for a while, so you can focus on more important things? Friends, readers, fellow Americans: I would like to make that dream come true. What I have in mind is a free, downloadable browser extension that strips away unwanted campaign coverage from the Internet. It will screen your Twitter and Facebook feeds for election-related keywords and hide anything it finds. And it won't just work on social media: It will also filter out campaign stories from the home pages of major news websites, including Slate, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, CNN, Huffington Post, Vox, the Atlantic, and Vice. Alas, such a product is well beyond my nearly nonexistent coding skills. But if I've learned anything from presidential politics, it's that family connections can paper over even the most egregious levels of incompetence. As it happens, my older brother, the George to my Jeb, runs a software company in New York. I made my case, and he agreed to take on the project. And now that project is complete. Say hello to I Haven't Got Time for the 'Paign, a life hack for the weary news consumer, and something pretty close to the product of my dreams. Go on over to Paign-Free.com and give it a try. A few notes on how it works: I Haven't Got Time for the 'Paign isn't meant to cut you off altogether from election news. The biggest, most important campaign stories--how the candidates respond to major tragedies like the one in Charleston, South Carolina, for example--will reach you through the offline media (print newspapers, cable news, etc.), as well they should. The online filters aren't perfect, either, so lesser stories will sometimes work their way into your feed. Again, that's OK with me. The software tries to muffle needless noise, not seal you in a vacuum pod. If it can block out, say, 90 percent of the bloviating columns on the candidates, I'd call it a success. Nor should the product be understood as a tool of apathy or civic disengagement. When you install IHGTP, you'll be prompted for the date at which you'd like the feature to shut itself off. That's the snooze-button function: You're not turning off presidential campaign coverage forever; you're only pushing it aside for now. Wanna keep your news feed clear until the caucuses in Iowa? Set it for Feb. 1. Or perhaps you'd like to wait until after Super Tuesday? That's an option, too. Even with the software installed, you can still read any article you want. When you're on a filtered page, just click the IHGTP icon on your browser toolbar--the alarm clock done up in stars and stripes--to toggle filters on and off. You can also add your own keywords to a custom list. (Open up the extension options page for that.) With some careful curation, you could turn IHGTP into a filter for any topic in the news that might cause you consternation. (I Haven't Got Time for Game of Thrones? I Haven't Got Time for Professional Football? Whatever you want; it's your snooze bar.) The servers at my brother's company will keep track of data on the custom filter settings and on the articles that the filters block but that users end up reading anyway. If these statistics turn up any noteworthy trends, I'll report them back to you in another posting here in Slate. (The data will be anonymous and presented in aggregate.) I've been testing the extension since last week, and it's already saved me from seeing many hundreds of election-related tweets and posts and headlines. Sure, there will come a time when I'll want to stay informed--when I'll be glad to keep abreast of all the latest polls and PR stratagems. I've got my timer set for January. But until then, I'd rather keep my sanity. No snooze button for you? Here's all of Slate's 2016 campaign coverage."	Finally, a Tool That Will Let You Filter Out Campaign Coverage Until It Really Matters
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/07/cnn_trump_poll_why_republicans_love_donald_trump.html	"There's no world in which Donald Trump is a serious candidate for president. Republican elites don't want him, Republican donors don't want him, and if--through some cosmic fluke--he managed to win a major primary, every strategist and activist in the Republican Party would turn their aim toward him and his candidacy. But just because Trump is an unqualified vanity candidate doesn't mean he's unimportant in the story of the 2016 GOP presidential primary. Unlike Chris Christie or Mike Huckabee--two vastly more legitimate candidates--Trump is popular with Republican voters. A new CNN national poll puts him in second place in the GOP field at 12 percent support--seven points behind the leader, Jeb Bush--while recent polls from Iowa and New Hampshire also show him with a second place spot in those crucial early contests. If Trump holds his position, he'll be on stage with Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio when official debates start in August (he could even lose some support and still make the cut). The obvious question is ""Why?""--why does Trump have a hold on this thick slice of the members of the Republican base? The answer is, unlike the professional politicians in the race, Trump is--from his views on immigration to the ""issue"" of Obama's citizenship--one of them. That's not to say that more serious candidates like Ted Cruz or Bobby Jindal are insincere. They are reliable conservatives with strong, right-wing beliefs and positions. But they're also elected officials: They legislate, they build coalitions, and they compromise between what they want and what is possible (though this is more true of Jindal than Cruz). They can appease the Republican base with harsh attacks on the other side, but they can't endorse every crazy idea, lest they hurt their goals and priorities. A political free radical, Trump doesn't have this problem. He doesn't have to collect endorsements, or persuade reluctant fundraisers (he's self-financing), or build a team of party professionals. He doesn't have to do anything other than put himself on a debate stage and get publicity. And so, he says what he thinks. The last time he entered the fray, in the runup to the 2012 primaries, this meant ""birtherism,"" the belief that Barack Obama was foreign-born and thus ineligible for the White House. For this round, it means casual xenophobia. ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" he said during his presidential announcement last month. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."" He continued: ""It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably--probably--from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast."" Appalled, corporate America moved to break bonds with the real estate mogul. NBC ended its relationship with Trump, longtime host of Celebrity Apprentice and co-owner of the Miss USA and Miss Universe franchises. Macy's dropped him from its stores, and Univision, the Spanish-language network with wide reach in the United States, cut its ties as well. On Wednesday, Trump replied: ""Clearly, NBC and Macy's support illegal immigration, which is totally detrimental to the fabric of our once great country."" Through all of this, actual Republican voters not only weren't bothered, they actually seemed supportive, as evidenced by Trump's rise to near the top of the heap. The reason is clear. While Trump was out-of-bounds of mainstream conversation, he was well in the bounds of Republican Party politics and the kinds of rhetoric used there about Mexican and Latin American immigrants. His complaints about ""drugs,"" ""crime,"" and ""rapists,"" for example, echo those from influential Iowa Rep. Steve King, the all-but-official leader of the GOP's anti-immigration wing. In 2013, criticizing the Dream Act, he told conservative website Newsmax that ""For every [undocumented immigrant] who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there that--they weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."" Likewise, in response to the child migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, conservative journalists and Republican politicians spread fear of immigrant-borne disease. Fox News personality Marc Siegel warned that dengue fever is ""emerging in Texas because of the immigration crisis""; radio host Laura Ingraham declared that ""The government spreads the illegal immigrants across the country, and the disease is spread across the country""; and, in a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, then-Georgia Rep. Phil Gingrey referenced ""Reports of illegal immigrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus, and tuberculosis."" Trump also sounds like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, who--in the last month of his 2014 campaign against Democrat Mark Pryor--warned that terrorists were working with cartels to send fighters into the United States. All of these claims--from drugs and disease to ISIS--were insane. But they reflected (and encouraged) a climate of anti-immigrant hostility in the Republican Party, underscored by the huge backlash to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's plan for comprehensive immigration reform in 2013. And those beliefs persist. Earlier this year, the Pew Research Center asked Americans about the impact of immigrants on the United States. Sixty-two percent of Democrats and 57 percent of self-identified independents said that immigrants ""strengthen the country through hard work and talents."" By contrast, 63 percent of Republicans said they ""burden the country by taking jobs, housing, and health care."" Trump doesn't just represent the Republican base on immigration. He is the Republican base on immigration. His anxieties are their anxieties. And his rhetoric--a revanchist stew of foreign policy belligerence, small government ideology, anti-elite agitation, and raw bigotry--reflects and appeals to a meaningful part of the Republican electorate. The good news is that this meaningful part is still a small minority of the Republican Party. The right-wing of American populism might be ugly and angry, but it's not powerful. The bad news, on the other hand, is that you don't have to be a majority to be influential. You just have to grab the right influence at the right time. Trump is a distraction, but don't be surprised if a more credible candidate--like Walker, who can cloak his hard-right politics in suburban blandness--tries to bring Trump's voters to his side. Alone, these voters won't bring victory. But in a close fight, they could offer the winning points."	The GOP Base Loves Trump Because of His Anti-Elite Agitation, Raw Bigotry

The school rejected her, and she blamed its affirmative action program, which considers race and ethnicity in a ""holistic review"" of certain candidates. ""There were people in my class with lower grades who weren't in all the activities I was in, who were being accepted into UT, and the only other difference between us was the color of our skin,"" she explained. Her rhetoric aside, however, Fisher and her lawyers couldn't prove discrimination in court. In 2009, a federal district court upheld the university's policy and rejected her lawsuit. She appealed the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the prior ruling. In a last grasp for success, her lawyers appealed their case to the Supreme Court, which--in a 7-1 decision--vacated the previous ruling and sent it back to the 5th Circuit for a second hearing. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy explained that the university hadn't proved ""its admissions program [was] narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity."" Everyone had to try again. That was 2013. The 5th Circuit returned to the question, and last year it came to the same place: UT's policy was constitutionally kosher. ""It is equally settled that universities may use race as part of a holistic admissions program where it cannot otherwise achieve diversity,"" wrote the 2-1 majority. Undeterred, Fisher appealed to the Supreme Court again. And on Monday, the Supreme Court took her case, again. What's striking about this case--and what makes it frustrating to some observers--is the curious question of Fisher's academic record. Put simply, as Nikole Hannah-Jones documented for ProPublica, affirmative action wasn't her problem. If you want entrance to UT Austin and you live in Texas, you have three options: You can score in the top 10 percent of your high school class, which grants you automatic entry; you can try for the non-top 10 slots; or, if your grades are weak, you can attend a satellite campus and transfer, provided good grades and a strong course load. When Fisher applied in 2008, notes Hannah-Jones, the UT Austin filled 92 percent of its in-state spots with students from the top 10 program. She wasn't among them. With a 3.59 grade-point average and a modest SAT score of 1180 out of 1600, she was a solid student but not a great one, not for a school with an overall acceptance rate of 40 percent and an extremely low acceptance rate (comparable to Harvard's) for in-state students admitted outside of top 10. For the remaining 8 percent of in-state spots, UT Austin used a comprehensive approach that weighed grades and test scores along with essays, leadership, activities, service to the community, and ""special circumstances."" Those ranged from socioeconomic status and school quality, to family background and race. As the university's director of admissions explained for the 5th Circuit, ""[R]ace provides--like language, whether or not someone is the first in their family to attend college, and family responsibilities--important context in which to evaluate applicants, and is only one aspect of the diversity that the University seeks to attain."" Neither special circumstances nor grades were determinative. Of the 841 students admitted under these criteria, 47 had worse AI/PAI scores (a combination of the holistic measure, grades, and test scores) than Fisher, and 42 of them were white. On the other end, UT rejected 168 black and Latino students with scores equal to or better than Fisher's.* To call this discrimination is to say that Fisher was entitled to a space at the UT Austin, despite grades that didn't make the cut. It's worth pointing out that the university gave her the choice of transferring from a satellite school, which she rejected. Fortunately for Fisher, this latest trip to the high court might be the try that sticks. At least four Supreme Court justices believe affirmative action is unconstitutional. In his concurrence to the first Fisher opinion, for instance, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, ""The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception."" Likewise, on the same grounds, Justice Clarence Thomas attacked affirmative action as morally equivalent to Jim Crow. Justice Samuel Alito has sided with affirmative action opponents in the past, and in reference to a voluntary school desegregation plan--which he struck down--Chief Justice John Roberts has said that ""the way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,"" as if race consciousness is the same as racism. Meanwhile, a member of the court's liberal wing, Justice Elena Kagan, will recuse herself from hearing the case because she worked on it when she was solicitor general. Given all this, most liberals aren't optimistic. With that said, there's an argument--from Richard Kahlenberg of the Century Foundation--that an end to race-based affirmative action will spur the country toward class-based affirmative action, which would assist poor and working-class students of all backgrounds, who are underrepresented at selective colleges. Because of disparities of wealth and income, minorities are as likely as whites to benefit under a class-based arrangement. On that score, Texas--with its top 10 program--is a pioneer. Top 10 doesn't adjust for neighborhood or school quality; the best student at an older, rural school is just as qualified for admission as the best student at a gleaming, suburban complex. With that said, Top 10 comes with two serious problems: Highly qualified students at great schools miss the cutoff, on account of high competition, while the best students from low-achieving schools are often unprepared for university work. Indeed, there's a certain perversity to top 10, which achieves its racial diversity by leveraging neighborhood--and thus public high school--segregation. But, under a legal regime that only tolerates a ""narrow"" use of racial preferences in education--forcing race-neutral means for race-conscious ends--that outcome is inevitable. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her Fisher dissent, ""I have said before and reiterate here that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternatives as race unconscious."" Finally, it's worth repeating a point from the Economic Policy Institute's Richard Rothstein, who notes--correctly--that ""black families and their children suffer from compounded and inherited disadvantages that are unique, not like those of white or immigrant families who happen to be from lower social classes or who happen to live in low-income neighborhoods."" Race disadvantage is different than its class counterpart, and one affirmative action isn't a substitute for the other. But even if it were, it's important to note that if the court ends race-based affirmative action, there's no guarantee that we'll see an alternative. Opponents of race-conscious policy in education are often opponents of ""diversity"" writ large and won't be fooled into accepting measures to help boost diversity by the use of the word class instead of race. Correction, July 2, 2015: This article originally misstated that 47 of the rejected students from University of Texas at Austin had worse grades than Fisher. They had worse AI/PAI scores. (Return.)"
