Rand Paul had his take on Tuesday's election results. ""I think this election was basically a repudiation of the president, but also Hillary Clinton,"" he said. ""The Democrat [in Kentucky] ran and wouldn't admit that she voted for President Obama. She was very specific--'I am a Clinton Democrat.' "" As political explanations go, this is unusually self-serving. Yes, the Clintons campaigned for Alison Lundergan Grimes, but there's no evidence Kentuckians were voting against Clinton as much as they were voting against Obama. Paul's take is purely a product of his aspirations; he's running for the Republican presidential nomination, and he wants you to think that he's the only one who can take on Hillary Clinton and win. Still, his comment raises a question: What does Tuesday mean for the unofficial--but very real--Clinton campaign? Writing for Yahoo News, Andrew Romano says that the Republican win is a boon for the presumptive Democratic nominee. Because it's ""hard to imagine"" soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ""will be able to control his party's vehement Just Say No caucus."" In fact, there's a great chance Washington will stay broken, allowing Clinton to ""run as the antidote to D.C.'s dysfunction,"" writes Romano. On the other side, the National Review says this is nonsense. ""Let's get something clear: Watching your party get stomped like a narc at a biker rally in a midterm election is not something that helps a party's presidential frontrunner,"" writes Jim Geraghty for the conservative magazine. ""America is not happy with Washington, and particularly furious with Obama and Democratic governance as a whole."" Both takes get part of the picture right. The new Senate Republican majority is filled with Tea Party politicians--like Joni Ernst of Iowa and Tom Cotton of Arkansas--who have no interest in compromising or even working with the president, much less the Democratic minority. What's more, the most extreme lawmakers--like Sen. Ted Cruz and the hard-right caucus of the House--likely feel vindicated. After two years of obstruction--including a government shutdown and a debt ceiling standoff--they won a huge midterm victory. Why change course? What's the incentive? In which case, the antics of an irresponsible Republican Congress will burden the eventual Republican presidential nominee, which only helps a Clinton candidacy. At the same time, the Democratic Party is in utter disrepair. Some progressives have comforted themselves by noting the popularity of Democratic ideas: Otherwise conservative states have raised the minimum wage, legalized marijuana, and protected abortion rights from draconian ""personhood"" laws. But this only highlights the problem with the Democratic brand, which is so unpopular it weighs down candidates who push otherwise popular proposals. The question for Hillary Clinton's campaign is this: Will voters see her as a singular figure--Hillary--standing against an unpopular Republican Party, or will they see her as just another Democrat against just another Republican? If it's the former, then Tuesday doesn't mean much for her prospective candidacy; voters will see her as Clinton first and a Democrat second, and may even see her ideas as Clinton ideas and not Democratic ones, which could help if she tries to expand the national issue space to include things like universal child care. If it's the latter, however, then Team Clinton has a new challenge: to turn the Democratic brand into something worth supporting in 2016. But even that comes with the important caveat that presidential candidates have done just fine following a bad midterm year and have failed after a good one. George H.W. Bush won the election after the Republican failure of 1986--the closest analogue to Hillary Clinton's situation--and Al Gore lost it after the Democratic success of 1998. I should say that there's a third option in all of this: that Tuesday didn't matter at all, and in a way that has nothing to do with Clinton's persona. Put simply, there's a good chance that 2014--like 2010--was driven by the demographics of American politics, in which Republican voters dominate midterm elections, and Democratic voters dominate presidential years. In which case, Clinton doesn't have to worry about 2016 since she won't be speaking to the people who elected a Republican Congress; she'll be speaking to the people who twice elected Barack Obama. And that is a good position to be in."	What Does the Republican Victory Mean for Hillary Clinton?

""I am the guy who is elected by everybody,"" he said. That was both an explanation of why he was punished by the voters who rejected members of his party and a reminder that he is not without power. The president can still speak to those voters who didn't participate in the midterm elections but who will return in 2016. ""To everyone who voted,"" said the president, ""I want you to know that I hear you. To the two-thirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday, I hear you too."" Whether Obama can influence those voters who didn't participate on Tuesday or not, by speaking of that larger electorate, he reminded everyone that there is a much larger bloc of voters out there evaluating whatever happens next. Now that Republicans are taking a leadership position, the broad mass of voters--not just the ones who participate in midterms--will be evaluating both parties. This was subtle. It wasn't a day for stark warnings, however. The president was conciliatory and repeatedly said he was open to hearing from Republicans. He said he'd like to share some Kentucky bourbon with incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Note, White House handlers: McConnell apparently likes his in a Manhattan.) The president pointed to possible common ground on infrastructure legislation and efforts to improve and expand early childhood education. He mentioned tax reform, something McConnell also said was an issue the two leaders could theoretically work together on. Both men, at least at this early moment, seemed to recognize that the poll results showed the country desperate for some measure of bipartisanship. Immigration reform is the real first test. President Obama has said that he will act if Congress doesn't. McConnell has said if Obama did that, it would be like ""waving a red flag in front of a bull."" It doesn't seem like the president is inclined to wait. He suggested that his executive orders could be superseded by whatever legislation the House and Senate agreed on. If the president goes forward, he weakens House Speaker John Boehner and McConnell's leverage with their members. House and Senate leaders are never going to get their members to agree to any future deals on immigration (or any other issues that require trusting the president) if he takes unilateral action on immigration. That's because their voters are going to think individual Republicans are turncoats for working with a president who would act like that. Maybe the president wants to exacerbate existing tensions within the GOP by playing hardball on the executive orders. But that's a pretty aggressive bet. And since Republicans are most irritated by the president's unilateralism, it's safe to say that action in advance of legislation would swamp any more happy talk. There are some veto fights coming, and the push and pull over immigration will be an early test of whether the politicians, the press, and the people can handle the messy process that is going to define this next period. If it is accepted that both sides are going to follow their ambitions, clash, veto, repair, and proceed to a bruising adult solution, then there might be some actual progress. If any confrontation immediately escalates to a shutdown or the press treats a veto as a catastrophic event (as opposed to a necessary routine devised by the founders), then we're in for another grim period. McConnell mentioned several times that there will be no government shutdowns on his watch and no debt ceiling breaches. His rise to power in the Senate marks the return of a person steeped in the traditions of an older institution where people were blunt and tough and got things done. That's the Senate that Vice President Biden loved so much, and now with Sen. Harry Reid in the minority, perhaps Biden will return to his old haunts to negotiate with McConnell. The two have notched several deals in the period of dysfunction of the last several years. But the president can't outsource the task; he'll have to deal with the new majority more than he has in the past. ""Whether it's having a drink with Mitch McConnell or letting John Boehner beat me again at golf,"" Obama said, he was willing to do anything to get something done. Friday he'll meet with leaders from both parties at the White House for lunch. Perhaps he should serve Manhattans."	Will Obama Play Hardball With the New Republican Congress?

They were right. On Tuesday night, Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate for the first time in eight years. In many of the states the GOP won Tuesday, Republican candidates themselves didn't primarily execute what proved to be a wildly successful strategy of linking Democratic candidates--from Colorado to North Carolina--to an increasingly unpopular President Barack Obama. Instead, deep-pocketed conservative groups--including a cluster of groups tied to Republican strategist Karl Rove and a network of groups backed by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch--together sponsored hundreds of thousands of TV ads that relentlessly attacked Democrats for their ties to Obama. The prominence in 2014 of nonparty groups such as super PACs and politically active nonprofits underscores the way election funding has changed since the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling in 2010. Democrats, who enjoyed a six-seat Senate majority going into Election Day, attempted to defend themselves from an expected Republican onslaught. Numerous incumbent Democrats outraised their GOP rivals, and liberal donors dug deep to support a pro-Democratic super PAC--Senate Majority PAC--that became the top sponsor of Senate-focused campaign ads this election cycle. Democrats even dabbled in so-called dark money through secretive nonprofit groups, such as Patriot Majority USA, that don't disclose their donors. But it wasn't enough. Republicans are now predicted to control at least 52 U.S. Senate seats next year. ""When the outside money comes in in substantial amounts, you don't have to make any choices,"" Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said about Republicans' midterm resources. Had Republican candidates been left to their own, Ornstein continued, ""my guess is you would not have seen nearly as much money going into places like Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire--even Alaska."" Groups connected to Rove and the Koch brothers were among the biggest winners in Tuesday's midterm elections. Of the 10 U.S. Senate races where either the Rove-linked nonprofit Crossroads GPS or its sister super PAC, American Crossroads, was active, their favored candidates prevailed in at least six--with the Alaska Senate race still too close to call at this writing and a runoff election coming next month in Louisiana. Similarly, of the nine U.S. Senate races where the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity was active, its favored candidates also prevailed in at least five contests. Only in New Hampshire and Michigan did the Crossroads groups and Americans for Prosperity see defeat. In the Granite State, incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen kept Republican challenger Scott Brown, who previously represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate, at bay. And in Michigan, Rep. Gary Peters defeated former Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land to win an open-seat race. As of press time, incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, was trailing GOP challenger Dan Sullivan, the state's former attorney general and natural resources commissioner, by about four percentage points. Ultimately, the current occupant of the White House decided the 2014 election, said Steven Law, president of American Crossroads. ""This election was about President Obama,"" Law said in a statement. Levi Russell, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, did not respond to requests for comment. In a marked contrast from the 2010 midterm elections, Democrats, too, embraced the post-Citizens United world of big-money politics, even while they continued to bemoan it. That high court decision allowed corporations, including certain classes of nonprofit corporations, to spend funds to expressly advocate for the election or defeat of federal candidates. The decision also paved the way for super PACs, which may accept unlimited contributions but must disclose their funders. During the 2014 election cycle, the pro-Democratic Senate Majority PAC, which is run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, produced more than 50,000 ads--more than any other outside spending group, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG, a firm that tracks political advertising. And a pro-Democratic nonprofit called Patriot Majority USA--that is linked to Senate Majority PAC--played attack dog in the South, where several incumbent Democrats faced strong GOP challengers. Just two of the candidates backed by Senate Majority PAC and Patriot Majority USA won on Tuesday--Peters in Michigan and Shaheen in New Hampshire. Six of Senate Majority PAC's favored candidates went down in defeat, while Patriot Majority USA saw four of the Democratic candidates it supported lose. Both groups also backed incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, who is now headed to a Dec. 6 runoff with Republican rival Bill Cassidy. Officials with Senate Majority PAC and Patriot Majority USA did not respond to requests for comment. Overall, more than 1 million TV ads have aired since January 2013 as Democrats and Republicans battled for control of Congress' upper chamber, according to Kantar Media/CMAG. In many of the most pivotal Senate races, outside groups accounted for nearly one of every two ads. Dark money groups that don't disclose their funders accounted for at least one of every five ads in six of the hottest Senate races: Arkansas, Colorado,   Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, and North Carolina. According to a Center for Public Integrity review of data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics, just two Senate contests saw outside groups spend more on elections than the candidates themselves in 2012--Virginia and Indiana--and there were no such races in 2010. This year, however, there could be more than a half-dozen such contests when final numbers are tallied. And the spending gap between candidates and outsiders has grown--dramatically. In 2012, candidates in Virginia and Indiana nearly matched dollar for dollar what outside groups spent in those contests. This year, in some cases, the outsiders have spent more than double what the candidates had at their disposal. Take Colorado, for instance, where Republican Rep. Cory Gardner--with the aid of the Crossroads network, Koch groups, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--ousted incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. The two men had collectively raised about $30 million for their campaigns as of mid-October, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of filings with the Federal Election Commission. Yet all outside groups active in Colorado had reported spending about $55 million to the FEC as of Tuesday, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. (Party committees also reported spending an additional $14 million.) Similarly, in North Carolina, incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan and state House Speaker Thom Tillis, her Republican rival, collectively raised about $32 million as of mid-October. Groups that were neither parties nor controlled by candidates reported spending about $58 million in that contest as of Tuesday--and parties spent an additional $19 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Hagan outraised Tillis by a ratio of more than two to one and liberals accounted for about 55 percent of all TV ads aired in the contest, yet Hagan still lost to Tillis on Tuesday night. In the final days of North Carolina's race, which will likely go down as the most expensive Senate contest in U.S. history, a Senate-focused TV ad ran once every 50 seconds somewhere in the state. Most of the ads were decidedly negative. Meanwhile, in Virginia, incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Warner found himself in an unexpectedly close race with Republican challenger Ed Gillespie, a former lobbyist and ex-chairman of the Republican National Committee. The Virginia contest had been all but ignored by outside spending groups, and Warner himself ran more than half the approximately 26,000 TV ads aired in the race, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG. The Virginia Progress PAC, a single-candidate super PAC supporting Warner, aired about 3,400 ads, or about one of every eight TV ads. It told the FEC it spent about $1.8 million on ads, but it was silent since early October. Only one conservative outside group appears to have run TV ads in Virginia: the 60 Plus Association, which ran fewer than 400 spots, according to Kantar Media. Meanwhile, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, the lobbying wing of the gun rights powerhouse, reported spending about $410,000, much of it to promote Gillespie with phone calls and direct mail. As of press time, Warner held a very narrow lead over Gillespie. The increased use of big-money groups in politics--particularly those that do not reveal their funders--worries some political observers. ""The more undisclosed big money in elections, the poorer our democracy,"" said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California-Irvine and a Slate contributor. Disclosure ""helps to ferret out corruption,"" Hasen continued. ""When journalists and voters can follow the money, they can look for politicians acting in the interests of those who contribute or spend toward their election."" But former FEC Chairman Brad Smith, a Republican, thinks fears of dark money influencing the election are overblown. ""I have never heard, nor heard of, any ordinary voter expressing alarm that any particular ad was produced by a dark, scary money group,"" Smith said. Organizations that raise concerns about dark money, Smith continued, are part of ""an effort by people who really want to restrict political speech, to scare voters, and whip up fears about nothing."" The IRS plans to draft regulations in early 2015 that aim to crimp certain nonprofits' ability to engage in politics. Don McGahn, a former Republican chairman of the FEC and current attorney at law firm Jones Day, predicted such efforts may prove futile. ""If the IRS tries to change the rules, they're in for one hell of a fight,"" he said. ""It will get a lot of people wound up, and you'll see a lot of litigation.""

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/midterms_2014_washington_gridlock_cannot_get_any_worse.html	Since Barack Obama took office, the congressional wing of the Republican Party has had impressive success with a simple strategy: oppose everything the president supports, blame him for every problem and make him the central issue in each election. In 2010, this approach returned the House of Representatives to Republican control with a gain of 63 seats. In 2014, it delivered the Senate, which the GOP will now control by a majority of at least 52-48. One might assume that the latest Democratic rout means that polarization in Washington is about to get even worse. If extreme partisanship has worked so well for the party that now has full control of the legislative branch, are we not bound to go from a condition of hardly anything being accomplished in Washington to one of absolutely nothing being accomplished in Washington? In fact, the political situation could begin to evolve in a more positive direction come January. When Republicans had only partial control of Congress, it was rational, if cynical, for them to behave as if anything good that happened strengthened Obama's hand. A weak economy, even if worsened by a debt-ceiling crisis they instigated, was ultimately the president's problem, not theirs. But Republican incentives will be different in the days ahead. Cooperation with Obama--at least on selective matters of mutual concern--may make more sense than unflinching obstruction. The first argument for conciliation is that Republicans will soon bear an equal share of responsibility for what happens in Washington. They will have the power to pass bills on their own. Passing only legislation that Obama is certain to veto, like overturning the Affordable Care Act, will not win them much credit with voters. Conversely, vetoing any legislation whatsoever that Republicans are able to pass will consign Obama to premature irrelevance. This is a version of the logic that took hold after Republicans captured both houses of Congress in the 1994 election. Despite the bitter conflict that resulted in multiple government shutdowns, Bill Clinton and the Republicans managed to find common ground around a major welfare reform bill, a balanced budget, and numerous smaller issues. The next two years no longer are merely on Obama's watch; nor, with the economy on the upswing, will Republicans want them to be. A second reason that cooperation may increase in 2015 is the changing dynamic within the GOP. Until this year, the biggest hazard to Republican incumbents came from more extreme Tea Party conservatives. But in this year's primaries the Tea Party's power began to wane, as money from wealthy donors flowed to old stalwarts such as Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Pat Roberts of Kansas who were better positioned to keep their strongholds out of Democratic hands. This will be even more true in 2016, since turnout is far larger, and the electorate much more Democratic, in presidential election cycles. If you are a Republican incumbent who feels that the greatest threat to your job comes from your right, then you take a big risk when you side with Obama about anything. If, on the other hand, your principal worry is losing to a Democrat, you have an increased incentive to strike deals with the opposition on issues where Democratic positions are more popular than Republican ones. One final reason to hope for greater bipartisanship is that hyperpartisanship may finally have reached a kind of rational dead end. While elections are inherently a zero-sum game between the two parties, politics as a whole has the potential for other outcomes. Between elections, Democrats and Republicans have evolved a lose-lose game in which the inability to find any common ground reduces respect for everyone in office. A culture of strife and paralysis that breeds contempt for Washington as a whole makes all politicians less powerful and more miserable on a daily basis. Ultimately, frustration with Washington makes all incumbents more vulnerable to challenge from multiple directions. If voters continue to throw the bums out in election after election, the bum will eventually be you. These shifting incentives do not mean that one should expect cooperation across the board, or compromise on the most contentious issues such as immigration or federal spending. But Republicans may begin to find common ground with the president on issues where they do fundamentally agree, such as Trade Promotion Authority, or fixing the broken No Child Left Behind education law. In the end, the argument for more cooperation is a simple one. Washington gridlock cannot get much worse. So at some point, it will begin to get better. A version of this article also appeared in the Financial Times.	Washington Gridlock Cannot Get Any Worse
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/joni_ernst_iowa_senate_the_country_s_most_conservative_senate_candidate.html	"WEST DES MOINES, Iowa--""It's a long way from Red Oak to Washington, from the biscuit line at Hardee's to the United States Senate,"" Joni Ernst exulted on Tuesday night to a ballroom filled to capacity with her supporters. The soon-to-be freshman U.S. senator then paused before delivering her trademark line, the one she delivered with relish in a campaign ad that focused on her early-life vocation of hog castration. ""Thanks to all of you, we are heading to Washington. And we are going to make 'em squeal!"" The crowd, which had already worked itself into a restrained tizzy with the help of $5 beers and a Senate map that was getting redder by the minute, squealed with delight. That moment of castration-one-liner-induced glee notwithstanding, the Ernst victory party was much more victory than party. The crowd spent the first few hours cheering--albeit not too loudly--every time Ernst's name showed up on the Fox News ticker. Her supporters skewed to the older side, and the vast majority of them spent the night drinking responsibly and feasting on finger food that included chicken fingers and Chex Mix. The closest thing to flair that I saw all night was a single American flag hat. Earlier this year, it would've been laughable to suggest that a comfortable Ernst win would feel like such a non-event. In many ways, this was the most shocking GOP victory of the 2014 midterms. The 44-year-old Ernst, a state senator since 2011, was able to win a state that Obama took by 6 points over Mitt Romney in 2012 and by nearly 10 against John McCain in 2008. She will become Iowa's first female U.S. senator and, kind of shockingly, has the Hawkeye State's women to thank for it. According to CNN, the Republican fought her Democratic opponent, Rep. Bruce Braley, almost to a draw among female voters, 48 percent to 49--a major improvement from the 19-point gap Romney faced in 2012. Ernst's historic victory will also end Iowa's 30-year run with at least one Democrat in the Senate and, more importantly, helps ensure that Republicans will control the upper chamber next year. This was supposed to be the Democrats' race to lose--and in some ways that's exactly what happened. Buffeted by the in-state name recognition afforded a sitting congressman, Braley entered the race as the favorite to replace his fellow Democrat, retiring Sen. Tom Harkin. But Braley's early lead in the polls disappeared almost as soon as the general election began. As a four-term congressman running without the benefits of incumbency, Braley failed to generate the type of energy needed to cut through the political headwinds created by an unpopular president and an even more unpopular Congress. Video of him denigrating Iowa's senior senator, Republican Chuck Grassley, as ""a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school"" didn't help matters, either. But the bigger story was Ernst, the folksy state senator who talked like a Tea Partier but had the blessing of the GOP establishment. She burst out of the gates with that star-making ad--what a cliche: a candidate trading on her experience castrating hogs to win a Senate race--and stayed there with a campaign heavy on personality and light on policy. The ghosts of presidential elections past (Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee) and future (Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan), joined her on the stump, those bold-faced names helping her campaign paper over views that made her arguably the most conservative candidate on any statewide ballot in the country. Ernst, as liberals are eager to tell you, has logged some serious time out on the conservative fringes. She's dabbled in U.N. conspiracy theory, backed a ""personhood"" amendment, suggested Obama was a ""dictator"" who needed to be impeached, and vowed that she'd be willing to take up arms against her own government ""should they decide that my rights are no longer important."" Her less extreme views--a relative term--include abolishing both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Education. But to the great frustration of the Braley campaign, Iowans--and much of the media--didn't seem to notice. As Norm Ornstein argued last week, national outlets were unwilling to question the Beltway's conventional wisdom that the GOP had avoided anointing Todd Akin-like candidates who were too extreme to win a general election. (Meanwhile, Iowa media, as Alec MacGillis documents, was unable to pick up the slack.) The Ernst campaign eagerly embraced its new, and rather easily won, moderate image with a not-so-subtle makeover that included softening its campaign slogan from ""Soldier. Mother. Conservative."" to ""Soldier. Mother. Independent Leader."" The more moderate slogan didn't come with more moderate policy proposals, but that's largely because Ernst steered clear of policy on the campaign trail--something she continued to do Tuesday night. ""In Washington, politicians are more interested in talking than doing, they ignore problems hoping they'll just go away,"" she told the crowd before ticking off ISIS, the national debt, and the economy as examples of those problems. If Ernst has solutions to those problems, she's keeping them to herself for now. The most she had to say on the subject on Tuesday was telling the crowd that Washington needed a heavy dose of what she calls the ""Iowa way,"" a rather amorphous concept that she says includes things like ""honesty, service, and hard work."" Such lines may have suited her well on the campaign trail, but it remains to be seen how that will translate into lawmaking. ""We're taking the Iowa way all the way to Washington,"" Ernst promised. Once she does, Iowans and the rest of the country will at last find out exactly what that means."	The Country's Most Conservative Senate Candidate Scored a Huge Win. Now, What'll She Do in Washington?

They captured the Senate and gained seats in the House. But they didn't do it by running to the right. They did it, to a surprising extent, by embracing ideas and standards that came from the left. I'm not talking about gay marriage, on which Republicans have caved, or birth control, on which they've made over-the-counter access a national talking point. I'm talking about the core of the liberal agenda: economic equality. Here are some of the themes Republicans ran on in this year's Senate and gubernatorial campaigns: 1. Poverty. Democratic incumbents spent a lot of time talking about new jobs, economic growth, and other aggregate numbers that have been going in the right direction. Republican challengers undercut that message by focusing on people at the bottom. From California to Georgia to Virginia, Republicans called attention to high or rising poverty rates. 2. Minorities. Republicans also zeroed in on blacks and other underserved populations. In Louisiana right-wing candidate Rob Maness pointed out, ""Unemployment for young black men in this state is three times the rate of unemployment for anybody else."" In Georgia, Republican Gov. Nathan Deal emphasized the state's progress toward reducing the number of black men in jail. 3. Equal pay. Republicans researched how much money Democratic officeholders paid their male and female staffers. Any Democrat who paid women less was called out for it, regardless of circumstances. Republicans used this tactic in at least five states: Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. 4. Median income. One of the best ways to illuminate inequality is to measure the economy not by aggregate or average income, but by median income. Republicans hammered this figure in state after state, from Oregon to Arkansas to Georgia to Connecticut. ""Over the last several years, median household income in this state has declined by over $4,000,"" said Rep. Cory Gardner, the Republican Senate candidate in Colorado. ""In fact, it's been since 1999 that middle-class wages have stayed the same."" 5. Real unemployment. While Democratic incumbents bragged about declining unemployment, Republicans pointed out that this number omits people who are so discouraged they've stopped looking for work. This was a GOP talking point in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Oregon, and Virginia. Dan Sullivan, the party's nominee for the Senate in Alaska, put the argument this way:"	Republicans Won the Senate, But the Country's Politics Are Headed Toward the Left
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/d_c_marijuana_legalization_initiative_71_is_going_to_pass_and_could_show.html	"If the polling is right, residents of Washington, D.C., are likely to vote to legalize marijuana Tuesday. But it won't be the kind of legalization we've seen up to now. As written, D.C.'s Initiative 71 embodies a different--and perhaps better--approach to cannabis legalization than the laws already in effect in Colorado and Washington state, or the similar laws that Oregon and Alaska voters might adopt Tuesday. Those systems involve more or less the same policies that now apply to alcohol: private, for-profit production and sale, regulated and taxed by the state. By contrast, the proposed D.C. law won't allow any commercial activity. District residents will be able to grow a limited number of plants, possess a limited amount of the resulting cannabis, and give away--but not sell--whatever they don't want to smoke themselves. The system is called ""grow and give."" If that were the end of the story, Initiative 71 would be great news for people interested in a way forward for cannabis policy, making D.C. the laboratory for an interesting experiment. But passing Initiative 71 will only be the beginning of a complicated political process with an unpredictable outcome. The path already laid out by Colorado and Washington state is the obvious one. Since alcohol is the only intoxicating and sometimes habit-forming drug now legally available without a prescription, the alcohol system--regulated for-profit commerce--seems like the natural model to adopt when legalizing another intoxicating and sometimes habit-forming drug. But are we really satisfied with the results of the current alcohol system? Yes, the repeal of alcohol prohibition largely eliminated illicit alcohol production and sale, along with the organized crime, violence, enforcement activity, and corruption that bootlegging generated. What we got instead was the relentless promotion of drinking to excess--from the Super Bowl to spring break--with the result that alcohol now accounts for more substance use disorder, more violence (especially sexual assault and domestic violence), more health damage, more injury, more death, and even more arrests than all illicit drugs combined. About 100,000 Americans each year die of the consequences of their own drinking or someone else's: from stroke, cancer, liver disease, heart disease, accidents, homicides, and suicides. Cannabis, which doesn't generally unleash violence and has less dramatic health risks, is unlikely to generate similar levels of misery, even if we treat it legally the same way we treat alcohol. But the commercial imperative to move the product in volume will give the cannabis industry the same incentive the alcohol industry now has to encourage excessive use. And we can also expect the legal cannabis industry to lobby as fiercely against adequate levels of taxation and regulation as the alcohol lobby does, very successfully, today. In Washington state, where my firm advised the Liquor Control Board on establishing regulations for the new commercial cannabis industry, the unlicensed and unregulated medical marijuana sector has, so far, fought off all legislative attempts to rein it in. The same thing happened this year in California, where a bill to regulate the $1 billion medical marijuana industry died in committee despite the sponsorship of the president of the state Senate and the support of advocates of commercial cannabis legalization. If the goal is to allow adults to toke up in peace--without the hassle of finding a ""420-friendly"" physician and pretending to have some ailment--and to stop arresting so many users and low-level cannabis dealers, disproportionately poor and minorities, it can be done without involving the ""potrepreneurs"" now hoping to cash in on the Green Rush. D.C. should try ""grow and give"" and see how it works. It wouldn't generate any tax revenue, or offer consumers the same convenience or product variety as a commercial system, and of course policing the boundary between ""giving"" and ""selling"" would be virtually impossible. But it might be a big improvement on the current prohibition. Eliminating organized marketing would likely lead to a much smaller increase--if any--in cannabis abuse than we would expect if we sell pot the way we now sell beer. Still, ""grow and give"" isn't the only option between full-on prohibition and commercial legalization. We could restrict production and sale to consumer-owned cooperatives, or to not-for-profit enterprises, or to stockholder-owned public-benefit corporations whose chartered purposes include the promotion of moderate consumption and whose boards would include experts in public health, pediatrics, and drug abuse prevention. Unfortunately, we couldn't imitate another post-Prohibition alcohol strategy adopted by some states and restrict retail sales to government-owned stores, because neither the District nor a state government can tell its employees to violate federal law, as cannabis growing and cannabis sales still do. Even a commercial market could have more safeguards than the Colorado or Washington state systems feature. States could require that the retail sales force be trained in pharmacology and drug abuse prevention, or create systems of user-set but vendor-enforced personal quotas on weekly or monthly purchase amounts as an aid to people who want help controlling their cannabis use. (One in six people who have used cannabis in the past month reports finding it difficult to avoid going overboard, which is not surprising, given that one in three people who have used pot in the past month reports having lit up on 21 or more of the past 30 days, according to analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health by Jonathan Caulkins and Maria Cuellar of Carnegie Mellon University. There are about seven times as many of those heavy users today as there were in 1992.) States that legalize could at least use production caps or high taxes to prevent the collapse in marijuana prices that will surely result from substituting cheap legal production for expensive illegal production. D.C. already has a small cannabis industry, including cultivators, thanks to its restricted medical marijuana regime, and advocates for full legalization aren't satisfied with ""grow and give."" Once Initiative 71 has passed, they intend to ask the elected officials of Washington to create a full commercial system; the D.C. Council is already planning to work on it over the next few months, and the two leading candidates for mayor have said they would support such a move. The wild card in the deck is the possibility that Congress will interfere before D.C. has a chance to implement any cannabis system: If passed, Initiative 71, like all D.C. laws, is subject to a congressional review period. (Republicans failed earlier this year to gut D.C.'s recently passed marijuana-decriminalization legislation.) Whatever happens on Capitol Hill, here's hoping the debate on Initiative 71 takes into account the potential losses from full commercialization as well as the potential gains, and that D.C. decides to experiment with something other than the tired commercial formula that serves us so badly when it comes to alcohol.  Making mistakes is inevitable; repeating the same mistake seems unnecessary."	D.C. Is About to Legalize Pot. Can It Keep the Cannabis Industry Out?

One of the quickest ways to tell how big or little of a Republican wave this election brings will be to look at what the partisans are saying as the night progresses. Below are live tweets from some of the top pundits and politicos on Twitter. On the left-hand side of the screen, you'll see the liberal tweets. On the right-hand side, you'll get the conservative ones. Our instant spin room should let you know who's winning, who's losing, and what it all means.	What Conservatives and Liberals Are Saying About the 2014 Midterm Results
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/tom_steyer_spent_57_million_to_get_voters_to_care_about_climate_change_it.html	"This election cycle's biggest spender--at least among those who operate through the fully disclosed part of the political system, a.k.a. not the Koch brothers--is liberal billionaire Tom Steyer, who doled out at least $57 million of his own cash to try to get voters to care about climate change. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV), an environmental group, dumped another $25 million this year into the 2014 races, about $5 million more than it spent in 2010 and 2012 combined. All told, environmentalist organizations say they'll pour $85 million into the midterms. As LCV president Gene Karpinski declared proudly to the Washington Post late last month, ""This is by far the biggest investment that the environmental community has ever made in politics."" What has all that green gotten these green groups? Not a whole heck of a lot. Steyer and his like-minded allies opened their checkbooks with the hopes of making climate change a front-burner issue. But as the most expensive midterm election in American history wraps up, it's clear that environmentalists will fall far short of that goal. A Pew Research Center poll from September found that the environment came in a distant eighth among a list of 11 campaign issues that matter most to voters. Look past national polling to individual Senate races, and the picture isn't much prettier. Steyer's NextGen Climate Action super PAC has deployed the bulk of its resources to protect Democratic seats in Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Colorado. Those races--along with gubernatorial contests in Florida and Maine, where the group is also spending heavily--share a common theme: a Democratic candidate who is, to varying degrees, climate conscious, and a Republican opponent who is anything but. We don't know yet how those races will shake out, but regardless of the outcomes it will be difficult for anyone to make the case that climate was the decisive issue in any of them. As my colleague John Dickerson has already explained, the one issue that's resonated on the campaign trail this year is President Obama's raging unpopularity. Drill down a little deeper into the Pew numbers, meanwhile, and you find an electorate that's much more likely to pick a candidate based on the economy, Obamacare, and terrorism than her views on the environment. That's something even greens have come to accept. Environmental groups have increased the scope of their attack ads so much that some don't even mention climate change at all. Such decisions reflect the reality that climate has yet to prove itself as a decisive issue on the campaign trail. The biggest ideological gap on the topic is arguably in Iowa, where Rep. Bruce Braley voted for the House's cap-and-trade bill, and his opponent, Joni Ernst, wants to abolish the EPA all together. Braley entered the race as a moderate favorite but saw his early lead evaporate in the face of a surprisingly strong challenge from Ernst, a folksy state senator with an extremely conservative track record. NextGen and other green groups have spent more than $2.3 million airing more than 11,000 ads in the Hawkeye State trying to push Braley back on track, but Ernst continues to edge ahead in the polls. According to FiveThirtyEight, she's a 70 percent favorite to win heading into Election Day. Republican Cory Gardner holds a similar lead over Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado's climate-friendly incumbent. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has the lead in New Hampshire over GOP challenger Scott Brown, and Democrat Gary Peters is a massive favorite in Michigan over Republican Terri Lynn Land. ""We want 2014 to be a pivot year for climate--the year we can demonstrate that you can use climate change as a wedge issue to win in political races,"" Chris Lehane, the veteran Democratic strategist behind Steyer's super PAC, told reporters in May. Five months later, Lehane is looking for symbolic victories rather than electoral ones. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle over the weekend, Lehane suggested the effort shouldn't be judged on Election Day outcomes alone. He suggested that once Republicans recognize an issue is ""problematic for them, that's when you begin to get the whole paradigm to flip."" That, he said, is already happening with climate. As proof, he pointed to a handful of examples of conservative candidates touting something that kinda sorta resembles green bona fides. One such example: a small moment in one of the Iowa debates in which Ernst told voters, ""I drive a hybrid car, and my family recycles everything."" The only reason that line is notable, though, is that Ernst has been unrelentingly hostile to climate science on the campaign trail. And it won't matter what she drives if she gives the GOP the votes it needs to cut the EPA's budget next year. Muddling the money men's message even more is the fact that these four Senate races are mostly about protecting what the climate crowd already has. All four seats are currently held by Democrats, either by incumbents running for re-election or retiring lawmakers they hope will be followed by Democratic successors. Even a vanishingly unlikely four-for-four sweep would represent, at best, something that looks like the status quo, which hasn't exactly produced the type of victories that environmentalists dream about. Given the fact that, here in the real world, the GOP appears poised to take over control of the Senate, that status quo sounds positively dreamy to greens right now. A Republican-led Senate would seriously damage the nation's effort to combat climate change. Efforts to strip the EPA of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases would likely be blocked by filibustering Democrats or a vetoing president, but such an attempt would put environmentalists on the defensive at a time when affirmative measures are needed. The GOP could also cut the agency's funding and generally make things difficult by hauling EPA officials in front of Congress on a regular basis. As the Brookings Institution's managing director William Antholis noted recently, every minor move could have major global repercussions at next year's UN climate convention in Paris, where the Obama administration will try to convince international leaders that the United States is finally getting serious about combating man-made climate change. It was always going to be an uphill battle for environmentalists. They face the same political headwinds that are making life difficult for liberals in general: an unpopular president and an unforgiving electoral map. Their realistic best-case scenario heading into Election Day was always going to be limiting Democratic losses. Short-term setbacks aside, Steyer views his midterm-spending spree as a down payment on the future. He targeted the races he did because of their importance for 2014 and 2016--there's a reason that both Iowa and New Hampshire are on the list. ""Our feeling on 2014 is, we want to do things that are both substantively important and will have legs after that,"" Steyer told the New York Times in February. ""We don't want to go someplace, win and move on."" Now that winning seems out of the question, the bigger question Steyer and his court face is how to rally their deep-pocketed allies in the future. How can they convince wealthy benefactors to open up their checkbooks in 2016 and 2018 if they can't produce anything resembling a victory in 2014?"

The Wisconsin Republican trucks around his district with his wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, and their seven kids (ages 6 months to 15 years) as well as their campaign staff. There's a very high child-to-staffer ratio. One of the young girls always totes her stuffed dog, Ra-Ra, and the whole family, including the 6-month-old, sports black-and-red plaid. It's all very on-brand, as Duffy was a lumberjack in another life. No child has yet been left behind at an event. Duffy has one of the more interesting resumes in Congress. As well as lumberjacking and working as a bus driver for a year in the ski town of Breckenridge, Colorado, he was a cast member on The Real World: Boston and Road Rules: All Stars, where he and his wife met. Though his national name recognition is probably lower now than during the zenith of his MTV days, he has fans in higher places. If anyone can parlay reality television celebrity into genuine public policy clout--and this would be a big if--it's Duffy. More than 34,000 people have competed on reality shows in the United States since 2005, according to author Seth Kaufman, but Duffy is the only one you will find on the Hill. American idol alum Clay Aiken is facing Rep. Renee Ellmers in North Carolina, but that candidacy seems to be going nowhere. And though Duck Dynasty relative Zach Dasher is running in Louisiana against ""Kissing Congressman"" Vance McAllister, he wouldn't technically count since he isn't listed as a cast member. So unless Bristol Palin, Donald Trump, or a Kardashian decide to bless America by running for Congress sometime soon, Duffy is it. And the fact that a substantial portion of his 20s is on video doesn't seem to have limited his political ambitions (which should be comforting to young Facebook users everywhere). In fact, it seems to be a net plus. Fellow Wisconsinite and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus thinks he's a rising star for the party. And Wisconsin Republicans see him as a potential contender for statewide office; he's a key member of their farm team. One might assume that making the transition from reality television to Capitol Hill is complicated. But it doesn't have to be. After wrapping up his final MTV gig--Andrew Romano has a rundown of his TV career at the Daily Beast--Duffy and his wife moved back to Hayward, Wisconsin, his hometown. He'd taken time off from law school to do the TV shows, so he just picked up where he left off. His novelty status as a reality TV star helped him get cases when he first started practicing law, he said, and he soon became a special prosecutor for the Ashland, Wisconsin, district attorney. Later he became the D.A. And when Duffy decided to challenge the incumbent Democratic congressman Dave Obey, his MTV past was a perk. ""It was something different, helping us just separate ourselves, and get a little extra press, a little extra attention,"" Duffy says. ""We're not here because of reality TV. We ran a really good race, and we used every tool that we had."" (Obey decided to retire after Duffy announced he was entering the race.) Duffy's most immediate goal is to get re-elected on Tuesday. His district, which takes up much of the northern half of the state, is the geographically largest in Wisconsin, and it's a swing district. President Obama won it by eight points in 2008, and Mitt Romney won by a few in 2012. Duffy's team doesn't seemed worried about re-election, and the Cook Political Report rates the race as ""solid Republican,"" but Duffy still campaigns hard and goes back to the district every weekend. On the Saturday before Election Day, he and his family joined RNC Chairman Priebus and Gov. Scott Walker for a rally in Eau Claire. Priebus described Duffy in terms that were nothing short of effusive. ""He's young, he's got great family, he's charismatic, he's smart, he looks good, he's the whole package,"" Priebus said. ""Sean's the future of America."" After the Eau Claire rally, ""the future of America"" and his brood headed to a restaurant called The Bog in Warrens, where Rachel and the 6-month-old were immediately swarmed by middle-aged women. Then it was on to the final stop of the day, a meeting with volunteers at the Barron County GOP headquarters in Rice Lake, Wisconsin. There, they meet up with Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, the dean of the Wisconsin delegation and another big Duffy booster. Over dinner at a nearby supper club, Sensenbrenner explained that his relationship with the Duffy family goes deeper than just politics. Duffy and Rep. Paul Ryan are close--both are practicing Catholics, and their kids have slumber parties together--and they played an outsized role in Sensenbrenner's recent conversion to Catholicism. Sensenbrenner, then Anglican, faced a personal crisis in May. ""There was a conspiracy against me,"" he says flatly. ""My wife had a very serious brain aneurysm, and I was spiritually adrift. Two of my colleagues, loving their neighbor as theirselves--all of a sudden I got these pastoral calls from Cardinal Dolan, who I got to know very very well when he was in Milwaukee."" Timothy Dolan, currently Archbishop of New York, was previously Archbishop of Milwaukee, so his diocese and Sensenbrenner's congressional distract overlapped. Duffy laughs at the ""loving their neighbor"" comment. ""We made certain people aware that we thought he was vulnerable to conversion,"" he says. ""A little push could be helpful."" Duffy didn't go into explicit detail, but the gist is this: He and Ryan communicated to the right people that Dolan ought to call Sensenbrenner about his wife's health issues and, maybe, about crossing the Tiber. ""I would not use the word 'vulnerable,' "" says Sensenbrenner. ""But I would agree with the push."" ""Perhaps 'amenable,' "" says Rachel. Dolan came to Milwaukee in August to confirm Sensenbrenner into the Catholic Church. The Duffys attended the ceremony. ""Ever since they convinced me to become Catholic, I've become very warm and cuddly,"" Sensenbrenner deadpans. After Election Day, expect the Republican Party to call on Duffy to use his powers of persuasion for a far larger audience."	Is Sean Duffy the GOP's Next Big Wisconsin Political Star?
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/florida_may_say_no_to_medical_marijuana_why_the_sunshine_state_may_turn.html	"Florida was supposed to change the way the South thinks about medical marijuana. In late July, a full 88 percent of the state supported legalizing medical cannabis, and in early October 67 percent supported Amendment 2 specifically.* Instead, that wide margin has all but disappeared, and rather than join the 23 other states with similar laws on the books, the amendment appears to be bleeding support by the hour. A private trend poll commissioned by an out-of-state company has shown a clear downward tick in the final week before Election Day, and a Tampa Bay Times ""insiders poll"" of state political experts has more than 80 percent expecting a loss. It's still too close to call, but if the initiative fails on Tuesday, Florida will make a different sort of history: It will be the largest state to ever reject legal medical marijuana by popular vote. ""It seemed like we had the prime opportunity for Florida to do something novel and different,"" said state Rep. Katie Edwards, a Democrat from Broward County who co-sponsored a successful, but more limited, compassion law for severely sick patients earlier this year. ""So what the hell happened?"" Opinions and frustrations over the amendment's nosedive are not in short supply, and blame is already being widely ascribed. But in conversations with those involved, one common culprit is revealed: dysfunctional partisanship. United for Care, the group promoting the amendment, is a strictly Democratic affair, and the campaign's financial burden has been carried almost entirely by one man--Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, a household name in Florida for his ubiquitous television commercials. Morgan has made compassion a hallmark of his ""Yes on 2"" campaign, and he points to his brother, who was paralyzed from the chest down at 18 years old and suffers from chronic pain and spasms, as an example of a patient in need. Nevertheless, the campaign that Morgan has bankrolled with roughly $4 million of his own money has become inseparable from party politics and Charlie Crist, the Democratic candidate for governor who happens to work at Morgan's Orlando law firm. Since it launched, Florida Republicans have suspected that Morgan's campaign is actually an effort to pump voter turnout in an off-year election and help Crist eke out a win against incumbent Gov. Rick Scott. Morgan denies he's playing politics, telling the Tampa Tribune that he's ""not as smart or devious as they think I am."" And yet, when he hired a campaign manager, he picked Ben Pollara, an operative who describes himself as ""one of the premier Democratic fundraisers in Florida."" Pollara served on President Obama's 2012 National Finance Committee, was the state finance director for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, and has represented Democrats including Sen. Bill Nelson, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. ""It has not been a bipartisan campaign,"" says Pollara. ""The opposition has been run entirely by Republican operatives and funded by Republican mega-donors."" Indeed, Pollara is now in the unenviable position of running a campaign against Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas business tycoon who in 2012 spent more money than any single person has ever spent on an American election. On May 29, Adelson sent $2.5 million to the Drug Free Florida Committee and to date has contributed $5 million, or 85 percent of the total budget against the measure. Some speculate that Adelson's interest is personal; the Adelsons lost a son to a drug overdose in 2005. Others think he is simply trying to turn out conservative voters to help Gov. Scott. Regardless, according to Stephen Gutwillig at the Drug Policy Alliance, Adelson has made this the most well-funded drug policy campaign, ever. ""It's very unusual for an issue with such widespread mainstream support,"" Gutwillig said, citing the surge in national approval of medical cannabis. The ""No on 2"" campaign has spent most of its windfall on a deluge of television ads that started running statewide at the end of September, about a month after August polling detected a falloff in support. The ads are savvy--dressing up tiny decontextualized bits of fact with a high gloss of exaggeration and fear-mongering. ""It's hard enough to reach Florida's supermajority without an onslaught of misleading ads,"" says Gutwillig. What makes the entire struggle over Amendment 2 harder to understand is that there was strong bipartisan support for medicinal marijuana in the state even a few months ago. In March, two young state representatives, Republican Matt Gaetz, 32, and Democrat, Katie Edwards, 33, teamed up to sponsor the Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act. The law, which Gaetz characterized as ""a bipartisan effort from start to finish,"" permits certain high-CBD and low-THC strains to be prescribed for children and adults with epilepsy, cancer, and other chronic conditions. The bill sailed through the Republican-controlled legislature. ""I do believe that cannabis is medicine,"" said Gaetz, a panhandle conservative. ""I support a more modern cannabis policy in my state, and I am the chairman of the Criminal Justice Committee."" But he never supported the Amendment 2 ballot initiative. ""Mostly because I wasn't really involved in the creation of Amendment 2."" Pollara never reached out to Gaetz, the key pro-cannabis Republican in the state. ""We have not really been pursuing endorsements from elected officials,"" Pollara explained. ""Most people have no idea who their state representative and state senator are, much less care what they think about medical marijuana."" Even Democratic lawmakers don't agree with that analysis. ""If you're going to pass a constitutional amendment in Florida, you have to have bipartisan support and bipartisan outreach,"" Edwards said. Early on, medical marijuana in Florida, and Amendment 2 specifically, had an ideologically diverse base of support. The movement even included Roger Stone, the veteran political strategist who has been working as a libertarian consultant since he formally left the GOP after more than 30 years as a party insider. ""All of my activism on behalf of medicinal marijuana was altruistic. I'm a libertarian, and it's what I believe,"" said Stone. But as he watched the campaign over Amendment 2 turn into a political knife fight, something Stone knows all too well, he walked away. Nearly $10 million has been spent on Amendment 2 in Florida, and if it loses on Tuesday, it will be a rare--and costly--loss for the forces pushing to liberalize medical marijuana around the country. Referendums on full and regulated legalization will also be decided on Tuesday in Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia, all of which are trending more favorably than Florida's Amendment 2. ""The campaign got embroiled in gubernatorial politics, and it's a tragedy,"" Stone said. ""The reason it's a tragedy is because the people who really need help will suffer. They needed this to be truly bipartisan, and it wasn't."" *Correction, Nov. 3, 2014: This article originally misstated the percentage of Floridians who supported Amendment 2. Eight-eight percent of the state supported legalizing medical cannabis as of July, and in early October 67 percent supported Amendment 2 specifically. (Return.)"	Medical Marijuana Is Legalizing Everywhere. Why Not Florida?
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/american_melting_pot_how_slowing_down_immigration_could_help_us_build_a.html	"I'm obsessed with the idea of America as a melting pot. We owe the term to Israel Zangwill, who wrote a mostly forgotten play of the same name in 1908. (I remember it like it was yesterday ...) The play was forgettable, but the snazzy metaphor was not. ""Yes, East and West, and North and South, the palm and the pine, the pole and the equator, the crescent and the cross--how the great Alchemist melts and fuses them with his purging flame!"" How indeed! Much to my chagrin, the melting pot metaphor has been out of style for decades. Way back in 1963, Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously lamented that in New York City, at least, we were already ""beyond the melting pot,"" as various ethnic groups maintained their distinctiveness generation after generation. In 1972, Michael Novak wrote Rise of the Unmeltable Ethnics, a quirky defense of ethnic particularity and lower-middle-class cultural conservatism against the (alleged) homogenizing influence of academic liberalism. Then, of course, there was the rise of multiculturalism, which held that diversity ought to be celebrated, and that there was something both tragic and unjust about the expectation that members of ethnic minority groups ought to surrender what separates them from the cultural mainstream. America is no longer a melting pot, we're told. It's more like a salad bowl, full of ingredients that retain their unique flavors. As delicious as this multiethnic salad sounds--more croutons, please--I continue to be the melting pot's biggest fan. As a consequence, I've gone from being a rah-rah enthusiast for mass immigration to one who is more skeptical of its virtues. That's because I think the melting and fusing of different ethnic groups is essential to building a more cohesive and humane society, and that slowing down immigration would help this process along. The biggest challenge we face in the United States, in my view, is a lack of togetherness. I realize that this sounds like a line from a cheesy love ballad, but bear with me. There is a vast gulf separating those who belong to networks of family members, friends, and acquaintances that grant access to valuable social goods and those who don't belong to these networks. What kind of social goods do I have in mind? Money is the obvious one, but so is know-how. Most people learn to make their way in the world from parents or peers. Think about every job opportunity you've ever had, or how you learned to navigate any big, impersonal bureaucracy. The insider knowledge that was imparted to you was not available to just anyone--you, and those close to you, had privileged access to it, and whether you like it or not, this privileged access has played a central role in your successes. This isn't simply a racial inequality. There are plenty of ultra-connected people from minority backgrounds and there are plenty of whites who are outsiders in every socially relevant respect. But race is often used as a rough proxy for this kind of inequality because it is generally true that an American who can trace her roots back to the Mayflower will have a bigger, richer, and let's say more privileged network than a descendant of slaves, or a recent immigrant with little in the way of formal education. Race also allows us to identify this phenomenon in the data. Last summer, for example, Elizabeth Ananat, Shihe Fu, and Stephen L. Ross released an important working paper, which found that the gap in average wages between whites and blacks gets bigger as the size of the city in which they live gets bigger. Their (fascinating) explanation for this finding is that while workers benefit from the knowledge spillovers that come from living and working in a place where there is a higher concentration of people doing a certain kind of job, these spillovers tend to be bounded by race. That is, blacks have fewer same-race peers than whites from whom they can learn new skills and suss out new opportunities, and so whites gain more insider knowledge with each passing year, which in turn allows them to earn more money. There are, of course, some blacks (and Asians and Latinos) who are plugged into ""white"" networks, which aren't always lily-white, especially in places like Silicon Valley and Wall Street. As a general rule, however, race makes a big difference. Instead of calling this racial inequality, you could call it roots inequality. Who among us has the firmest, deepest roots in American life, which can allow us to stumble and make mistakes while still being able to depend on loved ones who can lend a hand? This isn't so much about how long one's ancestors have been in the country. Rather, it is about the solidity of your connections to other people who themselves stand on solid ground, and who can afford to offer help of all kinds, monetary and otherwise, when you need it. Earlier this week, Richard V. Reeves and Joanna Venator of the Brookings Institution observed that educated people tend to have educated parents. This news will probably not shock you. What is interesting is that the transmission of education advantage from one generation to the next seems to be even stronger than the transmission of economic advantage, at least for the children of the most educated parents. Reeves and Venator suggest that a big part of the story is the rise of positive assortative mating, the phenomenon in which people with similar levels of education marry each other. This contributes to household income inequality, predictably enough. Yet it has another, subtler effect. When a college-educated adult has a child with a non-college-educated adult, she can pass along her tacit knowledge about what it takes to make it through the educational system even if her partner isn't in the same boat. When two non-college-educated adults have a child, that young person is going to have a much tougher time working the system. It's no coincidence that the high-achieving, low-income students who never make it to selective schools are disproportionately drawn from the children of non-college-educated parents, and from rural areas and small cities. These kids might have high grades and test scores, but they don't belong to the networks that grease the wheels of upward mobility. What does any of this have to do with immigration? Americans are, for obvious historical reasons, deeply romantic about the immigrant experience. More than one-tenth of Americans, like me, are the children of immigrants, and there are many more third- and fourth- and fifth-generation Americans raised with heady stories about flinty ancestors. The truth is that some immigrants are poised for great success in a society like ours, and others will have a tough time making their way into the middle class. If we accept that we have a collective responsibility for the well-being of every member of our society, as I think we should, it makes sense to select immigrants who have at least a fighting chance of making it. When thinking about which immigrants do have that fighting chance, it's important to recognize that the economic realities of the first decades of the last century are profoundly different from those of the first decades of this one. That earlier era was one of labor scarcity, when people with limited skills could climb the economic ladder by doing dangerous, strenuous work. In today's economy, people with limited skills are finding that market wages are stagnant or even falling. The educational gap between immigrants and natives in the 1900s was modest when compared to the yawning gap that separates them today. Earlier this year, the OECD, the consortium of the world's rich democracies, released its latest assessment of adult skills. The survey divvies up people from age of 16 to 65 into several levels of proficiency in literacy, numeracy, and, my personal favorite, ""problem-solving in technology-rich environments."" A disturbingly high 18 percent of Americans fell in Level 1 or below (the lowest proficiency levels) in literacy, 30 percent in numeracy, and 61 percent in problem solving. The numbers were far worse for U.S. immigrants, 40 percent of whom fell in Level 1 or below on literacy, 48 percent on numeracy, and 76 percent in problem solving. Given the transmission of educational advantage from one generation to the next, it is a safe bet that second-generation Americans like me are overrepresented among the lowest native-born performers. The fact that our immigration policy has in recent decades tended to lower the average skill level of our workforce isn't news, or at least it shouldn't be. What we often fail to appreciate is how the fact that so many immigrants have such limited skills interacts with the rise of positive assortative mating and opportunity hoarding. College-educated people tend to marry other college-educated people, and we are all more likely to share opportunities with people in our networks than with random strangers. Those realities mean that newcomers to our society with below-average skill levels, as well as their children and even their grandchildren, are going to have a hard time getting past the bottom rungs of American society. If you believe Gregory Clark, an iconoclastic economist at UC-Davis, it might take even more than three generations for the descendants of less-skilled immigrants to reach an average level of social status. Legalizing large numbers of unauthorized immigrants will definitely help them attain that social status. Yet it won't change the fact that even under the best circumstances, the wages commanded by people with less than a high school diploma tend to be very low, and the social connections they can draw upon are usually limited to other people facing similar challenges. Moreover, while the best evidence we have finds that less-skilled immigration doesn't have a negative effect on the wages of less-skilled natives, it does have a substantial negative effect on the wages of less-skilled immigrants already living in the U.S. These are precisely the people who have the weakest social connections to other Americans, and who need all the help they can get to put down roots in this country. Which brings me back to the melting pot. There is an alternative to allowing today's less-skilled immigrants and their descendants to form the bedrock of an ever-expanding underclass. There is a way to help poor members of our foreign-born population form the social connections they will need to move from the margins of American society to the mainstream. What we need to do is limit the future influx of less-skilled immigrants. Zangwill wrote The Melting Pot in the 1900s, but the true heyday of cultural amalgamation, among whites at least, started in the 1920s, when the United States shut off the spigot of European immigration for three generations. Mary C. Waters, the Harvard sociologist best known for her work on Caribbean immigrant identity, has written that ""in the absence of appreciable numbers of new arrivals successive generations of acculturated Americans, not unassimilated greenhorns, became the majority among the new ethnics."" This in turn meant that for second-, third-, and fourth-generation Italian and Polish Americans, ""ethnicity became less intense and increasingly intermittent, voluntary, even recreational."" Ethnic enclaves slowly faded away and the descendants of European immigrants intermarried their way into the mainstream. Now, in contrast, ethnic enclaves in our biggest cities are flourishing, and expanding their footprints--the booming Chinatowns of Brooklyn and Queens stand in stark contrast to Manhattan's fading Little Italy. Those Chinese Americans who, in effect, ""exit"" their ethnic groups by assimilating and intermarrying and leaving Chinatown behind are, Waters explains, replaced by new arrivals who are content to lead a Chinese life on American soil. Distinct ethnic cultures are continually being replenished through immigration. For Waters, this means that the story of assimilation--the third-generation Chinese American who gets an MFA at Yale, marries an Anglo investment banker, and who hardly ever sets foot in Chinatown--is obscured by this parallel story of ethnic replenishment. It is also true, however, that ethnic replenishment will tend to limit assimilation and intermarriage, as most people prefer to marry and socialize with members of their own group. So if we want the Mexican and Bangladeshi immigrants of our time to fare as well as the Italian and Polish immigrants of yesteryear, we need to do two things. First, we need to spend a considerable amount of money to upgrade their skills and those of their children, as the world has grown less kind to those who make a living by the sweat of their brow. Because public money is scarce, this is a good reason to limit the influx of people who will need this kind of expensive, extensive support to become full participants in American society. Second, we need to recognize that a continual stream of immigration tends to keep minority ethnic groups culturally isolated, which is yet another reason to slow things down. No, this won't suddenly mean that poor immigrants will become rich, and that well-heeled insiders will stop hoarding opportunities. But it will give us the time we need to knit America's newcomers into our national community."	Let's Bring Back the American Melting Pot by Slowing Down Immigration

Maybe it's the panic over Ebola. Maybe it's the chorus of Republicans touting birth-control pills. Maybe it's the parade of Democrats bragging about their guns. That's all pretty strange. But the weirdest thing, in my book, isn't any of these. It's the long line of politicians pandering for votes along the border with Canada by promising to seal the border with Mexico. Anyone genuinely concerned about terrorist infiltration of the United States would look north, not south. The FBI's list of major terrorism cases includes several with Canadian roots. In 1999, a would-be bomber was caught crossing the border from British Columbia to Washington state. In 2004, Canadian Mounties helped the FBI bust a Saudi money launderer who thought he was financing a Hezbollah operation linked to Little Rock, Arkansas, and Montreal. In 2007, three men were convicted of participating in a jihadist cell that ""operated from many cities in the United States and Canada."" The FBI doesn't mention Mexico in connection with a single case on the list. But that hasn't stopped politicians in our northernmost states from ignoring Canada and ranting instead about security threats to the south. Why? Because border security, as a campaign issue, is a fraud. It's not about security. It's about playing on fears of Latin Americans. Here's a cross-country tour of the demagoguery. Minnesota, Aug. 14. Two days after winning the Republican primary, Senate candidate Mike McFadden calls on Sen. Al Franken to reconvene Congress to address the crisis in Texas. ""We have a humanitarian and security crisis along our southern border,"" says McFadden. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that McFadden issued the statement ""from north-central Minnesota."" Washington, Oct. 6. Republican Clint Didier, running for Congress in a district that covers more than 100 miles of the Canadian border, releases an ad about border security. ""National security begins at home, on the border,"" Didier warns as short-sleeved Latinos stroll across the screen. ""Criminals from all over the world are sneaking in."" As the video continues, a border volunteer, identified as a Texas rancher, describes a scene: ""This is a coyote leading a group of Middle Easterners into our country."" Didier concludes: ""ISIS is already in Juarez. How long till they hit us?"" Idaho, Oct. 6. During a campaign debate, Republican Sen. Jim Risch pulls out a bar graph. ""Look at what President Obama did,"" he fumes, holding up the sheet for the cameras. ""This is a chart of unaccompanied children entering the United States illegally. ... The numbers have skyrocketed since 2012 with people pouring in here. This has got to stop."" Idaho, Oct. 9. Republican Rep. Raul Labrador is asked why he hasn't done more in office. He responds by pointing to House-passed legislation that would facilitate deportations and National Guard deployments along the Mexican border. ""Just two months ago we had a big debate about immigration in Congress, about what was happening at the border,"" he says. ""It was because of me and because of my leadership that we actually passed something."" Michigan, Oct. 15. The GOP's Senate nominee, Terri Lynn Land, releases an ad outlining her agenda. It shows a patrol vehicle cruising along a desert border fence, followed by a video clip of ISIS fighters. ""Congress and the president have failed,"" says Land, narrating the ad. ""They spent too much. Our border isn't secure. And they've made America less safe."" She ends with three calls to action. The first is: ""Let's secure the border."" Maine, Oct. 16. Bruce Poliquin, a Republican and former state treasurer, is running for Congress in the second district, which spans more than 600 miles of the Canadian border. (Maine is also the state from which Mohammed Atta embarked on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.) During a debate, Poliquin is asked what the government should do to control Ebola.

Bolton's spokesman said the former United Nations ambassador will head to the Granite State this weekend to make a campaign stop for Republican House candidate Marilinda Garcia, with whom he held a national security press conference earlier this month. He will also do some phone-banking for the state Republican Party. On top of that, his political action committee recently gave the state party $10,000, and he will soon be announced as a member of the Chairman's Circle (a small group of significant donors to the party that, per the Daily Caller also includes Sen. Kelly Ayotte, former Sen. Scott Brown, and Sen. Rand Paul). It appears to be part of Bolton's effort to expand his role from a leading conservative foreign policy player to powerful politico. Bolton has never run for elected office and has spent the bulk of his career in the executive branch--he was in Ronald Reagan's and George H. W. Bush's administrations, as well as being George W. Bush's undersecretary of state for arms control and international security before getting bumped up to the U.N. job. Though he's been a surrogate for Mitt Romney and John McCain, electoral politics is a bit of a shift from his M.O. And this cycle, he's busy. His super PAC has made independent expenditures to run ads boosting Scott Brown and Garcia, his PAC and super PAC have together raised more than $7 million, and he's endorsed 85 Republican candidates (including Maryland congressional candidate Alex Mooney, Iowa Rep. Steve King, Arizona congressional candidate Martha McSally, Arkansas Senate candidate Tom Cotton, New York congressional candidate Elise Stefanik, and Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts). The trip won't just be about politicking, though. Bolton is also slated to have a private meeting with the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute for Politics, a rite of passage for serious potential presidential contenders. In August 2013, he told the National Review that he was eyeing a 2016 presidential bid, citing dismay at President Obama's foreign policy. That still seems to be very much on the table. In an email, Bolton described himself as ""a libertarian conservative on most domestic issues"" and was critical of both parties for de-emphasizing the national security issues that are his bread and butter. ""I set up the PAC and SuperPAC because national security has been eclipsed by other issues under the Obama administration and due to an inadequate Republican response,"" he wrote. ""It's been a mistake for the country and I'm determined to change that."" Whether or not he thinks he needs to run for president to change that is unclear. But trekking up to New Hampshire in late October certainly suggests that's a possibility. ""John has made it a point to have [national security] front and center in any 2016 election campaign,"" said Charlie Kupperman, the treasurer of the Bolton for New Hampshire PAC. ""I don't think any candidate that decides to run will be able to ignore that dimension."" Will the rise of ISIS and the conflict in Ukraine earn Bolton's hawkish foreign policy views a better reception in New Hampshire than they might have otherwise received? ""The American people are very pragmatic and well ahead of their political leadership in understanding why national security has never faded as a real issue,"" he emailed."

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/republicans_may_win_big_in_state_legislatures_gop_control_of_state_government.html	"Forget the U.S. Senate. Even if Republicans seize control of the chamber, their policy-changing prospects will be limited at best. The election night results you should really keep an eye on involve candidates whose names you don't know in races that rarely, if ever, cross the national radar. These election contests could affect how high your taxes are, whether your neighborhood abortion clinic stays open, and just how much influence unions have in your state. Spoiler: State legislatures matter--a lot. If there's one truth of divided government, it's that the most significant legislative action often happens on the state level instead of in gridlocked Washington. While the U.S. Congress has been bogged down in a morass, state legislatures with single-party rule have been hopping. In the last few years, for instance, the Republicans who control Texas' legislature and governorship have passed bills banning abortion after 20 weeks, tightening regulations on abortion clinics, reducing the number of required standardized tests for students, running the table on tort reform, and requiring photo ID to vote. And just like Republicans running for federal office are expecting a wave or wavelet of sorts next week, their state-level counterparts are aiming to take control of a few more legislative chambers--potentially with substantial policy consequences. Let's start with Iowa. Though the state's representation in Congress is perfectly bipartisan--one Republican and one Democratic senator at the moment, as well as two Republicans and two Democrats in the House of Representatives--its statewide government is almost entirely dominated by the GOP. The Republican governor, Terry Branstad, will waltz to re-election, and Republicans have a six-seat majority in the state legislature that they expect to hold comfortably. Democrats still control the state Senate by three seats, but Iowa's Republican State Leadership Committee is bullish about its prospects of flipping that chamber. In part, their confidence is spilling over from how much positive attention the party is getting for its other candidates. State Sen. Joni Ernst's stronger-than-expected campaign to fill the state's open Senate seat has been a jolt for Iowa Republicans. Some expect having Ernst at the top of the ticket could have a felicitous down-ballot effect on Election Day. Likewise, the number of 2016 presidential contenders schmoozing their way through the state--Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Rick Perry, and Gov. Bobby Jindal, to name a few--is having an energizing effect on the party's base. Republicans by no means have the state Senate locked up. But if they win it, the Hawkeye State might look a little more like the Lone Star State. Abortion restrictions, for example, would likely be a top agenda item. Jenifer Bowen, the director of Iowa Right to Life, said state Senate Majority Leader Michael Gronstal's refusal to allow votes on pro-life legislation is the main reason Iowa doesn't have laws barring late-term and telemedicine abortions. ""We know Gov. Branstad is eager to sign pro-life legislation,"" Bowen said. If Democrats' slim margin in the state Senate doesn't hold up, Branstad will soon have a chance to reach for his pen. Republicans are also poised to take over the entire state government in Arkansas. They claimed both the state House of Representatives and state Senate in 2012--one of the few bright spots for Republicans on that night--and Republican nominee Asa Hutchinson is likely to defeat Democrat Mike Ross in the contest for the open governorship. Likewise, Republican Rep. Tim Griffin should have no trouble becoming the next lieutenant governor. Arkansas was one of the last holdouts for Democrats in the South. After next Tuesday, it probably will be no more. And for Arkansans, that likely means one thing: tax cuts. A conservative insider based in Washington with close ties to the state's Republicans said Hutchinson has been gathering tax-cut ideas and that it's highly likely the state will shortly get rate-reducing tax reform. If Iowa is poised to look a bit more like Texas, then Arkansas is heading Kansas-ward. The West Virginia House of Delegates is another chamber that has national Republicans feeling confident this election cycle. That's because there is a realistic chance that Republicans could hold both chambers of the legislature as well as the governorship in 2016. If that happens, it will probably be bad news for unions, as the kind of tough-on-labor legislation that has passed in Wisconsin and Michigan could be at the top of the docket for Mountain State Republicans. Another potential historic win that has Republicans keeping their fingers crossed: the Kentucky state House of Representatives. Flipping that chamber wouldn't have the kind of immediately foreseeable policy consequences as in other states, but it would be a big psychological victory for the GOP; Republicans haven't held it since before the Great Depression. So while there will be plenty of buzz this coming Tuesday night about historic wins and game-changing losses in Congress, remember that the contests you hear about least may be the ones that matter most."	Forget the Senate. Republicans Are About to Take Control of State Legislatures Across the Land.
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/republicans_2014_what_the_gop_can_learn_from_democrats_about_how_to_get.html	"Like many Republicans across America, I spent a fair amount of time on Tuesday night high-fiving other Republicans. The midterm elections were a smashing success for the GOP, which greatly surpassed my characteristically low expectations. But when I woke up, bleary-eyed and unready to face the morning, I realized that despite this mammoth GOP victory, it was extremely unlikely that it would translate into solid conservative policy achievements. The fact that President Obama is still in power is the most obvious reason. The other less-obvious reason is that Republicans are just not as good as Democrats at achieving their policy goals. The Republican and Democratic coalitions are both political parties in the same way that whales and lemurs are both mammals, or that Finnish and Hungarian are both Finno-Ugric languages. Though they share some very broad characteristics, they are profoundly different. Our failure to understand the differences between the two parties sows confusion and resentment, so I'd like to clear things up. One of the more amusing aspects of our politics is that Democrats will often accuse Republicans of being in the pocket of this or that special interest while Republicans insist that Democrats are wild-eyed ideologues. This is almost the opposite of the truth. It is Republicans who are the ideological ones, while it is Democrats who, in the wise words of political scientists Matt Grossmann and David Hopkins, are ""a coalition of interest groups whose interests are served by government activity."" I realize that this is a massive oversimplification, but bear with me, because I think it illuminates why both parties keep falling in the same old patterns. The Democratic Party is a collection of interest groups that seeks to, among other things, redistribute income and wealth from people who are not Democrats to people who are, or who will be, and they do a pretty good job of it, even when they lose elections. Noam Scheiber of the New Republic did an excellent job of explaining why this was the case way back in December 2002, after a big Republican midterm sweep not unlike this week's. Scheiber explained that the biggest headache for any masochist setting out to lead congressional Republicans was that ""unlike interest groups on the left, which tend to accept the transactional nature of government, many movement conservatives have a genuinely coherent worldview they want to see reflected--in its entirety."" To put this differently, while Democrats generally recognize that half a loaf is better than none, ""[t]he right wing of the Republican Party is simply incapable of accepting the kind of compromises a Senate majority leader must make,"" or for that matter a speaker of the House, or a president. Am I claiming that my fellow conservatives are always wrong to claim that Democrats are wild-eyed ideologues? No, of course not. There are plenty of ideological progressives in the Democratic Party, some of whom are wild-eyed. (Trust me on this one.) For the most part, they are European-style social democrats who believe that America would be a richer, fairer society if we had a bigger, more powerful government--staffed by credentialed experts, naturally--that can redress various inequalities and injustices through technocratic means. The chief political difference between ideological conservatives in the GOP and ideological progressives among Democrats is that ideological progressives recognize that they're usually in the minority among their fellow partisans. Progressives understand that they'll often have to take a back seat to, say, public school teachers who want education policies that advance their interests, or first- and second-generation Americans who want an immigration policy that puts family unification first, or a renewable energy policy that isn't necessarily the best way to fight climate change. Ideological progressives succeed because they know they have no choice but to persuade their fellow Democrats. They've been trained to make the case for why their policies are best for members of interest groups X, Y, and Z. This in turn teaches them how to persuade moderates in the electorate at large. The beauty of the way Democrats approach politics is that their willingness to accept half a loaf means that they can keep making incremental gains even when they appear to be ""losing."" Lane Kenworthy, a sociologist at the University of California-San Diego and the author of Social Democratic America, puts it beautifully: ""Small steps and the occasional big leap, coupled with limited backsliding, will have the cumulative effect of significantly increasing the breadth and generosity of government social programs."" That is, conservatives can try to nibble at the edges of new social programs, but they'll rarely succeed in rolling them back completely. Consider Obamacare, perhaps the most controversial new social program in recent memory. Ideological progressives often insist that Obamacare is in fact Republican legislation, even though virtually no Republican lawmakers backed it. It is also true, however, that the beneficiaries of Obamacare's coverage expansions are disproportionately Democratic-leaning, and the law makes it much easier for overburdened state and local governments to shift some of the burden of providing health benefits for their retirees to the federal government. Though I don't doubt that the motivations behind Obamacare were sincere, it happens that it does a lot of good for Democratic voters, which reflects the willingness of ideological progressives to sell universal coverage within the party. Republicans are rarely this slick. They're far more likely than Democrats to be true believers who put ideology above all else and who struggle to achieve their concrete goals. They struggle because unlike ideological progressives, ideological conservatives believe that most people already agree with them, and that when they fail to win a particular policy fight, it's because something shady and underhanded is going on. The fact that there are far more conservatives in America than liberals is, in a funny way, a liability for the right. Liberals understand that they can't win without moderates; conservatives will only concede this unfortunate fact reluctantly, if at all. The result is that Republicans spend much of their time banging their heads against whichever wall happens to be close by. To be clear, both major parties are half-coherent mishmashes of different interest groups. But the biggest, most influential interest group in the Republican Party consists of ideological conservatives. Yes, Republicans are beholden to big business and Wall Street, perhaps more so than Democrats. To the lasting chagrin of the donor class, however, Republican elected officials have little choice but to bend to the demands of the most ideologically zealous members of the Republican rank-and-file. Talk to GOP donors who make their fortunes in financial services or technology, and who call Manhattan or Palm Beach or La Jolla home, and you'll find that few are passionate about the pro-life cause or gun rights. If anything, many of them would love to jettison the devout evangelical ideologues who do so much to define the party's public image. But they'd never dare, as these voters are the heart and soul of the modern GOP. They're the ones who turn out in off-year elections and who vote faithfully in primary races to punish RINOs. The conservative ideology these voters share is not super well-defined. Some on the left mock Tea Party conservatives for, say, calling for smaller government while defending Medicare to the death, or for championing socially conservatives causes while claiming to be defenders of individual liberty. The straightforward interpretation is that this is simple hypocrisy. A more convincing view, which I owe to Emily Ekins, the director of polling for the libertarian Reason Foundation, is that the preference for limited government is rooted in what she calls a ""reap what you sow"" understanding of economic fairness. Simply put, this is a belief that people should be rewarded in accordance with the contributions they make and they should bear the consequences of their own mistakes. Many conservatives see Social Security and Medicare as fundamentally different from other social programs because, as FDR and LBJ intended, they are widely understood as something akin to insurance programs, paid for by worker contributions. As C. Eugene Steuerle and Stephanie Rennane have carefully documented, this is far from the truth. Most Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries get far more out of these programs than they pay in. Yet the closely related idea of conditional reciprocity, in which, in the words of legal scholar Amy Wax, entitlement to public resources is ""conditional on each person's reasonable effort, consistent with ability, to support himself and his family,"" strikes me and most other conservatives as fundamentally sound. Not all Republicans embrace this brand of moralism, to be sure. But it definitely informs how grass-roots conservatives understand the policy debate. The challenge for ideological conservatives is to first recognize that not all Americans share their convictions. And as if that won't be hard enough, they'll then have to learn from ideological progressives how to sell conservative ideas to people who don't already buy into them. Yes, yes, Ronald Reagan Milton Friedman freedom bald eagles yadda yadda. How will such-and-such Social Security reform that's in line with conservative beliefs make members of this or that group better off? How will Paul Ryan's Medicare reform deliver better care to Grandma? How will family-friendly tax reform benefit middle-class single moms? Conservatives hate thinking this way. But if they ever want to translate victories like Tuesday night's into lasting policy achievements, they're going to have to learn."

In the coming days, there will be no dearth of stories about unlikely comebacks, survivor incumbents, and rising stars. But not everyone can be a winner. Even as large expanses of America went ""red"" Tuesday night, there were a share of Republican flameouts--rising GOP stars who lost while the rest of the party was popping Champagne. Given that Republicans pulled off decisive wins in so many races that were supposed to turn out badly for them, the losses of a few overhyped GOP nominees look particularly embarrassing. Oregon Senate nominee Monica Wehby takes the cake here. In April, she released a moving ad that drew universal plaudits; National Review dubbed it ""the best GOP political ad ever."" And for a moment, it was all eyes on Oregon. Democrats downplayed Republicans' excitement, and they were actually right to do so. Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley won by more than 16 points. In New Hampshire, state Rep. Marilinda Garcia drew nonstop national hype. She got prominent billing at CPAC this year, and a host of 2016 contenders lined up to campaign alongside her, including Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul, and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. The National Republican Congressional Committee also energetically touted her to national media. But now, with nearly all of the vote in, it looks like Democratic incumbent Ann Kuster will beat her by double digits. Yipes. Fellow Granite Stater Scott Brown needs no introduction. Just one thing: National Republicans spent the final months of this election cycle trumpeting their potentially amazing pickup opportunity in New Hampshire while largely ignoring any possibility that nominee Ed Gillespie might pull off a win against Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner. Beating Warner would have been a monster win for Republicans; the GOP has struggled in statewide Virginia contests, and the state voted for Obama twice, so knocking him off would have put some of those ""Blue Virginia"" rumors to bed. That makes this one of the most painful losses for Republicans this cycle. Mia Love gets an honorable mention here. The former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, won her House race Tuesday night, but it was surprisingly close (decided by about 4,000 votes), and it gave Republicans heartburn toward the end of an evening that was otherwise largely unmarred. Love will be the first black female Republican in Congress and has always had outsized support from the national party, including a prominent role at the Republican National Convention in 2012. But it really should never have been this close; Mitt Romney won her district in 2012 by 16 points. Republicans have plenty to trill about for the coming weeks, but they still could stand to benefit from thinking about the ones that got away."	Not Every Republican Could Be a Winner. Here Are the GOP's Rising Stars Who Flamed Out.
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/scott_walker_wins_wisconsin_again_why_the_conservative_governor_won_again.html	"WEST ALLIS, Wisconsin--""First off, I want to thank God."" Gov. Scott Walker had just come on stage at the State Fair Exposition Center to give his third victory speech in four years, and the supporters mashed up in front of the stage were totally losing it. ""I want to thank God for his abundant grace and mercy,"" Walker continued. ""Win or lose, it is more than sufficient for each and every one of us."" The crowd exploded. It's nice of Walker to throw in that ""win or lose"" line, but he didn't really need it. Walker doesn't lose. The governor first got elected in 2010 by 5.8 points, won an acrimonious recall election in 2012 by 6.8 points, and looks set to win his first real re-election bid by about 6 points. Walker's supporters at the victory party were elated but not surprised. They argued his win was in the cards from jump street, that Democratic nominee Mary Burke's dependence on out-of-state support backfired, and that Walker's superhuman ability to stay on message made re-election way easier than it looked to many (including me!). The governor had a straightforward strategy, and he stuck to it. Wisconsin Republicans expect the final voting data to confirm that Walker won in large part because he took Fox Valley in northeast Wisconsin. That region, which includes Green Bay, is the state's second largest media market (after Milwaukee and before Madison). Walker visited the area about a dozen times in the past two weeks of the campaign, according to Wisconsin GOP First Vice Chairman Brian Schimming, and he had a robust field operation there. To be fair, he had a robust field operation everywhere, with 23 offices around the state and an effective grass-roots organization. ""I've been doing state races for 25 years,"" said state Rep. John Nygren. ""This is the most door-to-door intensive race I've seen in the 25 years I've been around."" Fox Valley was the battleground, Schimming said, and Walker won the battle there. If there's a single factor that put him over the edge, he argued, that was it. Other Republican observers added more detail. A hallmark of Walker's campaign was his total non-interest in appearing with outside surrogates. As he toured the state, he appeared with Republican leaders in their home districts, including Rep. Sean Duffy in Eau Claire and Rep. Paul Ryan. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus also toured the state by bus with Walker in the home stretch. Priebus is also from Wisconsin, a fact Walker often touted as they stumped together. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also visited the state to campaign for Walker, but that's because he invited himself. Walker tapped into the cycle's near-universal anti-Washington sentiment, decrying the influence of ""Washington special interests"" on the Badger State at every campaign stop. Some victory partygoers said things really started looking up for Walker about a month ago. That's when, with Burke's supporters outspending Walker's, negative ads swamped the airwaves. Burke drew significant support from Emily's List, an organization that backs pro-choice female Democratic candidates, and she also won backing from labor organizations and the president himself, who visited to hold a rally for her. Walker loyalists said that as money from outside groups and unions poured into the state for Burke and as her campaign came to be associated with its out-of-state surrogates (first lady Michelle Obama stumped for her twice), voters got recall flashbacks. ""I think it ended up that way,"" Schimming said. ""I used to tell the Democrats they helped us with the recall,"" he continued, ""because they spent so much time trying to go after him that they really turned off a lot of people."" Schimming described that 2012 election as ""a pretty vicious time."" And some Walker backers argue that Burke's brutal attacks against the governor reminded voters of a moment in state politics that they weren't particularly interested in revisiting. ""Wisconsin voters are very independent voters,"" said Nick Novak, communications director for the conservative MacIver Institute think tank. ""Gov. Walker was very clear about what he was going to do, and that's probably why the voters chose to elect him."" While Walker was repeating the same simple pitch throughout the state, national labor organizations were running ads targeting the governor and Burke was hobnobbing with the president and first lady in the state's two most liberal cities, Madison and Milwaukee. If Burke bet on this being an anti-incumbent election cycle, Walker bet on its being anti-Washington. And he bet right. ""The difference between Washington and Wisconsin--the folks in Washington like this top-down approach that's old and artificial and outdated and says that government knows best,"" Walker said in his victory speech, over roaring fans. ""We say that you should build the economy from ground up that's new and fresh and organic, and that's what we're going to do."" What, specifically, are they going to do? Tax cuts and school choice reforms are safe bets. The governor has mulled expanding the state's voucher program, as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel explains, and Madison insiders say that's likely to be a top priority for the governor's second term. And Wisconsin Politics is reporting that Republicans grew their majorities in both chambers of the statehouse, so Walker will have ample backing. The possibility of passing Right to Work legislation will also come up. Walker hasn't floated this idea, but, per one statehouse observer, he'll hear about it from advisers and conservative backers. It's hard to believe that Walker would have the appetite for another round of union battles. But it was also hard to believe he would win three elections in four years, and that he would win this last one, against an opponent whose backers outspent his by a cushy margin. So here's some analysis: When it's Scott Walker, the unlikely is never that far-fetched."	How Scott Walker Does It

A drubbing? A knock into the cheap seats? President Obama now has the dreary task of characterizing his party's losses, which came as a result of voters' disapproval with his presidency. In 2010, Obama called it a shellacking. In 2006, George W. Bush called his party's defeat a thumpin'. Once Obama comes up with the word, he's going to have to endure a press conference in which he has to explain again and again why he is not the problem. On Tuesday night, Democrats lost at least seven Senate seats and a dozen or so House seats. The Republican march across the country also included victories in governor's races in key presidential battleground states like Wisconsin, Ohio, and Florida. In addition to Republican Senate wins in states like Iowa, Colorado, and North Carolina, this collection of victories will help Republicans make the claim that their ideas can win outside their ruby-red areas. Even embattled Republican Gov. Sam Brownback won in Kansas. Democrats lost governor's races in blue states like Massachusetts and Maryland. The Republican Party had one strategy it followed in nearly every Senate race: run against the president. It paid off. (Next week, the president travels to Burma. Perhaps he should have scheduled the trip eight months ago--and stayed there.) Democratic candidates couldn't get out of the president's shadow. Every Democratic attempt to localize the races failed. In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall ran a campaign aimed at female voters, emphasizing reproductive rights. It was a tested item from the Democratic playbook, and it failed. In North Carolina, Sen. Kay Hagan ran a near-perfect campaign, hitting Republican Thom Tillis on education funding cuts that had occurred while he was the state Speaker of the House. It didn't work. In Georgia, Michelle Nunn seized on her Republican opponent David Perdue's support for outsourcing while in the private sector; it too wasn't enough. Georgia has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, but in exit polls the 80 percent of Georgia voters who said they were worried about the economy still opted for Perdue with 60 percent of the vote. The president wasn't only a drag on Democratic candidates; his coalition failed to show up, too. Democrats spent $60 million on trying to make the midterm electorate look like the electorate in a presidential election year, an attempt to cure the party's boom-and-bust cycles. Younger voters were a particular disappointment. In 2012 they represented 19 percent of the electorate but this year they represented only 13 percent, almost identical to their lackluster performance in 2010. In Colorado younger voters represented 20 percent of the 2012 electorate. In 2014 they represented only 13 percent, according to exit polls.* The voting was all by mail in the state this year, and though Democrats thought it would help them with younger voters, it appears to have done the opposite, say Democrats. Colorado really burns because Democrats based their turnout effort on Sen. Michael Bennet's successful campaign in the state four years ago. Update, Nov. 6, 2014: Democrats in Colorado turned out in greater numbers than in the 2010 campaign, but not enough to help Udall. The story of Colorado is more complicated than Democrats not reaching 2012 turnout levels. Republicans benefited from support from older voters who used mail-in ballots, but the final story is likely to be one about persuasion rather than turnout. Voters who participate in midterm elections regularly (and therefore aren't part of the special turnout effort) and did so again this time went more for the Republican candidate, as did unaffiliated voters who do not register by party identification. The 2014 election was less an endorsement of Republican ideas and more a rejection of a president in the sixth year of his presidency. Republicans didn't win a mandate for a specific set of policies, but after such an intoxicating victory, it would be easy to think they had. Both parties have regularly fallen into the trap of going beyond what the voters will allow after a strong election night. Republican leaders have said they know that they'll have to prove they can govern to put themselves in a good position for the 2016 campaign. What will they tackle first? Exit polls show that the economy is still the No. 1 concern for voters. They punished the president on Tuesday, but they will now expect more from Republicans. Sixty-three percent of the voters, according to exit polls, said the economic system ""favors the wealthy."" That's an unaddressed issue that Republicans will now have to wrestle with. Now Republicans will have a conversation about what to do and in what order. Republicans should ""do everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz on election night, calling for a systematic campaign of legislation to pressure the president. What was the message of the electorate on Obamacare? It was split between those who think the law is just fine or doesn't go far enough and those who think it goes too far. Forty-eight percent thought the law was about right or didn't go far enough. Forty-seven percent thought the law went too far. In Iowa, the location of a big GOP win, only 45 percent thought the law went too far. Those numbers don't suggest a call for radical action. President Obama has to define his loss, and then Republicans will have to define what it means to have won such a big victory. This article has been updated with more information since publication. *Correction, Nov. 6, 2014: This article originally misstated that turnout among Democrats in Colorado was 28 percent, a record low for the state. That number, based on exit polls, does not match the tabulated vote. Democrats say their voters were 32 percent of the electorate, not a record low. (Return.)"	How the Republican Party Clobbered Democrats With Their Own President

Cisse was disappointed with the results, but she was also hopeful for what might come next. ""This was historic,"" she said. ""When you're making inroads, you're walking a middle road. Michelle inspired a lot of people, especially in a state primed to reject someone of her gender and her values."" This sentiment was typical of the people who witnessed Nunn's final address, which might have had something to do with the nature of Nunn's remarks. Nunn had started her remarks with a concession to Perdue, but she didn't quite give a concession speech. Instead, she claimed a partial victory. ""We have laid the groundwork for the future,"" she said. ""We have shown the people of Georgia what a two-party state looks like."" Her supporters echoed this optimism. ""People are definitely going to follow in her footsteps,"" said Bianca Horton. ""Especially young people and women. [Nunn] laid the groundwork, and we're going to follow through."" Likewise, said another supporter--who was trying to console his partner as he gave his take on the night--""Michelle ran a very good campaign that made this a real race. Maybe after this we're a slightly less red state."" I think that's right. Over the course of a year, the Nunn campaign and its allies successfully capitalized on Georgia's rapid demographic change, registering tens of thousands of new voters and bringing them to the polls. In the process, they turned a lean GOP election into a genuine tossup, forcing a real effort from the state and national Republican parties. Indeed, when all the votes are tallied, Nunn will have outperformed Democratic candidates in the 2004 and 2010 Senate races, and will have likely matched President Obama's performance in 2012. And while we can't quite say Democrats will have the advantage in 2016--though, with a more diverse electorate and the higher mobilization of a presidential race, it's possible--we can easily predict another competitive election. Which is to say that, going forward, it's hard to say that Georgia is a ""red state"" like its neighbors South Carolina or Alabama, which are avowedly hostile to Democrats. Instead, it's more accurate to call Georgia a red-leaning state that could--with the right conditions--turn purple. Or, as former Sen. Sam Nunn said to me early in the night, ""I think when you [see] this much excitement, it's going to put Georgia in play for 2016. Whatever the vote is, I think people see this excitement, and how many people are involved in the campaign. This diverse blend of people working together--white, black, Hispanic, women, young people, urban, rural--all [the] away around."" This diversity, it should be said, is unprecedented. For most of its history, Georgia has been governed by a limited class of affluent whites. Now, for the first time, we have a large, multicultural electorate. And it will bring major changes. ""Redistricting is on the horizon,"" says Rep. Stacey Abrams, the Georgia House minority leader and head of the New Georgia Project, which made news as an unprecedented registration effort aimed at Georgia's minority communities, but is focused on the long term. Specifically, Abrams--and the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock of Ebenezer Baptist Church--see Georgia's rapid demographic change as a chance to construct a genuinely interracial political culture. ""If we have a race-based politics rather than a value-based politics, we're going to be in trouble,"" says Abrams, who fears a future in which various racial groups fight over existing resources rather than working together to expand ""shared resources."" ""We can acknowledge race without relying on it,"" she says. It's less of a ""post-racial"" vision and more of a ""race, and"" approach, whereby different groups have different interests, but can unite toward a common goal. Over the next decade, they plan to do the hard work of educating and mobilizing, of teaching people about local government and state races, and of turning Georgia into a place where progressive values can thrive, not just survive. For them, the Nunn campaign isn't a failure--it's the start of a long-term project to transform Georgia and harness the promise of its current shifts. It is, in other words, just the beginning."

If only politicians followed this motherly mantra! As another bitter election season concludes, the airwaves will temporarily clear of the nasty political ads that have dominated them. In the 34 states with Senate seats up for grabs, candidates and political groups ran more than 1 million TV ads to influence those races, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of data from Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking firm. About 46 percent of those ads were attack ads, but in some states it was far more than half: The closest races had the meanest mudslinging. In North Carolina, where the Senate candidates have been locked in a dead heat, nearly seven out of 10 ads were negative, the highest rate. The next worst fights were in Kansas, Iowa, Michigan, and Colorado, where about 60 percent of the attack ads that aired were political ads.

Also, jobs. In a contest that is closer than close, no one knows if Walker's message is working. Wisconsin's conservative governor is one of the most polarizing figures in national politics; after introducing policy changes to dramatically curtail public sector unions' clout, protesters flooded the state Capitol in Madison for months, and Walker ultimately was forced to run in a recall election (which he won decisively). Conservatives think he's saving America. Liberals think he's the devil incarnate. In Wisconsin, nobody is lukewarm on Scott Walker. What may be most notable isn't the substance of the governor's final pitch, but how he says it. In the waning days of Walker's campaign, his message--delivered on a bus tour that has stopped at factories around the state and allowed him to pose with heavy machinery and blue-collar workers sporting safety goggles--has been uncharacteristically conciliatory. Forget anything on gay marriage or abortion. If you're looking for hot takes on Ebola and ISIS, look elsewhere. Walker is probably the most on-message politician in America right now. In the last several days, the candidate's campaign stops all unfold like this: He rolls up in his ""Scott Walker Continuing Wisconsin's Comeback"" bus, the twangy Brooks and Dunn song ""Only in America"" plays over a loudspeaker, and then Walker and his two sons and his wife, Tonette, and Rep. Paul Ryan and Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and her husband and their two young daughters all pile onstage to talk about jobs. Kleefisch, who is very energetic, opens with a speech about how the average family has saved $322 in taxes every year since Walker took office and how the state is now ""a totally different Wisconsin."" Then Walker takes to the stage (or to the small portable platform his advance team sets up in the parking lot) and says, ""I got a question for you: How many of you have been watching TV the last couple weeks?"" There are chuckles and groans. ""How many of you have seen the ads on TV the last couple weeks?"" There are boos. ""How many are sick of the political ads?"" Then Walker talks about the fact that Mary Burke and her supporters have run lots of negative TV ads against him, but that his spots are positive. ""My ads, particularly here at the close, they're me looking you right in the face, just like we're talking tonight, person to person, just like I'm sitting in your living room, looking across your coffee table, looking you right in the face, telling you what I'm for,"" he says. He is for jobs. Also, he is for the future. ""I'm not asking for your vote on behalf of Tonette and I,"" he says at every stop. ""Today I'm asking for your vote on behalf of Matt and Alex, I'm asking for your vote on behalf of my two sons."" In his last stop before Election Day, the governor added a line I hadn't heard before. ""I hope that tonight, here and across this state, people can see that our motives were pure,"" he says to a crowd assembled in the parking lot in front of Husco International. Walker has drawn ferocious criticism for dividing a state that is generally considered a very affable place. Voters outside of his core ranks likely hold significant residual resentment that he caused such a stir, regardless of the merits of his policies. Walker's near-apologetic tone seemed to acknowledge that distaste. Having voters recognize the purity of his motives would be helpful. As John Dickerson pointed out in August, the governor's approval ratings were underwater just three months before Election Day even though most of those polled thought the state was going in the right direction. So Walker is fighting for his political life in the nicest way possible. His first (and, maybe, only) term as governor was enormously combative. Walker's closing argument appears to be an effort to show his softer side."	Wisconsin's Polarizing Gov. Scott Walker Ended His Campaign With a Soft, Almost Apologetic Tone
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/michelle_nunn_and_david_perdue_in_close_georgia_senate_race_democrats_and.html	"Standing in front of a huge David Perdue bus in a hangar at DeKalb Peachtree Airport, Sen. Johnny Isakson begged the crowd to go to the polls. ""Tomorrow isn't just about going to the polls for yourself, it's about bringing our neighbors and friends,"" he said, ""Whatever you do from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., you want to get everyone to go out and vote."" This is the typical plea of a campaign in its final stretch. But it also reflects the fundamental and driving dynamics of the Georgia's election contests. Rapid demographic change has pushed this Southern state from a deep red--which gave 57.9 percent of its votes to George W. Bush--to a reddish purple, where the Democratic Senate candidate--Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn--is neck-and-neck with Republican David Perdue, and the Democratic candidate for governor--Jimmy Carter's grandson Jason Carter--is close to a win over Nathan Deal, the Republican governor. Compared to 2010, the black share of the electorate is larger (28.8 percent versus 28.2 percent) and the white share smaller (64.2 percent versus 66.3 percent). These look like small shifts, but in a close election, they're substantial. In an electorate with more black voters, Democrats need significantly fewer white voters to maintain a lead and get to 50 percent. What's more, these trends are ongoing--the Georgia electorate of 2016 and 2018 will each be less white than the one that preceded it. Tuesday's races--and the strategies pursued by both campaigns--will set the stage for the next decade of partisan fights in the state. Which is why voter mobilization has had been a huge part of the Georgia campaigns in a way that hasn't been true in more than a decade. Indeed, if there's an underlying story to the Georgia statewide races, it's that the parties are fighting a fierce war to get their supporters to the polls, with Democrats registering new voters by the tens of thousands, and Republicans pinpointing their voters with new tools and techniques. ""This is the largest operation as far as people and technology we've ever had,"" said Ryan Mahoney, a strategist with the Georgia Republican Party. Supporters on both sides understand as much. Among Michelle Nunn's final events in the Georgia Senate race was a service project. More than 100 volunteers gathered at a park near an Atlanta high school--one, not-incidentally, where her mother used to teach--to spruce up the field and prepare the community garden for another season of growth. One of the volunteers was Atlanta City Council President Ceasar Mitchell, who was there with Nunn on St. Patrick's Day 2013 when she made the decision to run. ""People understand that [this campaign] is an investment,"" he said, ""It's important to breathe life into Georgia Democrats before 2016 or 2018, and make sure those progressive values are there."" Indeed, the Nunn event wasn't just a service project--it was a chance for volunteers to canvass the surrounding, mostly black neighborhoods. At a certain point, before Nunn arrived, one older volunteer complained that she would rather canvass the area--for her, talking to voters was more important than pulling weeds. Likewise, at the Republican event with Sen. Isakson and the full slate of GOP candidates--including Gov. Deal and David Perdue--attendees understood that victory was fully a function of who could shape the electorate to their advantage, and that if Democrats win, it'll be because they outplayed Republicans. ""If that happens,"" said Rusty Jones, a retiree and enthusiastic GOP supporter, ""it will be because the negative ads worked."" Those ads are ubiquitous. And they're not just the ones you see on television, where candidates--and groups on behalf of candidates--blast the other side for a variety of real (and sometimes imagined) sins. Turn on a gospel or R&B radio station in Atlanta and you'll hear Rep. John Lewis--a civil rights icon--urge people to vote to ""protect their sacred right,"" telling them they've ""come too far"" to lose it to Republicans. There's a reason Lewis is using this message, which to Republican ears is inflammatory. After earlier fights over voter registration--where Democrats alleged voter suppression and Republicans accused groups like the New Georgia Project of voter fraud--Democratic voters are highly attuned to the disputes over ballot access. ""Here in Macon, we wanted Sunday voting, but they voted it down,"" explained Jeannette McElhaney, a Nunn supporter, at a final rally for the Democratic candidate near Mercer University, ""They justified it by saying Sunday was the Sabbath. We understand that, but you can buy alcohol on Sunday. And if you can buy alcohol, you can vote."" Republicans, it should be said, think these accusations of suppression are ridiculous. ""I think it is without basis,"" says Neal Purcell, who serves as financial chair for the Perdue campaign, ""No one is going to take anyone's vote away. This is political rhetoric of the worst kind."" There's no doubt that it's political rhetoric. But it's also true that Georgia's secretary of state, a Republican, has discarded 40,000 voter registrations, a move upheld by a state judge. Likewise, state officials have tried to clean voter rolls with a program that effectively targets minority voters, including blacks. A huge number of Georgians have already voted in the midterms, and from what we know, Democrats have reason to think they might prevail; black voters are providing a larger share of early ballots this year than they did in 2010. ""At 33.1 percent of early votes cast,"" notes Jim Galloway for the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, ""black balloters nearly match their turnout of 2012, when President Barack Obama was up for re-election."" This fact is a testament to the tremendous effort of Georgia Democrats in their quest to shift the electorate and build a fighting chance for their candidates. Still, the final polls from Georgia show Perdue with small leads over Nunn--ranging from 1 to 4 points--and Deal with somewhat larger leads over Carter, ranging from 3 to 5 points. Which is to say, for all of their work--and all of their success on the ground--Democrats may, and probably will, lose these elections. But it won't be a complete loss. Nathan Deal might go back to the governor's mansion and David Perdue may get a six-year assignment in Washington, but Democratic work in this election means that--in two years--there's a decent chance Georgia is a genuine swing state. Put another way, Georgia might not save the Democrats' Senate majority, but come 2016, it might give them a third term in the White House. As far as consolation prizes go, that one isn't too bad."	In Georgia, Candidates Matter, but Winning the Voting Wars Matters Most of All
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/republican_governors_races_on_election_day_the_gubernatorial_contests_will.html	For the last several years, as the GOP brand in Washington has remained weak, Republican governors have tried to distance themselves from their Washington cousins. The governors were out in the states making decisions that meant something to their constituents while the Beltway Republicans were shuttering down the government. One conservative PAC involved in this year's Senate races said that when it conducted polls and focus groups about government incompetence, they saw the predictable evidence of voter anger with President Obama's handling of ISIS, the Ebola crisis, and launching healthcare.gov. But they also found something else: People quickly brought up the government shutdown, something they pinned on the GOP. While the party that controls the White House is usually defined by the presidency, the party in opposition must go to some pain to define itself by its most appealing elements--since its image is most up for grabs. Is the Republican Party the party of Sen. Ted Cruz or Florida Gov. Rick Scott? Maine Gov. Paul LePage or Sen. Rand Paul? Tuesday's election results for GOP governors will be a better signal about the public's appetite for conservative ideas than the Senate races because those contests have largely focused on President Obama rather than policies that can affect people's lives. In gubernatorial races, however, voters are evaluating how governors work with legislatures and enact policy that either does or doesn't work. Senators debate issues that may or may not affect people's lives. If governors don't enact laws that deal with real problems, they get turned out of office fast. Drawing a conclusion will be more complicated than simply waiting to see if Republican governors are re-elected. If Gov. Scott Walker wins in Wisconsin and Gov. Sam Brownback holds on in Kansas, they will both be able to argue that they survived even after taking political risks to govern as proud conservatives. If, on the other hand Ohio Gov. John Kasich cruises to a big victory, that might show something different. Kasich, and Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, opted to take the federal Medicaid money as a part of the Affordable Care Act. Doing so was once considered heresy in conservative ranks. But now people like Newt Gingrich point to Kasich as a model for expanding the Republican Party with black voters. In Gingrich's election-eve predictions, he cites that Kasich won the endorsement of a black newspaper. The Ohio governor won that endorsement because he took the Medicaid money. Almost all of the vulnerable Republican governors this cycle did not. Will their victories or defeats render a verdict on that decision? If Kasich and Walker both win, it might suggest that the Republican brand is flexible enough to accommodate both styles. Then it will be up to a national figure to explain how a Republican could do that in the White House. Both of these men may want to offer their theory for governing.	Why the Fate of Republican Governors Matters Most for the GOP Brand
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/election_day_questions_to_answer_what_to_look_for_in_the_midterm_election.html	"Finally, we're going to get some results on Election Day 2014. Here are the signposts and early returns that I'm looking for and the questions I want to see answered. (Email me at slatepolitics@gmail.com and let me know what questions interest you and if I have any answers I will let you know on Slate's Election Live Blog on Tuesday.): What kind of Senate tide? It will be a good night for Republicans, but how good a night? That matters because the start of a new political age emerges out of the old. Republicans will have an easier time arguing the American people support their policies if they have a big win. Future GOP presidential and Senate candidates will define themselves either as keepers of the spirit that won the day or, if it's a tepid night for Republicans, they'll run as the antidote to whatever weakness they claim led to a lackluster result. So, will Republicans win by just doing well in the states where Republicans dominate (states like Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, and South Dakota) or will they be able to claim their ideas worked in states that have a broader mix of voters like Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, and New Hampshire? Members of the GOP establishment are already making the case that co-opting and minimizing the Tea Party during the GOP primary season was a key lesson of this cycle. Will the final picture support that theory? Or, will a loss by Sen. Pat Roberts in Kansas give grassroots conservatives the proof they need to claim that if a real conservative had won the party primary, the solidly Republican seat would never have been in jeopardy. (Of course if Roberts loses, then the big question will be if independent candidate Greg Orman's victory determines the balance of the Senate and if so, which party will he join.) If the GOP wins in purple states, how did they win? Victories in any of the states President Obama won in 2012 will mean that Republicans have made improvements to their turn-out-the-vote operation, shrinking or overtaking the Democratic advantage. But what other lessons can they take from these victories and duplicate in 2016? Did they find new inroads to younger voters or minorities? Did GOP Senate nominee Cory Gardner in Colorado find a new way to talk to female voters or a way to blunt Democratic attacks? Or maybe he discovered ways to do both. Did Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst ride a wave of anger with Obamacare--30 percent of her supporters say repealing the law was their No. 1 reason for voting for her--or did she find a new way to talk to Midwestern voters? As Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report points out, the Obama coalition is flaming out in these battleground states. In Iowa, Obama's job approval rating among women has taken a 23-point swing from a net positive of 14 points (54/40) to a net negative of 13 points (40/53). If Republicans only won because Democrats were dispirited, that will be hard to duplicate in the 2016 Senate races where Republicans will be protecting seats in nine states that Obama won. What's the message from governors? Thirty-six states will elect governors on Tuesday. There are some race-specific questions that are fascinating: In Florida, will Charlie Crist's party switches matter? In Massachusetts, has Democrat Martha Coakley doomed herself again the way she did against Scott Brown in the 2010 Senate race? Just how badly will Democrat Wendy Davis lose in Texas? In Maine, if the Democrat candidate Mike Michaud wins, it will mean the state will almost certainly sign up immediately for Medicaid expansion. But from a thematic perspective I'm most interested in how Republican governors fare because they have so many party stars on the line. Nine incumbent Republican governors are running in states that President Obama won last time. (Those states include Maine, Iowa, New Mexico, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Ohio.) The outcomes of these races will offer an even greater hint about what kinds of policies might appeal to Democratic voters as Republicans take lessons for their presidential candidates. In the outcome of races like Gov. Sam Brownback's in Kansas, we'll also see how constituents react to conservative principles when they are put in practice. What's the Scott Walker verdict? We'll get another piece of data to test the Walker Hypothesis. After Scott Walker became the first governor to defeat a recall attempt, he argued that he had found a way to appeal to Obama voters by governing as a conservative. He said that almost 10 percent of the electorate voted to re-elect President Obama and keep him in office, too. In the Wall Street Journal, he argued he was a model for the Republican Party--someone who could govern as a conservative and still win in a purple state. The midterm electorate is much different than in a presidential year, but will there be anything in the exit polls that give him ammunition to make the same claim? Of course, the first test will be whether he is re-elected. Whose ideas won in the states? When I sat down to lunch with anti-tax activist Grover Norquist a few months ago, he handed me a map of the country that didn't have anything to do with the battle for control of the Senate. Norquist was focused on something else: the number of Americans living under Republican governors and GOP-controlled legislatures. That's because as Washington dithers, the local offices are where policies are enacted that affect people's lives. In 2010, Republicans had a great year, winning 700 legislative seats and picked up 20 legislatures. Those gains were solidified in the redistricting process that followed, so that even in 2012--a bad year for Republicans--they picked up five more legislative chambers at the state level. Republicans control 59 of the 98 partisan chambers in 49 states. (Nebraska is officially nonpartisan). Democrats control only 39. The sea of red shows up on this map. Will that number go up or down? The Republican State Leadership Committee has predicted that it will increase the number of legislatures under Republican control by six. Norquist is watching West Virginia where he thinks the House of Delegates is likely to shift to Republican control and the Senate might start moving that way and ultimately flip in 2016. Arkansas will likely get a Republican governor, making that state government entirely Republican-controlled. Norquist thinks the New Hampshire House will flip and is watching Illinois and Connecticut where Democrats may lose control of the Senate. My colleague Betsy Woodruff has written about this march and also notes that we should watch for a possible shift in the Iowa Senate and even a flip to the Republicans in the Kentucky House. Who won the turnout battle? Did the $60 million Democratic effort pay off? Were Democrats able to find new voters and recreate the Obama coalition of younger voters, blacks, and Latinos in a non-presidential election year? Six of the 16 states with the largest black population are voting for senators on Tuesday. In the early vote count, it already looks like Democrats have gotten black voters to vote in Louisiana and North Carolina in greater numbers than in the last midterm election. In Louisiana, Democrats say they have registered more black voters than in 2012. How many will turn out? Was the Democratic turnout effort better in states like Iowa and Colorado where Democrats had an organization honed from repeated presidential fights, than it was in Arkansas and Georgia, which are not traditional battleground states? In polls leading up to Election Day, there has been a split between the way registered voters feel about the election and the way likely voters feel. The latter has been a more Republican-leaning group. On Tuesday we'll find out if the models that anticipated the shape of the electorate were right. How do women voters factor into 2014? The first state I'll watch is Colorado where Democrats have run heavily on the issues of abortion rights and access to contraception. (Even ads hitting the Republican Senate candidate Cory Gardner on his environmental record began with a picture of a medicine cabinet and mentioned contraception.) It was one of the states that Planned Parenthood targeted, along with Iowa, North Carolina, and Alaska. Sen. Mark Udall won women voters by 15 points in 2008. President Obama won them by 3 points in 2012 and 15 points in 2008. Sen. Michael Bennet, whose focus of female voters set the model for the current race, won women voters by 18 points. What will the number be this time? How toxic was President Obama? According to Gallup, the percentage of Republicans who ""strongly disapprove"" of the president is higher than it was in 2010 when Republicans picked up 64 House seats, six governorships, and six Senate seats. The Pew poll last week showed that 62 percent of Republicans were going to cast their vote as a vote against Obama. So what is the final number? How much did Republicans really dislike the president and how much did that matter to their vote? This is also a question about political gravity. So far, Democratic candidates have been able to stay close in the polls to their opponents in Republican states, even though Obama's approval rating is lower in those states than his national average. If they can survive, they will buck the recent trend of states voting for senators from the same party of the presidential candidate they supported. Do voters just stay home? What if the undecided voters who don't like the president also don't like the Republican alternative? The president's approval rating is low, but in the latest CBS poll, the GOP-controlled Congress's approval rating is 21 percent. If turnout is low, could it be because voters weren't given anything to like about the Republicans in a GOP campaign that was entirely about President Obama? Disapproving of President Obama isn't much of a motivator if people don't think the Republicans can do a better job. That leads to another question about the makup of the electorate. The 2010 midterm elections were the first election cycle in which more people identified as conservatives than moderates. Will that remain true? If the number of moderates is down, then we'll know just how much of a base election this was. How did the business candidates do? Voters say they want business experience in their politicians. In a recent Gallup poll, 81 percent responded that the country would be better governed if more people with business and management experience were elected. But in practice it's not always a boon for candidates. That may be because achieving success in business often puts you in contact with politically unpopular practices like outsourcing and offshoring. That has affected candidates in both parties. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker attacked his Democratic rival Mary Burke for outsourcing. In the Georgia Senate race, Michelle Nunn bludgeoned her Republican opponent David Purdue for the same thing. In the close Connecticut governor's race, Democratic incumbent Dan Malloy has attacked his opponent Tom Foley's business record. In a CBS poll in May, Democrats outpolled Republicans by 10 points when asked which party cared about people like you and which party was more likely to help Americans get a fair chance to get ahead. How will these attacks on candidates with business experience play out? Will Nunn have a wider margin over Perdue among voters who care about the economy? Will the attacks against Burke limit her appeal to voters in Wisconsin who already are inclined to think that Gov. Walker doesn't share their concerns? Which poll was right in Iowa? The campaign circus these days invariably includes a debate over polling methodology. As if to ensure that debate remains robust, two polls came out on election eve showing very different results in Iowa. The highly respected Des Moines Register poll showed Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst up by 7 points against Democrat Bruce Braley. In the Quinnipiac poll, the race was dead even. You can imagine which party said which poll was skewed. On Election Day, one of them will probably be proven wrong--unless of course the result is within the margin of error of both polls. Even Election Day can't settle every question."	What to Look for on Election Day
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/scott_walker_s_re_election_as_wisconsin_s_governor_why_republicans_think.html	"EAU CLAIRE, Wisconsin--On a portable stage in the parking lot of a strip mall in front of the Eau Claire GOP field office, sandwiched between a Curves and an Office Products Co. store, Gov. Scott Walker is keeping his chin up. After the beating he's taken, that's no small feat. Walker, Wisconsin's incumbent Republican governor, is in a tough statewide contest for the third time in four years, and this one is much closer than it was supposed to be. The Real Clear Politics polling average has Walker up by just 2.2 percentage points over Democratic nominee Mary Burke, and that number is inflated by a recent Marquette University poll nobody takes seriously that shows him with a seven-point lead. The latest data, from Public Policy Polling, has him up by just one point (well within the margin of error). The Wisconsin governor's race is one of the closest in the country. And, according to conversations with top Republicans and conservative activists, it's also the single most important. Walker is revered among national conservatives for taking on Wisconsin's powerful public sector unions at enormous political risk. A National Review cover depicted him as Perseus slaying Medusa, and the American Spectator has already declared that if he pulls off a win on Tuesday, ""he's our man"" for 2016. While many of the potential Republican presidential nominees are highly polarizing for the right--Sen. Rand Paul has been in hawks' crosshairs since Day 1, and Jeb Bush's stances on immigration and Common Core already have Tea Party types seeing red--Walker is the rare Republican star who nobody hates. He matters so much to some Republicans that if Wisconsin's governor loses on Tuesday night, winning the Senate would just be a consolation prize. ""In my mind, if Scott Walker loses, it's a bad election cycle even if there are big wins everywhere else,"" says Phil Kerpen, who runs the fiscal conservative advocacy organization American Commitment, ""because the impact on public policy will be more negative than any political upside elsewhere."" Winning statewide as a conservative Republican in Wisconsin isn't easy. Even though five of its eight congressmen are Republicans and the GOP controls its statehouse, Wisconsin is a very blue state. It's historically been a union stronghold, and it hasn't gone Republican in a presidential race since 1984. For progressives, the Republicans' fragile hold on state government is an insult, an affront that should be corrected. Given those realities, you might expect a Republican governor to govern coyly. Walker hasn't. He won the 2010 gubernatorial race by 5.8 points, and in February of 2011 he proposed Act 10 to dramatically curb public sector unions' collective bargaining power, to bar unions from automatically collecting dues from members' paychecks, and to demand higher health insurance and pension contributions from government workers, along with a host of other changes. The progressives' response was immediate--and not particularly subtle. Activists camped out in the Capitol building for weeks, Democratic state lawmakers fled the state to try to prevent a vote on the bill, and national progressives charged conservatives with a ""Republican jihad."" None of that worked, and Walker signed the bill on March 11. Unions and their allies pushed back hard. They challenged the bill in court and lost, worked to vote out a conservative state Supreme Court justice and lost, tried to recall 10 Republican state Senators and lost 7 of those contests, and in 2012 tried to recall Walker and lost by 6.8 points. (Also worth noting: Republicans forced three recall elections for Democratic state senators, and Democrats won all three of those.) So Walker and his Wisconsin allies have faced an enormous number of brutal electoral battles. But given polling, Tuesday's gubernatorial race is Democrats' best shot to get rid of Walker for good. That would be a boon for Wisconsin progressives, of course, but it would also have national repercussions. A Walker loss would send the message to Republican governors across the country that if they take on unions and push for hard-hitting conservative policy overhauls, they will be punished. ""If we don't send Gov. Walker back to Madison, that sends a message to every principled conservative leader that if you stand up for your people, if you grow jobs, if you grow businesses, and you balance your budget, you won't be rewarded,"" said Rep. Sean Duffy, who spoke to a crowd of volunteers in that Eau Claire parking lot a few minutes before appearances from Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, and Walker. Walker had a slightly different tone when he took the stage a few minutes later, criticizing ""Washington-based special interests."" ""What they don't like about what we've done in Wisconsin is that they're afraid, come next Tuesday, it might happen elsewhere,"" he said. So what's Tuesday night like for national Republicans if they win the Senate but Walker loses? ""That's not a good night,"" said Priebus, speaking after the rally. ""Walker represents not just the future of Wisconsin, but the future of our party and the future of people that make promises and keep promises, and whether they can be rewarded for doing those things."" Talking up the accomplishments of Republican governors is a key part of the RNC's messaging. Obama is hurting the country, they say, so look to states like Wisconsin and Texas to see how things go when a Republican is in charge. A Walker loss would be a frightening message for Republican governors around the country mulling Wisconsin-esque policy changes. Kerpen argues that if unions stop Walker and his reforms, ""then they would sort of strangle that in its crib, and it would end in Wisconsin."" Patrick Gleason, the director of state affairs at Americans for Tax Reform, said a Walker loss ""will scare a lot of governors across the country."" ""That will send a message: Don't do this, because you very well might not survive,"" he said. ""If Walker prevails, it's going to embolden a lot of governors and lawmakers across the country. You're going to see a lot of governors and lawmakers in other states get spines--or get stronger spines--than they had prior to Walker's re-election."" Conservatives are also increasingly concerned about the verve with which prosecutors have targeted many of the GOP governors who are also potential 2016 contenders. Govs. Rick Perry, Chris Christie, and Walker have all faced legal scrutiny that conservatives charge is politically motivated. If Walker loses, they will brace themselves for broader use of ""lawfare."" But those fears weren't on display in Eau Claire this weekend. ""Wisconsin is gonna save America!"" Duffy yelled as he rallied the crowd in the parking lot. Walker has to get re-elected first."	The Most Important Election in America
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/mitt_romney_s_return_moderate_republicans_similar_to_the_former_presidential.html	"Mitt Romney is not going gentle into that good night. Despite the rough ending of his presidential bid, he's been busy in Republican Party politics, crisscrossing the country to campaign for rising stars and keeping his public profile high. He also made a number of significant endorsements during primary season, and his endorsees had much better outcomes than Sarah Palin's. His busy national media schedule has stoked rumors that he's even considering another presidential bid in 2016--rumors that he and his wife have flatly discounted. President or not, Romney is omnipresent. But if you wish he was still in some sort of elected office, fear not: A few New England states could--maybe--elect three new Romneyesque, socially moderate, technocratic Republican governors on Tuesday. Winning a statewide race as a Republican in New England is no day at the beach, but if things go the GOP's way, then a fresh new crop of Mitts could spring up on the East Coast. First off is Charlie Baker. He's following Romney's footsteps very closely, as he's gunning for the former presidential contender's old job as governor of Massachusetts. Baker jumps at every opportunity to tout his social moderation; he told Boston Globe columnist Yvonne Abraham that he's ""to the left of Barack Obama"" on the social issues that have historically electrified Republicans' socially conservative base. Romney took similar steps to tout his Bay State-friendly position on abortion when he was running for governor, promising to ""preserve and protect a woman's right to choose"" in a debate. (He later walked back that position, of course.) Unlike Romney, Baker favors gay marriage. He often brings up his gay brother when he talks about his support for gay rights. In a debate, he drew applause after challenging a long-shot candidate who suggested homosexuality was a ""sexual perversion."" The RealClearPolitics polling average gives him a 4.2 percentage point lead over Democratic nominee Martha Coakley, so Baker's strategy may be working. It doesn't hurt that Coakley is a notoriously ineffective campaigner. It also doesn't hurt that if you squint, Baker looks a tiny bit like Robert Redford. Then there's Allan Fung, the Republican running for governor in Rhode Island. His contest has drawn far less national attention than Baker's, but RCP rates it a toss-up. RCP's David Byler explains that the state's sizable population of independent voters is open to Republicans' overtures. On top of that, Rhode Island is one of the most Catholic states in America, and Gina Raimondo, Fung's Democratic opponent, drew biting criticism from the bishop of Providence after she promised to repeal the state's partial-birth abortion ban. Fung's stance on abortion, in contrast, is right out of the Romney 2002 playbook: pro-choice, but not too pro-choice. Naturally, Romney visited Little Rhody to endorse him earlier this month. Fung is having a tougher time than Baker, but a win wouldn't be totally shocking, especially given that Rhode Island hasn't elected a Democratic governor since 1990. The Connecticut governor's race, which could also produce a Romney-type, is as close as humanly possible; RCP gives Republican Tom Foley a whopping 0.5 percentage point lead in their polling average over incumbent Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy. Like Romney, Foley has a venture capital background and a striking pair of sideburns. This race is a rematch, as Foley lost to Malloy by less than one point in the 2010 race for governor. Foley is running on a technocratic platform that includes lowering the sales tax, dialing back regulations, and ""improved IT to make government more productive."" One could convincingly argue that Tom Foley is a platonic archetype of Mitt Romney and that he is more like Mitt Romney than Mitt Romney is like himself. Two last addendums: First, not all New England Republican gubernatorial candidates are social moderates. Paul LePage, the incumbent in Maine, is about as pro-life as possible. He's also highly vulnerable. If he loses on Tuesday, that's likely to have a chilling effect on other pro-life candidates looking to compete statewide in the Northeast. And second, not all pro-choice Republicans are in New England. Monica Wehby, the Republican Senate nominee in Oregon who will definitely lose on Tuesday, says that abortion ""is a personal decision between a woman and her family, not a woman and the federal government,"" per Oregon Live. Like Wehby, Illinois Republican gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner demonstrates zero interest in making it harder to get an abortion. Unlike Wehby, he's actually running a competitive campaign. Romney's days as a governor may be long gone, but his spirit lives on, at least through Tuesday."	The Next Mitt Romney
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/wall_street_s_favorite_house_members_the_members_of_congress_taking_apart.html	"Rep. Shelley Moore Capito wants West Virginians to know she's a defender of community banks. From her seat on the House Financial Services Committee, Capito argues, she has protected small local financial institutions from the overreach of aggressive regulators. Among her biggest supporters, however, are the biggest banks in the world. Capito, a Republican, is running for the West Virginia U.S. Senate seat that's being vacated by Sen. Jay Rockefeller after 30 years. She counts Citigroup and Goldman Sachs among her most generous campaign donors. ""She's a reliable vote for all things Wall Street,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan group that advocates for increased market oversight of financial institutions. Capito is part of the ""Congressional Banking Caucus,"" a group of lawmakers identified by the Center for Public Integrity as especially solicitous to the banking industry. They are all members of the House Financial Services Committee and have been the recipients of generous campaign support from financial services company employees and political action committees. The other members of the group are Financial Services Committee Chairman and Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, New Jersey Republican Rep. Scott Garrett, Wisconsin Republican Rep. Sean Duffy, Connecticut Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, Missouri Republican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, New York Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks, California Republican Rep. Ed Royce, Georgia Democratic Rep. David Scott, Ohio Republican Rep. Steve Stivers, and Missouri Republican Rep. Ann Wagner. The group has been central to efforts led by Hensarling to undo many of the financial reforms enacted in the Dodd-Frank law of 2010. At least 30 bills have been proposed to the House during the 113th Congress, aimed at chipping away at aspects of Dodd-Frank. Members of the banking caucus sponsored or co-sponsored 20 of those laws. At least 21 have been referred to the House Financial Services Committee and three have been passed to the Senate. Since the Center for Public Integrity published a report on these lawmakers in April, their efforts to reshape the regulatory landscape have continued. Luetkemeyer, for example, has proposed several bills to limit the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the new consumer regulator created by Dodd-Frank, which he blames for raising costs to consumers and driving small banks out of business. ""There's a consolidation going on out there right now and it's a result not necessarily of the market but a result of regulation,"" he said at a June event, sponsored by Politico and the Independent Community Bankers of America. ""This is having the reverse effect of what actually was the intention of Dodd-Frank, which was to protect the consumers."" Himes, who spent 12 years at Goldman Sachs before running for office, is often at odds with Hensarling while still looking to protect Wall Street firms from regulatory overreach. ""He will continue to push back against attempts to undermine key protections established by Dodd-Frank while reviewing the law's unintended consequences,"" his spokesman Kevin Garrahan, said. None of the other members or their representatives responded to requests for comment on the committee's work. Capito is the only member of the caucus who is leaving her House seat in a bid for the Senate and is the only one in a competitive race. All the other members of the group are rated by the Cook Political Report as having safe seats, except for Duffy, whose district ""leans Republican"" according to the nonpartisan political analyst. That means their financial benefactors--from megabanks to mortgage bankers to payday lenders--can continue to count on these lawmakers to push through their agendas and protect them from excessive regulation. Capito has defended herself against criticism by her opponent, West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, that she's too cozy with the banking industry. In an Oct. 7 debate, Capito acknowledged that she voted against limiting bonuses for executives of banks that had received taxpayer bailouts. But, she said she also voted against the $700 billion bank bailout approved by Congress in 2008. She said her support of the banking industry is meant to help small, local banks. ""I'm going to defend the West Virginia community banks and the West Virginia credit unions. We need to have a full financial system here in the state that doesn't include big banks, that includes the ability to get a car, to get a mortgage."" she said. Still, some of her most ardent supporters are the biggest financial institutions on Wall Street. The employees and political action committees of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Bank of New York Mellon are among the top 20 donors to Capito's Senate run, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. She also has the support of many energy companies. Amy Graham, a spokeswoman for Capito's campaign, declined to respond to questions for this story. Capito is not among the top recipients of contributions from the Independent Community Bankers of America, the lobbying group that represents small banks across the country. The group contributed $5,000 to her Senate effort, just a quarter of what it donated to her fellow ""Banking Caucus"" member, Luetkemeyer. Capito has been an ally of community banks. Late last year, she led the House opposition to a proposed regulation that would have required community banks to get rid of certain investments, a move that would have cost several of the banks' profits. She and Hensarling first wrote a letter to regulators asking them to reconsider the rule, and followed up by filing legislation that would reverse it. Regulators responded and announced Jan. 15 that the new regulation would not apply to smaller banks. But Capito's activism also benefits the banking giants who have been among her greatest supporters. Capito, who chairs the subcommittee that oversees consumer lending and finance companies, is married to a banker who has worked for Wells Fargo and Citigroup. ""One characteristic of her bills is that they do include community banks, but they would also help much larger banks,"" said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of groups that advocate for financial reforms that help consumers. Stanley cites, as an example, a Capito proposal to limit regulators' powers in bank examinations and create an ombudsman where banks can take complaints about their regulators examinations. The American Bankers Association, which represents all banks including community banks and megabanks, has lobbied for this bill. ""This is definitely something that community banks are asking for, but it's not limited to community banks. It would greatly benefit Wall Street banks,"" Stanley said. This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C."	How Wall Street's Favorite Politicians Are Taking Apart Dodd-Frank, One Piece at a Time
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/mississippi_the_affordable_care_act_and_racism_the_state_s_failures_are.html	"Driven by its high poverty rate, Mississippi ranks low on health and wellness. It has one the highest rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes in the country, as well as the highest mortality rate for infants and adults. These ills are worst among its black residents: 43.2 percent of Mississippi blacks are afflicted by obesity and its associated problems and 44 percent live at or below the poverty line, compared with a--still high--30.2 percent obesity rate and 16 percent poverty rate for whites. Which is to say that, more than anywhere else, the Affordable Care Act is necessary in Mississippi. But, as Sarah Varney describes in a vital piece for Politico Magazine, the state's Tea Party-tinged Republican leadership--including Gov. Phil Bryant--refuses to budge. Not only did it shutter a state-run private exchange for individuals to purchase health insurance, it refused the Medicaid expansion, which would have extended coverage to those living in desperate poverty. The latter consequence is especially destructive. As designed, the Affordable Care Act provides Medicaid for everyone at or below 133 percent of the poverty line and subsidized private insurance for everyone above. Chief Justice John Roberts and the Supreme Court made the expansion optional, but they failed to extend the subsidies to poorer families, which left a gap. If you're too poor to qualify for subsidies--but don't qualify for the present Medicaid program in your state--you're left in the cold. In Mississippi, this leaves 138,000 residents--most of them black--with no insurance options at all. In addition, the state's full rejection of the ACA has thrown the existing hospital system into chaos. ""[The hospitals] had been banking on newly insured patients to replace the federal support for hospitals serving the uninsured, which was set to taper off as people gained coverage,"" writes Varney. ""Now, instead of more people getting more care in Mississippi, in many cases, they would get less."" It's a disaster. A worsening of conditions for a state that--Varney notes--is already last in life expectancy, per capita income, and child literacy. We know why Mississippi Republicans refuse to work with the ACA: A hyper-ideological, small government conservatism that disdains social programs and public investment. But it's worth a look at the history behind that conservatism, which lives strongest in Mississippi but exists throughout the Deep South. Mississippi has poor social outcomes and a threadbare safety net. It also has--and has long had--the largest black population in the country. And it's where slavery was very lucrative, and Jim Crow most vicious. This is not a coincidence. In Mississippi--as in the rest of the South--white supremacy brought a politics of racist antagonism. For instance, the Civil War was hardly over before, notes historian Eric Foner in his book Reconstruction, it passed the first of the ""Black Codes"" that would limit freedom for freedpeople:"	Why Mississippi Fails in Almost Every Imaginable Way
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/maine_ebola_nurse_kaci_hickox_just_walked_out_on_her_quarantine_will_maine.html	"Kaci Hickox has left the building. The Doctors Without Borders nurse ended her ""voluntary"" home quarantine on Thursday morning, leaving her Maine home for a bike ride with her boyfriend. Hickox's daylight pedaling comes after a week in which she was ensnared in a tangled web of state Ebola regulations. After landing in New Jersey last Friday, she spent last weekend quarantined against her will in a Newark hospital on the orders of Gov. Chris Christie, then the first half of this week voluntarily isolated in Maine at the request of Gov. Paul LePage. ""I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based,"" Hickox told reporters on Wednesday evening, making it clear that she wouldn't abide the state's request that she self-quarantine for the remainder of the virus' 21-day incubation period. Now, Hickox has lived up to her promise. Unlike most states, Maine doesn't allow its public health department to quarantine first and ask questions later. State police are keeping tabs on Hickox, but there's not a lot they can do without a court order allowing them to either take the nurse into custody or forcibly return her to her home. An order allowing for her temporary detention prior to (and likely during) a court hearing could come down as soon as today. Everyone I spoke to for this story believes that a hearing will happen, perhaps as soon as early next week, though it's at this point unclear whether the case would be heard in Maine district or superior court. That hearing would look at the question of whether the state can legally quarantine Hickox as a result of the time she spent treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone earlier this month. To put it another way: Does Hickox pose enough of a public health risk to justify her loss of freedom? That legal fight will serve as a proxy--and could set a legal precedent--for the national debate over just how far the United States should go to contain a deadly virus that has ravaged West Africa but has so far claimed only one life on U.S. soil. It's no secret what side scientists are on in that debate. The public health community has been vocal about its opposition to mandatory quarantines for medical workers who are not showing symptoms of an Ebola infection. Not only could such bans deter American medical professionals from volunteering to go where they're desperately needed, experts say such measures are also unlikely to do any good in the first place. Ebola is highly infectious but not highly contagious. It takes only a small amount of contact with the virus to become infected, but the only way for that infection to be transmitted is via the bodily fluids of someone who is sick. That's why experts say there is no need to quarantine nurses and doctors who have been exposed. Even if they have been infected, they'll have a chance to self-diagnose and get themselves to a hospital before they become contagious. Hickox's lawyers have made it clear that will be at the heart of their case. ""Our position is very simple: There's no justification for the state of Maine to quarantine her,"" her lawyer Norman Siegel told the Associated Press on Wednesday. ""She has no symptoms, and therefore she's not contagious. And she's not at a risk to the public or the health and welfare of people in the state of Maine."" Scientists, however, don't have the last word in the court of law. ""The judge will need to weigh the probability of infection, however small, versus the magnitude of harm an outbreak could cause,"" says Margaret Foster Riley, a professor of law at the University of Virginia. Maine officials will likely make the case that other officials have gone above and beyond the active monitoring the federal government has deemed sufficient for all but the highest-risk individuals. Maine can point to New York and New Jersey, which were the first two states to implement mandatory quarantines, and it can also look abroad, where the Pentagon has approved what looks an awful lot like a 21-day government-ordered quarantine for U.S. soldiers returning from Ebola relief missions (even if it's far from an apples-to-apples comparison). ""They'll have to convince the judge that there are plenty of other reasonable people taking similar measures,"" Riley says. Historically, courts have tended to side with the quarantiner over the quarantinee. But the modern case history is dominated by cases involving tuberculosis, which--unlike Ebola--is highly contagious and easily spread. Still, the TB cases are relevant precedents here, because many of them were less about the current state of the individual being quarantined than their willingness to follow doctor's orders. ""It was more of a predictive question: What are the chances that they become non-compliant and then spread the disease?"" says Wendy Parmet, the director of Northeastern University's Program on Health Policy and Law. ""It would be remarkable for the state to argue that the scientific consensus is erroneous. Instead, they'll most likely need to argue that without the quarantine you can never know what the person might do--whether they'll follow the medical recommendations or not."" The courts have tended to side with the state when it comes to TB, particularly when an individual had been non-compliant in the past, or when he is homeless or mentally ill. But Hickox's case is obviously different. ""Unless her outspoken political stance is held against her,"" says Parmet, ""we don't have a reason to believe that she's unable or unwilling to take her temperature two times a day."" Likewise, Hickox's legal team could point to the fact that all three health professionals who developed Ebola symptoms while in the United States were quick to alert authorities. One other area of law the court could consider is the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill--but that too appears likely to be something of a dead end for the state. ""The recent trend there, really for the past 50 years, has been in favor of individual liberty,"" says Riley. Given the lack of case history, it is very, very difficult to predict whether Hickox or the state would prevail. One factor that may override all other considerations is that local judges are typically hesitant to overrule local officials in the heat of the moment on matters of public safety. ""The science is pretty clear, but we need to understand the atmosphere in which this is unfolding,"" says Parmet. ""It's a lot easier for them to look at it afterward and say this was a mistake."" A decision by the Maine court won't end the national debate. It would, however, give momentum to the winning side. If a judge were to decide that Maine doesn't have the legal authority to quarantine Hickox, medical workers who face similar restrictions in the future will be that much more likely to challenge those measures in court. Likewise, if the court sides with the state, those workers might be less likely to fight. ""The only prediction I can make now,"" says Parmet,"" is that there will be a lot more litigation and a lot more chaos in the weeks to come."""	Maine's Ebola Nurse Just Left Her House. Will a Court Be Able to Force Her Back Inside?
