But he's a Bush--the third to run for president--and that comes with ""free stuff""--the unearned advantage of dynastic ties that will always keep you from becoming Jeb Nobody. And he's had that leg up since well before he made his presidential run official. Jeb entered the race with checks from Bush family donors and help from Bush family advisers. Indeed, his super PAC raised massive sums in the first few months of the year, almost all on the strength and reliability of his name. But Jeb is yet to prove that strength or reliability. Whether it's his rhetoric on immigration (""Frankly ['anchor babies'] is more related to Asians"") or black Americans (""Our message is one of hope and aspiration. It isn't one of division and 'Get in line and we'll take care of you with free stuff,' ""), Bush has shown a tin ear. He's demonstrated an even worse instinct for political conflict, withering against Donald Trump and other outsider candidates. He's at 8.7 percent in national polling averages and holds high unfavorables with voters overall. As such, reports the Washington Post, those early donors are beginning to waver, unsure if they should stick with Bush for the duration. ""Jeb Bush is entering a critical phase of his Republican presidential campaign, with top donors warning that the former Florida governor needs to demonstrate growth in the polls over the next month or face serious defections among supporters,"" notes the Post. If Bush were one-of-a-kind--the only ""establishment"" candidate in the race--this wouldn't be a huge problem. But he has a strong--arguably gifted--opponent in his former protege, Marco Rubio. His hyped announcement aside, the Florida senator has taken an understated approach to his campaign. He has been doing small events in the crucial primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire as well as his home state of Florida. His focus has been policy: He has released a tax plan, outlined a foreign policy vision, and issued a plan for paid family leave. Other than minor spats with Donald Trump, he avoids conflict with other candidates. And in his fight with Trump, he's landed a real blow. ""He had a really bad debate performance last week,"" said Rubio of the real estate mogul during a recent radio interview. ""He's not well-informed on the issues. He really never talks about issues and can't have more than a 10-second soundbite on any key issue. ... I think he's kind of been exposed a little bit over the last seven days, and he's a touchy and insecure guy. So that's how he reacts, and people can see through it."" More importantly, he is broadening his coalition in the party. After Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker left the race, Rubio moved quickly and scooped most of his donors to his side. On Friday, he won a warm welcome from activists at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, where he announced the resignation of House Speaker John Boehner to an enthusiastic crowd of social conservatives. He's backed by a host of Republican foreign policy minds, and he's a favorite of ""reform"" conservatives who want more, and stronger, ""pro-family"" policies that are meant to address kitchen-table economic issues. Rubio has shined at the debates and performed well in events like the recent Heritage Action forum in South Carolina. As for polls, Rubio has been on the upswing, surpassing the other grassroots and establishment candidates--other than Bush--with 7.6 percent in the Huffington Post average of national polls. He has high favorables--58 percent of Republicans like him in the latest CNN poll--and, as a potential nominee, he's acceptable to most GOP voters. No, he's not yet the favorite to win--especially if we're judging by traditional measures like fundraising and endorsements--but it's easy to imagine a Bush-Rubio race for the establishment vote, where Rubio pulls ahead on the strength of his skill and talent as a politician. With that said, we also shouldn't underestimate Jeb. Between his campaign and his affiliated super PAC, Right to Rise, Bush has about $120 million. His brother George W. Bush is prepared to fundraise for his campaign, and he can expect even more donations in the next few months. He still leads in endorsements--although that could change if Rubio continues to surge ahead--and his super PAC is spending $24 million on ads in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. If you want an analogy for this race, your best choice is the 2008 Democratic primary. There, a strong--but far from dominant--Hillary Clinton ran a lackluster campaign against a savvy and popular newcomer, Barack Obama, who leveraged skill, strategy, and the historic nature of his bid to win a close race against the then-senator. There's no question Bush can win (for a while, in fact, Clinton could too). But he has to step his game up, and fast; Rubio is on the rise, and Jeb--more than anyone else--is his target.

Now comes the spin game. Politicians from Marco Rubio to Rick Santorum are already at work, recasting what the pope said to suit their agendas. Don't let them fool you. The pope had tough words for everyone, but especially conservatives. Here's a rundown of the challenges he delivered: a few to the left, and a fistful to the right. 1. Capitalism. Last Tuesday, on his flight from Cuba to Washington, D.C., Francis said he was misperceived as a lefty. In his speech to Congress Thursday, he called business a ""noble vocation"" and endorsed ""the harnessing of the spirit of free enterprise."" But at every stop, he advocated constraints on the free market to protect its underdogs. In Washington, he declared, ""There is no social or moral justification, no justification whatsoever, for lack of housing."" In Philadelphia, he praised ""the growth of the labor movement."" At the United Nations, he instructed ""international financial agencies"" to make sure countries ""are not subjected to oppressive lending systems."" 2. Climate. Francis added environmental stewardship (which he said was threatened by ""man's predatory relationship with nature"") to a list of ""essential aspects of the church's mission."" He praised President Obama's plan to curb air pollution. He contradicted several Republican talking points: that humanity's role in climate change is unclear, that action on this problem can be postponed, and that unilateral American efforts would make no difference. ""Climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation,"" said the pope. He demanded action on ""the environmental deterioration caused by human activity,"" and he told lawmakers that ""this Congress [has] an important role to play."" 3. Immigrants. On the plane from Cuba, the pope said he had considered entering the United States through Mexico, specifically at Ciudad Juarez. That's a clear gesture of solidarity with Latin American migrants who have been targeted by Republicans in Congress and in the presidential race. In Washington, the pope instructed American bishops to welcome and help immigrants. In some of the strongest words of his visit, the Argentine told Congress:"	On Issue After Issue, Pope Francis' Visit Was a Rebuke to Conservative Ideology
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/john_boehner_devoured_by_the_gop_revolution_his_right_wing_rhetoric_came.html	"John Boehner ends his career a conservative. He helped craft the Contract With America with Newt Gingrich, and stood on the right flank of the House Republican caucus for most of his career. After Barack Obama took office, Boehner immediately moved to opposition, accusing him of ""snuffing out"" the America he knew and comparing politics in 2010 to America's fight against Great Britain. ""There's a political rebellion brewing,"" he said, ""and I don't think we've seen anything like it since 1776."" When, galvanized by this kind of rhetoric, the Tea Party wave swept conservatives into office--a second Republican Revolution--he was the obvious choice, winning a unanimous vote for speaker-designate ahead of the official election for speaker of the House. After 20 years in office, he was finally at the pinnacle of congressional power. But then the revolution spiraled out of control. The Tea Party conservatives elected in 2010 weren't interested in governing as much as destroying President Obama's agenda. Everything--even routine governance--was second to the war on the president. And given his rhetoric, they expected Boehner to go along for the ride. Before 2011 the debt ceiling was an easy excuse for showmanship. Politicians would posture against raising the federal limit on debt, and after everyone was finished, Congress would raise it. Conservatives wanted to use the limit as leverage for cutting government, and they pressured Boehner into doing just that. If Obama wouldn't slash spending, then Republicans would cap the debt, causing a default and spiking the economy into the ground. Boehner provoked the standoff, then tried to defuse it with a long-term debt deal. But conservatives--led by then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor--wouldn't yield, and he abandoned negotiations. If not for a last-minute bill to make automatic cuts to federal spending, the United States would have reneged on its debt, causing an economic crisis. It was an extraordinarily risky gamble that hurt the economy even as it fulfilled some Republican objectives. Still, conservatives weren't satisfied. Despite this, he held on. What's striking is Boehner never supported Obama or his policies. He opposed the stimulus, voted against the Affordable Care Act, and--by all accounts and measures--was in the right wing of the Republican Party. But he was also an institutionalist; a modern-day Girondin who supported revolutionary goals but refused to plunge the United States into catastrophe for the sake of partisan or ideological goals. For three years conservatives used deadlines as leverage, and Boehner struggled to lead Republicans to a resolution that protected his position from unruly conservatives and left the country mostly unscathed. This brinksmanship is how we got the ""fiscal cliff"" fight, the October 2013 shutdown over Obamacare, and the February 2015 fight over Homeland Security funding and immigration. To show his mettle to the most conservative Republicans, Boehner provoked a crisis or confrontation. And when it was clear the administration wouldn't budge, he capitulated, telling members that he did his best. This effort was a mixed success. Boehner survived Tea Party anger, but Cantor--who encouraged Tea Party resistance--fell to the furor, losing his seat to an obscure right-wing challenger. What's amazing about all of this is the degree to which Boehner and his team have actually delivered conservative policy. Under his leadership, congressional Republicans have slashed federal spending--achieving $3.2 trillion in cuts--and blocked important parts of Obama's agenda, like comprehensive immigration reform. Despite this, rank-and-file Republicans hate him. According to a new survey from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, 72 percent of GOP primary voters are dissatisfied with Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, including the 36 percent who want them ""immediately removed"" from their posts. Spurred by controversial (and heavily criticized) videos released this summer, House conservatives want government to end funding for Planned Parenthood, despite no evidence of misconduct or criminal activity and the long-standing ban on federal funds for abortion. If Republican leaders don't budge, then those Republicans--and their allies in the Senate--will shut down the government. Once again, Boehner would have to fight a losing battle for the sake of defusing an intransigent minority. Once again, he'd be maligned for making a deal. But this time, he refused. Rather than indulge and debase himself for the most extreme people in his caucus, he quit. In the short term, this takes a shutdown off the table--Boehner will stay in power through the deadline for funding the government, and will likely cut a deal with Democrats to keep things going. Beyond that, however, it's hard to know what happens. His likely successor is current Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy is just as conservative as Boehner and will face the same pressures as his predecessor. Put differently, the same Tea Party revolution that elevated Boehner and Cantor eventually ended their careers. If McCarthy follows their path, and doesn't bend to conservative demands, then the revolution might devour him, too."	John Boehner Was Devoured by His Own Revolution

Matt Salmon met with Speaker John Boehner on Thursday, Salmon knew something was different. ""I thought something was up,"" said Salmon who, along with other conservatives bucking Boehner, met with the House speaker for an hour Thursday evening. They were there to negotiate funding the government, which the members of the Freedom Caucus said they would not support if funding for Planned Parenthood were included. ""He was resolute about the continuing resolution,"" said Salmon, referring to Boehner's choice for keeping the government funded. ""He usually offers a few options. He wasn't trying to find an alternative. He wasn't mean about it. He was very matter of fact."" Another person in the meeting said that Boehner made the case for why he should keep his job, and the conversation turned to whether there would be an effort to oust him. He explained all that he had done for conservatives and reasserted his pro-life credentials. If he put up a real defense then it suggests that Boehner wasn't on his way out and really may have made the decision Thursday night. Something was up indeed. Usually Boehner tries to allow the House to ""work its will,"" but his will was in play this time. Boehner wasn't trying to accommodate the conservatives in the normal fashion because his job was no longer on the line. It wasn't on the line because he was taking himself out of the game. On Friday morning Boehner announced that he is leaving Congress and leaving his top post on Oct. 30. The conventional wisdom at the moment is that Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy will take the spot. Rumors were circulating Friday morning that he was already whipping votes. McCarthy is not as conservative as Boehner, which will be a challenge for him. But the bigger challenge is that he'll need conservative votes to get elected, and those conservatives are making demands. What conservatives want is for the new speaker to be more assertive. That means with the president but also with Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who conservatives say should change the filibuster rules to keep Democrats from blocking conservative priorities. It's not usually very easy for the leader of one house of Congress to tell the leader of anohter house what to do. If the new speaker doesn't keep the pressure on McConnell and deliver results, predicts one Boehner ally, ""We're going to be right back here in the same place in six months."" One of the ironies for Boehner is that as he heads out the door, conservatives give him credit for fighting to rid the House of earmarks. That was a tool he could have used to keep his fidgety conference in line. But it also demonstrated the high-water mark for his level of activity. When conservatives didn't see him fighting as hard for the president's executive action on immigration or against Planned Parenthood funding, they charged that his heart wasn't really behind those conservative priorities. So the critique wasn't that Boehner didn't fight for conservative principles. He just didn't fight for every one. That's a high bar for the next speaker. Thursday was a moment of highs and lows for the speaker of the House. The former altar boy who attended Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Reading, Ohio, hosted the Pope. He'd been working on that project for 20 years. ""It's a pretty big deal for a little Catholic boy like me,"" he said. After experiencing the eternal questions in the Pope's presence and the soul-examining questions in his address, Boehner then spent that hour with restive members of his conference discussing the details of funding the government and defunding Planned Parenthood. The descent from high to low happened at a velocity that could have been clocked by NASA. Friday morning as Boehner let his conference know his decision, a House colleague was heard to utter an expletive--a reference one member told me to those conservative representatives who were pressuring Boehner. Boehner heard the epithet, according to the account, and said he was stepping down to help bring the conference together, not to initiate new rounds of recrimination. The fight over funding Planned Parenthood was the proximate cause for Boehner's latest fight with conservatives, but the departure was really the result of many of the fights from the past and the fights that were likely in the future. Conservatives feel he hasn't fought the administration hard enough and used the power of the purse rigorously enough. ""In my district John Boehner is less well-liked than Barack Obama,"" said one member of the restive caucus. Conservatives are also angry that Boehner didn't pick more fights with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""I would want him to go after Mitch McConnell,"" says Salmon about what he would want from the next speaker. ""He so lamely uses the 60-vote threshold, and the next speaker should tell him to stand up and knock it off."" Salmon and others think that McConnell could do away with the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster, as Democratic Leader Harry Reid did for judicial appointments. But there was just too much plaque built up over time from these battles between the speaker and the core group of conservatives who he and his team refer to as the ""Hell No Caucus."" Also, Boehner had just achieved the height of his speakership. (In my calls this morning, Boehner's friends and allies weren't sure whether being named speaker or hosting the Pope was the bigger honor in his life.) The theory is that by stepping down, Boehner will allow Republicans to start afresh. But the problems are still there. Conservatives want action, but they are limited by the Senate and a Democratic president. ""The crazies have taken over,"" said New York Republican Rep. Pete King. Newt Gingrich told Fox News that Boehner faced what he had once faced as speaker. ""Part of your party has demands that are not reachable, and they view your failure to reach them as a sign they need somebody new who somehow magically is going to get what they want,"" said Gingrich, who stepped down from the position for similar reasons. When Sen. Marco Rubio announced that Boehner was stepping down at the Value Voters Summit, a gathering of social conservatives, the room erupted into applause. Rubio used the moment to make the case for a new generation of leadership. Heritage Action Fund, which was among the groups Boehner criticized for raising money by stirring up conservatives with false claims, danced on Boehner's grave. Sen. Ted Cruz kicked him on the way out the door, accusing Boehner of selling out his constituents. Boehner's great achievement was bringing the Pope and his message of fellow feeling to Congress. But those lessons of caring for the person beyond his or her politics weren't in much evidence among Boehner's detractors. The speaker could bring everyone together in the same room, but that doesn't mean he could make them listen. That was true of his tenure too, but on his way out at least one of his adversaries had a kind word. ""He has a very kind heart. He is a very decent human being,"" said Salmon. ""Sometimes a leader has to take really tough positions. He did today, and he did the right thing by stepping down. If you are going to sum up everything, you'd have to include this selfless act by putting Congress before himself.""

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/house_democrats_could_save_house_speaker_john_boehner_but_they_probably.html	"Shortly after Pope Francis' address to Congress on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell began the process through which the Republican-controlled legislature will ultimately fund Planned Parenthood along with the rest of the federal government. The chamber first voted on a short-term funding bill that stripped Planned Parenthood of federal funding, simply so McConnell could demonstrate that the votes weren't there. The final count of 47 ""yes"" votes was nowhere even close to the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. So McConnell then moved quickly to set up a vote on a ""clean"" resolution funding the government as-is through mid-December. Once the Senate takes care of that, the fun begins in the House of Representatives. McConnell, as he did earlier this year in the Department of Homeland Security funding battle, is trying to jam the House. Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus have pledged not to vote for any package that funds Planned Parenthood. House Speaker John Boehner could do what he usually ends up doing--bring up the ""clean"" funding bill and pass it with the help of Democrats--but conservatives are dangling a coup threat over him. What are Boehner's options? He could call bluff on the coup attempt or try to fight it out. He could let the Freedom Caucus have its precious shutdown for a few days, allow the fever to break, and then bring up the clean resolution. He could hide under his desk and chug merlot until all of his problems melt away. Or if he's willing to suffer the wound to his pride, he could work to strike a deal with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats that would make him stronger than ever. Any House member can vote for anyone--literally anyone; it doesn't have to be a current member--in a speaker's election. Typically the parties try not to fiddle with each other's business, though: The majority elects its leader as speaker and the minority votes for its own top choice. If they wanted to, though, Democrats could swing their votes to a Republican in the event of a vacant chair. In other words, they could provide Boehner the backstop he needs against the threat of a coup. Some Democrats seemed receptive to this during the DHS showdown earlier this year. And why not? It would put an end to the brinksmanship that's dominated Boehner's tenure over the last four years and wrest Republican power from its locus in the Tea Party-centric Freedom Caucus. And though Boehner can't be termed a moderate, Democrats would rather have him running the show than a more right-wing member who might want to give the whole Let the government default on its debt for fun! thing a shot. As of earlier this week, approximately a dozen House Democrats expressed willingness to throw their votes to Boehner in the event of a coup attempt. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a top Democrat, has thrown some cold water publicly on the idea. ""My view is that the Republican caucus will have to make its own decisions,"" he said late last week. As the Hill points out, Van Hollen's circumstances are peculiar: He's running against a more left-wing challenger for the Democratic Senate nomination in Maryland next year, so he doesn't want to start hollering in public about how much he'd love to bail out Boehner. House Democrats may be considering the possibility more seriously in private. He nevertheless makes a strong case: Why should this be Democrats' problem? Isn't Republican disarray, no matter how annoying it makes these recurring funding showdowns, in Democrats' political interest? At the end of all the annoying, recurring funding showdowns, Democrats get their way: McConnell folds, Boehner folds, and the Democrats get their clean funding resolutions and debt ceiling hikes. Democrats have the leverage and understand how to deploy it, even if it makes for some long nights. It's also unclear that 218 Republicans would be able to rally around a speaker more right-wing than Boehner in a spot speaker's election. The candidate who's most discussed as a Boehner replacement is current Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who's hardly a Tea Partier. Since there isn't much agency involved in the internally unpopular choices any GOP speaker has to make, McCarthy would have to run the House much as Boehner has: by taking the least bad options available to him. That may be fine with House conservatives, too: They may just want to lop off someone's head, and it would work well for them to have another ""establishment"" figure in charge to scapegoat for their natural lack of leverage. Unless House Democrats can extract some extraordinary promises from Boehner for their votes--a push to increase the minimum wage, a significant lift in the sequester caps on discretionary spending--it's more useful for Democrats to watch House Republican chaos run its course as outside observers."	House Democrats Could Save John Boehner. But They Probably Won't.

Five of them (the exception is former New York Gov. George Pataki) have often invoked their faith to justify their positions on abortion, homosexuality, and terminating life support. They've also chastised Catholics who dissent from the Vatican on these issues. Three months ago, speaking to a Christian audience, Jeb Bush derided the type of politician ""whose moral convictions are so private, so deeply personal, that he refuses even to impose them on himself."" Sen. Marco Rubio mocked liberals who ""ignore multiple pronouncements of this pope on the definition of marriage and on the sanctity of life."" But now these Republicans have a problem. Pope Francis, who has just arrived in the United States from Cuba, has pushed other issues to the front of the church's agenda. He talks about destructive capitalism and peace through diplomacy. His first encyclical focuses on climate change and environmental protection. These are awkward subjects for Republicans. How have they responded? With the same evasive tactics they previously attributed to Democrats. 1. Silence. In the past, when bishops have denounced John Kerry, Joe Biden, or other Catholic supporters of abortion rights, these politicians have tried to lie low and let the controversy pass. Now conservative Catholics are doing the same thing. Gov. Chris Christie, when asked about the pope's critique of trickle-down economics, said, ""I have no reaction."" Bush, when asked about the pope's call to address climate change, shrugged, ""He has every right to have a view on it."" Gov. Bobby Jindal, when asked about the pope's affirmations of evolution and the Big Bang, refused to comment. 2. It's just PR. Rick Santorum claims that Francis' gestures of tolerance on family issues are ""in the context of trying to reach out to people who may not agree with him on a whole lot of other issues, in order to try to open up some doors and open up a conversation."" The pope's strategy, according to Santorum, is ""to reach out and bring some other people in"" so that they'll be exposed to the church's more ""conservative positions."" Jindal takes the same view: The pope's friendly tone on family values is just bait. 3. The pope doesn't understand science. Santorum parrots the Vatican-backed myth that hormonal contraceptives are ""abortifacient."" But when the conversation shifts to climate change, Santorum says the pope is out of his depth. ""The church has gotten it wrong a few times on science, and I think we're probably better off leaving science to the scientists and focus on what we're really good on, which is theology and morality,"" Santorum argues. ""When we get involved with political and controversial scientific theories, then I think the church is probably not as forceful and credible."" (Santorum has previously described evolution as a controversial theory and has criticized it as flawed, though Francis has endorsed it.) Actually, Francis was trained in chemistry, but Santorum doesn't care. According to Santorum, even scientists can't be trusted on climate change: ""Any time you hear a scientist say the science is settled,"" he says, that's ""not real science, because no scientists in their right mind would say ever the science is settled."" 4. The pope doesn't understand policy. Santorum says bishops shouldn't ""get involved with agriculture policy or things like that that are really outside the scope of what the church's main message is."" Christie, in the same vein, rejects the pope's case for U.S.-Cuba reconciliation because ""his infallibility is on religious matters, not on political ones."" For these politicians, the church's moral teaching against abortion translates directly into defunding Planned Parenthood, even though this would lead to more abortions. But when other Catholic teachings threaten Republican economic or foreign policies, suddenly religious edicts are dismissed as naive. 5. The pope's views are purely personal. In his commencement address at Liberty University on May 9, Bush ridiculed politicians who claimed their moral convictions were personal. But a month later, after Francis issued his encyclical on the environment, Bush pleaded, ""I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope. ... Religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting in the political realm."" When the pope's comments in interviews align with social conservatism, Santorum defends them. When they don't, he dismisses them as unofficial. That's how Santorum treated Francis' remark that Catholics don't have to breed like rabbits. ""When he speaks as the leader of the Catholic Church, I'll certainly pay attention,"" Santorum said of the pope's statement. ""But when he speaks in interviews, he's giving his own opinions."" 6. Trust the Vatican, not the pope. On economic issues, Republicans brush aside the pope's statements as the work of bureaucrats. ""Contrary to the arguments of certain economists that work at the Vatican,"" says Rep. Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, there's no agreed-upon Catholic solution to poverty. But on family issues, Republicans who don't trust the pope are happy to rely on the bureaucrats instead. Santorum promises that Francis won't change the church's teaching on contraception, because ""the pope has a lot of other people around him who advise him."" 7. I disagree with the pope's interpretation. On abortion, politicians who look for loopholes in the church's prohibition are denounced as heretics and weasels. But on the death penalty, Republicans assert the right to nobly dissent. Every Catholic Republican running for president supports capital punishment, even though Francis declared last year that ""all Christians"" must work for the ""abolition of the death penalty, whether it be legal or illegal, and in all its forms."" Jindal claims an exemption for child rapists: ""The Catholic Church and many churches teach that the death penalty should be reserved for the most serious crimes, and I agree."" Bush, as governor of Florida, invoked the self-defense loophole. Although ""many spiritual leaders, including the Pope, have called for the abolition of the death penalty,"" Bush argued, ""according to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, preserving the common good of society requires rendering the aggressor unable to inflict harm."" 8. The pope is missing the big picture. Rubio concedes that Francis ""is reminding us of our obligation to be good caretakers to the planet."" But the senator adds that policymakers must also recognize ""it's in the common good to protect our economy."" On Cuba, Rubio goes further. Recently, when he was asked about his differences with the pope, the senator replied: ""I would also ask His Holiness to take up the cause of freedom and democracy."" That's a pretty strong insinuation that Francis hasn't taken the sins of the Castro regime seriously enough. 9. The pope's message is for other countries. When Francis talks ""about the exploitation of the underprivileged,"" says Jindal, ""we've got to understand that he's speaking to a global audience."" It doesn't mean he's ""against charter schools"" or ""against my tax package,"" the governor argues. Every country is a sinner, except us. 10. The pope threatens American interests. Four months ago, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Rubio explained the pope's Cuba initiative this way:"	10 Excuses the GOP's Catholic Presidential Candidates Use to Ignore the Pope's Teachings
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/jeb_bush_is_talking_about_george_w_bush_nonstop_the_gop_candidate_hasn_t.html	"Have you heard that Jeb Bush's brother is George W. Bush? Of the Connecticut Bushes? It seems almost as if Jeb himself discovered this in the past week and just has to tell everyone about it. His brother was president--same gig he wants! Small world, eh? Bush's recent crowing about his older brother began during last week's debate. Donald Trump was heckling him about how the most recent President Bush ruined the Middle East and the global economy. Jeb, who was instructed by his advisers to debate aggressively, turned to Trump and said, ""You know what? As it relates to my brother, there's one thing I know for sure. He kept us safe."" The rebuke was Bush's strongest applause line of the night. Bush has been yakking nonstop about his swell brother ever since. The day after the debate, Bush's team took to Twitter to reaffirm his questionable assertion that President Bush, pictured standing atop a smoldering pile of rubble and bodies, ""kept us safe."" At a Republican conference in Michigan last Friday, Bush appealed to his family name again, this time to explain how he would solidify various international partnerships. ""I know how to do this because, yes, I am a Bush,"" he said. ""I happened to see two really good presidents develop relationships with other countries."" (That's the other thing--did you know that his father was also president? The coinkydinks just keep piling up.) Over the weekend, his campaign went after a Democratic group for criticizing his brother's record. Ever since he began considering a run late last year, Bush had mostly dealt with questions about his brother by nervously tugging his collar and skedaddling. He was unable to support his oft-repeated message that he was his ""own man"" with any clear examples of policy daylight between himself and the 43rd president. Questions about his brother's legacy and why the country should install a third Bush in the Oval Office were among the most predictable campaign issues in world history, and Bush for months was unable to devise a compelling or even coherent response to them. The ""pivot to embracing his brother,"" as awful consultants would put it, turns out to be the latest byproduct of what we'll generously call the Bush campaign's spontaneous nature. The official story, as told to the Washington Post, is that Jeb Bush was thinking of something to say to Trump and just blurted out, ""He kept us safe."" According to the Post, that rejoinder ""refocused a campaign in desperate need of a moment."" Well, who's to say? It's possible that Bush's advisers really were energized by his response; it's also possible that they all gasped when he said it and are now furiously spinning the press into believing they approved. Whatever the case, they're running with it now, because either they truly believe George W. Bush is a great asset or they recognize that backing down would be a show of weakness. The risk in embracing his brother varies between the primary and general electorates. Republican voters recall W. more fondly than the public at large--he was, after all, the last Republican politician to successfully unite the party to national victory--though they're really not in the mood to rally behind another establishment politician. It doesn't get much more establishment than John Ellis Bush. The general electorate, meanwhile, may believe that George W. Bush is a nice man now that he's out of office, but his presidency still isn't remembered fondly. At least by taking this posture toward his brother, Bush is finally taking some posture toward his brother. He was visibly uncomfortable when trying to keep George's legacy at arm's length, as if consultants had overadvised him to the point that he couldn't remember anything they said. For whatever reason--and sure, he's a little biased--he believes that his brother was a very good president. If the only way he can confidently respond to questions about his brother is with an outright defense, then doing so may be his best option. Perhaps even his only option. His poor polling and favorability numbers among both primary and general election audiences suggest that the ""last-name thing"" has been just as damaging as, if not worse than, observers predicted it would be. Banking on his last name for support from his family's network while expecting the public to ignore his familial associations was a big ask in the first place, and it hasn't worked out. If he wants to win, he will have to rehabilitate his family name. He will need to convince Republican primary voters that the Bush family was the best damn thing that ever happened to the party and enough independents that President George W. Bush wasn't actually half-bad. In no way will this be an easy task, but there are no easy answers for him at this point. See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Jeb Can't Stop Saying Nice Things About George
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/scott_walker_was_flanked_on_all_sides_the_wisconsin_governor_was_crowded.html	"Ten weeks ago, when he announced his campaign for president, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was ""fighting to win."" ""Americans deserve a president who will fight and win for them,"" he said. ""Young or old--or somewhere in between--I will fight and win for you."" Likewise, last week, he promised to ""wreak havoc"" on Washington with unapologetic conservative values. ""I have a plan to move this country forward,"" Walker said. ""To wreak havoc on Washington, America needs a leader who has been tested. I have been tested like no one else in this race."" On Monday, Walker walked this back. Yes, he was tested. But it wasn't enough, and now he's leaving the race. ""Today, I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field,"" he said in a statement. ""With that in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately."" What happened? The immediate problem was money. Yes, Walker had billionaire donors and a flush super PAC. But that cash can't fund offices and pay staffers. ""No matter how much money in the super PAC, hard dollars still matter,"" said Gary Marx, a senior adviser to the Walker campaign, in an interview with the Washington Post. ""He didn't have the finances to continue on. Money is ultimately what stops campaigns from going further."" This makes sense. Walker couldn't raise the money it took to support a staff-heavy investment in Iowa, and so, he left the race. But even this raises other questions. Walker, after all, was supposed to be the perfect conservative candidate, an ideologue who could bridge the gap between the grassroots and the establishment. But Walker wasn't up to the task. It's possible, as Daniel Larison argues for the American Conservative, that he was never as strong as he looked and doomed to eventual failure. But this underplays his assets (a conservative record in a blue state with three election victories) and overstates his weaknesses (a dull style and personality). Put differently, everyone looks bad after their worst moment. If it were Sen. Marco Rubio, for instance, we'd point to a mixed political record: One statewide political victory--in a three-way race in an unprecedented Republican wave election--and a failed push for comprehensive immigration reform, abandoned after conservative criticism. No, Walker was capable. His problem was more structural: This is an unusually difficult field. If Walker were running for 2012, he'd face two real challengers: Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. Instead, he was up against an army of vanity candidates, factional fighters, and plausible nominees, from Rubio, Jeb Bush, Gov. John Kasich, and Gov. Chris Christie on the establishment side to Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Sen. Ted Cruz on the grassroots one. In this field, Walker couldn't make mistakes. If he ignored establishment concerns or piqued grassroots anger, his balancing act was over. At the same time, he had to hone rhetorical skills and build a media presence, to energize supporters and win curious Republicans to his side. By itself, this is difficult. With Trump in the race, it's almost impossible. He dominates media and siphons conservative voters. For establishment candidates, this is a modest problem. If they come too close to Trump--if they swipe and fight--they risk a bruising battle that could harm them in the polls. At the same time, they can turn away. They're not fighting for his voters. Instead of tussling with Trump, they can fight for more moderate Republicans, and return to the fray when Trump is diminished or gone. If you're vying for conservatives, it's even worse; Trump consumes your oxygen and there's no way to fight back--you can't out-Trump the man himself. Cruz solved this by making an alliance with Trump, all but backing him against the rest of the party. Walker could have followed Rubio and ignored Trump, working to build his ground with more moderate voters. Instead, he tried to beat Trump at his own game, swinging to the right with every question on immigration, and swinging back when he couldn't take the heat. He soured himself for activists and alienated party elites. That, however, wasn't the end. There were still the debates, where Walker could distinguish himself against his opponents. But he couldn't break through. After his first lackluster debate, Walker declined to single digits. After the second, when he was virtually invisible, he sank to 0 percent in the polls. He found himself flanked by Trump (with Carson and Fiorina) on the right, and Bush (with Rubio, Kasich, and Christie) on the left. Without elites or the public, Walker was finished. And so he quit, the second candidate to leave the Republican race. The lesson is straightforward: In a crowded field with strong contenders, every move counts. If Walker were running in 2012, against a weaker field, he might have survived. As it stands, why would anyone choose the guy who can't win a fight or make a mark? It's hard to say what comes next; primaries have patterns, but so much is contingent on the individual campaigns and personalities. With that said, the end of Team Walker is good news for the GOP establishment. Now, there are fewer people vying for the same votes. If the grassroots is going to win this primary--the eternal goal of movement conservatives--it will have to beat a more unified field of moderate and mainstream Republicans.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/scott_walker_drops_out_why_the_wisconsin_governor_left_the_gop_primary.html	"Scott Walker was the perfect candidate on paper. He had no shortage of credentials to run through in his appeals to Republican donors and voters alike. Political observers are beyond familiar with them by now, but--in a last tribute to the second major presidential candidate to drop out of the herd--let's run through his resume one final time: Three gubernatorial victories in four years in blue Wisconsin; a record of meaningful ideological accomplishment in the face of protests that swept up the nation; an appeal broad enough to stretch from social conservatives to libertarian-leaners like the Koch brothers to more traditional Republican establishmentarians. It was impressive until it wasn't. The dramatic collapse in support Walker has seen in recent months, both nationally and in critical early states, earned him comparisons to that other great-on-paper Midwestern Republican candidate with executive experience from 2012, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. That's not quite right: Pawlenty never took off. Walker, meanwhile, reigned atop Iowa polls for roughly six months, beginning with a ""fiery"" (read, loud) speech at January's Iowa Freedom Summit. It appeared early on that he had found a way to marry his sterling GOP primary credentials with a voice that resonated. That voice didn't hold up well when confronted with complications. One such complication: questions. Those can be a major headache on the campaign trail if you are not good at answering them. Early stumbles on areas outside of his union-busting comfort zone, such as foreign policy and immigration, immediately raised red flags about whether he was ready for primetime. Walker's team responded by erecting what reporters derisively referred to as ""Fortress Walker,"" walling him off from inquiries. The candidate who seemed so resolute in his conviction to quash public sector unions in Wisconsin wilted under questioning, flipping around between stances on the issues du jour at a comical pace, or caving to the whims of the party's small but obnoxious elements. Meanwhile, political novice Donald Trump presented voters with the missing element in Walker's otherwise perfect resume: the entertaining warrior, the unrepentant id. Where Walker would let long-term general-election concerns filter into his thought process when considering a response on immigration, Trump--how should we put this?--would not. He stole from Walker the Iowa lead he'd held for six months, which ended up being just long enough to prop up pundits' expectations that he needed to win it. His super PACs, which raised impressive sums early on, burned through much of that money in a late-summer effort to arrest his free fall. As they spent more, he got more desperate, and his nearly nonexistent presence at the first two debates did not help his solicitation for further donations. Walker literally hit zero in a national poll on Sunday. Yes, it's early, and national polls don't matter, and people are fickle, yadda yadda yadda. But when you hit zero ... it's probably time to go. Good on Walker for taking the hint that Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, whatshisname, and whoshisface are refusing to take: It's just not happening. Indeed, in Walker's brief announcement Monday evening, he encouraged other underperforming candidates to wrap it up. ""Today,"" he said, ""I believe I'm being called to lead by helping clear the field."" Rarely has ending a campaign due to total lack of support been explained with such self-aggrandizement, but hey, whatever makes it go down easier. ""The short answer is money,"" a Walker source told the New York Times, explaining the move. ""He's made a decision not to limp into Iowa."" If Walker actually thought he had any chance, though, he'd have been perfectly satisfied to limp into Iowa with limited funds. The last two Iowa Republican caucus winners, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, were each working with about three cents in campaign funds. But Walker could never find his voice, and he recognizes that. Now it's all about lobbying the eventual nominee to let him serve as Labor Secretary, a perch from which he could realize his dream of smushin' unions on a national scale without all that messy business of running for president.

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/ben_carson_doesn_t_believe_muslims_should_be_president_his_genial_reputation.html	"Ben Carson's brand is ""nice."" ""Carson has the bedside manner of the physician he is,"" says the Christian Science Monitor. ""Ben Carson doesn't shout,"" writes Adam C. Smith for the Tampa Bay Times. ""He doesn't throw zingers, and he rarely disparages rival presidential candidates. In a period when Donald Trump's bluster dominates the 2016 presidential race, Carson seldom says anything provocative enough to generate TV news coverage."" On Sunday, in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, that changed. ""Do you believe that Islam is consistent with the Constitution,"" asked Chuck Todd, after Carson said a president's faith only matters if it's inconsistent with the country's values. ""No, I don't, I do not,"" answered Carson. He continued: ""I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that."" The Council on American-Islamic Relations slammed the retired neurosurgeon, who with Donald Trump leads the Republican presidential pack. ""Mr. Carson clearly does not understand or care about the Constitution, which states that 'no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office,' "" said the group's national executive director in a statement. The Carson campaign wouldn't budge. ""[Mr. Carson] has great respect for the Muslim community,"" said spokesman Doug Watts, ""but there is a huge gulf between the faith and practice of the Muslim faith, and our Constitution and American values."" Despite the reality of the American Muslim community, which is as loyal and patriotic as any group of Americans, Carson--the soft-spoken, genial doctor who runs on his religious faith--believes they are unqualified for high public office and that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with ""American values."" But this isn't shocking. Of course Carson believes in the disloyalty of American Muslims. His genial reputation conceals a deep commitment to paranoid politics, honed over years of conservative activism and deployed in speeches, op-ed columns, and now a presidential campaign. At the Values Voter Summit in 2013, for example, he compared the Affordable Care Act--President Obama's signature health care law--to chattel slavery. ""You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,"" said Carson in his remarks to the conservative gathering. ""It is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control."" There's no question this is outrageous. But it pales next to the reactionary paranoia of much of his other rhetoric. ""I mean, [our society is] very much like Nazi Germany,"" he said last year, in a rant against ""political correctness."" ""You know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe."" If political correctness is akin to German fascism, then it's no shock the doctor thinks the IRS is a bona fide secret police. ""You know, we live in a Gestapo age, people don't realize it,"" he said, in reference to the federal tax agency. He believes that President Obama might suspend elections in 2016, that Democrats want immigrants to increase the welfare population and keep themselves in power, and that--as he explained in the first Republican presidential debate this year--Hillary Clinton and ""the progressive movement"" are ""trying to destroy this country"" by driving up the national debt and stepping ""off the stage as a world leader."" Carson, the doctor, is a brilliant pediatric neurosurgeon. Carson, the candidate, is a crank--a creature of deep suspicion and conspiratorial thinking, who gives the mainstream a rare glimpse into the American Negative Zone of far-right fear and fetid fever dreams. There, anti-Muslim prejudice is common and unapologetic while Carson's claim--that Islam is inherently anti-American--is axiomatic. Given his political background, his remarks were typical, if not even expected. (It almost goes without saying that there's an irony in Carson's bigotry: When he was a child, his ideological antecedents attacked civil rights activists with the same anger and contempt.) If his comments surprised, it's because of his style. Carson's gentle affect is his greatest asset; it soothes listeners and obscures the degree to which he's the most extreme candidate in the race. With that said, he's a Kessel Run away from the Republican nomination. Barring the catastrophic collapse of every other ""establishment"" or conventional candidate, he has little chance of becoming the GOP nominee, much less president. But that's no consolation. Right now, the top candidates in the Republican primary are a nativist demagogue and a right-wing paranoiac. They're channeling and emboldening the worst impulses in American politics, and winning the polls because of it. They will fall, but not before making a dangerous, and potentially enduring, mark on our politics."	Ben Carson Is the Most Extreme Candidate in the Race
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/methylene_chloride_is_a_deadly_chemical_found_in_paint_thinners_why_has.html	"Johnathan Welch was 18 and working through lunch when the fumes killed him, stealing oxygen from his brain, stopping his heart. The chemical linked to his death in 1999 wasn't a newly discovered hazard, nor was it hard to acquire. Methylene chloride, which triggered similar deaths dating as far back as the 1940s, could be bought barely diluted in products on retail shelves. It still can. And it's still killing people. The solvent is common in paint strippers, widely available products with labels that warn of cancer risks but do not make clear the possibility of rapid death. In areas where the fumes can concentrate, workers and consumers risk asphyxiation or a heart attack while taking care of seemingly routine tasks. That hazard prompted the European Union to pull methylene chloride paint strippers from general use in 2011. For reasons that aren't clear, regulatory agencies in the United States have not followed suit--or even required better warnings--despite decades of evidence about the dangers, a Center for Public Integrity investigation found. A CPI analysis identified at least 56 accidental exposure deaths linked to methylene chloride since 1980 in the United States. Thirty-one occurred before Welch died, and 24 since. The most recent was in July. Many involved paint strippers; in other cases victims used the chemical for tasks such as cleaning and gluing carpet, according to death investigations and autopsy reports CPI obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and state open records requests. Teenagers on the job, a mother of four, workers nearing retirement, an 80-year-old man--the toxic vapors took them all. A Colorado resident one year older than Welch was killed his first day at a furniture-stripping shop. Three South Carolina workers were felled in a single incident in 1986. Church maintenance employee Steve Duarte, 24, survived the Iraq War only to be killed in 2010 while stripping a baptismal pool in California. ""People have died, it poses this cancer threat ... and everybody knows it's a bad chemical, and yet nobody does anything,"" said Katy Wolf, who recommends safer alternatives to toxic chemicals as director of the nonprofit Institute for Research and Technical Assistance in California. ""It's appalling and irresponsible."" Two Medical College of Wisconsin researchers writing in the  Journal of the American Medical Association criticized the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency for remaining ""mute"" on methylene chloride's ability to trigger a heart attack. Year of publication: 1976. The EPA says it does intend to take action. It is working on a rule--expected to be proposed early next year--that could stiffen warning labels on paint strippers containing the chemical, add certain restrictions, or ban the products. But any regulation would come more than 30 years after the agency first considered such possibilities for methylene chloride. The industry is lobbying against a rule, saying the chemical already is well-regulated and remains the most effective way to remove paint. Faye Graul, executive director of the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance, a trade group that includes methylene chloride manufacturers, said the way to stop the string of deaths is simple: ""Proper use of the product."" Labels on the cans warn against using in areas that aren't well-ventilated. The Consumer Product Safety Commission, for its part, denied a 1985 petition to ban the chemical in household products, when the issue was cancer, requiring instead a carcinogen warning that appears on cans in fine print. And CPSC staff shrugged off requests by California and Washington state officials in 2012 to consider stiffer regulation in response to the recurring deaths, later contending that the problem is an occupational one--even though consumers have died, too. ""To provide information to the public concerning this matter, CPSC has produced a paint stripper pamphlet,"" an agency toxicologist wrote to the state officials in letters obtained by CPI. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration tightened its rules for on-the-job exposures to methylene chloride in 1997. But OSHA standards don't cover consumers or the self-employed, and many of the recent fatalities happened at sites that are virtually invisible to the agency until there's a death--inside residential bathrooms where lone workers strip tubs of old, chipped finishes. Methylene chloride offers a case study in how products that pose major risks remain on store shelves. Stuart M. Statler, who helped write the Consumer Product Safety Act and served as a Republican commissioner on the CPSC from 1979 to 1986, said too often companies don't prioritize safety, seeing it as a needless cost. And agencies are unlikely to force the point with bans. He doesn't see that changing. ""The pendulum has swung so far in the direction of deregulation,"" said Statler, now a product safety and regulatory consultant. ""Too hazardous"" outside controlled settings Methylene chloride, also called dichloromethane, is briskly efficient in all that it does. It softens old paint in minutes, allowing the coating to be scraped off. But if its fumes build up in an enclosed space, it can kill in minutes, too. The California Department of Public Health, in its appeal to the CPSC, said the continuing deaths suggest methylene chloride is ""too hazardous to be used outside of engineered industrial environments""--exactly what the European Union concluded about the chemical in paint strippers. While these products can be bought at home-improvement and general retail stores across the United States, the specialty respirators and polyvinyl-alcohol gloves needed to handle them safely aren't sufficient, the Department of Public Health says. Even workers wearing respiratory protection have succumbed. Levi Weppler, 30, who left a wife pregnant with their first child, was among those found dead with a respirator on, slumped over the Ohio bathtub he was refinishing in 2011. The cartridge-style device he used to filter the air wasn't enough: Only a full-face respirator with a separate air supply, or exhaust ventilation to remove the fumes, is sufficient, OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health say. By 1985, U.S. agencies considered methylene chloride a probable human carcinogen--the Food and Drug Administration banned it in hairspray as a result. But the rapid-death problem was identified even earlier. In 1976, NIOSH noted that reports of such fatalities dated to 1947, when four men using the chemical for hops extraction were ""overcome"" and one of them died. Kenneth Rosenman, chief of Michigan State University's Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, helped identify the more recent trend of bathtub fatalities from methylene chloride in a 2012 paper that has galvanized efforts by public health officials. They fear the fume risk isn't widely known. ""It's not surprising to the scientists who have studied methylene chloride in paint strippers when used in small spaces, but I think it's surprising to the worker and consumer who can purchase the product off the shelf,"" said Robert Harrison, chief of the California Department of Public Health's occupational health surveillance program. Methylene chloride exposure triggers regular calls to the nation's poison control centers. They handled more than 2,700 such cases in the five years ending in 2013, according to the most recent data. The number involving inhalation wasn't recorded, but almost all the exposures were accidental. Hundreds involved children. And about 950 of the exposed people went to the hospital or sought other medical treatment, according to a CPI analysis of American Association of Poison Control Centers reports. The death toll compiled by CPI, meanwhile, almost certainly undercounts the number of instances. Poison control centers don't hear about all incidents. OSHA tracks workplace fatalities, but not cases involving the self-employed or consumers. And Rosenman is sure the true cause of death for some methylene chloride victims is missed, given the chemical's ability to trigger a heart attack. Paint-stripping powerhouse W.M. Barr & Co., an employee-owned company in Tennessee that makes several methylene chloride brands, including ones linked to six worker deaths since 2006, sees the safety issue differently. Barr's founder helped the Navy develop the product during World War II to avoid fire hazards after a deadly incident on a ship involving a flammable paint stripper, according to Barr's vice president of risk management, Mike Cooley. Methylene chloride is nonflammable. Several million cans of paint stripper containing the chemical are sold in the United States each year, Cooley wrote in an email to CPI. ""One cannot but help conclude that for the vast, vast majority of consumers, the products were and continue to be safe,"" he wrote. ""Like many products, there are hazards related to the use of [methylene chloride] paint removers. However when used in the proper setting and as directed, they are not only effective but safe."" Swift death Setting aside longer-term health concerns, such as cancer, the danger posed by methylene chloride is its one-two punch when fumes accumulate. Because it turns into carbon monoxide in the body, it can starve the heart of oxygen and prompt an attack. The chemical also acts as an anesthetic at high doses: Its victims slump over, no longer breathing, because the respiratory centers of their brains switch off. An open flame, meanwhile, can transform methylene chloride to phosgene. That's the poisonous gas used to deadly effect during World War I, responsible for more fatalities than chlorine and mustard gas combined. (Whether methylene chloride became phosgene in any of the deaths CPI tracked isn't clear; full records were not available in all cases.) The 1986 triple-fatality shows how swiftly death can come. Several contracting firms were working on projects at a dam pumping station in Laurens, South Carolina. One had employees applying paint stripper to an underground area, described by OSHA in records as a basement and a pumping pit. Those workers managed to evacuate after the fumes built up, but when one man went back in, he was overcome so quickly he couldn't get out. He died. The emergency medical responder who tried to rescue him had to be hospitalized. Two of another contractor's employees went through the same exercise, one entering the area to turn on the sump pump and passing out, the other felled while checking on him, according to OSHA records. The first man survived; the would-be rescuer did not. To top it off, an electrician working aboveground ""heard an unusual noise,"" according to OSHA, and died in the basement when he went to see what it was. Four years ago at a California paint company, Gary de la Pena discovered a co-worker lying unconscious in a 9-foot-deep paint-mixing tank. The man had been cleaning it with paint stripper and collapsed. De la Pena rushed in, pulled off his colleague's useless respirator, and put him over one shoulder to carry him out. That's all he remembers. Already--in just a matter of seconds--the fumes had overcome him, too. The man he was trying to save died. De la Pena, now 49 and living in Mexico City, still doesn't know how he survived. He was in the tank for at least 45 minutes, green foam flowing from his mouth when he was finally pulled out. He had to be resuscitated and was hospitalized for four days, according to a state investigation. He wasn't able to finish his medical treatments before his immigration status forced him back to Mexico. His health has never been the same. ""I guess it attacked my nervous system,"" said de la Pena, who knew nothing about methylene chloride until after his brush with it. ""It's a really dangerous chemical."" Sufficiently concentrated, methylene chloride will kill anyone. But people with heart conditions face higher risks because it doesn't take as much carbon monoxide to trigger an attack. Smokers can be affected more quickly, too, given their already elevated carbon monoxide levels. In one incident, detailed in the 1976 Journal of the American Medical Association article, a 66-year-old retiree had three heart attacks--the last one fatal--that each began as he was stripping a large chest of drawers. ""Nobody warned him,"" said Rosenman, the Michigan State professor. What agencies have done--and left undone Judy Braiman remembers reading about the heart-attack risk in the 1970s, probably in that same JAMA article. Around 1977, her Empire State Consumer Association in New York petitioned the CPSC to require a warning on methylene chloride paint strippers that ""particular care ... must be exercised by persons with heart problems or impaired lung function"" because carbon monoxide would form in the body from use. The CPSC, alarmed, announced that its staff was drafting a proposed warning. Braiman, a former CPSC adviser and president of the since-renamed Empire State Consumer Project, clearly remembers seeing the carbon monoxide cautions appear on cans afterward--only to disappear a few years later. The CPSC never did require them, the agency says. Today, some labels tell customers with heart problems to check with a physician before using paint strippers. CPI could find none that specifically warned about carbon monoxide or heart attacks. Alex Filip, a spokesman for the CPSC, said by email that he doesn't have much information on the agency's methylene chloride work in the 1970s because the staffers involved are no longer employed there. As to why the commission didn't consider regulation more recently, he suggested that its hands are tied--a rationale that was not communicated to the state officials in the letters responding to their requests for help. ""One fact that stands out in our early investigation is that the injury and death information indicates that this is largely a workplace issue, which is outside of our jurisdiction,"" Filip wrote. CPSC staff tell him their review of epidemiology data found no people who died as a result of using the products as consumers, and they believe the agency's stance on warning labels is ""still appropriate."" Yet deaths from the solvent that involve consumers, though far harder to track than worker fatalities, have occurred in the United States. The CPSC, in fact, said in its 1978 announcement of proposed warnings that it was aware of ""at least three"" heart-attack deaths among people using methylene chloride paint strippers in 1976 alone. In 1990, a coroner blamed the chemical after Julette ""Julie"" Jenkins, a 28-year-old Ohio woman who had been stripping a desk in her attic, dropped dead on the first floor, teacup in hand. And an 80-year-old man died from unintentionally inhaling methylene chloride in 2013, the poison control center system reported. As the CPSC notes, another agency is working on the issue now--the EPA. Paint strippers with methylene chloride are a test case, one of a handful of chemical uses the EPA recently assessed in hopes of using the weak Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to actually control toxic substances. ""About one person per year over the last dozen years or so has died, usually in an enclosed space like a bathroom,"" Jim Jones, assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said of methylene chloride strippers. ""Certainly [that] is what jumped out at us. But when we did the assessment, we also found cancer risks."" The solvent industry opposes the effort. After the EPA identified methylene chloride in 2012 as a chemical it intended to assess, the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance told the agency it was ""mystified"" by the attention. Methylene chloride ""is more than adequately regulated"" already, wrote Graul, the group's executive director. Paint stripper warning labels, in Spanish as well as English, all advise against using the products in poorly ventilated areas, she said in a recent interview. Some give bathrooms as an example. ""There are precautions on how to use it, how not to use it,"" Graul said. ""Amateurs were taking it and stripping bathtubs with it, with no ventilation, and there were fatalities as a result."" But a CPI review of products sold at 15 home improvement stores in the Baltimore-Washington region did not find any that explained, on the label, the potentially fatal consequences of using without sufficient airflow. The closest to it: that ""intentional misuse""--so-called huffing to get a chemical high--could result in death. Graul said there are products that explain the inhalation risks, although she could not name them--paint stripper manufacturers are not her organization's primary members. But such a warning is not required, she added. The trade group, which prefers stronger warnings to bans, twice suggested such a move to the CPSC after the EPA began assessing the products. ""They were interested, but ... because they couldn't put any staff on it, they couldn't make any commitments to do anything,"" Graul said of the consumer agency. A reassuring thought for manufacturers as they wait for the EPA's proposal is that products are very hard to ban under TSCA. The EPA must prove it tapped the ""least burdensome"" option that would be effective; warning labels are one of the lighter alternatives. When the agency tried to ban asbestos under TSCA, the blanket prohibition was overturned in court in 1991. Asbestos exposure kills thousands a year. The court loss reverberated. ""EPA has never tried again to ban a chemical on the market,"" said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund. The EPA already tried to take a soft approach for methylene chloride strippers. It met with manufacturers to ask them to voluntarily switch to another substance. The agency got no takers. ""There is nothing as effective,"" Graul said. ""There are even ... two EPA staffers at that meeting who admitted they have old homes and use methylene chloride for paint stripping."" Lower-risk ways to remove paint Less-toxic paint strippers have been on the market for years--California authorities recommend ones with benzyl alcohol, soy, or dibasic esters--but they represent the minority of products. Wolf, with the Institute for Research and Technical Assistance, found benzyl alcohol to be a reasonably effective replacement for commercial and consumer furniture stripping because it loosens all the same coatings for approximately the same overall cost. It doesn't do so as quickly as methylene chloride in some cases. But it doesn't have the expense of methylene chloride's OSHA-required protections, she noted. Graul called Wolf's 2006 tests ""extremely outdated."" The Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance will hire a firm to take a new look at methylene chloride alternatives because California will require it, likely next year. Methylene chloride paint strippers are in the first wave of that state's effort to get firms looking at how to make hazardous products safer. When foreseeable uses of a product are dangerous, fixing the underlying hazard is much better than warning against those uses, argues Rachel Weintraub, legislative director at the Consumer Federation of America, the group that petitioned the CPSC to ban methylene chloride in household products in 1985. ""What's more effective in protecting consumers? Is it to blame them and say it's their fault, not ours, or is it to design the hazard out of it?"" she said. ""Consumers just assume that a product is safe."" Swapping one chemical for another is often a hazard trade-off. A methylene chloride replacement used in some paint strippers--N-Methylpyrrolidone, or NMP--faces EPA scrutiny as well because animal tests have showed reproductive problems and harm to unborn babies. And benzyl alcohol, recommended because of its lower toxicity, isn't nonflammable. But it's a ""fairly insignificant"" fire hazard, said Guy Colonna, a division manager with the National Fire Protection Association. (Some paint strippers with methylene chloride are flammable, too, due to other ingredients mixed in.) Sometimes, the alternative that works best isn't another chemical. Jon Shelton with Seattle Bathtub Guy, a firm that fixes tubs, swears by sanding. He finds it works quicker than using a chemical stripper, and the potential hazard it creates--dust--is easily controlled by turning on the faucet. He has no desire to go back to methylene chloride. ""I don't want anything to do with it,"" he said. ""I knew if I was going to work with this stuff every day, there was going to be a point that I made a bad decision ... and then what do you do when it's too late?"" Dead at 18 Johnathan Welch was one of the youngest victims. At age 16, he took an after-school job stripping furniture for a small business near Chattanooga, Tennessee, called Dip 'N Strip. Dizzy spells came on some months in. In 1998, he passed out at work and needed medical treatment, according to records later obtained by state investigators. A 1997 NIOSH guide for controlling methylene chloride in furniture-stripping shops warned that dizziness was a sign of ""high exposure."" But Johnathan's mother, Rita Welch, said he hadn't been warned about the hazards of the methylene chloride in the tank he worked over--the state found no records of such training--so his family didn't connect his condition to what happened on his job. A doctor diagnosed him with sinus problems, and Johnathan kept stripping furniture. After high school, he went full-time. He took to working through lunch to get out faster. On Aug. 18, 1999, the week before he was to start college, the rest of the staff went into an adjoining room to eat while the 18-year-old kept working. Thirty-five minutes later, he was found collapsed over the tank, his hair brushing the chemical mixture that was 70 percent methylene chloride, one burned and swelling arm in the liquid. Doctors tried to save him, but Johnathan was brain dead. Chemical inhalation, according to their diagnosis, had starved him of oxygen. The next day Rita Welch and her ex-husband agreed to take him off life support. Sixteen years later, the death of her only child is as raw as a fresh wound. Every August when the anniversary arrives, she said, ""I have to take the whole week off of work."" Who's responsible? In the absence of bans or voluntary substitutions, the first link in the chain that ends with customers exposed to methylene chloride is the manufacturers. The one certain way they can get safety information into customers' hands is to put it on cans' warning labels. But paint stripper warnings don't clearly communicate the risk of death. Take Jasco Premium Paint & Epoxy Remover, a widely available product that killed de la Pena's co-worker in the paint-mixing tank in 2011. It's made by Barr, whose other methylene chloride paint remover brands include Klean-Strip and Goof Off. The Jasco can warns on the front that the contents are poisonous if swallowed, that they can irritate the eyes and skin, and that the vapor is ""harmful."" The instructions on the back of the can warn several times against using in poorly ventilated areas, including bathrooms, but don't say why--other than the risk of chronic effects, such as cancer. The possibility of death is mentioned only in connection with swallowing and huffing. To get a more explicit warning about the risks of using the product to strip paint, users have to track down the manufacturer's safety data sheet online or find the ""IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE,"" dated as June, on the Jasco website. The Jasco warnings are typical for the market, according to a CPI review of labels on seven other brand lines. Cooley, the official with Jasco's manufacturer, Barr, said by email that the CPSC had reviewed and approved the company's labels. ""We strongly believe that the products are safe for their intended uses when the directions and warnings are followed,"" he wrote. ""Sometimes that means the product should not be used, such as when the intended setting is a room with poor ventilation."" Donna Riley, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech who studies consumer product risks, co-wrote a 2000 paper about warning labels on methylene chloride strippers. They struck her the same way as most consumer-product warnings: ""They're terrible in so many ways. ... They aren't designed with the user in mind."" What the warning labels are good for, lawyer Jason Rowe says, is limiting liability. ""The warning is very inadequate for a consumer, but it's got enough room to drive a truck through in a legal case,"" said Rowe, who represented the mother of the church maintenance worker who died in 2010. She settled, in part because of the poor track record for the few civil cases decided by judges or juries. After manufacturers, the next link in the methylene chloride chain is retail stores. Don't count on life-saving advice there, either. After two California workers died in paint-stripper accidents, the state Department of Public Health sent specialists posing as consumers to stores that carry the products. Methylene chloride strippers were more widely available than safer alternatives, they found, and none of the store clerks warned about the fatal implications of improper use. Some, in fact, said the products posed no danger. The department's 2013 report quoted a clerk insisting that a brand linked to one of the California fatalities wasn't deadly: ""If it were, it wouldn't be sold on our shelves."" After that, the state distributed safety posters to stores to put alongside paint strippers. The poster calls strippers with methylene chloride ""extremely toxic,"" lists necessary safety protections and recommends safer alternatives. CPI, which did not see similar information in Baltimore or Washington stores, asked Lowe's, Home Depot, and Ace Hardware whether they post safety warnings elsewhere in the country. Ace said in a statement that, because it is a cooperative of independently owned stores, locations are not required to post warnings, but ""many may choose to do so as our retailers are committed to the safety and education of their customers."" Lowe's would not answer the question, saying instead that it encourages customers to follow manufacturers' usage recommendations. Home Depot did not respond. Unsafe workplaces When products are destined for worksites, employers are the final link in the distribution chain. They have a legal duty to provide a safe work environment and must follow OSHA rules about air measurements, control methods, and respirator use when using methylene chloride. Since that standard went into effect in 1997, OSHA air samples testing positive for the chemical topped the exposure limit nearly 20 percent of the time, a CPI analysis shows. Almost all the companies whose workers died from methylene chloride were found in violation and fined. But the typical penalty came to less than $3,000. Fatal accidents often draw small fines; OSHA chief David Michaels has urged Congress to give his agency's enforcement more teeth. Johnathan Welch's 1999 death prompted a fine of $1,508. The Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that Dip 'N Strip had no emergency eye-flushing station, no proof of hazardous chemical training, and no labeling on the tanks to ensure employees knew what they were working with. Shop owner Larry Coxey, who hadn't notified TOSHA about the death as required, contended that it wasn't work-related. He suggested to the inspector that Welch could have committed suicide--a claim TOSHA noted in the file but did not accept. The agency sought help from NIOSH, which drew up recommendations for engineering controls to fix ventilation problems at the shop. Estimated cost: about $9,000. TOSHA didn't check on the business again until 2006, after Welch's mother insisted. This time, the fine grew to $11,300. Coxey hadn't installed the controls, TOSHA found. Neither of his two employees had been properly trained about methylene chloride hazards. One, age 24, told the inspector that he would get lightheaded there sometimes and would have to leave the stripping area to feel better. The other, while working without a respirator at a chemical tank, explained his method of avoiding overexposure: to ""not breathe when leaning far over the tank."" Air samples showed methylene chloride levels nearly 10 times the federal standard. The shop, in a rundown block of Red Bank, a city surrounded by Chattanooga, is still operating. Coxey, reached by telephone, gave a deep sigh when asked about the case. He's convinced Welch's death wasn't from methylene chloride ""because he had an aneurysm."" Told about the diagnosis, Coxey said the death certificate blamed asphyxiation. Told that methylene chloride asphyxiates people at high enough levels, he said he didn't want to talk about it. ""That's something I'd just rather forget about,"" he said. TOSHA administrator Steve Hawkins, recalling the case, called it ""very upsetting."" The reason the agency hadn't gone back sooner, he said, is that Coxey had no employees when the death investigation ended. Coxey told TOSHA that he alone would handle the chemical dipping, Hawkins said. Some people honestly don't know that methylene chloride is dangerous, Hawkins said. He suspects others don't want to know. Either way, it's available in thousands of stores. ""It's pretty crazy, really,"" he said, ""the stuff that you can buy."" A mysterious death Julie Jenkins' 1990 death in her Columbus home stumped the coroner. What would cause a healthy 28-year-old to collapse, heart stopped, while walking in her house with a cup of tea? At some point before, she'd partially stripped a desk in her attic with Dayco Marine-Strip. But it wasn't until a second-hand furniture dealer suggested to her relatives that the product was dangerous--and they alerted the coroner--that anyone thought about methylene chloride. It's not a routine toxicology test. The chemical was in Jenkins' body. The coroner's report called the amount ""consistent with toxic levels"" and declared it the cause of death. After the family sued, manufacturer James B. Day & Co. disputed that the amount--2.2 parts per million as measured in her eye--could have killed her. The company told the jury in 1995 that another cause was just as likely, such as a heart attack related to prescription diet pills Jenkins had recently stopped taking. The jury agreed. ""I still find it hard to believe that the jury would find the warning label to be inadequate ... and then fail to find the methylene chloride to be the cause of death, despite the coroner's testimony and the autopsy report,"" Eugene L. Matan, the family's lawyer, wrote to Jenkins' parents the following month. Day dissolved almost a decade later. But Gerald P. Sthay, a lawyer and chemist who was the company's representative at the trial, remembers the case. In his pretrial research, he couldn't find examples of deaths like Jenkins', which didn't involve asphyxiation. Such cases would very likely go unrecognized, he knows, but he doesn't see how the amount in Jenkins' system could have triggered her death. ""I had no fear of the product myself, having worked with methylene chloride strippers,"" said Sthay, now with a health care firm. ""There's no product that does what it does as well as it does."" Claudia Sloan, Jenkins' oldest sister, hasn't changed her mind about the case, either. ""I have no doubt that methylene chloride killed her,"" said Sloan, who had hoped the trial would lead to better warning labels. ""There was nothing wrong with Julie. ... She shouldn't be dead."" In the intervening time, more than two dozen people died while using paint strippers. Thirteen years after Jenkins' death, a worker suffered a fatal heart attack OSHA attributed to methylene chloride exposure earlier that day. Twelve years after Jenkins' death, a man working with Dayco Marine-Strip asphyxiated in an Illinois bathroom. Seven years after Jenkins' death, Rita Welch's son took an after-school job stripping furniture. Welch, now 59, is haunted by what could have been. If only Johnathan had had training and protective equipment. If only she'd known what he was working with. If only she'd never heard about that job. If only people working with the same chemical weren't still dying. ""I don't want nobody else to go through the hell I did,"" Welch said. This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news  organization in Washington."

That's great news for Trump, because with each universally condemned howler, he has historically gained another couple of points in the polls. What's unusual about this latest crime against decency, though, is that it has nothing to do with what Trump said--it's about what he failed to say in response to some dingbat at a campaign event:	Trump Might Not Correct Birthers, But the GOP's Normal Pandering Is Far Worse
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/gop_debate_the_way_republicans_choose_their_candidate_for_america_s_highest.html	"Did we learn anything about the Republican primary battle in Wednesday night's debate? Basically, there are two contests going on at once. Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina are competing to be the most compelling anti-politician. Trump showed flashes of wit, but there are signs that his schtick is wearing thin. Carson came across as earnest, thoughtful, and intelligent, and he has just as a much of a claim to outsider status as Trump. Fiorina was legitimately awesome, in large part because she manages to be disciplined without coming across as robotic. She was so well-briefed that every other candidate on the stage, with the exception of Marco Rubio, who was also polished and prepared, ought to have felt embarrassed. The main flaw of the anti-politician type is that the anti-politician is generally not as knowledgeable as she or he ought to be about the issues of the day. Fiorina is an anti-politician who knows what she's talking about, or at least who does an insanely good job of faking it. She will thrive. So that's the anti-politicians. The other contest is the one among the Republican regulars, and here you get the sense that we will soon see a great winnowing. Ted Cruz badly wants to be in the anti-politician lane, but he's not pulling it off. Still, his healthy self-regard will keep him in the race indefinitely. I'm guessing that Scott Walker will stick around for at least another few weeks, though he didn't help himself all that much last night. Mike Huckabee is the most polished speaker, and he loses nothing by remaining in the race. Rubio was by far the best of the conventional candidates, but what he really needs is for panicking Jeb donors to flock to him, and it's not clear that they will. Rand Paul is finally recognizing that he should own his libertarianism, and stop trying to soften his rough edges to appeal to the GOP mainstream. He'll stick around. If I had to choose, I'd say that Chris Christie will be the next candidate to go, despite the fact that he did a solid job last night. What is Christie giving us that, say, Jeb or John Kasich are not? I'll bet many of his loyal supporters are asking themselves that same question. But my main takeaway from this debate is that the way Republicans choose their candidate for America's highest office is totally crazy. When Christie showed flashes of brilliance, I kept wondering, Why didn't he run in 2012? Oh yeah: He probably didn't run for the same reason that Mitch Daniels, then two-term governor of Indiana, adored by wonky conservatives everywhere, didn't run. Primary campaigns have become long, demoralizing, and obscenely expensive affairs. During the last go-around, Mitt Romney spent $391 million to become the Republican presidential nominee, and Romney has hundreds of millions of dollars and an army of rich, loyal friends. Suffice it to say, these qualities are not shared by all of the Republicans who'd make pretty decent presidents. Back when conservatives were still licking their wounds from Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat, Jeffrey H. Anderson and Jay Cost argued that the Republican presidential-nomination process was broken, and they offered a roadmap for how to fix it. When I first read their proposal, I thought it was nuts. Having endured just a few short months of intra-Republican presidential bloodletting, I now think it's brilliant. I mean, it's still impracticable. But their roadmap would attract higher-quality candidates, and it would leave future Republican nominees in a stronger position come the general election. What is wrong with the GOP presidential-nomination process, according to Anderson and Cost? The short answer is that it forces candidates to start building campaign apparatuses years in advance. The process has evolved into such a painful slog that many talented would-be candidates conclude that it would be sheer masochism to take part. The result is that Republicans wind up with a relatively small number of legitimate contenders, their plausibility being determined largely by their ability to raise tens of millions of dollars from hedge funders, used-car barons, and industrialists, and then a larger number of colorful characters with no realistic shot at the nomination, who use the seemingly endless series of primary debates to build their personal brands. These debates, in turn, give media organizations outsized influence over the process--by stoking petty personal conflicts among candidates, and by focusing on manufactured controversies over substantive policy questions, the cable news networks seem more intent on embarrassing candidates than on encouraging serious deliberation. And finally, the presidential nomination process as it stands empowers a relatively small number of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, as the contests in those states are so essential to creating ""momentum"" for one candidate or another. With all of this in mind, Anderson and Cost envision a Republican Nominating Convention, in which roughly 3,300 delegates, 3,000 of whom would be elected by rank-and-file Republicans in their local communities and the remainder of whom would be Republican officeholders, would select five official candidates. Let's focus on how this would work if there weren't an incumbent Republican president. (This process would work a bit differently if there were one.) Each delegate would begin the process by listing up to five prospective candidates, listed in order of preference. This would yield a mammoth list of potential candidates, which would be whittled down over several rounds of votes. I won't bore you with the mechanics, but the basic idea is that you'd eventually be left with a manageable number of candidates who'd then be asked if they actually wanted the nomination, and those who said they were up for it would then be whittled down to five officially-sanctioned candidates. The best part of this kooky scheme? This convention would take place in February of the year of the election. These candidates would then take part in a series of debates, moderated by Republicans for Republicans, interspersed with a series of three regional primaries, in which party members would vote for their favorite candidates. The idea is that you'd have a debate and then a big, multistate primary, then another debate and another multi-state primary, and then ... you get the idea. One complicating factor is that these ""primaries"" wouldn't be primaries as we know them, as state governments would resist losing their influence and their ability to control their own primaries. But in this system, the GOP nominee would be chosen by the end of April at the latest. Such a short, focused campaign would give less-moneyed candidates a better shot at securing the nomination, and it would free up candidates with real jobs to focus on them rather than on begging Sheldon Adelson for his sweet casino money. Why am I so taken with this idea? Imagine the kind of campaign we'd be having now if Anderson and Cost's nomination process were in place. As matters stand, name recognition plays an outsized role, and the rise of a candidate like Donald Trump puts every other candidate on the defensive. Under Anderson and Cost's process, you might have candidates currying favor with the grassroots Republicans who'd take part in a nomination convention, but this wouldn't really involve chasing headlines by making outrageous statements. It would mean cultivating ties with local GOP organizations around the country. We might have dozens of Republicans, including the governors of Michigan, Tennessee, and Indiana, or quirky civic and religious leaders, trying their hand at becoming the fifth of the official nominees. Why the hell not? Winning over a few hundred delegates is a lot cheaper than trying to defeat a Romney or a Bush by outspending him on TV ads. And by the time we got around to actually having debates, we would have no more than five candidates, who would have the breathing room to actually discuss the issues that matter. I'm under no illusion that Anderson and Cost's approach will win out any time soon. But the Republican Party, and American democracy, would be better for it."	The Way Republicans Choose Their Candidate for America's Highest Office Is Totally Crazy
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/donald_trump_was_low_energy_at_the_gop_debate_the_billionaire_appeared_hollow.html	"Donald Trump looked exhausted by the end of the debate. He looked exhausted by the middle of the debate, really. And who could blame him? So were we. But this is Donald Trump! ""I have tremendous energy,"" Trump said earlier this week at his big rally in Dallas. ""Tremendous. To a point where it's almost ridiculous if you think about it."" But somewhere near the middle of Wednesday night's debate, Donald Trump ran out of BS. And he knew it. It began when Carly Fiorina went after him. She cut him--the first time any candidate has cut him since, well, he launched his campaign. Fiorina was asked about Trump's recent Rolling Stone comments expressing revulsion at her face. ""Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly in what Mr. Bush said,"" Fiorina said. ""I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said."" It brought the house down. Game respects game, and all Trump could muster, over a humiliated grin, was an even more patronizing compliment about how Fiorina has a ""beautiful face."" From then on, Trump was more or less just another one of the figures onstage, not the outsized presence who has commanded a majority of campaign coverage in the last months. He was far from the Trump who came out of the gate and, without prompt, called Sen. Rand Paul ugly, brushed off Jeb Bush's hit about his casino interests in Florida, refused to offer Columba Bush any apology for suggesting that she had softened her husband to the Mexican menace. He loves to bat Jeb Bush and Rand Paul around. He had much less luck with Fiorina, and that seemed to humble him. As the debate went on, and moderator Jake Tapper jumped from subject to subject, some actual interesting policy debates arose. Paul, Gov. Chris Christie, and others had a strong conversation about medical marijuana and the policing of drugs. It required details and familiarity with policy. Trump, who hadn't known about the basics of New Hampshire's heroin problem until the Rolling Stone reporter briefed him on it, seemed to understand that the further a debate gets into policy, the better off he is pretending he's not there. Sen. Marco Rubio was able to effectively corner him on his lack of foreign policy knowledge. ""I will know more about the problems of this world by the time I sit [in office],"" Trump defended himself, ""and you look at what's going on, this world is a mess."" This was largely Trump's contribution to the foreign policy debate: I'll figure it out later, and by the way, you all suck. That's always been his style, but it's much harder to get away with it when you're onstage with your 10 chief rivals for three hours with poor air conditioning. After a long bout of silence, Trump briefly re-emerged near the end to spread the same sort of bogus vaccination conspiracy theories that former Rep. Michele Bachmann shared when she was flaming out in 2011. He would've caught more flak for it had it been earlier. By 10:45 p.m., all he deserved was some eye rolls. Trump was ready for bedtime by the time he was called to make a closing statement. Stop asking me so many questions about so many things and just let me be president, he pleaded: If I become president, we will do something really special. We will make this country greater than ever before. We'll have more jobs, we'll have more of everything. We were discussing disease, we were discussing all sorts of things tonight, many of which will just be words, it'll just pass on. I don't want to say politicians--all talk, no action--but a lot of what we talked about is words and it'll be forgotten very quickly. It would be foolish to predict a Trump collapse after this debate, for the simple reason that people have been predicting his collapse since the minute he declared his candidacy and many times since, never to see it materialize. He's not going anywhere anytime soon. But the theory that the Trump Show can be exhausted--that if you work him long enough, he'll be exposed as hollow and drained of bombast--was resuscitated. By the end of the night, you could see him beginning to feel the way he should be feeling: that he doesn't belong here. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."

""Next guy in the crosshairs will probably be [Mitch] McConnell,"" Rep. Matt Salmon reportedly texted Sen. Mike Lee on Friday morning, before sharing that text with the press. ""Here's what I say in response to Speaker Boehner stepping down,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said at the Values Voter Summit: ""Mitch McConnell, it is now your turn."" Roger Villere, the longtime Louisiana GOP chair and RNC vice chairman, urged McConnell to ""Resign!!"" on his Facebook page this weekend. Sen. Rand Paul, who supported McConnell's 2014 re-election bid over a more conservative challenger in the Kentucky primary, dodged several questions about whether he supports McConnell as leader on Sunday. And Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign strategy, of course, hinges on trashing McConnell as his spineless establishmentarian foil. But despite all the anger with his leadership, McConnell is safe for a number of reasons. For one, tempers run cooler among statewide-elected officials, who represent broader swaths of the electorate than the most conservative House members do. Majority leaders are also elected by the majority conference, affording McConnell far more defections than Boehner had to work with as speaker, a position elected by a majority of the entire chamber. Not that McConnell has much resistance in his conference to begin with: He was elected unanimously as majority leader following the 2014 election. Even Cruz won't go so far as to state directly that McConnell needs to go. ""That is a question, at the end of the day, for the Republican conference,"" Cruz said recently. McConnell himself is not up for re-election until 2020 and doesn't need to cozy up to the right to ward off primary competition. McConnell's job is secure, for now. That conservatives dumped Boehner but are stuck with McConnell perfectly encapsulates the right's misplaced protests over the past six years. If they want more ""fight"" out of their leaders, or a more aggressive approach to combating the Obama administration, McConnell is the one who should have been felled. Given Boehner's ultraconservative record and the basic structures that were aligned against him, it's amazing that members of the even more ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus thought that John Boehner refused to fight for them--or could have fought more. He held out on raising the debt ceiling for that awful summer of 2011--ultimately leading to an embarrassing credit downgrade--and allowed conservatives to have their shutdown over Affordable Care Act funding in 2013. Boehner and everyone else familiar with basic math determined that neither form of protest was an effective branding mechanism for the Republican Party in its quest to retake the White House. Boehner, like McConnell, wanted to put an end to the pointless brinkmanship heading into 2016. McConnell's conference understood; Boehner's did not. So if it wasn't Boehner's fault, who was most to blame for not allowing Republicans to achieve long-sought ideological goals these past few years? The answer is more of a ""what"" than a ""who"": the Constitution. That's the document that gives presidents veto power and requires two-thirds majorities in Congress to override. ""Because of the Constitution"" is usually an answer that plays well in the deep-red districts that House conservatives represent, but it sure doesn't when used as a reasonable excuse for inaction. Former Majority Leader Eric Cantor--who, like Boehner, was eaten alive by the same Tea Party voices he stoked in order to secure a House majority--put the conundrum well in a New York Times op-ed this weekend. ""[S]omewhere along the road, a number of voices on the right began demanding that the Republican Congress not only block Mr. Obama's agenda but enact a reversal of his policies,"" he wrote."	Mitch McConnell Deserves Conservative Ire More Than John Boehner Ever Did

When he slammed ""illegals,"" his audience of 16,000 whooped. When he promised to build a wall on the Mexican border, they hollered. And when he closed his event--""You're going to say to your children, and you're going to say to anybody else, that we were part of a movement to take back our country, and we will make America great again""--they cheered. As if to punctuate the meaning of ""take back our country,"" the post-rally devolved into a confrontation between Trump supporters and Latino activists, protesting the billionaire and his anti-immigrant rhetoric outside the arena. The assembled Latinos were angry. The mostly white rally-goers were vitriolic. ""Illegals go home!"" yelled one woman. ""Deport illegals!"" yelled another. There's no shock in Trump's words or their effect. Set aside his talk of doing ""deals"" and his attacks on rich donors, and the overriding issue in Trump's message is immigration. For Trump and his followers, immigrants siphon resources, damage the economy, and bring crime and violence. ""The cost of building a permanent border wall pales mightily in comparison to what American taxpayers spend every single year on dealing with the fallout of illegal immigration on their communities, schools, and unemployment offices,"" Trump says on his website. In his rhetoric, he's more pointed. ""They have to go,"" he says. And Republicans agree with him: Seventy percent believe Trump is right when he blames unauthorized immigrants for ""bringing drugs"" and ""bringing crime"" to the United States. Negative attitudes about immigrants exist throughout American society. According to a 2012 survey, for example, 48 percent of young black Americans believe that ""illegal immigration"" hurts U.S. jobs. But Trump's rhetoric is more exclusive. It's a message for white Americans, and specifically, those alienated by mainstream political life. These are ordinary people--blue-collar workers, middle-class professionals, retirees--who feel that their America is slipping away and being replaced by something unrecognizable. They don't just distrust government--they think it gives benefits to people who won't work instead of those who deserve help. ""I'm just tired of footing the bill for people who don't want to put in,"" said Chris Cooper, one of Trump's supporters in Dallas. They live in a fast-changing America, and they don't know how they fit in. Trump doesn't just excite and entertain, he speaks to people's fears and anxieties. With his say-anything style and confident, aggressive persona, he builds a bond with people who want something steady in public, and someone who cares about them above all. ""I love that he's talking in everybody else's language. He's not trying to be politically correct--he's just speaking to us like how we're talking here, or how you talk to your friends,"" explained George Lanier, another supporter at Trump's Dallas event. It's why his gaffes don't hurt him, and why some of his supporters are comfortable enough to voice their prejudice. ""We have a problem in this country. It's called Muslims,"" said an unidentified man at a Trump town hall in Rochester, New Hampshire. ""You know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American."" Trump isn't just a symbol of voter frustration or outrage with an unresponsive system--the conservative counterpart to Sen. Bernie Sanders. No, from his attacks on President Obama's citizenship in 2011 to his rhetoric against Latino immigrants and Muslim Americans today, Trump is an avatar of the ugliest impulses in American political life. And while it's tempting to treat this as simple ignorance, the truth is that Trump comes out of a long tradition of American illiberalism, from the 19th-century ""Know-Nothings"" who raged against the influx of Irish and Catholic immigrants, to the Reconstruction-era vigilantes and ""redeemers"" who terrorized black and white voters and overturned elected governments in the postwar South. These authoritarian currents are always strongest at times of disadvantage, tremendous social change, or both. The America of the 1920s, marked by incredible inequality and a new influx of truly ""foreign"" immigrants, produced a proto-fascist mass movement of alienated whites, in the form of a new Ku Klux Klan, which claimed 2 million members (including a U.S. senator) at its height in 1924. Trump isn't a herald for a new nativist fraternity, but his xenophobia, racism, nationalism, and clear disdain for democratic cooperation mark him as a fascistic figure. But even more than that, he is a classic American scaremonger tapping into recurrent white American anxieties. And while Trump has borrowed his ""silent majority"" rhetoric from Richard Nixon, the man he most resembles is that era's id, a demagogue who fed on the fear and anxiety of the 1960s and '70s--George Wallace. Wallace wasn't a businessman or a billionaire. He wasn't born rich, and he lacked any ties to the American elite. His early life was defined by his remove from wealth and power. His rise in Alabama politics had less to do with privilege and everything to do with drive, talent, and hard work. He ingratiated himself into the high echelons of state politics and eventually--through skillful opportunism--maneuvered to the governorship, where he would halt the ""march of centralized government that is going to destroy the rights and freedom and liberty of the people of this country."" Trump doesn't reflect Wallace in his biography. The similarity is in his style and approach. Wallace was a politician for people who felt powerless, regardless of the reality. First as a fighter for segregation in the face of civil rights victories and later as a voice for ""law and order"" against the specter of crime and disorder, Wallace harnessed the fear and anger of millions of Americans with a pledge, in a sense, to take back their country. ""I want to say that one of the first things we're going to do when we get into the White House, and we're going to do it within the law, we're going to turn back to you these domestic institutions,"" said Wallace in a 1968 speech for his presidential campaign. In the same way, he captured their resentment. ""It's a sad day in the country when you can't talk about law and order unless they want to call you a racist,"" said Wallace in another campaign speech, capturing the anger of the ""great majority,"" as he described it. Likewise, in Trump's rhetoric against immigrants and foreign aid--""They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries.""--we hear echoes of Wallace. ""The leadership of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have paid more attention to the exotic and those who made the most noise, they have given [the average citizen's] money away in foreign aid, they have given it away to welfare loafers,"" Wallace said on a 1972 episode of Meet the Press. Wallace's supporters didn't constitute a social movement. ""Although they are an important bloc of voters, in the end they were only a loose collectivity attracted to Wallace and to the sentiments he expressed, more like a fan club than anything else,"" writes sociologist Jody Carlson in George C. Wallace and the Politics of Powerlessness.  Wallace, she continues, ""was a one-man phenomenon."" The topics are different (integration versus immigration), but the parallels with Trump are clear. Like Wallace, Trump isn't ideological. His views--he's for taxes on the wealthy and against entitlement cuts--run counter to conservative dogma. His supporters aren't ideological either. Their concerns are more concrete. Trump speaks to them--""A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs""--and gives them a clear scapegoat: ""Because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs."" They are here for him and no one else. Or, as one steelworker said of Wallace in 1968, ""You don't have to worry about figuring out where he stands. He tells it like it really is."" ""Wallace's supporters are distinguished from others by their authoritarianism, feelings of political powerlessness, and racial prejudice,"" writes Carlson. Those words serve as an apt description of the Trump phenomenon as well. Wallace's protest politics ""were essentially expressive ... not designed to move in any productive way toward getting more power for the people, but to make them feel more powerless instead."" Indeed, continues Carlson, Wallace thrived on ""turmoil, excitement, [and] discord. He is interested in exploiting issues, not solving problems."" Like Trump, Wallace appealed to his followers in a base, almost visceral way. ""He was ... the perfect mimetic orator, probing his audiences' deepest fears and passions and articulating those emotions in a language and style they could understand,"" writes historian Dan T. Carter in his book The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of American Politics. ""On paper his speeches were stunningly disconnected, at times incoherent, and always repetitious. But Wallace's followers reveled in the performance; they never tired of hearing the same lines again and again."" In the same fashion, Trump's followers don't need novelty. ""He was tremendous--the same everywhere he goes,"" said one supporter at his Dallas rally. Wallace never won a national election. His slice of alienated America wasn't large enough to prevail in a broad contest. But he wasn't marginal. In the 1968 presidential election, running as an independent, Wallace pulled 13.5 percent of the vote, carried five states--all in the South--and won 46 electoral votes. And in the 1972 Democratic primary--where he, like Trump this year, was an explicit ""outsider""--he won 23.5 percent of the vote (or more than 3.7 million ballots) and collected 382 delegates, placing him third in the overall field. Beyond his campaigns, Wallace shaped the contours of American politics. He was a master of television, the ascendant media of the era. ""[O]n the flickering television screen and in dozens of personal appearances he offered to those frightened and insecure millions a chance to strike back--if only rhetorically--at the enemy,"" writes Carter, in a sentence that could easily describe Trump's relationship to social media. More importantly, Wallace helped generate the forces that Richard Nixon would use to build a national Republican coalition in the wake of national discord and a fractured Democratic Party. Nixon didn't indulge the explicit racism of Wallace and his supporters, but he co-opted the clearly racial focus on crime and criminality, tying civil rights to urban disorder. ""[T]he deterioration [in respect for law and order] can be traced directly to the spread of the corrosive doctrine that every citizen possesses an inherent right to decide for himself which laws to obey and when to disobey them,"" he said in a 1966 interview. In his 1968 campaign, Nixon took a subtle stance against federal desegregation plans--calling for ineffective ""freedom of choice"" policies--and walked a delicate balancing act of appealing to white fears without sounding extreme. Aware of the Wallace threat to his presidential effort, Nixon worked those voters to his side. ""Don't play their game. Don't divide your vote,"" said Nixon in an ad aired before the election. ""Vote for ... the only team that can provide the new leadership that America needs, the Nixon-Agnew team. And I pledge to you we will restore law and order in this country."" Nixon took the Wallace stew of powerlessness and resentment, and brought it fully into the mainstream, shorn of its open racism. Which brings us back to Donald Trump. Everyone's assumption, including my own, is that Trump will fade before voting begins. It's a strong case. Trump's popularity rests on his novelty as much as anything. He plays to the cameras, aware that politics loves a sideshow. But if the media goes away--if Trump can no longer titillate--then his appeal goes too, and he'll leave the presidential race like every other vanity candidate. The Wallace analogy, however, suggests a different path. What if Trump is more than just a clown? What if he's unleashed a real constituency for nativist, authoritarian politics? Then it's not hard to imagine how Trump, riding on his own wealth, keeps the show going into Iowa, New Hampshire, and beyond. And while our political system is fractured enough to deny him an ultimate victory, that doesn't mean this wouldn't matter. For the GOP--much like the Democratic Party in the 1960s--a successful Trump would force a reckoning. Either Republicans cut him out of the party, even at the risk of losing in a three-way race, or they follow Nixon's example and co-opt his basic message for the party's use, shrinking his base enough to win if he runs an independent campaign. In which case, by leaving the mark of white nationalism on the Republican Party, Trump wins regardless of his ultimate fate. Either way, we can't just dismiss Trump as entertainment. Like Wallace, he is an eruption of the ugliest forces in American life, at turns authoritarian, like the Louisiana populist Huey Long, or outright fascistic, like the Second Ku Klux Klan. And like all of the above, he's brought the background prejudice of American life to the forefront of our politics, and opened the door to even worse rhetoric and action. The only good news about Trump is that he has awful timing. The United States has large and important problems, but it's also not mired in crisis. ""U.S. businesses have added 13 million jobs over 66 straight months of employment growth, with the jobless rate dropping 10 percent to 5 percent,"" notes Politico. ""The budget deficit has fallen from nearly 10 percent of GDP to less than 3 percent under Obama, while the uninsured rate has fallen from 15.4 percent to 9.2 percent under Obamacare."" Crime is still on its downward trend, American troops aren't committed to major wars, and the administration isn't embroiled in scandal, at least not on the scale of impeachment, Iran-Contra, or Watergate. A vocal minority feels powerless and disaffected, but most Americans--if their actions mean anything--don't. They want a different direction, not a different system. But that's the luck of the draw. What if this were 2008, on the heels of a disastrous war and on the verge of a depression? What if the stimulus never happened and--like many other countries across the Atlantic--we met recession with austerity? What if the fear and discontent of those years curdled into anger and unrest? In that environment, a Trump or Trump-like figure--someone more organized, more competent, and more attuned to the structure of American politics--could succeed, despite our jokes and ridicule. Americans like to believe that, unlike Europe, we can avoid demagogues and authoritarians in our national politics. For the most part, it's been true. But make no mistake: With the right conditions, it can happen here."	Donald Trump Is Bringing America's Most Hateful Politics Back to Life
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/john_boehner_resignation_can_the_next_house_speaker_unite_the_fractious.html	"Can you imagine how relieved House Speaker John Boehner must feel right now? After years of wrangling Republicans in the House, and after almost a quarter-century as a member of Congress, Boehner is letting go. By the end of next month, he will finally be free of the Republican rebels who've tormented him for years. Boehner had made it known that he had no intention of wielding the speaker's gavel for much longer, but no one expected him to step down so abruptly. It seems that Boehner saw the writing on the wall. Members of the House Freedom Caucus, a collection of Boehner's bitterest foes within the House GOP, have been plotting to remove him from office for months, and with more than 30 committed anti-Boehner votes, they were in an excellent position to succeed. Over the next few days, Boehner will shepherd a ""clean"" spending bill through the House to avoid a shutdown of federal agencies. You could think of this as Boehner's parting gift to middle-of-the-road Republicans, who dread being dragged into yet another cosmic battle over whether to keep the government's lights on. There are plenty of decent candidates to succeed Boehner in the top job. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has the inside track, as he is well-liked across the party. He's also considered something of a lightweight, who sees himself more as a political tactician than a legislative visionary. As of now the only Republican who could wrest the speaker's gavel from McCarthy is Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the congressional GOP's most creative policy thinker. But Ryan has explicitly ruled himself out from contention, presumably because becoming speaker would be a thankless ordeal that would distract him the work of crafting conservative domestic policy legislation. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is said to be considering a run at the top job, or a run for majority leader if McCarthy moves up the ladder. And there might be a wild card or two, like Jim Jordan. Both Hensarling and Jordan hail from the party's right, but Hensarling is seen as more thoughtful and disciplined, while Jordan is seen as more of a loose cannon. What Republicans need is a speaker who can unite members around a coherent agenda. It is extremely unlikely that GOP lawmakers will be able to achieve their larger policy goals as long as President Obama is in office. And now that the presidential race is underway, congressional Republicans will have to take a backseat to the major presidential candidates on big-picture issues like tax and health care reform. What Republicans in the House can do, however, is advance a constitutionalist agenda to defend the prerogatives of Congress and resist the expansion of the executive authority. Right now, for example, many federal agencies have independent funding streams that they can use to perform their duties even in the absence of congressional approval. This badly undermines the constitutional principle that the spending power resides in Congress, and Republicans should do what they can to put a stop to it. More broadly, Republicans should seek to reform the way Congress does business by streamlining the federal budget process and by giving committees more resources to hire expert staffers so they won't be so dependent on lobbyists and other outside organizations to make informed decisions. The beauty of this agenda is that it can appeal to all Republicans, whether they're moderates or hardcore conservatives. While Republicans in the Obama era disagree about many things, they share the belief that the executive branch has grown far too powerful and that the budget process is broken and biased against meaningful spending reform. By addressing these issues now, House Republicans can set the stage for major conservative reforms in the event that a Republican president is elected in 2016."	How John Boehner's Replacement Can Unite a Fractious Republican Party
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/values_voter_summit_conservatives_rejoice_over_house_speaker_john_boehner.html	"Attendees at the Values Voter Summit, the Family Research Council's annual D.C. conference for social conservatives, went wild when they heard the news. House Speaker John Boehner made the announcement to his conference at the Capitol while Sen. John McCain was kicking off festivities at the VVS across town. Sen. Marco Rubio was the lucky duck who got to announce it to the crowd. ""Just a few minutes ago, Speaker Boehner announced he would be resigning."" Rubio, the quickest candidate on his feet in the race, neatly pivoted this into an endorsement of his own campaign theme. While he wasn't there to ""bash"" anyone, Rubio said, ""the time has come to turn the page and allow a new generation of leadership in this country."" Sen. Ted Cruz, meanwhile, was perfectly comfortable bashing Boehner. The man who's been leading efforts to defund Planned Parenthood in Congress flattered everyone assembled at Woodley Park's Omni Shoreham complex, crediting them with the coup. ""Yesterday John Boehner was speaker of the House,"" he said. ""Y'all come to town and somehow that changes. My only request is, can you come more often?"" It's a hard-earned victory for conservatives, and they were in a mood to celebrate. ""American voters who put the Republican Party into the majority have grown weary of GOP leaders running into these political battles waving a white flag,"" said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. ""We welcome Republican leadership that understands that some values, like life, religious liberty, and national defense, are worth fighting for--no matter what."" But what can a speaker with more ""fight"" achieve? Contrary to popular myth at places like the Values Voter Summit, Boehner was a captive of few options. Far-right House conservatives win election and re-election by posturing in opposition to the Washington Establishment, regardless of what fouls the Establishment may or may not have committed. As long as the Senate filibuster exists and Democrats control the White House, neither Boehner nor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has much ability to enact the party's ideological goals. It has nothing to do with Boehner or McConnell secretly harboring affection for abortion or the Affordable Care Act. The obvious choice for the next speaker would be current Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. If House conservatives' goal is simply regicide, then McCarthy--who's not a hard right-winger but is personally on good terms with many of the Tea Party types--is a fine choice. Other candidates who've been mentioned as possible replacements include Reps. Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling. If, however, the idea is to find a speaker with more ""spine"" than Boehner, someone who can push their ideological wish list through either the government funding or debt ceiling mechanisms, conservatives will remain disappointed as long as a Democrat remains in the White House. McCain, one of the few procedural realists at the VVS, signaled as much in his speech. ""Hopefully,"" he explained about the Planned Parenthood controversy, ""we'll have a pro-life White House to work with soon."" The subtext: Please, let's fund the government without drama until then. McCain is not particularly well-received at conservative confabs. Donald Trump, however, is adored at these venues. Whether for his conservative credentials or, more likely, his celebrity, Trump was mobbed by reporters and fans as he entered the hotel complex. After getting in a jab at his latest media-showcased sparring partner, Rubio--a ""baby"" who ""doesn't show up to vote,"" in Trump's words--he chimed in on Boehner's resignation. He was unsurprisingly delighted with the news. ""I think it's wonderful, frankly,"" he said. He agreed that Boehner was not conservative enough. That's really the only acceptable answer for a Republican presidential candidate. The campaign-Congress feedback loop is going to amplify the myth that House Republicans' inability to win a brinksmanship battle was due to its moderate, or perhaps even liberal, speaker. The systemic flaws that brought down Boehner will bring down the next speaker, assuming the House Republican Conference can settle on one. There's real danger if Republicans can't corral 218 votes among themselves--and Democrats decide to engage in mischief during a speaker election. If GOP members deadlocked between factions, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi could rally Democrats around someone who pledges to treat the minority more favorably. That's something that appeals to James Salt, executive director of Catholics United, a more left-leaning Catholic social justice advocacy group. ""Wouldn't it be nice if there was a bipartisan effort to find a leader who could get a majority of votes to lead this country in a responsible way?"" asked Salt, who was hovering around the VVS on Friday. That would align well with Pope Francis' message to Congress on Thursday. And it definitely wouldn't be popular among conservatives. ""We need to look forward to the new leadership, the new conservative leadership,"" David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, said in introducing the crowd to Donald Trump. Someone ""who will fight Barack Obama."" Trump himself came out wielding a Bible. ""We had some big news today with Boehner,"" he said to more raucous cheers. ""Some people like him on the personal basis""--a modest wave of ""NO"" emerged from the crowd--but ""we want to see the job done properly. We want to see people getting it done."" If Republicans are unified, he mused, we're ""gonna win."" He leveled this charge against the Republican leadership, not at the 40-some conservative gadflies in the House. The Values Voter Summit, of course, ate it up."	Hardcore Conservatives Rejoice Over the Fall of John Boehner
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/joe_biden_is_taking_a_long_time_to_decide_about_running_for_president_is.html	"Joe Biden is still thinking. The vice president's self-imposed summer deadline for deciding whether to enter the Democratic primary will lapse this week. In an interview with the Catholic America magazine, Biden described his continued ambivalence: ""It's just not there yet and it may not get there in time to make it feasible to be able to run and succeed, because there are certain windows that will close. But if that's it, that's it. It's not like I can rush it."" At the same time, prominent Democrats think he's essentially in the race. ""Top Democrats increasingly believe Vice President Joe Biden is going to enter the presidential race, setting up a battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination,"" reports the Hill. The Biden camp, for its part, is cagey on its plans for an announcement. ""Various deadlines have been floated,"" reports Politico. ""End of summer, Oct. 1, the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13, the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson dinner on Oct. 24. But none of these is looking like a hard deadline. Neither are any of the cutoff dates for getting his name on state ballots."" This all raises a question: What, exactly, is Biden doing? Right now, Hillary Clinton is completely dominant. Even with her email scandal and unprecedented decline in favorability and popularity, she leads the national Democratic field--including Biden--by double digits. Clinton has 44 percent support in the Democratic primary, to 26 percent for Bernie Sanders and just over 20 percent for the vice president. She trails Sanders in New Hampshire but holds solid leads in Iowa and South Carolina. Most importantly, she's winning endorsements from party elites and interest groups. Last week, she won endorsements from New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, and the state's chapter of the National Education Association. She also has two surrogates from Sanders' home state of Vermont: Gov. Peter Shumlin and former Gov. Howard Dean. And on Tuesday, she got a big endorsement from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, a major union with more than half a million members. Overall, she has an unprecedented lead in the ""endorsement primary,"" with support from dozens of senators, governors, and members of Congress. Voters are debating the Clinton campaign, but the party infrastructure has largely decided. Now, none of this means Clinton is destined to win the Democratic primary. As with everyone who runs for president, there's always a nonzero chance for catastrophic collapse, from an indictment over her private email server to some unforeseen and fatal blow to her campaign. But if the evidence means anything, then the most likely outcome--by far--is an eventual Clinton win. The truth, in fact, is this was the case from the beginning--after President Obama won re-election in 2012--and it has shaped the race in important ways. If Clinton were a typical candidate, she would have more opponents than a liberal insurgent: She would face other establishment candidates with similar credentials and bona fides. But Clinton isn't typical; she's a former first lady, a former senator, a runner-up to Barack Obama with 18 million votes to her name, and a former secretary of state. She's the Galactus of the Democratic Party, and as soon as she chose to run again, she cleared the field of potential competitors and rival political machines. This is great for Clinton, but a mixed-bag for the Democratic Party. Not only does it lose the benefit of a hypercompetitive primary, which builds energy and infrastructure, but if Clinton falls--if she has to leave the race--then there's no alternative, no John Edwards to John Kerry, or even a Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama. Moderate and conservative Democrats will likely reject Sanders, to say nothing of donors and establishment figures. Which brings us back to Biden. What is the vice president doing? He's running as the backup. ""[Biden] is running for Clinton's understudy--as the candidate who will go on at the last minute, if necessary, if she's unable to continue for any reason,"" explains political scientist and Bloomberg columnist Jonathan Bernstein. He grants that it isn't clear that this is what Biden is thinking, but he thinks it is what's happening. The Democratic Party, or at least its establishment, needs a B Team--a candidate and a campaign to run if Clinton can't. Sanders doesn't fit the bill, and Martin O'Malley--who sits near the bottom of the polls, with 1 percent--isn't visible enough to meet the challenge. Biden, the sitting vice president, is the natural choice. And so he does the work: He talks with lawmakers, sits with officials, meets with donors, and builds the skeleton of a campaign, with enough muscle to move if necessary. In the meantime, he'll enjoy the attention of media and supporters. After all, it's nice. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	What Is Taking Joe Biden So Long?
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/carly_fiorina_rises_in_the_polls_the_new_republican_star_will_now_likely.html	"Welcome to Carly Fiorina's moment. After a commanding performance at last week's GOP presidential debate, she is the newest Republican rock star. Not only was she cheered at the Heritage Action for American forum in Greenville, South Carolina, and well-received at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference on Mackinac Island, Michigan, this past weekend, but in the latest CNN poll, she wins 15 percent of Republican primary voters, making her second, behind Donald Trump and just ahead of Ben Carson. It's an important victory for her long-shot, outsider campaign, which needs publicity to thrive in the absence of institutional Republican support from donors and fundraisers to activists and lawmakers. But it comes with a cost: scrutiny. Here's the thing about running for president. Once you become somebody--a strong debater or a leader in the polls--you have to deal with an eager and enthusiastic press that wants to know your background. This isn't just an opportunity for aggressive journalists; it's a chance for critics and political rivals to do damage. And it's this scrutiny that is often the thing--or one of them--that destroys a candidacy, especially one like Fiorina's that rides on voter anger and discontent. What happens? Either the press finds scandal--like the sexual harassment claims against Herman Cain in the 2012 primary--or unearths a record that undermines the candidate in one way or another. Fiorina is scandal-free, so far. But just a glance at her business career reveals bad judgment, worse performance, and deep political vulnerability. The Associated Press, for example, is unsympathetic to Fiorina's attempt to rehabilitate and tout her time at Hewlett-Packard. ""The truth is, her HP tenure was rocky,"" writes the AP before undermining Fiorina's claim that she ""doubled the size"" of the company:"	Why Carly Fiorina's Moment Will Be Fleeting
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/scott_walker_why_the_wisconsin_governor_may_still_be_a_force_to_be_reckoned.html	"Scott Walker's swift departure from the GOP presidential race on Monday could be interpreted as an embarrassing failure for a man who was until recently a conservative folk hero. But I believe that Walker has done himself and his party a service, and that he has instantly become a leading contender for the vice presidential nomination. Here's my analysis of what happened to Walker--and my case for why we've not yet heard the last of him in this race. What was Walker's fatal flaw? Since Walker officially announced his presidential campaign in July, he has underwhelmed the conservative media with his strange inability to answer straightforward questions regarding his views on domestic policy issues of particular interest to the right. I appreciate that most Americans don't spend every waking moment pondering the fate of the Export-Import Bank or whether we as a country ought to rethink birthright citizenship. To GOP diehards, however, these are very important issues, and Walker's failure to develop considered positions on them cost him. Conservatives across the country admired Walker for the steeliness he demonstrated over the course of his yearslong battle with organized labor in Wisconsin. A few weeks of waffling greatly diminished this reputation. Wait. How can it be that Walker hurt himself by not having considered positions on important domestic issues when Donald Trump and Ben Carson are leading the GOP field? No one really expects Donald Trump to have plausible things to say on these matters, least of all Trump's most devoted admirers, who love him for his rare combination of rage and what can only be described as ""sassiness."" Similarly, Ben Carson has attracted the devotion of conservatives, and in particular of evangelical conservatives, by virtue of his humility and his air of quiet seriousness, not his mastery of policy detail. The same rules don't apply to Walker, a sitting governor who is not, for all of his other virtues, a terrifically magnetic personality. Isn't the ideal GOP candidate someone who can appeal to the grassroots conservative activists and the fat cats who bankroll the party? Didn't Walker fit that bill? Sort of. In GOP presidential races, it is common for there to be a moderate conservative who commands the support of the fat cats and one or several ideological conservatives who, if they're lucky, win the backing of a committed cadre of small donors. Then there are the candidates who try to thread the needle by being more conservative than the ""establishment"" candidate but not quite as fire-breathing in their right-wingery as the ""outsider"" candidates. Tim Pawlenty tried to occupy this niche in 2012, as did Rick Perry. In 2008, this role was played by Fred Thompson. The trouble with this middle-of-the-road approach is that it can be the worst of both worlds. If you come across as too bloodless and pragmatic, you won't convince activists to embrace your candidacy, and to fuel your campaign with hard money donations. If your populism is too pronounced, you will alienate the Wall Streeters who might have bankrolled your super PAC. Basically, it's really hard to navigate this middle course, and Walker just couldn't pull it off. It's at least possible that another candidate--Carly Fiorina? Marco Rubio?-- might be able to do so in the months to come. Couldn't Walker have recovered? Couldn't he have at least tried to get up to speed on national issues and build strength over time? The short answer is probably not. If Walker believed that he was a man of destiny and that the future of the republic depended on his willingness to tough it out, perhaps he could have muddled through for a few more months, lying in wait as other candidates stumbled. To muddle through, however, he'd have to either radically trim the size of his quite big and expensive campaign staff or he'd have to raise more hard money. As Josh Kraushaar of National Journal notes, Walker managed to raise a handsome sum for his super PAC, but his super PAC could not pay for his staff or for his travel. Paying those bills meant attracting donors to Walker's formal campaign apparatus, and it's hard to attract donors when you're in the low single digits in the polls and you've faded to the point of invisibility on the debate stage. Walker was faring so badly that had he limped to another debate, he might have been relegated to the kids table--which might not even be around next time. I'd say that Walker has spared himself and his family a lot of sleepless nights. So why do you think Walker would make an excellent vice presidential nominee? Walker has bought himself plenty of time to study up on national issues away from the national spotlight. Though he ran an awful campaign, he showed occasional flashes of blue-collar charisma that could serve him well as a second banana. His somewhat awkward straddling of the line dividing the outsiders from the insiders could end up serving him well when it comes time for the nominee to choose a running mate. If one of the outsider candidates wins the nomination, Walker could serve as a steady pair of hands. If one of the Latino-friendly Floridians wins, Walker could shore up support among working-class white voters with his unpretentious vibe and his paeans to discount retailers. Don't count Scott Walker out yet."	Scott Walker Ran a Terrible Campaign--but We Haven't Heard the Last of Him in This Race
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/scott_walker_drops_out_of_2016_presidential_race_the_wisconsin_governor.html	"Scott Walker is the only governor to survive a recall but the first sitting governor who could not survive Donald Trump. The Wisconsin governor dropped out of the 2016 presidential race on Monday, marking one of the fastest flameouts in recent political memory. It was only in July that he announced he was running.* He was at the top of Iowa polls, a climb he had been on since his first strong showing in January at Rep. Steve King's GOP cattle call. Walker wasn't just a survivor. He was proof of a theory--that a candidate who did what conservatives wanted would be rewarded for his constancy. His message was simple: Others talk; I have delivered. After a president elected with no executive experience and no big legislation to his name, a candidate who was ideologically solid and who had results should have lasted longer. Walker announced with fanfare and high expectations back when Trump was being accused of hiring actors to attend his announcement. Now Trump gets vast crowds. Better to start as a longshot and get hot, which is what Trump has done. Walker got hot too fast, say Republican strategists and donors connected to the campaign. Walker built up a big staff, raised expectations, and just couldn't maintain the money or the excitement. ""The real reason for the race ended--at least this early--was fiscal mismanagement by the campaign,"" said one source close to the campaign. ""They burned through cash needlessly--expect the FEC report to be ugly."" The battle against unions sounded more exciting before Trump was giving kids helicopter rides. Walker could not adapt to seize the conversation.** The departure from the race was a shock to those in the donor community who were expecting Walker to retool after the last debate. It was clear he was in trouble, and his debate performance on CNN Wednesday night was lackluster. He had tried to pull out the jumper cables by attacking Trump--both in the debate and on the conservative circuit--but it didn't win him any notices. While Walker was falling in the polls, rumors started to swirl about a staff shakeup. Some donors wanted to see campaign manager Rick Wiley moved out of the job. Others weren't looking for a head but a new strategy. That strategy was put forward after the debate last week. The idea was to focus on Iowa, where Walker had an organization in 99 counties and let the super PAC provide air cover. The super PAC had already booked ads for South Carolina and Iowa. ""As of this morning we thought that was still the plan,"" says a member of Walker's donor community.* Walker's collapse suggests that while this was supposed to be the super PAC election where candidates could stay alive for a long time, the super PAC can't save you if you can't raise the more useful campaign money yourself. Walker faced the truly embarrassing possibility of being locked out of the next debate because he had sunk so low in the polls. With the prospects so dim, the money was just drying up. Unlike his favorite anecdote about buying low-cost goods with coupons at Kohl's, campaigns can't be run by pinching pennies.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/ben_carson_isn_t_apologizing_for_insulting_muslims_his_republican_supporters.html	"The political world is once again perplexed by a comment from a Republican presidential candidate expressing an untoward view of Muslims. Ben Carson, who behind his easygoing demeanor is a paranoiac who sees analogues to Nazi Germany everywhere, would not support a Muslim candidate for president. ""I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,"" he said on Sunday's Meet the Press. ""I absolutely would not agree with that."" He explained that the tenets of Islam forbid its practitioners from properly enforcing the Constitution, so that's that. Carson's rival candidates sensed that the political novice had committed something in the ballpark of a gaffe. They attacked his position from different angles, many hoping to affix themselves to the outrage du jour to secure more attention for their own presidential efforts. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has about as much support in the presidential contest as you do, encouraged Carson to apologize to the ""American Muslim community"" and concluded ""that Mr. Carson may be a good doctor, but he is not ready to lead a great nation."" Sen. Ted Cruz hardly expressed a love for Islam, but he did note that Carson's approach is at odds with the spirit of the Constitution. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, as usual, submitted the most hilarious take thus far. In an unsolicited statement sent to the press that whines about how the press is always nagging candidates with questions, Jindal explained that he'd be fine with a Muslim president who submits to certain conditions, such as being sworn in on a Bible. Carson and his team aren't sweating the modest rebukes from oxygen-deprived competitors. In fact, they're ""doubling down"" on the comments, according to every political news site on the Internet. ""Doubling down"" is a peculiar industrywide means of describing what's going on here. It connotes that a candidate, controversially, is making the high-risk decision to stand by seemingly indefensible remarks. The term is misapplied here. Carson's team, more accurately, is emphasizing his remarks. Carson isn't just scoring Republican primary points by showing resolve in the face of a hostile liberal media. He's scoring points on the merits, too. His campaign is even bragging about it. What's the simplest way to put this? The American public is broadly hostile to Islam, and the Republican base is especially hostile. Sure, we've had one GOP presidential candidate overtly defend the ""American Muslim community,"" but that was just Lindsey Graham--and the Republican base is hostile to Lindsey Graham, too. No one else, even the candidates who won't go so far as to affirm Carson's stance, is going to be seen hugging the neighborhood imam anytime soon. For evidence of this hostility: Look around. A Huffington Post/YouGov survey conducted earlier this year found that only 21 percent of the American public has either a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Islam. Fifty-five percent has either a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion. Among Republicans, 13 percent has either a somewhat or very favorable opinion, while 76 percent has either a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion. (As with many surveys, one imagines the thought process here. Muslims, you ask? You bet I view them somewhat unfavorably!) A 2014 Pew survey found that Muslims were viewed even less favorably than the dreaded atheists; an Arab American institute from the same year found that 57 percent of Republicans ""doubt that Muslim-Americans or Arab-Americans would be able to perform in a government post without their ethnicity or religion affecting their work."" And not affecting their work in a good way, either. The fellow who kicked off all of this generalized discussion about Islam was Donald Trump. Last week Trump ""failed to correct"" a New Hampshirite who declared President Obama a Muslim of non-American birth. The political media, then, expressed shock that Trump didn't correct a person who represents the views of nearly half of his party, greater than half of his own voters, and perhaps Trump himself. Trump's own answer to Chuck Todd's question on Meet the Press on Sunday further explained the politics underlying these alleged ""gaffes."" When pressed by Todd about whether ""putting a Muslim in the White House"" is acceptable, Trump interjected: ""I mean, some people have said it already happened, frankly."" Suffice it to say he wasn't referring to Thomas Jefferson. And there's another layer to the question that flew over much of the political media's heads. A significant portion of electorate would approach Todd's query from a radically different understanding of the world as it is. Forty-three percent of Republicans, per the most recent CNN poll, believe President Obama to be a Muslim. That's a lot of people. They believe that the country has already ""put a Muslim in the White House,"" and the experiment didn't turn out very well. President Obama, in their minds, was unable to perform his government job without his religion affecting his work. Why else would he agree to hand Iran nukes or take it easy on ISIS? Why would we ever put another Muslim in the White House? Perhaps we should expect more from potential presidential nominees. Well, go ahead and try that; be sure to tell the rest of us how it works out. Carson's response was so obviously in his political self-interest that it only would've been surprising had he responded a different way. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Of Course Ben Carson Isn't Apologizing for Insulting Muslims
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/paul_ryan_and_tim_scott_announcing_south_carolina_poverty_summit_kemp_forum.html	Ever since he was tapped as Mitt Romney's vice presidential candidate, Rep. Paul Ryan has been trying to start a conversation among Republicans about poverty. As a candidate in 2012 he held an event in Cleveland with ministers to explore the roots of poverty but didn't hold any more, in part because the Romney campaign wanted his focus elsewhere. After the campaign, he launched a low-key multicity tour of poor neighborhoods with the guidance of Robert Woodson, founder and president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise. It became the backbone of his recent book The Way Forward. The people Ryan met became the characters in a seven-part documentary called Comeback. The documentary came out about the time I was attending a GOP forum in Iowa where candidates had all gathered to talk about agricultural issues. I spent the day before the event with staffers for Catholic Charities looking at the part of Iowa that we never visit with the presidential candidates--the food pantry where people come from across the state to get a box of groceries or the temporary housing where families come in from the cold. It occurred to me that the next logical extension of Ryan's mission would be to launch a poverty summit, so I wrote a story making that case. Republicans, and Ryan in particular, are anxious to show how conservative ideas can transform the lives of the estimated 45 million Americans living in poverty. But we know what it looks like when candidates focus on an issue--take immigration for example--they mention it at every stop. They make trips to the border. They print T-shirts boasting about their positions. But there's almost no talk of poverty on the GOP campaign trail. If candidates were really interested in presenting their views on the issue--either because it is substantively important or because it is politically helpful to the brand--then the least they could do would be to gather for a summit of the kind that had drawn them all to speak to those corn farmers. Now it's happening. On Monday, Ryan and Sen. Tim Scott will announce that they are hosting the Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity. Named after former representative and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, the forum will take place on Jan. 9 in Columbia, South Carolina. It will feature presidential candidates, scholars, and community leaders to make the case for conservative solutions to poverty. Naming the gathering after Kemp echoes the former congressman's efforts to do what Ryan is trying to do. Kemp even tried to do it when he was Bob Dole's vice presidential nominee. He traveled to Harlem in New York, Watts in Los Angeles, and the South Side of Chicago preaching the gospel of free enterprise. Green is the color of civil rights, he used to say, meaning the money that came from free enterprise. Much like Ryan, Kemp was ultimately discouraged from appealing for votes in poor neighborhoods where there weren't many Republicans. Ryan, as a Catholic, has nicely timed the announcement of the summit to coincide with the arrival of Pope Francis who brings with him his message of service to the poor. The forum could be an opportunity to wrestle with issues that don't get discussed much on the campaign trail--what role individual responsibility plays in poverty and how much of it is the result of systemic forces. Also, as budget chairman, Ryan proposed some modifications to the safety net that his critics claim would devastate the poor. If the presidential candidates come to engage with these topics, it will perhaps interrupt for a brief moment the campaign circus. Ryan has his work cut out for him though. Farmers in Iowa vote. The poor is not a constituency that votes or is likely to support the candidates in large numbers in early primary states like South Carolina. Though Ryan has lots of ideas about how to reduce poverty in our society, his first challenge is reducing the poverty of conversation about it.	I Suggested Republicans Hold a Poverty Summit. Paul Ryan Is Going to Do It.
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/pope_francis_in_the_united_states_why_he_isn_t_the_liberal_rock_star_american.html	"Pope Francis is coming to the United States, and liberal Catholics are thrilled. Vice President Joe Biden is praising the pope's moral leadership. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a leading abortion rights advocate, has sent the pope a list of topics to address. For many Catholics, the euphoria extends to family and sexual issues on which Francis has signaled new tolerance. A majority of American Catholics, according to a Pew survey, predicts that within the next 35 years, the church will approve contraception and married priests. Thirty-six percent expect the church to recognize same-sex marriages. Some of these people think the pope shares their respect for moral diversity and individual rights. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, claims that Francis disagrees with opponents of same-sex marriage and that he believes the church ""should not interfere spiritually in the lives of gays."" Bill de Blasio, the Catholic mayor of New York, says his fondness for the church has been rekindled by Francis' outreach, particularly a ""seismic moment"" two years ago, in which the pope, responding to a question about gay Catholics, asked: ""Who am I to judge?"" These liberals misunderstand the pope, because they don't understand a tension in their own thinking. Politically, Francis isn't liberal. He's progressive. We use these terms interchangeably, but they're different. Liberalism is fundamentally about doubt: You have your view, I have mine, and we agree to disagree. Progressivism is about confidence: Your view is wrong, mine is right, and I'm going to change the world accordingly. Francis is confident, and he's not afraid to use political power to achieve his aims. As he puts it, ""A good Catholic meddles in politics."" Temperamentally, Francis does have liberal tendencies. He regrets the authoritarian way he governed as a young Jesuit leader. He wants to be open and collegial. He accepts criticism, seeks dialogue, and tries to learn from it. When Catholics disagree, he tries to focus them on respect, love, and mercy. But if you look at his record, you'll see limits to his openness. Take homosexuality. The quote that endeared Francis to liberals was: ""If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?"" Francis later explained his question this way: ""When God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person? We must always consider the person."" The key word here is existence. Francis was forswearing condemnation of the whole person, not judgment of homosexual behavior. He was repackaging what conservative Christians have always said: love the sinner, not the sin. Francis has never called into question the church's fundamental teaching: that while people ""who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies ... must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity,"" they are ""called to chastity"" because ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered."" In fact, Francis has affirmed that ""children have a right to grow up in a family with a father and a mother,"" and he has condemned efforts to ""redefine the very institution of marriage."" The Catholic catechism also forbids divorce. It says that if you get divorced and remarry, you're ""in a situation of public and permanent adultery."" In some congregations, that means you can't take Communion. Last month, to ease the pressure on these parishioners, Francis delivered new instructions to priests: ""People who started a new union after the defeat of their sacramental marriage are not at all excommunicated, and they absolutely must not be treated that way."" This month, he made it easier for couples to get their marriages annulled by the church so they can get remarried without being treated as adulterers. But they still have to go through a church trial. If they don't, the pope says, their new unions ""are contrary to the sacrament of marriage."" Under Catholic law, abortion warrants instant excommunication. It's considered so evil that in many countries, only a bishop can forgive it. Three weeks ago, Francis made an exception: Beginning in December, women who have had abortions can be absolved by priests. But the offer is valid only for a year, and only if you confess and repent. In addition, the deal isn't new: Fifteen years ago, Pope John Paul II offered women the same terms. And Francis' bottom line is the same as John Paul's: Abortion violates ""the right to life from conception."" Francis' concessions on these three issues aren't meaningless. They'll make life easier for some women, gay people, and divorced couples. But in each case, he has avoided challenging the catechism. He's offering just enough, procedurally or rhetorically, to lure wayward sheep back into the church, where their errors can be corrected. That's his goal. Communion, he explains, ""is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak."" Francis isn't trying to solve liberals' pet issues. He's trying to get rid of them. He said as much in an interview two years ago: ""It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time. The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent."" Not equivalent is his way of saying that he's not particularly interested in enforcing sexual or family morality. If you want to know what interests him, look at what's on his schedule in Washington, New York, and Philadelphia this week: sessions with immigrants, laborers, prisoners, and homeless people. Pope Francis is a social justice guy. Social justice is a long Catholic tradition. Popes have talked about welfare, labor conditions, and the moral boundaries of capitalism for more than a century. Many people on the secular left don't know about this tradition. They associate the church with the political right because John Paul stood with President Reagan against communism, and later, Benedict XVI stood with President George W. Bush against social liberalism. The average American liberal has probably heard that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is fighting to block contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But that same liberal has forgotten--or never knew--that for decades, the bishops have supported national health insurance. Today, all over the world, the acceleration of economic inequality and insecurity is reviving the political left. Francis is part of the change. He's the first pope from the Southern Hemisphere. He studied with liberation theologians. He has appointed cardinals from poor countries. Two years ago, at his installation Mass, he promised to serve ""the poorest, the weakest, the least important."" In speeches and interviews, he decries rampant capitalism. He talks about trade agreements, financial speculation, trickle-down economics, austerity, and youth unemployment. A quarter-century after John Paul lectured the European Parliament about secularism, Francis returned to the same venue with a very different lecture, focused on poverty and unemployment. Francis doesn't just raise these issues. He soaks them in Christian language and imagery. He describes the unbridled free market as a ""cult of money,"" ""new idols,"" ""the golden calf,"" and ""the dung of the devil."" He speaks of a twisted mentality that ""sacrifices human lives at the altar of money."" He tells Christians that poor people are ""at the heart of the Gospel,"" that working toward economic fairness is ""a commandment,"" and that ""our faith challenges the tyranny of Mammon."" His crusade against profit, in turn, has broadened into a crusade against environmental destruction. Three months ago, Francis combined the two issues in his first encyclical, ""Laudato Si."" He covered several topics--climate change, deforestation, biodiversity, pollution, water--but his message was relentlessly moral. By and large, he argued, wealthy countries cause the destruction, and poor countries suffer the consequences. He advocated ""integral ecology,"" a Catholic philosophy that would manage economic development to serve human needs. In speeches and interviews, he implored world leaders to ""be protectors of creation, protectors of God's plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another and of the environment."" He declared a World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation. He summoned politicians to a Vatican conference to enlist their aid against climate change. Francis has elevated other issues, too. Long before this summer's migrant crisis, he pressed European and American leaders to aid immigrants and refugees. He ordered the church to house migrants in vacant convents and monasteries, explaining that these buildings ""are for the flesh of Christ, which is what the refugees are."" He has campaigned not just against capital punishment, but also against solitary confinement, pretrial detention, and the ""hidden death penalty""--life imprisonment without parole. He has even castigated businessmen who ""call themselves Christian"" but manufacture guns. These expansions of the Vatican agenda are progressive, not liberal. They're clear, confident, and heavy on government action. Francis isn't interested in your alternative theology or your putative right to bear arms. In ""Laudato Si,"" he dismisses Christians who interpret the ""dominion"" language of Genesis as authorization to exploit nature. ""This is not a correct interpretation of the Bible as understood by the Church,"" the pope writes. He also rejects population control, the socially liberal cure for an overworked planet. If your politics incline to the left, you probably like Francis's economic agenda better than Benedict's family-values agenda. Right-wing attempts to impose values through law are notoriously clumsy and counterproductive. But Francis' left-wing ideas can be just as crude. By his own admission, he doesn't understand economics and has no clear solutions. He rejects cap-and-trade environmental remedies as too technical, too capitalistic, and insufficiently ""radical"" and redistributive. He scorns scientific fixes, saying they divert us from ""ethical considerations"" and ""deep change."" Progressive moralists turn out to be a lot like conservative moralists: Their piety clouds their practicality. On that score, let's cut Francis some slack. He was elected to be the pope, not the world's chief economist or engineer. He might not be the best judge, technically, of how to approach all the issues on his agenda. But he has chosen those issues well. Poverty and environmental destruction cause far more harm to far more people than the church's policies on abortion, divorce, and homosexuality do. That may sound callous, but it's true. And the pope is arguably the last guy from whom you should expect liberalism. What popes can do, better than almost anyone else, is focus the world's attention on certain issues. If you have to choose between a progressive pope and a liberal pope, take the progressive one. Did Francis have to choose? Probably so. He doesn't work for American liberals or even for American Catholics. A pope must think about the global Catholic community, and that community is divided. In the United States, a Pew survey found that most Catholics support same-sex marriage. But in Latin America, Pew's researchers found Catholic majorities for gay marriage in only three of 19 countries. Most American Catholics think that the priesthood should be open to women and that priests should be allowed to marry. Most Latin American Catholics don't. A broader poll of more than 12,000 Catholics worldwide, taken more than a year ago for Univision, found that on every question--abortion, contraception, divorce, homosexuality, female priests, married priests--Catholics in Asia and Africa were far more conservative than those in the United States and Europe. On economic questions, the gap is reversed. In the United States, fewer than 50 percent of white Catholics say it's the government's responsibility to take care of people who can't take care of themselves. In Latin America, roughly 90 percent of Catholics say it's the government's job to take care of very poor people who can't take care of themselves. In African countries where most Christians are Catholic--Guinea-Bissau, Rwanda, and Uganda--more than three-quarters of Christians say it's the government's job. Look back at older surveys, and you'll see the same pattern: Nearly every other country outpolls the United States in support for government aid to the indigent. Politically, Francis made the smart call. He's appeasing Western liberals with limited procedural concessions while spending the bulk of his capital on an economic agenda that resonates with ordinary people everywhere else. He also made the smart call from a doctrinal standpoint: It's far easier to square the catechism with progressive policies than with liberal ones. But the simplest explanation is that on the basic question of which way to go, Francis wasn't calculating at all. He got his job because he really does think like most of the world's Catholics. He's egalitarian, down-to-earth, and judgmental. And they love it.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/ted_cruz_attacks_chief_justice_john_roberts_the_texas_senator_wouldn_t_have.html	"It's quite something that Republican presidential candidates have decided Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is a liberal traitor to the cause. CNN moderators devoted a healthy segment to this discussion in Wednesday night's debate, one that largely took place between Jeb Bush, whose brother appointed Roberts, and Sen. Ted Cruz, a well-pedigreed conservative lawyer himself. Cruz, who has called for Supreme Court judicial retention elections to eliminate constitutional heretics like Roberts, declared that it was a ""mistake"" for President George W. Bush to appoint Roberts to the court in light of his two decisions to uphold the Affordable Care Act. ""He's a good enough lawyer,"" Cruz said, ""that he knows in these Obamacare cases he changed the statute, he changed the law in order to force that failed law on millions of Americans for a political outcome."" Cruz claimed that had he been president in 2005, he would have appointed a more ""rock-ribbed"" conservative judge. That judge would have promised President Cruz that in seven years, he would absolutely strike down a health care law nicknamed after the then-junior senator from Illinois. Bush, while ably forcing Cruz to confess that he supported Roberts' confirmation in 2005, recognized in their exchange that a full-throated defense of Roberts' selection was not politically wise. ""Going forward,"" he said, ""what we need to do is to have someone that has a long-standing set of rulings that consistently makes it clear that he is focused exclusively on upholding the Constitution of the United States so they won't try to use the bench as a means to which legislate."" No more appointments for judges like Roberts, whose modest two-year service on a federal appeals court should have been the first clue that he would eventually certify the legality of a market-based health reform law. Cruz equated Roberts with ""philosopher-kings imposing their liberal policies on millions of Americans."" Again, this is a somewhat hyperbolic depiction of Roberts' record. Aside from his Obamacare decisions--both of which were in fairly brittle cases brought by conservative plaintiffs--Roberts' has been a stalwart conservative. And Obamacare will be a thing of the past, anyway, when Cruz becomes president. If Cruz does become president, by the way? The individual to whom he'd owe that victory, more than any other, would be Chief Justice Roberts. It was the Roberts court, in Citizens United v. FEC, that paved the way for the super PAC era that would allow a figure like Cruz to prevail. And yes, Cruz certainly has a path to the nomination. Let's say there are three ways that the GOP primary process plays out from here The first is an extension of the current paradigm in which nonpolitician outsiders Donald Trump and Ben Carson command between them the majority of support of Republican voters. If this doesn't change, either Trump or Carson will win the nomination. The second is one in which the ""old rules"" of Republican Party nominating reassert themselves: A majority flocks to the establishment candidate with party backing and vast resources. (This would require the establishment to corral around a candidate first--either Bush or Sen. Marco Rubio--but that's a whole other mess.) Then there's the third reality: The vast anti-establishment parcel that Trump has excavated remains, but those voters migrate to a somewhat more credentialed, conventional candidate. That would be Cruz. This is the scenario on which he's been banking all summer. In this world, Trump and Carson would falter and Cruz would take the Iowa caucuses, we're he's well-positioned, and ride that momentum to a solid showing in New Hampshire. Under the old rules, this is where the party establishment would put its foot down: It would marshal its resources behind a Bush or a Rubio, cut off the insurgent in South Carolina and Florida, and finish him on Super Tuesday. But those rules no longer apply, since the party no longer has the party fundraising market cornered. That's because of Citizens United. Super PACs supporting Cruz have already raised at least $38 million. Throw in the not-bad $14 million that Cruz's official campaign raised in hard cash through June, and he already has a sizable war chest--nothing quite like Bush's nine-figure haul, but certainly enough to carry him to the end of primary season. If Cruz is able to pull this off, he should at the very least stop calling Roberts mean names like Liberal Philosopher-King. Really, if he wants to be a peach, he should send Roberts (and that other filthy liberal monster, Anthony Kennedy) a bouquet of freshly cut flowers or a generous iTunes gift card. In Citizens United and subsequent campaign finance opinions that Roberts himself wrote, his court has established a very narrow test for determining the corrupting influence of money in politics, one that allows Cruz to accept multimillion-dollar checks from a handful of billionaires that could take him to the promised land. And all Cruz can do is call him names! Aren't gentlemen of Harvard supposed to learn manners at some point?"	Why Ted Cruz Secretly Loves John Roberts
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/republican_primary_debate_carly_fiorina_impressed_while_donald_trump.html	"Carly Fiorina did the most to help her campaign in the three-hour CNN Iron Man debate. She did two things that the men who were once front-runners have had a hard time doing: She bested Donald Trump in a tussle and she used her answers to set herself apart from the pack. The second GOP debate touched on issues from pot legalization to gun rights to how to defeat ISIS. And there were plenty of side moments. Jeb Bush and Trump debated whether the real estate magnate had tried to open a casino in Florida; Bush defended his wife; Ben Carson and Trump exchanged views on vaccinations; Fiorina spoke of burying a child who had died of drug addiction. For Republican voters the 11 candidate lineup represented the challenge of this campaign: so much to choose from, and little help winnowing the field. If anything, the choice is now harder. Every candidate had a moment they can promote, though some--like Fiorina, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Gov. Chris Christie--did better than others. Fiorina's first success came when she gave an answer that combined the issues of Planned Parenthood and the recent nuclear deal with Iran. ""One has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation,"" she said. ""The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation."" (Though her story about Planned Parenthood was misleading). The substance of the answer would please anti-abortion conservatives, and the way Fiorina delivered it suggested she was confident in herself. Even on small issues, her answers suggested someone who had some convictions. When asked what woman she would put on the $10 bill, she said, ""I wouldn't change the $10 bill, or the $20 bill. I think, honestly, it's a gesture. I don't think it helps to change our history. What I would think is that we ought to recognize that women are not a special interest group. Women are the majority of this nation. We are half the potential of this nation, and this nation will be better off when every woman has the opportunity to live the life she chooses."" Bush and Gov. Scott Walker, by contrast, never conveyed the same sense of ownership. The loudest applause of the evening came when Fiorina responded to Trump's disparaging comments about her face in Rolling Stone. Trump subsequently said that he was referring to her persona, so Fiorina was asked to offer an opinion about Trump's persona. ""You know it's interesting to me. Mr. Trump said he heard Mr. Bush very clearly about what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said."" What was telling about her remark is that it was made on the fly. She was referring to something that Trump had said just moments before. She had to know this was going to come up, but she didn't give some prepackaged answer. She improvised. That probably added to the strong reaction she got after the face-off. (Or, as Trump would say, the ""persona-off."") After the audience went nuts, Trump tried to make good by saying, ""I think she's got a beautiful face and I think she's a beautiful woman."" (No one was buying that.) That was not the only moment that Trump was on his heels. At the start of the debate everyone ganged up on the Donald. What may have hurt him the most wasn't when he was in the thick of the fight, but when he was silent. For a long stretch, when the candidates engaged in a somewhat specific discussion of the issues, he disappeared. Trump's answers were highly general and when things got specific he showed no interest in jumping in. When he talked about Syria, his answer went in circles. Could it be possible that what hurts Trump is not what he has said, but when he has nothing much to say? Up until now every candidate but Fiorina who has attacked Trump has fallen in the polls. In Wednesday night's debate it felt like everyone could attack Trump, and it wouldn't necessarily hurt their standing--perhaps because the discussions were more rooted in policy this time around. Rubio made the most of these policy debates. He was specific and forceful when talking about Syria and the threat of global terrorism. His strongest moment came when he made the case for foreign policy expertise, in light of Trump's assertion that he could just learn quickly on the job. ""You had better be able to lead our country on the first day,"" said Rubio. ""Not six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis. You can't predict it. Sometimes you cannot control it. ... One thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe. And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office."" Rubio also shined at the tail end of a back and forth between Trump and Bush on Trump's claim that Bush shouldn't speak Spanish. Rubio defended speaking the language and told the story of his grandfather--an immigrant from Cuba--who came to love America, and conservatism, and pass both loves on to Rubio. ""He taught me that in Spanish. Because that was the language he was most comfortable in,"" Rubio said. He said he spoke Spanish to current-day immigrants to reach them: ""If they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me, not from a translator at Univision."" It was a moment that Bush was trying to exploit, but Rubio delivered. Christie played to the high road from the very start. In his opening statement he said the cameras should not focus on him but the audience, arguing that the debate wasn't about him but America. (All appeals to humility feel like they're aimed at Trump.) Later, as Trump and Fiorina got into a standoff over their business histories, Christie called them out for bickering. ""While I'm as entertained as anyone by this personal back and forth about the history of Donald and Carly's career,"" Christie said after Fiorina had brought up Trump's bankruptcies and Trump had dissed her tenure as a CEO. ""[But] for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight, who doesn't have a job, who can't fund his child's education, I got to tell you the truth, they could care less about your careers, they care about theirs,"" he said. ""Let's start talking about that on this stage and stop playing the games."" Christie wasn't the only one to make this point. CNN had decided to allow the candidates to mix it up and that led to much bickering. To get airtime, candidates like Christie, Kasich, and Mike Huckabee appealed to the high road, claiming that the bickering did nothing for regular people. Bush and Walker were more in evidence in this debate than they were in the first one--that's not a high bar--but they are not likely to be in the conversation much as the debate highlights are passed around on Facebook. Bush's best moment came when he defended his brother after Trump criticized him. ""He kept us safe,"" Bush said to big applause. Jeb showed some conviction in defense of his brother, which made for good theater, but it probably would have been better if it had been on a policy position or idea rather than that complicated issue of family relations. At one point during the immigration debate it seemed like Bush was on the cusp of using his policy dispute with Trump to show this passion and distinguish himself, but there wasn't much intensity. At another winning moment, Bush said the Secret Service code name he would pick for himself was ""Eveready ... It's very high energy."" Trump, who has been ribbing Bush repeatedly for being ""low energy,"" liked the answer so much that the two men exchanged a high-five. Trump was then asked to pick his own code name. ""Humble,"" he said. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	The Highs and Lows in CNN's Epic GOP Debate
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/gop_establishment_may_be_hopeful_after_second_primary_debate_the_beginning.html	"For the people who fund the Republican Party and drive its key concerns--the donors and owners who push tax cuts uber alles--Wednesday night's presidential debate (and its aftermath, in particular) was critical. Eleven people were on the stage debating, but there were just four viable candidates--five if you count New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie--who share a commitment to the party establishment and its core priorities: Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Scott Walker, and Gov. John Kasich. On paper, this is a Squadron Supreme of talent: Bush, the scion of a successful political family; Rubio, the charismatic star of a new, more modern GOP; Walker, the effective right-wing governor of a Democratic state; and Kasich, the ""compassionate conservative"" who wins moderates with ease. In practice, however, they've done nothing but disappoint. All, especially Walker, have withered next to the incredible success of Donald Trump and his closest rival, Ben Carson, the friendly--and radical--favorite of conservative evangelical Christians in the Republican Party. If Trump were just a sideshow--with no real pull on the shape of the GOP race--this might be tolerable. But in addition to insults, Trump brings apostasy. He wants higher taxes on the wealthy and slams cuts to Social Security. He doesn't just oppose comprehensive immigration reform--a perennial item on the establishment wish list--he wants to see a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. If Trump can sustain his rise, and turn it into a real campaign, he could upend the Republican consensus and deal a blow to supply-side aspirations. Given this, what did elites need? They needed their champions to perform--to show that they're able to fight challengers and establish themselves against their opponents. With a strong performance, one of the five--Bush, Rubio, Kasich, Walker, or Christie--could break out and return to prominence in the polls. Likewise, the establishment needed someone to wound Trump, even if it opened the door to Carson. Because even if Carson rose higher, it would confirm an important fact: that these ""outsiders"" are counterparts to Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain, and will fall after their 15 minutes in the spotlight. If that's true, then the elites will eventually win, as long as they hold on and support their best candidates. The good news is that this debate might mark the beginning of the end for Trump, who struggled to tackle substantive questions on foreign policy, his advisers, and what he'd actually do as president of the United States. More importantly, he faced a confident Carly Fiorina, who slammed and tweaked Trump on his obvious ignorance of key issues. ""I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,"" Fiorina said about his remarks on her appearance to Rolling Stone magazine. And when he took credit for bringing immigration to the front of the race, Fiorina rebuked him. ""Immigration reform did not come up in the debate because of Mr. Trump,"" she said. ""We have been talking about it for 25 years."" For the first time in weeks, Trump was diminished, and only recovered during a blistering--and irresponsible--attack on vaccination schedules. On the same score, Carson was a weak performer, practically sleeping through the debate, and stumbling through answers with his standard blend of genial storytelling and reactionary rhetoric. But just because Trump lost doesn't mean elites are in the clear. Fiorina isn't a Carson-esque radical or an opportunist like Trump, but she's also an outsider to the GOP, untethered to the establishment. She'll gain from this debate, but party elites won't. At least, not now. If there's a central question to the Trump phenomenon, it's this: Is Trump new? Is he a disruption in the GOP primary--a force that could upend the patterns of the past--or is he another bubble candidate, like Cain in 2012? If it's the former, we shouldn't expect gaffes or mistakes to harm him. If it's the latter, however, he'll fall to other vanity candidates as voters search for the next high. Which is why the next few weeks are key. If Trump loses his lead, then the establishment can breathe easier, even as it sees a Carson lead or a Fiorina lead. It means there's an end to the madness. ""Easier"" isn't easy, however, and if the GOP debate harmed Trump, it also underscored weakness in the establishment. Bush was better than he's ever been, touting his record, defending his brother, and tussling with Trump. And yet, he was underwhelming. After a strong start, he couldn't sustain the energy to attack, and was caught off-guard by replies and rejoinders. Worse, he fumbled when asked about Iraq, his foreign policy advisers, and their connections to previous Bush administrations. ""I'm my own man,"" he said, without showing how, exactly, that's true. But Bush, for all his stumbling, soared above Walker, who hardly spoke--he received three direct questions in a three-hour debate, compared with 13 for Trump and nine for Bush--and always answered in talking points about his record in Wisconsin, his devotion to Ronald Reagan, and his defiance of union protesters. In just a month, Walker has dropped from top spots in national polling to the very bottom; he needed to win this debate, and he failed. If, before Iowa, Walker drops out, this was the beginning of the end. That leaves party elites with three candidates who could walk away as good, or better, than they were before the debate: Rubio, Kasich, and Christie. Rubio has mastered his basic pitch of aspirational conservatism, and on immigration he can make the seamless move from biography to policy to the stories of other people. On the Iran deal, Kasich shined with a forceful defense of prudence in pursuit of national goals, and used his time throughout to pitch himself as a moderate, forward-thinking choice for the party. And Christie worked to move the conversation toward economic issues, where he could portray himself as a fighter for working-class Americans. Neither he nor his competitors had any discussion of economic policy outside of vague generalities. But for the sake of television, it worked. Of the three it's hard to say that any is a perfect candidate. But unlike Bush or Walker, they are clearly skilled enough to compete on a national stage, under the pressure of a presidential campaign. In other words, party elites have a new decision: Will they keep the faith with Jeb, giving him cash and assistance even as he stumbles through the primary process, or will they cut their losses and turn their attention to one of these other three? No, the Bush family isn't a bad bet. But Jeb keeps flailing, and it's not clear he's going to get better. See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Beginning of Trump's End?

""I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these [Planned Parenthood sting] tapes,"" she began. ""Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us."" It tapped so deeply into social conservatives' moral consciousness that few noticed the procedural path she seemed to endorse for resolving the Planned Parenthood funding impasse--one that was entering the GOP leadership discussion in Washington on Wednesday afternoon. ""Forcing Obama to veto"" a spending measure that defunds Planned Parenthood would mean either eliminating the Senate filibuster or defunding Planned Parenthood as part of a budget reconciliation package. The former will not happen. The latter, though? ""Senate GOP leaders are eyeing up an obscure budget tool known as reconciliation as they seek to defund Planned Parenthood without causing a government shutdown,"" the Hill reports. ""Two GOP leaders said Wednesday they are not ruling out the use of budget reconciliation to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood -- a process that would be entirely separate from the government spending bill that Congress must pass by Sept. 30."" Reconciliation allows legislation that meets certain requirements (e.g., it directly affects spending and revenues and doesn't increase the deficit, for starters) to bypass a Senate filibuster. It is the Senate majority's best one-off shot to get an important bill to the president's desk. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also seemed to endorse this plan--to more modest fanfare--by declaring, ""Pass [a defunding of Planned Parenthood] with 51 votes. Put it on the desk of the president."" Getting a Planned Parenthood defunding bill to the president's desk, and having him veto it, would serve as a victory in their eyes. But would that be enough for House conservatives? Because this budget reconciliation bill would be vetoed. Some 40 conservatives, quartered in the House Freedom Caucus, have pledged not to support any bill that funds Planned Parenthood. Once the reconciliation bill were passed, and vetoed, the situation would be right back to square one: having to pass a bill to keep the government open. Fiorina, Walker, and other candidates who weren't quite so gung-ho about inviting a shutdown over the issue seemed to support a compromise that would avoid a shutdown while allowing conservatives to save face. If conservatives don't accept it, though, then resume your shutdown countdowns. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."
