Mayor Bloomberg, as he should, took responsibility for the decision. From a tactical police perspective, the operation appears to have gone well in that the park was secured and nobody was seriously injured. Of course the situation is still rapidly evolving. Among other things, an important court decision is expected in half an hour. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the mayor's decision, such is the way things are supposed to work in our representative democracy. (I, for instance, find the arrest of reporters particularly distasteful.) As to the protesters, I have sympathy. I can only hope they will direct their anger not toward the men and women following orders (lawful orders, mind you), but to those with the power and means to actually affect change. As to the police, I also have sympathy. You are stuck in the middle, as usual. But you must exercise professionalism and restraint. The whole world really is watching. And the good job of many can easily be undone by the out-of-control action of few. But to those who may be intent on provoking and hurting police, I can offer no better warning than one told to my friend years ago by his father: ""Don't get into fights with police; they're not in the habit of losing."" There's a dirty old joke about two men watching three other men go at it, in bed. One observer, a bit naive, asks the other about the man on the left. The second observer, more knowledgeable, describes his role. The naive one then asks about the man on the right and, after receiving a detailed answer, finally asks about the third man, the man in the middle. The cognoscente says, somewhat longingly, ""The man in the middle? Why that's Lucky Pierre!"" I think of Pierre when Occupy protesters ask police, as they do, ""Who the fuck are you protecting?"" It's certainly a valid question. Police are supposed to protect everything and everybody--shop windows, people who need to get to work, even the protesters. It's an impossible task. On one side a very small minority of protesters wish to create something between mob rule and a literal revolution. On the other side, perhaps a few totalitarians wish to eliminate all dissent and relive battles of bygone decades. Placed between conflicting demands, police end up like Pierre, but unlucky: stuck in the middle and screwed from both sides. Protesters--the vast majority peaceful--exercise their 1st Amendment rights to speech, assembly, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Meanwhile residents and businesses whose livelihoods depend on normalcy oppose the protests, if not on ideological grounds, than simply because of their disruptive presence. Our democratically elected leaders make the laws and order police to enforce them with legal force. City officials, their eye on overtime and the bottom line, order police to clear an area--which requires force--and to make sure nobody gets hurt. It can't happen. Police become the messenger stuck between two irreconcilable forces. The results can be tragic. In Oakland, a young veteran was critically injured when police tried, unsuccessfully in the end, to keep a public plaza free from protesters. Tear gas, rubber bullets, and Tasers are called less-lethal for a reason. They can and occasionally do kill. Occupy protests complicate matters by bringing a segment of society--a white middle-class segment--into, what is for many, first contact with police authority. If you think of police as coming whenever you call for help, you may be surprised to learn that police do not work for you. Officers work first for the police department and then for the city that pays them. A force designed to maintain order and the status quo will never sing Kumbaya with protesters who combine a desire for change with a privileged sense of agency and entitlement. Police were invented in 1829, very explicitly in part, to protect society from mob rule. H.L. Mencken described police of the early 1900s as poorly paid, ""but they carried on their dismal work with unflagging diligence, and loved a long, hard chase almost as they loved a quick, brisk clubbing."" Police today are undoubtedly changed for the better, and reliance on force is much less common than it was in Mencken's age (or even a few decades ago). Better training and changing attitudes (combined with video cameras and lawsuits) have dragged police culture reluctantly into something very close to the present day. Even though police culture remains solidly working-class and socially conservative, there is a surprisingly strong populist and even libertarian streak in policing. Granted, this is more Tea Party conservative than balaclava-wearing anarchist, but in an era when even those who wear blue see pink-slips, one does not have to dig too deep in the rank-and-file to find conditional sympathy for Occupy. But to ask if police have sympathy for Occupy protesters is to ask the wrong question (akin to asking waiters if they're hungry on behalf of their customers). Police work is not about sympathy but getting the job done, pleasing the boss, and going home in one piece. When times are routine, police drive around, respond to calls for service, help when they can, arrest when they must, and pick up the pieces of very troubled lives. The angry, the criminals, the victims, the idiotic--they can all be part of the fun. In a chaotic world, routine comes to substitute for order. Your average cop asks for little more than a working car, a decent cup of coffee, a clean bathroom, time to eat, and the chance to get off work on time. Police will always gripe when something disturbs their routine. (But honestly, police can sometimes be a complaining lot.) If cops could wave a magic wand, the protesters would simply go away. But if cops could wave a magic wand, the whole damned city would probably disappear. Police relate to the demoralized employees in the film Clerks: ""This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers."" Occupy protests are certainly seen as a nuisance, but this is more work-related than deep-rooted ideology. If we accept that Occupy protests, like all large public gatherings, need to be policed, there are guidelines of protest behavior that can mitigate police unpleasantness: 1) don't hurt yourself or others, 2) don't shut down the city, 3) don't antagonize the police, and 4) no surprises. If these simple rules are followed, police will gladly stand around and collect overtime while others chant and rally. The job for police at large protests is mostly to protect and contain. In general, police avoid arrests at major events because they are time-consuming, disruptive, and remove officers from the scene. But when break-out groups of protesters disrupt the city, police have to react, and they won't be in a good mood. As long as protesters--not all protesters, but some--wish to provoke officers, police will play the role of an angry Pierre. If we wish protests to be allowed and peacefully contained, we could do far worse than follow the lead of the NYPD. So far, with a few notable bumps, things have actually gone pretty well in Manhattan. But New York City has huge resources not available to smaller locales. Ultimately the decision to accommodate, tolerate, or battle protesters rests, as it should, with a multitude of locally elected officials. Perhaps they should be more tolerant of groups of people who wish to control public space. Perhaps blocking roads isn't the be-all and end-all (after all, cars do it all the time). Perhaps we can better balance local livelihoods and open access to public space. These issues need to be decided by cool-headed civil discussion and not the moment a chunk of concrete whizzes past an officer's head. Police work literally and figuratively in uniform, but it is counterproductive and somewhat absurd to antagonize an officer in New York for an order given in California (and vice versa). Occupy is supposed to be about economic injustice, not the police. The majority of protesters are peaceful and mean well; the majority of the public respect, if not the substance of the protesters, the right to protest; and the majority of police officers--who, unlike the protesters, would certainly prefer to be elsewhere--do not want to become the focal point of protesters' fury. And yet there the police are, center stage, day in and day out. Wherever the protests go, police have to come reluctantly along for the ride, stuck in the middle, like poor Unlucky Pierre."	How Cops Really Feel About the Occupy Wall Street Protests

Born in a South Carolina hotel ballroom on Aug. 13, it died on the campus of Oakland University on Nov. 9, with CNBC's debate moderators unable to avert their eyes. The cause of death: self-inflicted injury, brought on by amnesia. The Perry campaign had always been sickly. But for a little while no one wanted to diagnose it. A Politico front-pager about whether Perry was ""dumb""? Cheap ""name-calling,"" according to Fox News. The candidate calling Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme?"" If you didn't like that, you had a problem with straight talk and honesty and, probably, cojones. Reporters dutifully filed stories about Perry's donor-friendly contracting, about the bogusness of his ""Texas miracle."" The campaign pretended that the media didn't exist. It couldn't last, because eventually, voters had to hear from Rick Perry. No amount of expectations-lowering guff--and Perry had exhausted the North American supply of it--could have saved him from what happened when he tried to name three abolishable Cabinet departments. He was repeating something he says at every major campaign stop, and yet he couldn't remember it. ""It is three agencies of government when I get there that are gone,"" he said. ""Commerce, Education, and the--What's the third one there? Let's see."" After Ron Paul and moderator John Harwood failed to bail him out, he simply said, ""Oops."" After the debate was over, Perry himself entered the media spin room for the first time. The rule about spin rooms: Front-runners don't bother with them. In a panic, you forget rules like that. ""I tell you what,"" said Perry to the gawking mob. ""I named two more agencies of government than what the, uh, uh, current administration has talked about getting rid of."" He juiced this with a new, hideous talking point: ""I may have forgotten Energy, but I haven't forgotten my conservative principles."" Reporters wouldn't leave him alone, asking him again and again how he felt. ""I stepped in it, man!"" said Perry. ""Yeah, it was embarrassing! Of course it was!"" A few steps away, Mitt Romney's spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom was looking for ways to shiv Perry without noticeable traces of blood. He found one. ""There's nothing I could say that could darken the night Rick Perry had."" True. All of those hours of fundraising, all of those one-engine flights to rural Iowa, all of that delicate flag placement at big speeches, and the fate of presidential campaigns comes down to stuff like this. Tim Pawlenty never recovered after he debuted the buzzword ""Obamneycare,"" then faced Mitt Romney in a debate and declined to use it. Perry was already perceived as a how'd-he-get-this-far bantamweight. He'll never be perceived as anything else. In a moment of pure media frenzy like this, in the hours before the Perry meltdown clip is repeated more times on cable news than footage of a cat playing a keyboard, we can forget that there's a whole presidential campaign out there. Twenty-four hours ago, the press was distracted by the tribulations and incoherence of another man who won't be president: Herman Cain. His problems ended (temporarily, pending the next accuser's press conference) only 15 minutes into the CNBC debate. Maria Bartiromo tried to ask Cain about his unending sexual harassment scandal. The crowd of Republicans, diehards who'd had to work for their seats, booed her for her audacity. ""You know that shareholders are reluctant to hire a CEO where there are character issues,"" said Bartiromo. ""Why should the American people hire a president if they feel there are character issues?"" ""The American people deserve better than someone being tried in the court of public opinion based on unfounded accusations,"" said Cain. He was drowned out by applause. It didn't even matter that Cain had conflated ""unfounded accusations"" with the facts of his case--a $35,000 harassment settlement, a $45,000 harassment settlement, two accusers who've allowed the media to report their names. Meanwhile, wasn't there supposed to be some sort of economic debate going on? There sure was. With one exception, those exchanges were even less insightful than the tabloid answers. They were at least fair. No candidate was singled out for a grilling on economics. Everyone got the same sorts of specific questions and answered with the same formula: 1) The problem was caused by someone else.
 2) It can be fixed.
 3) Oh, did you want me to say how? Cain, the evening's big escapee, was also its master of meaningless answers. He dodged a question on whether the United States should bail out Italy until he was finally pushed toward a ""no"" answer. ""There's not a lot that the United States can directly do for Italy right now,"" he said, ""because they have--they're really way beyond the point of return that we--we as the United States can save them."" He would expand on that philosophy: ""You don't start solving a problem right in the middle of it."" This was Cain being Cain, but it was a popular sort of answer. Newt Gingrich, who has re-won his reputation as the candidate of ideas by speaking clearly and saying nonsensical things (like ""firing"" Ben Bernanke, who has his job until his term is up), rejected the premise of most questions. He preferred to build a little diorama in which conservative ideas would have been tried first, and obviously worked. Tax cuts work because there were ""lower taxes"" during his speakership. (Taxes were actually higher then than they are now.) There is no war between the 1 percent and 99 percent, because, once upon a time ""Bill Gates drops out of college to found Microsoft."" (Gates was the prep-schooled son of wealthy parents.) Gingrich's points didn't actually hold up, but he enunciated them, and he stayed close to laissez faire doctrine. He survived. Romney survived for the same reason. As he's done in the last few debates, he positioned himself just far enough from the rest of the field to avoid adopting some heartless policy for the general election. He would save Medicare, because it's a program ""for the poor."" He wouldn't flatten taxes, because the middle class has been ""hurt the most."" Lots there for conservatives to dislike, but Romney cut the damage by endorsing their views of why America was in decline. The solution to the crisis was doing ""the opposite"" of Barack Obama. ""The reason we have the housing crises we have is that the federal government played too heavy a role in our markets,"" he said. ""The federal government came in with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Barney Frank and Chris Dodd told banks they had to give loans to people who couldn't afford to pay them back."" That was his pocket history of the financial crisis--caused by liberals, maybe sort of fixable. But he didn't slip up when he said it. As the anti-Romney faction of the party buries another would-be-hero, that's how the Massachusetts heretic survives."	Rick Perry's Campaign: Dead. Cause of Death: Self-Inflicted, Brought on by Amnesia

Since allegations of his past sexual harassment have surfaced, Cain has blamed the media, Rick Perry, the Republican establishment, disgruntled former colleagues, ""a troubled woman,"" the  ""machine that wants to keep a businessman out of the White House"" (the Antichamber of Commerce?) and the Democratic machine (proof of how screwed up this Democratic machine is: It's apparently trying to stop Herman Cain from getting the nomination). Many of Cain's accusations came out at a press conference Tuesday in which he said he didn't have any proof of some of his claims and he didn't have any names to connect to them. Still, he made the accusations anyway. ""I cannot say that it is a conspiracy,"" he said. ""We do not have definitive, factual proof. We can only look at some coincidences to suggest it, that maybe someone is deliberately behind it.""  In this way his defense tactic exactly mirrors the complaints he makes about the charges against him: non-factual and anonymous.  It was just one of the ways in which the improbable front-runner's defense of himself created as many questions as it answered. Let's start with the ""troubled woman."" As Cain took to the podium to defend against the fourth charge of sexual harassment, his lawyer complained Sharon Bialek was trying Cain in the court of public opinion. She didn't take her claim to the authorities but to the cable news shows. That's a fair point, maybe even a smart one. But if making the charges in private and through proper channels lends credibility to the claim, then that only validates the two women who reported Cain to the National Restaurant Association and were paid settlements. Cain repeatedly talked about anonymous charges. Since the first Politico story broke, Cain has made this claim in order to make the whole thing seem like shady whispers. But in the case of the two harassment claims at the NRA, they weren't anonymous at all. The names of the accusers were on the complaints, legal documents, and the checks written to them to settle the charges. One of them, Karen Kraushaar, has now gone public and according to Gloria Borger of CNN has kept all those documents and will provide them. To undermine Bialek, Cain's campaign showed that she had financial trouble and hadn't been able to hold a job. If Cain believes that Bialek's past legal troubles are a window to her character, then it ratifies the idea that Cain's are, too. Also: what if Kraushaar has a benign background with good credit rating and regular dental check-ups? Does this add to the validity of her claim? The strange press conference followed an equally strange email from Cain to his supporters in which he argued that his current troubles were merely the product of a successful business career. ""At some point during a career like this, someone will not like things you do, or how you do it. Someone will complain. That is just the nature of things if you've ever done much in your life."" It is unlikely that Mitt Romney, the other candidate bedeviled by the machine that doesn't want a businessman in the White House, would agree that a handful of sexual harassment claims is as natural a part of a successful business career as the gold watch at retirement. On the other hand, it could be more proof of the skim-milk nature of the Romney enterprise. Cain rises to the polls and the Conspiracy launches in confederation against him. Romney has been at the top of the polls for months, yet the scandal-mongers, whisperers, and shady mumblers are too bored with him to even conjure up an alleged library late fee. As Cain's troubles have mounted, his rival Michele Bachmann has taken subtle advantage of them. ""There will be no surprises,"" she says, if she becomes the GOP nominee. She'll never lose the race because of some October surprise from her background near Election Day. You are in a tough spot when the candidate who spent a portion of the campaign living down her past unpredictability and occasional wacky statements is pointing out your instability. But it's not just Herman Cain's past that might offer surprises. Every time he opens his mouth something surprising happens."	Dickerson: Herman Cain Calls a Press Conference to Proclaim Himself a Victim
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/republicans_considering_tax_increases_no_it_s_just_a_game_of_pretend.html	"One hundred people are ready to save America. See here? They said so in a letter. One hundred members of Congress--60 Democrats, 40 Republicans--signed their names to a document that asked the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction to do something real. Democrats for spending cuts. Republicans for tax hikes. Dogs and cats, living together! ""To succeed,"" they wrote on Wednesday, ""all options for mandatory and discretionary spending and revenues must be on the table. In addition, we know from other bipartisan frameworks that a target of some $4 trillion in deficit reduction is necessary to stabilize our debt as a share of the economy and assure America's fiscal well-being."" It was announced at a bipartisan press conference. The next day, at their caucus meeting, Senate Democrats were gabbing about it, taken aback by the act of a bunch of congressmen agreeing about something. ""Good for them,"" said budget committee Chairman Kent Conrad of North Dakota. ""Huzzah! That's what I say to those 100. They're patriots."" Give the letter a quick once-over and it's like watching hundreds of enslaved soldiers stand up and yell, ""I am Spartacus!"" to blow off a nosy centurion. Anything that distracts from the current mood of failure and schedule of stunt voters--bring it on. We are 19 days from the first deadline of the joint committee, better and forever known as the ""supercommittee."" We're even closer, two weeks, to the government running out of short-term funding. (The short-term patch, the one we passed to avoid a shutdown in May, was necessary because no full-term budget has made it through since April 2009.) When we're this close to two Armageddons, what does all the ""grand bargain"" talk mean? It behooves a lot of people in Congress to talk about a ""grand bargain"" right before they rule it out. That's progress! There's a robust fatigue and panic wearing down the resistance of people who have pledged never to raise taxes. They've grown slightly embarrassed about defending themselves. But only slightly. Look closer at what the Republicans in the supercommittee are saying, and what even the brave 40 Republicans of the Patriotic 100 are saying. They're as wedded as ever to tax cuts and low rates. The Republicans who put their names on that letter didn't say they were endorsing tax hikes. ""I specifically asked about that in the meeting,"" said Rep. Lee Terry, a conservative Republican from Nebraska who has never voted for tax increases. ""I said, does this commit me to raising taxes? And Stephen LaTourette (of Ohio, one of the brains behind the letter) said, 'No. This just says revenues.' That could mean spectrum fees, or something like that. It doesn't commit me to raising taxes."" Spectrum fees; well, that's something. If the supercommittee tackles them, it's bucking the cable industry and dissing two lobbyists who used to be members of Congress, Steve Largent and Gordon Smith. But compare the money you could raise from that with the revenue you could raise from--to pick an idea completely at random--letting the top-rate Bush tax cuts expire. It's a difference between perhaps $16 billion (that would be the spectrum fees) and perhaps $700 billion (that would be the expiration of the tax cuts). A real breakthrough in debt negotiations would look something like that. Democrats have offered to give away trillions in discretionary spending cuts and entitlement cuts in exchange for $1.3 trillion in tax revenue, for overall savings of $4.1 trillion. That's what it sounded like the Hardy 100 were ready to buy. The most concrete Republican offer so far: Plenty of cuts, and only $40 billion in real revenue increases. So what do the doubting Republicans actually want? Rep. Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican with spotless conservative cred, signed on to the letter, too. He meant it as a suggestion: Guys, be serious and do tax reform. ""I believe we need to get rid of the underbrush,"" he said. ""Some of these loopholes. The best way to do that it with a tax code that's half an inch deep and miles and miles wide. We want clarity in it, and we want equity."" What kind of equity? ""It galls me when I hear about a major corporation or a very wealthy individual not paying taxes,"" he said. ""But at the same time, when you hear about 50 percent of the population not paying taxes, that galls me also."" This really is an evolution in how Republicans think about taxes. Strike that: Not in how they think about them, but in how they talk about them. With the year they're having, and especially after the debt-limit brinkmanship that they won on points but lost on PR, Republicans don't want to make it look like they're inflexible on taxes. (Surely, this was part of the reason that Speaker John Boehner whiffed a question this week about whether Grover Norquist was ""good for his caucus."") How to stay frosty on taxes without sounding inflexible? Talk about tax reform. That's what Herman Cain and Rick Perry have been doing in the primary states. It's what the supercommittee's Republican diehards are doing, too. Sen. Pat Toomey, the freshman Republican from Pennsylvania, has used all of his time on the dais to talk up tax reform. Rep. Dave Camp, the Ways and Means Committee chairman who actually guards one of the gates to tax reform, has proposed a corporate tax reform that would lower that tax rate, now at 35 percent, and end taxes on foreign profits. Why is it so hard to find revenue this way? The Bush tax rates are set to expire at the end of 2012. That's what happens if no one does anything, which is always a safe assumption in Washington. It's also an assumption that allows you to come up with a tax reform plan in which more revenue starts rolling in right away. But Republicans don't make that assumption. In fact, they assume the opposite. ""I always work on the assumption that they'll be permanent,"" explained Terry, referring to the tax cuts. ""If we do tax reform, the new bracket would assume those savings."" That's not the only problem in the Great Grand Bargain hunt. It's just the most intractable. Republicans are changing how they talk about taxes. Long gone are the days when they could look intractable and get away with it. That's progress, sort of. It's not the progress that gets us closer to a deal."	When Republicans Say They Would Consider Tax Increases, They're Just Pretending
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/herman_cain_sexual_harassment_charges_the_three_arguments_republ.html	"Rep. Steve King represents the conservative bluffs of western and northwestern Iowa. He has personally shepherded the Republican Party's would-be presidents around his state. He hasn't endorsed any of them yet, but he sees Herman Cain fighting off a scandal, and it gets his blood pumping hot. ""Where's the Anita Hill?"" he said. ""This is an Anita Hill issue, and from what I see, without substance, this shouldn't have been a story."" King is not the only conservative saying this. Three days into a scandal that's collecting mass and speed like some fast-rolling lava floe, a third woman and a Republican consultant have emerged with more allegations of ""very uncomfortable"" 1990s-era Cain harassment. Yet Republicans are not abandoning Cain. The people who stand to gain if Cain implodes are mostly quiet about the stories. The rest of the conservative movement has risen up in anger at the media for even covering this stuff. On Wednesday, as Cain bounced from suburban Virginia to Capitol Hill, dodging TV cameras and pissed-off reporters, it was basically impossible to find a Republican who wanted to pile on. As of Wednesday there are three main arguments being mounted in Cain's defense. Let's count them down, from flimsiest to Most Likely To Succeed. Argument No. 1: Why, This Is All Just Racist Cain has had an on-again, off-again relationship with the ""race card."" He hates it, and he thinks no one should use it. Months ago, I was in a tiny scrum with Cain (boy, those days are over) when a British reporter wanted to know whether the mostly white GOP could ever support him. ""Am I black?"" joked Cain. He couldn't care less! But when Cain has been in trouble, he's searched under the couch cushions to find the card, brush it off, and shove it in the other guy's face. After Cain joked that legislation should top out at three pages, and Jon Stewart made fun of this, Sean Hannity asked the candidate why. ""Because I'm black,"" said Cain. This was after he predicted that he, just like Clarence Thomas, could be the victim of a ""high-tech lynching."" On Fox News on Tuesday, Charles Krauthammer asked Cain if race had anything to do with this story. ""I believe the answer is yes,"" he said. The next day, his campaign sent out a fundraising update to supporters, quoting Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, who'd been defending Cain on the grounds of left-wing racism. The Super PAC Americans for Herman Cain gave up altogether on subtlety and titled one of its fundraising e-mails: ""First Clarence Thomas, Now Herman Cain."" To understand this defense, you have to understand something about conservatives: They think Democrats use it all the time. Why shouldn't Cain spit it right back at them? It's only fair. And then they think harder on it, and realize that they hate it when Democrats do this. After the Washington Post's conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin saw Cain talk to Krauthammer, she attacked ""Cain's noxious racial politics."" Ron Christie, an African-American Republican strategist who materializes on cable news in times like these, describes just how icky it feels. ""On the one hand, some of the commentary (think Karen Finney) has been vitriolic because Cain is black and a conservative,"" he said, referring to one of the spats in the cableverse. ""As to the nature of the allegations themselves? Hard to say. I don't like the race card being played by the left or the right, and I think both sides have tried to do so to exploit a perceived political advantage."" Effectiveness level: Risky, with high chance of backfire. Argument No. 2: You Can't Trust the Liberal Media On Wednesday afternoon, Cain did a quick Q&A with Republican members of Congress working on health care. Rep. Michael Burgess, who called the meeting, ribbed the press for showing up with questions about the scandal: ""I have every belief you're going to look into this as carefully as you looked into President Obama's college grades."" After the meeting, the Republicans were unanimous: Cain should ignore the scandal and keep talking like this. ""He was on message, and that's as it should be,"" said Rep. Andy Harris, a freshman from Maryland. ""What we ought to be concentrating on is not wasting that time paying attention to issues other than the economy and how we're going to get out of this mess we're in."" That's what Newt Gingrich is saying, too. Shame on the media for asking about this! ""He's out there trying to help a country that's in desperate trouble,"" Gingrich said. ""And he has gotten more coverage over the last few days over gossip."" If Gingrich had wanted to, he could have looked at some right-wing blogs, which have taken this ball and spiked it. (Speaking of which: Did you know that one of the Politico reporters behind the scoop is sort of vaguely connected to George Soros?) It's fun, and it's familiar, but how does it help Cain? This isn't a case of a media outlet formulating a story out of nothing. This was a story that multiple organizations had heard inklings about, that Politico did the work on, and that its reporters backed up with primary documents. Effectiveness level: Limited, because the media isn't the problem. Argument No. 3: There's No Such Thing as Sexual Harassment This one took a while to come out. It's a hard conversation to start. Conservatives don't like to admit it. But hell, time to say it: They just don't think that the stuff Cain was accused of was all that bad. Sexual harassment claims are overblown. When he says the charges are false, they believe him. The lawyer and pundit Kurt Schlichter summed it up in a widely circulated op-ed: ""In the world of sexual-harassment law, the accusations are bad enough."" As they gripped and grabbed with Cain on Wednesday, Republicans said the same thing. Maybe the women in question were a little bit nutty, or a little bit--hey, you know the rest. ""It's unfortunate,"" said Rep. Glenn Thompson after the health care meeting. ""But during campaign time there are certain individuals who will raise half-truths and mis-portray things. Sometimes they do that because they're desperate in their own campaigns. I guess I'm not surprised this type of thing is brought forward."" Steve King, among Cain's most vocal defenders, took me back to his days running his construction company and working with the Iowa Land Improvement Contractors' Association. Sexual harassment training was a pain, an insult. After he and colleagues had to watch a 45-minute how-not-to video, he stood up and said, ""I am insulted that you would burn up our time with something that could be replaced by the two words 'common courtesy.'"" The only woman in the room, he said, applauded. ""It's a terrible concept,"" said King, ""to define an action by the perception of the perceived victim."" Let's say that Cain has bungled away the nondisclosure agreements that the National Restaurant Association put away in the 1990s. The women in question come out and speak. At that point it'll be their word against his. All those doubts about the very idea of sexual harassment settlements, all those doubts about whether this stuff can be trusted--that will come in handy. Effectiveness level: It's the best he's got."

Now he has a campaign in one. Responding to reports about his history of sexual harassment claims, he has offered conflicting and confusing stories. The candidate known for his simplicity has fallen into lawyerly hairsplitting. Conservatives almost immediately denounced the story as a ""high-tech lynching,"" the same phrase Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas (Cain's model) used to characterize his treatment during his 1991 confirmation hearings. The expression immediately signals to partisans which setting to choose for their outrage dial. All the same, the characterization is unfair to Thomas and lets Cain off the hook. Leave aside questions of whether the phrase ""high-tech lynching"" is accurate or appropriate. For our purposes, the relevant details are these: Thomas was hit with surprise allegations about sexual harassment in the middle of his confirmation hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. His former colleague Anita Hill's allegations were new, explosive, and adjudicated by a committee unequipped for the task. It all happened under the bright lights of the hearing room, where Thomas--not a public figure or politician--had to defend himself in the middle of the circus. The charges against Cain were handled in a far more professional manner. While Cain was chief executive of the National Restaurant Association, in at least two cases, according to Politico's reporting and that of other news organizations, women came forward with complaints. Cain's issue was adjudicated by lawyers and a human-resources department whose purpose, in part, is to handle these kinds of issues (if for no other reason than after the Thomas hearings every organization updated its HR policies on sexual harassment). Politics, presumably, were not involved. Hill's story appeared in the paper, catching Thomas off guard. Cain was given 10 days  to respond to questions about the matter before it was made public. Politico wasn't fishing--tell us anything wrong you've ever done--it was asking questions about a specific legal matter. Unlike Thomas, Cain wasn't responding to a new accusation; he was being asked for his position on an issue that had already been investigated and resolved. Checks had been cut, even. Taking Cain at his word, perhaps he was only vaguely familiar with the issue when he was first asked about it. But he has a quick memory. In the 24 hours after the Politico story was published, he had a series of detailed recollections. Is this the most important issue in the campaign? Obviously not. But it is relevant, particularly for a candidate who asks to be judged based on his performance in the private sector. As a political matter, it's also crucial to Republicans that candidates get a thorough vetting before the general election. No less than Sarah Palin has said so. If only President Obama had gotten this kind of teeth-cleaning! Tuesday at a National Journal forum, Rick Santorum's campaign manager said Cain's ""answers changed during the day,"" as he sought to explain the harassment question, and he called on the Cain campaign to be ""forthcoming so that you are vetted."" In the Clarence Thomas matter, it was clear from the way the Hill allegations surfaced--in the middle of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing--that they were not a part of the regular process. The same can't be said for a presidential campaign. Cain's knee-jerk defenders act as if this kind of story is sullying the meticulous theater of reason known as a Presidential Campaign. By the standard of presidential campaigns, and this one in particular, it's pretty natural for candidates to have to face wacky improvised explosions. George W. Bush had to defend the alleged use of subliminal words in his advertising, and a 24-year-old DUI arrest. John McCain tried to put Obama on the hook as a sexist for using the phrase ""lipstick on a pig."" Oh, and this campaign one of the former front-runners raised questions about the president's citizenship. Michele Bachmann was asked at a debate about submitting to her husband if she were president, based on some remarks she'd made years earlier. It was a gotcha question founded, one could argue, on a look-at-these-crazy-Christians reading of the passage she was citing. Cain is being treated no less roughly than Cain treated others. When Rick Perry enjoyed his moment in the beating barrel over a story about a racist word written on a rock at a family hunting camp, Cain was the first rival to criticize him (and Cain, in turn, was criticized for his criticism). That Perry story wasn't as solid as the one about Cain that he's now denouncing, and over which conservatives are displaying such umbrage. Thomas was treated differently than nominees that had come before  him (except maybe John Tower). Cain has not been. Rather, he is simply undergoing a process known as ""running for president."" Yes, a presidential campaign  is often a freak show. That's true, and I will join you in denouncing the modern campaign freak show (I am tut-tutting as I type this, which ain't easy). But my point is not the obvious one that the freak show is deplorable. It's that the freak show is not going away. Every president faces it once he gets in office. Cain in most ways benefits from the freak show--the emphasis on televised debates and well-turned one-liners. Poor Rick Santorum is dragging his can through all of Iowa's 99 counties and he's getting nowhere. When Cain puts a foot wrong, his supporters largely let him off the hook, whereas other candidates go into free-fall in the polls. So how did Cain handle the freak show? Not well at all. Though he'd been given time, Cain gave incomplete and misleading answers to Politico. Once the story became public, Cain's answers were insufficient and seemed to conflict. In the morning at the National Press Club he didn't know if there had been a settlement. By the afternoon he knew that there had been. When asked about the evolution, he sounded almost Clintonian. ""I was aware an agreement was reached,"" he said. ""The word settlement versus the word agreement--you know, I'm not sure what they called it."" The good news for Cain is that calling something a ""high-tech lynching"" is actually very helpful. Conservative voters feel like they've seen this movie before. They feel Thomas was unfairly treated, and regardless of whether the analogy is apt, they imagine Cain is being similarly unfairly treated.  They also see recent examples to discount what the mainstream media say in the Rick Perry hunting camp story or the investigation into Sen. Marco Rubio's family history. Distrust of the media, plus the Cain cushion, suggest that while this is a frenzy in Washington, it won't immediately harm him where the voting takes place. The Des Moines Register ratified this notion when it called those who had said they preferred Cain in their recent poll. None said they were jumping ship. And the Cain campaign said it had one of its best online fundraising days when the story hit. This may be another instance, for Cain at least, of a crisis turning into an opportunity."	Why the Herman Cain Sexual Harassment Story Is Different From the Clarence Thomas Sexual Harassment Story

David Letterman has joked, ""Republican Presidential candidate Jon Huntsman is fluent in Chinese. ... The last Republican president wasn't even fluent in English."" A Saturday Night Live spoof of the Republican presidential debates portrayed Huntsman drifting into a stereotyped version of Chinglish while answering questions about his Chinese fluency. Media reports on the Republican candidates simply assert as a fact that Huntsman is ""fluent in Mandarin""--a statement repeated by NPR, the New York Times, CNN, the Boston Herald, the Economist, Esquire, and New Hampshire's ABC station, among many others. Huntsman's ads emphasize that he is ""Fluent in Mandarin Chinese,"" and his website declares (in its Interactive Timeline) that he became ""fluent in Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Hokkien"" in 1980. Even the Obama White House declared that ""Huntsman speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese."" But is Jon Huntsman really fluent in Chinese? The answer seems to be no. When asked on the Colbert Report to speak Chinese, Huntsman spoke one sentence and then ""translated"" his words as ""I just said you ought to consider being my running mate for vice president."" The studio audience roared in approval. Yet in reality, Huntsman's mangled Chinese would translate as: ""I really want you to do my vice-America president."" In this brief and simple sentence, Huntsman managed to (incorrectly) insert the word America in the middle of the Chinese word for vice president (fu-zong-tong); made a less-than-ideal choice of verbs; and combined my and American vice president in a way that implies (in Chinese) that Huntsman possesses his own personal vice president of the United States. On Piers Morgan Tonight, Piers Morgan asked Huntsman to speak in Mandarin, and then immediately proclaimed what he heard as ""spectacularly good"" despite not understanding any of it. (As Huntsman himself responded, ""How do you know?"") A fair translation of Huntsman's Chinese response to Piers Morgan would be: ""Whatever I say, you don't, you won't know that much, you will not be so able to understand. I am Mr. Jon Huntsman. I want to be the up-to-next American president."" Huntsman himself ""translated"" the first sentence of this as ""Whatever I say, you'll have no idea what it is."" This isn't a particularly complicated sentence, yet Huntsman struggled to express it, making three halting attempts and never quite getting it right. His attempt to say ""next"" president (in Chinese, xia-yi-jie) became the strange xia-lai-de. (I could understand Huntsman only because I knew what he was going to say, but none of the Beijing individuals I checked with could understand this sentence even on repeated listens.) Probably the biggest goof in this sentence was Huntsman's self-introduction, ""I am Mr. Jon Huntsman."" It is even more bizarre to refer to oneself as ""Mr."" in Chinese than in English because of the Chinese cultural emphasis on humility. For example, Americans respond to compliments with ""Thank you"" while Chinese will typically answer ""Nali, nali""--literally, ""Where, where?"" (A joke I've heard in China is that Americans claim to ""speak"" Chinese no matter how few words they understand, while Chinese claim to be unable to speak English no matter how many words they understand.) Calling oneself ""Mr."" in Chinese sounds as jarring as calling oneself ""the esteemed Mr."" in English. These mistakes are all the more puzzling because Huntsman spoke only a few sentences total, was given the opportunity to say anything he wanted, and knew ahead of time that his interviewers often ask him to speak in Mandarin. Considering that he could easily prepare (and memorize) a witty comment in Chinese, it is strange that he makes mistakes at all. To reverse the situation, if a foreigner who claimed fluency in English was given the opportunity to say anything in English, and responded (after having time to prepare) by talking about ""vice-America presidents,"" we probably would not be impressed. It is difficult to evaluate Huntsman's Chinese-speaking ability because he so rarely speaks more than a brief sentence or two and never says anything particularly difficult. (When Piers Morgan gave him free rein to say anything he wanted, Huntsman responded with the kind of basic sentences one learns in first-year Chinese class, such as stating his name and saying that the other person doesn't understand him.) An NPR report describing Huntsman's appearance on Colbert referred to his ""seldom demonstrated"" Chinese ability, and a blogger complained that ""his Mandarin is pretty damn hard to scrutinize"" because Huntsman has rarely said much. Strong evidence of Huntsman's limited Chinese ability might be the fact that, when he spoke to Chinese audiences and Chinese media as ambassador, he did so in English. In a videotaped message to the Chinese public congratulating the PRC on the 60th anniversary of its founding, Huntsman spoke entirely in English, even though it's hard to imagine any English-language audience for this message. (This one-minute statement should have been easy to deliver in Chinese, either memorized or read from a teleprompter.) Likewise, a television clip of Huntsman at Beijing's Tsinghua University shows him talking in English. At a speech to Alibaba employees, Huntsman spoke for about a minute in extremely simple Chinese (he receives extensive applause for stating that his host ""is very young, very handsome, very smart, and very rich"") before switching to English for the remaining 40 minutes of the talk. Interestingly, right before switching to English, Huntsman seems to admit his lack of fluency--he tells the audience that he will use English because ""people might not quite understand"" his Chinese. During a 10-minute interview on the Chinese program Yang Lan One on One, Huntsman switched into Chinese only twice, for a total of five words. While speaking about his youngest daughter, Huntsman added the Chinese words my daughter, and when asked about running for president, he added ""haven't decided yet."" It's not clear why he switched into Chinese for this particular handful of words unless this was all he felt comfortable saying. During a CCTV program on China's high-speed rail, Huntsman spoke in English except for a sentence announcing (in Mandarin) that America should learn more from China. Even here, however, Huntsman got his word order mixed up. At the Faith and Freedom Conference, Huntsman spoke one introductory sentence in Chinese: ""Thank you for giving me this very good opportunity to speak with other people."" Here, too, the Chinese rings false. For one thing, in Chinese, speakers don't address an audience as ""other people""--this sentence is something a prisoner might say after being released from solitary confinement. The fact that Huntsman tends to speak only a handful of sentences in Chinese at a time makes it hard to judge his speaking ability, especially since anyone, fluent or not, can memorize a few sentences phonetically. I've seen Western businesspeople with minimal Chinese ability make seemingly fluent business pitches to potential Chinese clients because they memorize and practice the pitch. Heck, I've even seen Shaq speak Chinese in a commercial for a basketball exhibition. In searching for videos of Huntsman speaking Chinese, multiple clips (here and here) showed him making the exact same stock statement in Chinese--""Right now, America's only got one governor who can speak Chinese, and that would be me."" He delivers this line well (if slowly), but it appears to be a canned line he used with Chinese audiences. He also likes to get laughs by referring to himself with the slang term for ""old man,"" but neither of these stock phrases are evidence of fluency. The final minute of this long (and otherwise English-language) interview on China's Phoenix Television is a rare instance of Huntsman speaking at length in Chinese. To his credit, only Huntsman's final sentence is incomprehensible to Mandarin speakers. Even when he speaks correctly, however, Huntsman's vocabulary is limited, similar to a second-year student in Chinese. He uses the same handful of simple words again and again, telling us, for example, that Chinese people want to know ""what kind of country,"" ""what kind of history,"" and ""what kind of culture"" America has. Huntsman's best clip is this one, also from Phoenix Television. Although Huntsman spoke entirely in English during the official sit-down interview, Phoenix Television added a few clips of Huntsman on an airplane, speaking informally in Chinese about his love for motorcycles and Chinese food. Huntsman asks how to say certain words (""How do you say 'Harley' motorcycles in Chinese?"") and he repeatedly uses the same limited vocabulary, for example, the phrase you yi-si (""interesting"" or ""meaningful"") to describe Harleys and also (a couple sentences later) to describe the experience of riding them. Nevertheless, he sounds fluid and comfortable. Considering Huntsman's moderate Chinese speaking ability, the better question may be why American media have been so eager to gush praise upon a skill it cannot evaluate. NPR says that Huntsman's appearance on the Colbert Report (where he asked Colbert to ""do my vice-America president"") ""did win some points for fluency""; Colbert pronounced it ""terrifying."" New York magazine calls the seven-second clip of Huntsman at the Faith and Freedom Conference ""a brief but impressive reminder of his fluency in two languages, or two more than Sarah Palin."" Three hundred years ago, a European who called himself George Psalmanazar succeeded in a massive hoax, convincing much of Europe that he was a converted heathen from the (then mysterious) island of Taiwan. Psalmanazar invented outrageous stories about Taiwan (nobles lived underground; husbands ate adulterous wives; people traveled on the trunks of elephants), and he even created an imaginary ""Formosan"" language. Psalmanazar's book went through multiple editions, his fake Formosan language was included in language books for decades, and Psalmanazar was even invited to speak about his imaginary language at the Royal Society. Obviously, Jon Huntsman is no Psalmanazar. Huntsman does speak some Chinese, and he was deeply involved in policy while ambassador to China. But the journalists anointing him as ""fluent,"" ""impressive,"" and ""spectacularly good"" based on a few sentences they don't understand would probably be equally impressed and amazed at the imaginary languages of George Psalmanazar. Next time, rather than asking Huntsman to say whatever he feels like in Chinese, reporters should test his actual language skills by giving him a China policy question--say, about China's currency--and ask him to answer in Chinese."

These advisers, who had helped Gov. Rick Scott win a rough-and-tumble race in Florida, were supposed to know how to play nasty. They would surely pummel Romney because time is short, no one has been able to lay a glove on him, and there is such ample opportunity. That might happen someday. But if the new Perry team is smart (and it is), it's not going to go after Romney before repairing Perry's image first. Perry's problem is within the Tea Party. In a CBS poll five weeks ago, 30 percent of those affiliated with the Tea Party said they supported Perry. Now only 7 percent do. That number is not going to be improved by exposing the wires in Romney's control panel.  Those voters are not looking at Romney. They are looking for the best candidate to carry their values forward. Right now that candidate is Herman Cain. OK: So Perry's new team of vicious junkyard dogs will go after Cain, right? (Please, let's have some fighting here, because we're all bored!) No, they're not going to go after Cain either. That's not going to win hearts back. To replace Cain, Perry will have to do two things: Let voters come to the conclusion Cain is wonderful but not ready to be president, and rebuild Perry as the alternative once voters are ready for a second look at him. Cain is sustained by his outsider status, which covers a multitude of sins. He is also very appealing. But as Dan Balz reported, in a focus group in Cincinnati, pollster Peter Hart identified the ultimate weakness for Cain: Though the respondents were over-the-moon for him, his support hit a brick wall when they started thinking about him in the Oval Office. In the 2008 Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton and her campaign tried to take down Barack Obama by saying it was ""time to pick a president."" In other words: End your dalliance with the person who makes you feel good and start thinking about who has the attributes necessary to handle the job. That didn't work for her, but the non-Cain candidates hope a version of that same mindset will eventually kick in and give voters second thoughts about Cain. When that moment comes, a candidate like Perry has to be ready. Right now he's got some work to do. In that same focus group, when attendees were asked to compare Perry to a character from fifth grade, they said ""bully."" (If only they'd meant it the way Teddy Roosevelt did.) To repair his image, Perry has to remind voters why they liked him in the first place. He is a committed Christian, and he has a record he can point to in Texas that shows commitment to conservative principles. Yes, he has blemishes--but so do all the candidates. According to NBC's Carrie Dann, when Perry was able to explain his record on immigration to a Tea Party voter in New Hampshire on Friday, he made the sale. Now he just needs to repeat that. Negative ads will only get in the way, which is why Perry is running positive spots so far. This isn't to say that Perry won't keep up the ""Mitt is a flip-flopper"" attack. That would be malpractice. And Romney is helping. This week he was accused of flip-flopping on his support for the flat tax. It was a bogus charge. As if to fill the vacuum of fresh flip-flopping material, he wiggled and waffled on his support for Ohio's Issue 2. He said he was unfamiliar and didn't want to get involved, though he had previously offered support, which he then renewed a day after he said he wouldn't get involved. (The most implausible moment of this embarrassing series of events was when Romney said he wasn't familiar with the local issue. Debate Boy, who has aced nearly every question in the forums and who on the stump asks detailed questions about Iowa corn farming and cattle feedlots, was fuzzy on the deets? If he says so.) Perry has another thing going for him. Four-fifths of GOP voters say they are still undecided in their choice for president. At the same point in 2007, that number was about the same. Rudy Giuliani dropped like a rock from front-runner, Huckabee rose and McCain re-emerged from the back of the pack. A lot can still happen.  Perry just has to hope that he's in a position to take advantage when the time comes."	"Why Rick Perry Won't Attack Mitt Romney or Any Other Candidates Anytime Soon

""For the first time in history,"" said the president, ""our country's AAA credit rating would be downgraded, leaving investors around the world to wonder whether the United States is still a good bet. Interest rates would skyrocket on credit cards, mortgages, and car loans, which amounts to a huge tax hike on the American people."" The deal got done, zipped through Congress with two quick, emotional votes, then zoomed over to the president's desk. And then ... well, S&P downgraded America's AAA rating anyway. That was the first unexpected twist, and it roiled markets and Washington for a week. It was followed by the second twist: None of that bad stuff the president mentioned ended up happening. How could a saga that captured Washington for 11 weeks have faded so quickly? Why don't the president's enemies even talk about it as much as they used to? It's pretty simple. America lucked out and avoided any of the really negative side effects because investors, in their panic, didn't abandon U.S. bonds. The Dow Jones and S&P indexes are higher now than they were before the downgrade. Congress, worn to the ragged edge of sanity by the debt fight, moved on. Obama's Republican rivals found other stuff to talk about. Somehow, we dodged buckshot that was fired from three paces away. It's impressive--and it doesn't please investors or debt hawks at all. Actually, no: It's another disaster. ""All of us budget wonks were ready to say 'See! We told you!'"" says Steve Bell, a former trader and current fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He remembers sharing a stage with Pete Peterson, the original debt Cassandra, and the two of them saying ""Thank goodness!"" when they heard about the downgrade. Did he really hope for post-downgrade chaos? ""This is why they call economics the dismal science,"" he says. ""I wish we'd had some! I know that now, more than ever, we need external panic to get anything done about the debt."" We didn't get that. Right before the downgrade, interest on 30-year fixed rates was at 4.42 percent. It's at 4.22 percent now. The interest on 10-year Treasuries, then at 2.97 percent, is down to 2.22 percent. None of the things that were supposed to get worse after a downgrade actually got any worse. We think we know why. Our salvation come in the form of desperation and gimmicks from the investors who might have abandoned our bonds. ""We got the downgrade, and everybody puked,"" explains David Ader, head of government strategy at the Connecticut-based CRT Capital. ""When you're worried, you hold on to dollar reserves. After the downgrade, there was a sell-off in the stock market, because Treasuries were a better bet."" In other words, so what if the U.S. Treasury bond that had been downgraded by only one rating agency? It was still one of the safest bets in the world; S&P was just one agency. The apocalypse never happened, and three months later, Americans are experiencing no short-term pain from the downgrade. That's what has Steve Bell so worried. The fear of a downgrade has slipped away. He's often called to Capitol Hill to testify about what will happen if America doesn't tackle its long-term debt. That was the issue with the downgrade; that what S&P warned about in its memo on the decision. But members of Congress were told to expect a disaster, and they didn't get it. ""I hear from fairly solid people,"" says Bell, ""who say, 'Boy, the fact that nothing happened doesn't help your cause, does it?' I say, 'No shit."" The political class, at least as Bell encounters it, has been lulled a bit by the lack of catastrophes. It forgets that Moody's and Fitch could still downgrade the United States, and that Moody's has been nice and transparent with its threat. One rating agency can't do much to the reserve currency's strength. Two could, though. That's because there are an untold number of portfolios with requirements that require a certain amount of AAA bonds on the pile. Some of them will be forced to move the bonds if a majority of ratings agencies downgrades Treasuries. Even when you consider that, we're lucky. Some portfolios, including a lot of state pensions, require a certain rating level for most bonds they hold, but waive that requirement for Treasury bonds. That means the apocalypse could be put off even further, which is why the debt hawks are so worried. No crisis for Congress to panic about; no leverage for them to pass some combination of tax hikes and entitlement cuts. That was exactly what S&P wanted, and it's what Moody's implies that it wants as it puts America's bond rating on notice. When Obama warned of a Mad Max nightmare world of higher interest rates and falling dollars, he was trying to gin up support for a ""grand bargain."" He had the pundit class behind him, led by Tom Friedman and his Mary Poppins bag of mixed metaphors. The world was about to collapse! If we don't go big, the sky comes tumbling down! The sky stayed where it was, so Congress moved even further away from something ""grand."" This week, Democrats floated the idea of a $3 trillion supercommittee package, a combo of tax hikes and Medicare cuts, and Majority Leader John Boehner kicked it out of bounds: ""I do think it's time for everyone to get serious about this."" This is the problem for deficit hawks: Too many members of Congress are convinced that the Treasury and the president called wolf. They think they were misled by the hopscotching ""deadlines"" set by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, by which the government wouldn't be able to pay bills. They don't know what to make of how the downgrade happened, and all they got was another zinger for some American Crossroads campaign ads. That's moved Republicans back to zero, unwilling to revisit the issue of tax hikes, and convinced that they can reverse any cuts to defense even if the supercommittee fails them and $500 billion of defense spending is sequestered. The defense industry can prove how a crisis will hurt its bottom line. The Treasury? S&P? Moody's? Not anymore."

He suggested abortion was a personal choice, which won him the dreaded flip-flopper label. At one point or another just one of these qualities or positions has been declared a fatal vulnerability for Republican candidates, from Haley Barbour to Mitt Romney. Herman Cain has all of them. Cain is no longer flavor of the week--he's a regular menu item. He's popular, we know that. And now, after several weeks of attacks, gaffes, and scrutiny, he has shown endurance. Based on the collapse of the Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry campaigns, you might expect Cain's various rough moments would cause a drop in the polls. They haven't. If anything, he's increased in popularity, which shows just how suspicious voters are of the political class and how much they're willing to put up with someone who isn't a member of it. Cain leads in both the national polls and state measurements. A CBS News poll found 25 percent of Republican voters nationwide preferred him to the 21 percent for Romney. In Ohio, the Quinnipiac poll found Cain leading Romney 28 percent to 23 percent among GOP voters. CNN polls show Cain tied with Romney in Iowa and South Carolina and trailing him in Florida. The Gallup poll shows that--unlike Perry, whose appeal soured the more voters got to know him--Cain's approval rating and intensity score among Republicans has gone up along with his name identification. What allows Cain to sustain? (Besides easy rhymes?) He's not from Washington. It comes up time and again in conversations with his supporters. Polls show his strength is with Tea Party voters who are the most anti-Washington in the electorate. His ""outsider"" status--unharmed by stints as a chairman of the Kansas City Federal Reserve or as head of the national restaurant lobby--is also shielding him from criticism. Anyone who attacks his 9-9-9 plan is part of the permanent political class--the people who got us into this mess--trying to protect their advantage. Not being a politician also gives Cain a big gaffe cushion. His ""joke"" about an electrified border fence, his flirtation with trading hostages for Guantanamo Bay detainees, and his momentary moderation over whether abortion is a choice do not seem to have hurt him yet. Instead, they're seen as proof that he's not a polished pro like Romney. When Romney and Perry go after each other, Cain benefits by not being a bickering politician. That's all charming, but with a party so determined to beat President Obama, and with such good chances to do so, can this Cain flirtation blossom into something real? Won't people start to focus on electability and turn to Romney? The answer (at least as Cain's people see it): Electability may not be the liability the political elites might think. And actually, the political elites don't think Cain has an electability problem: 74 percent of Republican insiders in a recent Huffington Post poll think Cain can beat Obama. (Danger Herman: When insiders validate an outsider strategy you should be nervous.) For some Cain supporters the electability argument actually works in Cain's favor, not for Romney. ""We need an anti-Obama this time around,"" says Jeffrey Jorgensen, the chairman of the Pottawattamie County (Iowa) Republican Party. ""Gov. Romney would be a better candidate than John McCain or Bob Dole and a better president than George Herbert Walker Bush, but we need an anti-Obama this time, and governor Romney is not that candidate."" Perhaps the thickest part of the cushion for Cain is that his conservative voters don't have anywhere else to go. Michele Bachmann was eclipsed by Perry. That isn't going to happen to Cain. There aren't any eclipsing figures left. Gingrich is having a slight burble of resurgence but he's unlikely to become the new flavor; one of the qualities of being a flavor of the month is that people don't know much about you. Gingrich, for better or worse, is the best known of the bunch. Perry has a long uphill slog to regain what Cain took from him, which will be hard to do in part because Cain is more appealing to voters. Tea Party support may be keeping Cain aloft, but to grow and actually pose a threat to Mitt Romney he's going to have to find a way to appeal to more moderate GOP voters. The really exciting thing about the Cain campaign is that while on the one hand he is defying gravity, the candidate and his staff are constantly ordering in more anvils. Cain is running to replace a president who was criticized for having no experience, but Cain himself practically brags about how little knowledge he has with the issues of the day, saying he'll rely on advisers and smart people. As the clock ticks toward the start of the voting season Cain will spend this Friday and Saturday in the electorally meaningless Alabama. In keeping with the ""The More Unconventional the Better"" theme, the campaign put out a video of the campaign chief of staff Mark Block making a pitch for Cain while enjoying a cigarette and blowing the smoke into the camera. It was like nothing anyone had ever seen before. Sort of like the Cain campaign. Watch: Slate V's Parody of Herman Cain's Strange Smoking Ad"	"Why The Herman Cain Boomlet May Actually Last

Good grief. Isn't the ability to read still a job requirement for a career in journalism? And as last week's inane ""What Do They Want?"" meme morphs into this week's craven ""They Want Your Stuff"" meme, I feel it's time to explain something: Occupy Wall Street may not have laid out all of its demands in a perfectly cogent one-sentence bumper sticker for you, Mr. Pundit, but it knows precisely what it doesn't want. It doesn't want you. What the movement clearly doesn't want is to have to explain itself through corporate television. To which I answer, Hallelujah. You can't talk down to a movement that won't talk back to you. I don't purport to speak for anyone but myself here, although I spent time this weekend at Occupy Wall Street and my husband spent much of last week adding his voice to the protesters there. I saw an incredible array of people that defy any simple demographic characterization and a broad range of signs that made--imagine!--more than a single point. But if I may hazard an opinion, it would be this: One of the most fatuous themes of mainstream OWS coverage is the endless loop of media bafflement at this movement that doesn't have a message. Here's CNN's Erin Burnett in a classic put-down of the OWS' refusal to tailor its message to her. It takes a walloping amount of willful cluelessness to look at a mass of people holding up signs and claim that they have no message. Occupy Wall Street is not a movement without a message. It's a movement that has wisely shunned the one-note, pre-chewed, simple-minded messaging required for cable television as it now exists. It's a movement that feels no need to explain anything to the powers that be, although it is deftly changing the way we explain ourselves to one another. Think, for just a moment, about the irony. We are the most media-saturated 24-hour-cable-soaked culture in the world, and yet around the country, on Facebook and at protests, people are holding up cardboard signs, the way protesters in ancient Sumeria might have done when demonstrating against a rise in the price of figs. And why is that? Because they very wisely don't trust television cameras and microphones to get it right anymore. Because a media constructed around the illusion of false equivalencies, screaming pundits, and manufactured crises fails to capture who we are and what we value. For the past several years, while the mainstream media was dutifully reporting on all things Kardashian or (more recently) a wholly manufactured debt-ceiling crisis, ordinary people were losing their health care, their homes, their jobs, and their savings. Those people have taken that narrative to Facebook and Twitter--just as citizens took to those alternative forms of media throughout the Middle East as part of the Arab Spring. And just to be clear: They aren't holding up signs that say ""I want Bill O'Reilly's stuff."" They aren't holding up signs that say ""I am animated by toxic levels of envy and entitlement."" They are holding up signs that are perfectly and intrinsically clear: They want accountability for the banks that took their money, they want to end corporate control of government. They want their jobs back. They would like to feed their children. They want--wait, no, we want--to be heard by a media that has devoted four mind-numbing years to channeling and interpreting every word uttered by a member of the Palin family while ignoring the voices of everyone else. And there's this. The mainstream media thrives on simple solutions. It has no idea whatsoever of how to report on a story that isn't about easy fixes so much as it is about anguished human frustration and fear. The media prides itself on its ability to tell you how to clear your clutter, regrout your shower, or purge your closet of anything that makes you look fat--in 24 minutes or less. It is bound to be flummoxed by a protest that offers up no happy endings. Luckily for us, #OWS doesn't seem to care. It must be painful for the pundits at Fox News. The more they demand that OWS explain itself in simple, Fox-like terms, the more cheerfully they are ignored by the occupiers around the country. As efforts to ridicule the protesters fail, attempts to repurpose the good old days of enemies lists falter; and efforts to demonize the occupiers backfire, polls continue to show that Americans support the protesters and share their goals. The rest of us quickly cottoned on to the fact that the only people who are scared of the ""violent mobs"" at Occupy Wall Street are the people being paid to call them violent mobs. Mark your calendars: The corporate media died when it announced it was too sophisticated to understand simple declarative sentences. While the mainstream media expresses puzzlement and fear at these incomprehensible ""protesters"" with their oddly well-worded ""signs,"" the rest of us see our own concerns reflected back at us and understand perfectly. Turning off mindless programming might be the best thing that ever happens to this polity. Hey, occupiers: You're the new news. And even better, by refusing to explain yourselves, you're actually changing what's reported as news. Because it takes a tremendous mental effort to refuse to see that the rich are getting richer in America while the rest of us are struggling. Maybe the days of explaining the patently obvious to the transparently compromised are finally behind us. By refusing to take a ragtag, complicated, and leaderless movement seriously, the mainstream media has succeeded only in ensuring its own irrelevance. The rest of America has little trouble understanding that these are ragtag, complicated, and leaderless times. This may not make for great television, but any movement that acknowledges that fact deserves enormous credit."	"Lithwick: Could OWS Bring About the Demise of Corporate Media?

Let the other candidates flip pancakes and stockpile antifreeze in Iowa. Gingrich and Cain will be in Houston for a ""modified Lincoln-Douglas debate"" about entitlement spending. The room seats only 1,000, and tickets start $200, with the proceeds going to the Texas Tea Party Patriots PAC. Is this a weird scheduling decision? No doubt. That's not to say it will hurt Cain or Gingrich. Check the polls: Gingrich has recovered some of his old intra-Republican popularity. Cain is now the front-runner in Iowa and in a bunch of later primary states where voters know the candidates mostly through debates and Fox News hits--forums where these two shine. Both candidates are doing even better than they were before they converted their campaigns into full-service book tours. Just look at their schedules. On Aug. 13, Herman Cain lost the Ames straw poll handily, coming in fifth place. He left Iowa with polls showing him in low single digits. On Aug. 18, he officially launched his 9-9-9 tax plan. On Sept. 24, Cain won the Florida Republican Party's quadrennial straw poll. On Oct. 4, he released his memoir and started his book tour. Over the next two weeks, four Iowa polls were released, and Cain led in all four. But Cain himself wasn't in Iowa. His first post-straw-poll visit to the state came on Sunday. The entire Cain surge happened while he was elsewhere, with only four Iowa staffers and a sloppy local organization. And even before the surge, he'd spent less time in the state than Rick Santorum or Michele Bachmann. It's not supposed to work like this. Daron Shaw, a University of Texas political scientist, has spent more than a decade analyzing the effects of campaign appearances on voters and election results. In his research, most recently in The Race to 270, Shaw has determined that in-person campaign stops do more for candidates than anything else. In 2006, after Rick Perry hired Shaw to craft his re-election campaign, Shaw noticed that campaign stops in places like Lubbock wound up giving the candidate oodles of free, uncritical media, and permanent poll bounces of up to 4 points. ""You can sit in a studio and do 12 interviews on the nightly news in six markets in the time it takes you to go out to Lubbock,"" Perry svengali Dave Carney told the journalist Sasha Issenberg. ""The actual visits make a bigger, more lasting impact than just being on the news."" By every normal metric, Cain and Gingrich should be bottoming out. When Gingrich's first campaign team bolted, knives red and heavy in their hands, they explained that the candidate wasn't doing what it would take to win. Gingrich wanted to keep doing events for his new book and his self-parodying educational films. They thought he was wasting time. He hired a new staff and kept schlepping the ""cultural documents."" So far in October, according to Politico's candidate schedule, and not counting all-candidate debates, Gingrich has held nine public events of which five were promotions for a book or movie. And what was Gingrich's old team doing? Dave Carney is working for none other than Rick Perry, who campaigned the old-fashioned way, partially disowned his book, and fell to earth faster than Icarus cradling a space heater. ""I've been doing this for a long time,"" says Rich Galen, a Republican strategist who worked for Gingrich in the 1990s. ""People like me think that if you don't hire us, you're not serious. They didn't hire us, but Cain and Gingrich know what they're good at."" The centrist Republican strategist Mark McKinnon agrees with that. ""It's just exposing the fact that old-school organizing just isn't as relevant or important as it used to be in today's media world."" Time for the caveats! Gingrich never had a real path to the convention, and he still doesn't. You can poll a Holiday Inn ballroom worth of Republican consultants, and most of them will say the Cain surge is a hiccup en route to a Romney nomination. Polling well in October doesn't mean winning elections in January. It just means that two candidates who aren't working the early states so hard are surpassing some of the candidates who are. Santorum's the only one temperamental enough to talk about it, but surely the rest of them hate it, too. There's a popular going theory in the punditocracy now: Cain's just proving that every outsider candidate will get a bubble. Today, Cain, tomorrow Santorum. I don't buy it. The Cain/Gingrich un-campaigns are succeeding because they understand how the media works. Just look at how they've spent the last decade. Gingrich, ousted from House leadership 13 years ago, spent the Bush era writing identical-looking policy books and building a honeycomb of nonprofits: American Solutions, the Center for Health Transformation, on and on. Cain ran for U.S. Senate in 2004 and lost, but before and after that he was a pundit and radio host who could walk onto Fox News almost as easily as Gingrich could. Starting in 2009, he spoke to every Tea Party that would have him. That, not some sort of meticulous Washington meeting schedule, was how he found his campaign chief and built his network. In the last 10 years, Cain and Gingrich have learned to make bold pronouncements and endorse wild gimmicks, like Gingrich's plan to break up courts if they annoy conservatives, or Cain's 9-9-9 implosion of the tax code. They run their policy shops the way a contrarian editor might run his magazine. It works. Bill O'Sullivan, the treasurer of Texas Tea Party Patriots, explains that Cain and Gingrich have won over the party's base because they barrel through the normal constraints of campaigns and the ""glorified spelling bees"" that are media-sponsored debates. ""What we're trying to do is find leaders,"" he says, ""and these guys have decided to go outside the paradigm. They're showing enormous courage."" Another caveat: They're allowed to be courageous because they're not being attacked. Between his June collapse and the Oct. 18 debate (when Romney pantsed him over the idea of a health care mandate), no other candidate bothered to poke at Gingrich. Not until the last two debates did any candidate go after Cain at all. But nobody's bothering to attack Santorum, either, and he keeps struggling for the attention and affection that comes easy to Cain. No, there must be some other reason why this is happening--why we're this close to the caucuses and 35 percent or so of Republicans in key states are still smitten with Cain or Gingrich. It's obvious. It's the Tea Party. For nearly three years, the GOP's base has believed, and been told to believe, that it is in an existential battle for civilization, that politicians who got a few things wrong can never be trusted again. (Sorry about that, Rick, Rick, and Michele.) They joined a movement that they could spend all of their media-consuming minutes on, whether it meant watching Fox News or joining Glenn Beck's 9-12 book clubs. They don't need Herman Cain to work them over in person, carrying volunteer sign-up sheets, like Tim Pawlenty did. They know him well enough already. It might not last, and it might all end with a Romney nomination, but they're not going to give up on it. ""Think about what they said at Lexington and Concord,"" says Bill O'Sullivan. ""If they mean to have a war, let it begin here."""	"Cain and Gingrich Are Doing Well in Iowa With All the Wrong Moves. Why?

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/can_herman_cain_win_iowa_without_really_campaigning_there_iowans.html	"DES MOINES--Herman Cain has captured lightning in a bottle. That's the political cliche for the blast of popularity he's experiencing. But in Iowa, a state that has traditionally rewarded well-organized campaigns, the question is whether Cain is all lightning and no bottle. His supporters and political consultants are trying to get him to spend time and energy in the state, but he has a different plan. ""He really doesn't have much of an organization,"" says Jeffrey Jorgensen, the chairman of the Pottawattamie County Republican Party who supports Cain and calls him the ""Anti-Obama."" ""Since Ames, he has disappeared and has not been back."" Jorgensen says he's been having conversations with the campaign ""to get Herman back here, but for whatever reason he hasn't been back."" If Cain does well in Iowa, it could upend the entire premise of the caucus process: In order to win in Iowa, candidates must spend time in the state wooing the famously coddled voters with personal appearances and vast organizations. There is a lot of head-scratching going on among the Republican political class over Cain's reluctance to come pick up the support that appears to be his for the taking. He is very popular in the state, a finding confirmed by a University of Iowa poll that shows him with 37 percent support, 10 points ahead of Romney. Doing well in Iowa would offer a strong kickoff for his campaign against his better-funded rivals Romney and Rick Perry. The win would bring in money and give him momentum to compete with Romney in New Hampshire and Perry in South Carolina, states where each has advantages. ""He's on a book tour more than a campaign tour,"" says Dale Bjorkman, a retired Gateway computer employee, who attended a Romney event Thursday but said he was still considering Cain and Gingrich. Mac McDonald, the chairman of the Black Hawk County Republican Party, one of the largest counties in the state, says he has scheduled three events for Cain over the last few months. Each one has been canceled. ""Something's always come up,"" he says. ""We quit advertising that he's going to be there."" MacDonald says he hasn't heard from the campaign for two months. Cain has been to Iowa 33 times, according to his campaign, which has four staffers in a suite of offices in Des Moines. Voters who have seen him gush about it. But Cain doesn't seem to be planning to pick up the pace now that his moment has arrived. Cain hasn't been back in the state since the Ames straw poll in August. He visits this weekend to attend the Iowa and Iowa State football games, and he will speak Saturday at a forum held by the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition. But he is leaving the next day. According to his Iowa staff, his next trip to the state is scheduled for mid-November. After that, he has a visit planned for December, and, says Lisa Lockwood, his Iowa communications director, ""I would anticipate he might make a showing here on caucus day."" This is not the way it's traditionally done. Candidates usually blanket the state. Some boast about visiting all 99 counties. Rick Santorum has been to more than 70 counties so far this year in 60 visits. Iowans assume Cain will follow this model. ""He will come back and camp himself out here,"" said Steve Armstrong, Chairman of the Linn County Republican Party. The time-consuming work is necessary, the theory goes, because Iowa voters are particularly discerning and because a caucus requires a more concerted effort to mobilize voters. Voters don't just show up to flip a lever. They listen to hours of speeches from representatives of each candidate before they can record their preference. This requires a higher level of commitment, which campaigns usually stoke with careful cajoling. ""He's running for president of the United States, not the president of Iowa,"" says Lockwood, who is amiable even by Iowa standards. She says the campaign has been organizing in the key Republican areas and spreading the word through social media. The campaign isn't likely to launch a big wave of commercials. The operation ""is very lean. He is a business man. He doesn't spend what he doesn't have."" In the end, says Lockwood, ""I would be a little surprised if we don't bring in a caucus win."" She bases that on the enthusiasm she's seen from Iowa voters. One person saw her at Wal-Mart shopping in a Cain T-shirt and asked to volunteer. ""It's just a yay-positive spiral upward,"" she says, describing the power of Cain's appeal to the simple. ""He has 'kid logic' that can't be argued with. The example I use is my daughter. She was rinsing off her feet in the water in Florida, and I said, 'You're getting your pants wet.' She looked at me and said 'That's what water does, Mom.' That was so Herman Cain-esque."" Organizations aren't simply necessary to shuttle voters to the caucuses. They help put out brush fires, too. Cain recently caused himself a problem on the issue of abortion. When asked about his belief that abortion should not be legal even in the case of rape or incest, he said that in the case of rape, ultimately the decision was a personal one. Santorum, who is something of a town crier when it comes to responding first to his opponent's mistakes said the stance was ""the quintessential pro-choice position on abortion."" Cain has since clarified his position, but the Susan B. Anthony list, a group of conservative women who oppose abortion rights, blasted him in an email. Cain also had to walk back his claim that he would release prisoners at Guantanamo Bay in exchange for U.S. hostages. One former staffer says that these examples show that Cain will talk himself out of his positions if you give him enough time. And Cain has also emphasized the details of his 9-9-9 tax plan to respond to criticism: In Detroit Friday highlighting ""empowerment zones"" where taxes would be lower, he said in certain instances it would be a ""9-0-9 plan."" For all of the conventional wisdom about the necessity of campaigning hard in Iowa, there are plenty of candidates in both parties who have done the spade work and come up empty. Lamar Alexander and John Edwards wound up faltering because they'd done so much work in Iowa they didn't meet expectations. The same happened to Romney in 2008, which is why he's approaching the state with caution now. (He's only been to Iowa six times.) If the current two top contenders in the polls in Iowa wind up doing well, while states like Nevada and Florida scramble the early-selection process, 2012 may be remembered as the year that Iowa's pre-eminent position finally cracked."

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/why_it_doesn_t_matter_exactly_when_marco_rubio_s_family_left_cub.html	"On May 12, 2009, Marco Rubio, then a candidate for the U.S. Senate from Florida, arrived in the U.S. Capitol for a pivotal meeting with Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina. Florida's Republican leaders wanted the seat for then-Gov. Charlie Crist, then considered a shoo-in, and DeMint's job was to persuade Rubio to drop his campaign. Instead, Marco Rubio made grown men cry. ""He was young and eager to make his case,"" writes DeMint in his book The Great American Awakening (Rubio wrote the foreword). ""His parents had fled Cuba as refugees, coming to America with great hopes of a nation promising a better life for their children."" Compelling stuff. ""The Rubio family knew what it was like to lose their country. Rubio was afraid Americans were on the verge of losing their country and desperately wanted to stop the Washington politicians who were guiding America into the abyss."" People in the room were ""tearing up,"" writes DeMint. ""Rubio's passion and genuineness left me speechless."" Well, define ""genuineness."" On Thursday the Washington Post revealed the results of a deep dive into Rubio's family history. Rubio's parents didn't actually flee Cuba when Fidel Castro took power in 1959. They had moved to the United States in 1956. They thought about going back in 1961. Recoiling at what Castro was doing to the place, they decided to stay in the States. But the Post's scoop, as the Miami Herald has pointed out, was missing something: In speeches, commercials, and interviews, Rubio does not paint a dramatic tale of his parents fleeing as the Communists marched. (Until he changed it Friday afternoon, Rubio's official biography said that his parents came to the United States ""following Fidel Castro's takeover."")  If anyone fights back the tears long enough to listen to him, he describes his parents only as Cuban exiles upset at what their country turned into. Anyone who's ever tried to woo first-generation Cuban voters over to the Democrats can tell you: That's a pretty common view. Rubio plays a pivotal role in Republican politics. His family saga isn't just an allegory for what could happen to America, it is a warning of what is already happening. It's one thing for Glenn Beck to call Barack Obama a Communist--yawn, whatever, see you at the Bircher potluck. It's another thing for the son of Cuban exiles to call Obama a Communist. Of course, Rubio doesn't explicitly use that word to describe Obama. He's smarter than that. He only hints at it in every major speech. At the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference, when the national media was starting to expect Rubio to beat Crist, the candidate hot-wired the rise of Castro with the goals of Obama. ""Do I want my children to grow up in the country that I grew up in,"" he said, ""or do I want them to grow up in a country like the one my parents grew up in?"" As John Judis pointed out at the time, Rubio said something sort of crazy--that the party of Max Baucus and Steny Hoyer was engineering a Fourth International--and made it sound logical. ""Using his own life story,"" wrote Judis, ""he framed the choice facing Americans in a way that evoked the contrast between his Horatio Alger capitalism and Obama's or Nancy Pelosi's socialism."" Rubio was comparing the changes Obama and Pelosi wanted to engineer--at that point, financial reform and a health care law--with the collapsed command economy of Cuba, in which about four-fifths of workers are public employees. Yes, you can find liberals who extol the virtues of Fidel Castro's fiefdom (just four years ago, Michael Moore was arguing that we'd be better off if we adopted Cuba's health care system). But Rubio's implication, that Democrats would grind away our freedom just as surely as Castro did, was the sort of stuff other Republicans get branded as kooks for saying. Rubio's personal story, just as with the audition before DeMint, clinches the sale. Maybe it's good for Rubio that this is breaking now. Manuel Roig-Franzia, the Post reporter, is working on a book about the senator; this news could have come out much closer to the veepstakes, instead of coming out as everybody's distracted by the Republican presidential race and Muammar Qaddafi's bloodied corpse. Roig-Franzia has covered Cuba for years, and he puts the 1956 revelation in the right context. ""In Florida,"" he writes, ""being connected to the post-revolution exile community gives a politician cachet that could never be achieved by someone identified with the pre-Castro exodus, a group sometimes viewed with suspicion."" That explains what Rubio's been trying to do: Cash in on the cachet. His version of the Cuban drama is a canary-in-the-coal-mine tale that explains why he opposes Obama. Republicans never get tired of it. In a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, one of three big set-piece events designed to build up Rubio's national image, he even extended the narrative to cover his grandfather, who moved with the family to the United States. ""My grandfather loved being Cuban,"" said Rubio. ""He loved being from Cuba. He never would have left Cuba if he didn't have to. But he knew America was special. ... He knew that he had lost his country, and that the only thing preventing other people in the world from losing theirs to Communism was this country--this nation."" Rubio's official response to the Post story came in a column in Politico that got home-page splash treatment. The point it makes is familiar. ""People didn't vote for me because they thought my parents came in 1961, or 1956, or any other year,"" Rubio wrote. ""Among others things, they voted for me because, as the son of immigrants, I know how special America really is. As the son of exiles, I know how much it hurts to lose your country."" Are we weeping yet?"	"It Doesn't Matter Exactly When Marco Rubio's Family Left Cuba: He Still Hates Castro--and Obama!

On Thursday, he was a proud participant in Occupy Las Vegas. ""It's a shame about that house,"" says Mann, a former small-town mayor from Michigan who retired to Vegas. ""It changed hands a few times, and the last people who were in it--real nice people--they got left holding the bag. The value just went whoooosh."" He then tells his own housing history. In 1999 Mann bought a home for $209,000. He added a pool. The value peaked at $666,000 in 2007. It collapsed to $194,000. It's only now crept back up to the original value. He's lucky. He's not underwater. There aren't enough lucky people living in Las Vegas. Unemployment here has fallen recently, but it's still about 14 percent. In August, according to CNN, one out of every 118 homes in the Las Vegas area got a foreclosure filing. Online, you can find foreclosed homes with four or five bedrooms selling for less than $200,000. And so we have Occupy Las Vegas. This offshoot of the still-evolving national movement began with a 1,200-person rally on the Strip on Oct. 6, right in front of the micro-Statue of Liberty at the New York-New York casino. On Tuesday and Thursday, the Occupiers held two more rallies, both fairly small, both attracting a little local media attention. The Tuesday rally, right next to the place where Republican presidential candidates were debating, even crashed a live CNN broadcast. ""We're the fifth or sixth biggest group in the movement right now,"" says Jet West, an inordinately cheery middle-age man sporting new red-and-black Occupy Las Vegas stickers. ""That's according to what I've seen on the Internet."" The group is polite. They listen to cops, get permits, stay where they're told to stay, and return to their less-valuable-than-they-used-to-be homes when the rally is over. They've delegated a few leaders to negotiate with the city for some permanent place to camp out. Which park do they want? It's a secret. ""We tried to hold one rally in a lot that hadn't been rented for six years,"" explains Leroy Smith, one of the organizers. (He's a self-described student and small-business man. On Thursday, he tells me that he's launching a new iPhone app and has to fly to Denver soon to build up a medical marijuana combine.) When the group announced it, he says, ""someone put in a bid."" He suspects casino shenanigans. ""Anyway,"" says Smith, ""information about the permanent location is on a need-to-know basis."" ""I may not be there all the time,"" says West. ""But I'll put up a tent!"" Tuesday's crowd was a mixture: retirees, union members, young-and-pierced twentysomethings. (Some members of the last group wear Guy Fawkes masks but occasionally take them off to talk.) The union members wear SEIU purple or TWU orange and don't take any kind of organizing role. They cheer on drivers who honk their horns and chant slogans they've heard from YouTube-ed rallies in New York. They might have it tougher than the New Yorkers. Pete Ostapow, who retired from the real estate business after the crash, recalls the role he played. ""When somebody had bad credit, they couldn't get a good loan,"" he says. ""So we put them in what we called a subprime loan. It was good for two or three years. We'd tell them: Clean up your credit, come back, and you can refinance into a better loan."" ""Then the values went down,"" says his wife, Judy. ""They didn't have the equity they needed. That thing they say--Oh, people bought houses they couldn't have afforded!--that wasn't true! They were making the payments they could, but the banks wouldn't freeze the rates!"" ""That would have solved the whole problem,"" says Pete. On Thursday, I drive off the Strip, through downtown Las Vegas, through some suburbs, to the neighborhood Jerry Mann lives in. In some places you'd have to drive blind to miss the blight. Bright white stucco strip malls are half occupied, half empty. New-looking homes, not at all run-down, are for sale at auction. I stop for a Coke in northeast Las Vegas, after passing by a Mobius strip of payday-loan houses, diners, and taco joints. ""What do you call this part of town?"" I ask the cashier. ""Trashy,"" she says. Better than north Las Vegas, though, where ""the gangs are coming in from Los Angeles."" I head back to the strip for the Thursday rally. It's right outside Caesars Palace, which gives TWU Local 172 reason to talk about how the casino wants to cheat dealers out of their tips. Why have the rallies on the Strip and not downtown? The answer I get is that the landmarks make for better photos, and the tourists make for better gawkers or converts. This rally is louder. Unlike the people Occupying Wall Street, these people are allowed to use megaphones, so they do, allowing extremely unfocused people a chance to fill the air. A young guy in shorts and a white T-shirt, bouncing up and down on his heels, tells the crowd he ""loves humanity"" and wants it to ""get rid of possessions, stop being slaves!"" An Italian tourist grabs the megaphone and offers the Continental perspective. ""I want to love America, but I hate America right now,"" she says. She can see some people wincing. ""But I love America!"" The rally is saved when one organizer grabs a two-page statement of principles developed at Occupy Wall Street. It reads faster through a megaphone than through the repeat-after-me ""people's microphone"" the New Yorkers use. ""They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process,"" he says, reading, ""despite not having the original mortgage. They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right."" Paul Ruth, a teacher who lives nearby, likes that the list is coming from New York. ""I've been giving money to those guys,"" he says. He thinks the crisis could be resolved, at least a little, with a biblical-style jubilee that forgave some debt. Also: He can't stand that President Obama compared this to the Tea Party. ""He's gutless. When he compares the Tea Party to this movement, you know all you need to know. The Tea Party was funded by billionaires. These guys, you know, they're taking our donations."" The march begins at 4:15 p.m. Occupy Las Vegas has permission to march up and down the strip, taking up the traffic lanes next to the sidewalks; they will walk this path for two hours. The movement is famous enough by now that some of the gawkers grab cameras and take pictures of themselves, with the march in the background. The organizer who read the Occupy Wall Street demands leads two chants that he's written down on a Post-it note. ""Unemployment! Foreclosure! Occupy until it's over!"" ""Republican or Democrat!

The glowing, shifting Google map, which is only sometimes wrong, says to head to a Westin hotel at the Detroit Airport. I head there, and keep heading there, and I assume I've turned the wrong way until I see the average-ritzy entrance of a Westin poking out of the terminal. Parking isn't much easier. I have to swing around the airport road and find a spot far away in daily parking. And as for the entrance to the hotel: You have to go up, and over, and under something, then through something. I notice that a middle-aged guy carrying some coffee is looking around for directions in the same confused manner. ""Do you know where Newt is?"" he asks. His name is Dave Bartleson, and he's still shopping for candidates, but he got an e-mail about Gingrich's hastily planned post-debate event and decided to show. ""I like how he goes after the media,"" he tells me, as we descend an escalator into the Westin's leafy lobby. ""Most of us don't like the media. Honestly, the one thing that pisses me off about him is that he had some kind of a dust-up with Glenn Beck. I don't remember what that was all about."" Bartleson and I finally find the room, rented in a hurry by the Gingrich campaign. There are leaflets set out pointing possible supporters to the New Contract With America at Gingrich's website, accompanied by a short letter ""from the desk of Newt Gingrich."" The man himself has already started speaking, telling around 75 people--not bad for an airport labyrinth at 8:30 a.m.--about the time he tried to get the Reagan campaign to hold an event with Republican candidates, trumpeting five big policy ideas. ""It was the first time I really encountered the Washington culture of consultants,"" Gingrich remembered. ""They said, 'We don't want to get into ideas.' I said, 'These are all Reagan's ideas. These are what he campaigned on.' "" The room features a small stage and a podium that Gingrich isn't using except when he needs something to lean on. There is more space for media than necessary: Besides me, there's a CBS News reporter with a video camera and an Atlanta Journal-Constitution scribe. The rest of the press is chasing Herman Cain from Ypsilanti to Traverse City; they will get video of him saying he's ""been through hell,"" and more video of him joking about Anita Hill. Meanwhile, Gingrich is talking. ""Here's why I'm telling you the story,"" says Gingrich. ""David Broder wrote a very nice column about it in September of 1980. First of all, it was a huge decision by Reagan, that he was going to run as the head of a team. Second, we won six U.S. Senate seats that year. Mack Mattingly's race in Georgia wasn't called until the next day. If Mack Mattingly hadn't had the ability to stand alongside Ronald Reagan and be for something, he wouldn't have won."" It's a modal Newt anecdote. The villains: consultants, who are always wrong, who share the DNA of the scofflaws who quit his presidential campaign this summer and went on to join the Rick Perry juggernaut. (How's that working out?) The heroes: people who took Gingrich seriously, led by Gingrich himself. A lot of people wrote Gingrich into fringe territory back when his campaign collapsed. He's now polling as high as he was before he imploded. The press understands the GOP electorate in the same way a baby-sitter understands a kid who never seems to be satisfied with the new toy: It doesn't understand at all. Why isn't Gingrich being punished anymore for criticizing Paul Ryan's plan, and why are Republican voters so warm on a campaign that eschews humility for stories of the candidate's brains and insight? There are plenty of those in the bowels of the airport hotel. When Gingrich is asked about education spending: ""Did you watch the debate? For me, personally, the most daring thing I said all evening was on college tuition."" When he's asked about his plans to stop judges ""legislating from the bench"": ""If you go to Newt.org you'll see an entire paper on rebalancing the judiciary. It is the most thorough statement of the Constitution and the balance of power, I think, that's been written by a political figure since Lincoln's first inaugural in 1861."" When he's asked how his campaign has endured, despite all the slings and tweets and dust from the media: ""Callista's mantra was get to the debates. She said, you've got to find a way to survive to get to the debates. And, then frankly, the debates are a great sign of the American people's willingness to say 'Oh, I'm actually watching him, and he doesn't represent any of the things they've been describing him.' It actually goes to one of Ronald Reagan's great advantages. People so underestimated him going into the debates."" This is not how any other candidate talks, which is a big reason reporters--myself included--put his campaign in the ""fun curiosity"" camp. And yet Republicans love it. Talking to Newt's fans, who had to hustle and pay for parking to show up here, you hear a few of the reasons why. There are die-hards who simply think Gingrich is a world-historical figure. Greg Hummel, one of about 50 people who hang around to have Newt and his wife sign books, says he wrote in Newt's name for president four years ago. The other fans sound more like Bartleson. Their resentments are the same as Newt's. They don't like the media, and neither does he. (In his speech he fantasizes about a Washington where home values have gone down because reporters don't have a powerful government to cover. ""That's not the career they imagined for themselves!"") They think the media put Barack Obama in office and cover up the fact that he's a chucklehead who can't weld a noun to a verb without a teleprompter. Gingrich offers them the exact opposite. Still: Why him? Why a guy who polls worse against Obama than Mitt Romney? While his spiel is captivating, in the way that a really good conservative historian is captivating, there's no evidence that it wins over skeptics. His record, if you dig a little--that will happen, if he becomes the anti-Mitt--is as problematic as Romney's. There's one reason. It doesn't have a lot to do with ideas; it has something to do with history. Cathy Fisk explains it as she heads back out of the hotel, and I ask her about Romney. ""He's a Mormon,"" she says. ""I know, that sounds terrible, but in the Mormon religion they believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers--when you're ingrained with that, it's a problem."" There are high-minded reasons why Gingrich is doing better these days, and why Romney can't quite lock this down. And then there are other reasons."	Newt's Magical History Tour

The former president was onstage at the 2009 Netroots Nation conference. He had an airport-hangar-sized room to win over, and he did--by talking about why health care reform needed to pass. ""I'm telling you,"" said Clinton, ""no matter how low they drive support for this with misinformation, the minute the president signs a health care reform bill his approval will go up. Secondly, within a year, when all those bad things they say will happen don't happen, and all the good things happen, approval will explode."" This was August 2009. The health care bill passed in March 2010. The president's approval didn't go up; it fell. One year later, his approval didn't explode, and neither did the public's love for health care reform. Clinton kept giving advice, and very often the Democrats ended up taking it, consciously or not. They struggled so manfully to avoid their Clinton-era mistakes, and they lost anyway. The Democrats have lost their majority in the House, but Clinton's still here. He has more advice. Out Tuesday he released Back to Work, a book of policy, punditry, and finger-waggery that Clinton wrestled with because he didn't want to ""just add another stone to the Democratic side of the partisan scale."" He ends up adding a couple of boulders to the scale, and he adds to one of the micro-mysteries of modern Democratic politics. If Bill Clinton's so smart, why can't he save us? Take Clinton's ""talking points"" theory. He looks back on the 2010 elections, during which he did ""more than 130 events"" for Democrats, and decides that the party missed out by ducking his advice. ""Vice President Biden and I tried to get the Democratic National Committee to send out a centralized set of talking points to its large e-mail list,"" he writes, ""so Democratic foot soldiers would at least have some good ammunition for their phone and door to door campaigns. We couldn't persuade the decision makers to do so."" The Democrats didn't have talking points in 2010? This sounded goofy, but when I asked Democratic strategists about it on Tuesday, they agreed. The White House message shop didn't compete with the GOP. Democrats panicked and ran screaming from the bills they'd passed. But ... hadn't they passed the bills in the first place? Hadn't they avoided the big mistake Clinton warned about? Clinton's answer is so simple that it can't possibly be right. ""These problems,"" he writes, ""could have been finessed with commitments to reform--not repeal--the health-care law and to change how we produce and consume energy in a way that grows the economy and creates jobs."" Some Democrats did run on that first idea. The president campaigned on that, too. Clinton argues that Republicans were ""both candid and clever in presenting their own policy agenda in printed materials distributed to their more ideological base voters."" But he omits something: to wit, the boost that Republicans got from the new and enhanced third party political organizations, from the well-known American Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity to the more generically named mystery PACs that arrived in October. Clinton makes no mention of Citizens United v. FEC at all. His 2010 doesn't look like the one we lived through. Hey, he's smarter than we are about politics--maybe we missed something. ""For the first time since their big losses in 1994,"" writes Clinton, ""when the Republicans ran on the Contract with America, the Democrats did not counter the national Republican message with one of their own. There was no national advertising campaign to explain and defend what they had done and compare their agenda for the next two years with the GOP proposals. The large amount of money Democrats raised, $1.6 billion, was almost all spent on local races, just as it was in 1994, with similar results."" It makes sense, but according to Karl Rove, not even Bill Clinton thinks it's 100 percent true. In his memoir, Rove writes about talking to Clinton after the 2006 elections, in which the Democrats won back the House. Back then, Clinton seemed to appreciate the value of local spending. ""We should have won twice as many seats,"" Clinton told Rove, ""but we didn't because of what you all did to get out your vote. No one will give you credit, but I know what you all did."" A major get-out-the-vote effort was exactly what Democrats tried last year. Why didn't it work? Ah, this is the stuff that Clinton really knows but doesn't say. He just implies it. Massive progressive reform isn't going to happen anymore. Clinton never writes that, but the sad little eulogy for big-dreaming liberalism is sort of the point of this book. He piles on (and numbers!) micro-ideas about what could fix the economy--infrastructure banks, green tax credits, local retrofitting initiatives. ""We could provide free training and the cash equivalent of a ten-year property-tax holiday for investments that create more than a certain number of jobs or reopen a closed factory,"" he writes. The twist is left up to his footnote: ""This is an idea I first heard suggested by Newt Gingrich."" The point of all this is that liberalism is basically over. It should keep its gains. It should stave off the ""antigovernment bloc"" by limiting the points of attack--declaring war on red tape, for example. (This is another thing that Obama's Democrats have actually done. Stop laughing! The growth of regulations under Obama is slower than it was under Bush.) Focus up: Just try to improve what we've got. Clinton's boldest defense of progressivism takes the Occupy Wall Street movement's anger and bleaches it. ""Our process is too tilted in favor of powerful private interests over the public interest,"" he writes, ""in favor of short-term financial gains over long-term employment and income growth, in favor of consumption over investment, in favor of pushing more of our national income up to the top 1 percent over increasing the incomes of the middle class and giving poor people a chance to work their way into it."" What's the best way to make that happen now that the white Southerner's old allegiance to the Democrats is gone? How do you fix things when the natural majority party doesn't want the government to govern? Stop dreaming, get busy tweaking. Any other advice isn't going to work so well."	If Bill Clinton's So Smart, Why Can't He Save the Democrats?

The conservative blog Powerline links to it with the title ""Rampaging Occupiers Attack 78-Year Old Woman."" That's not quite what happened, but it's the official story out of the conference, a rallying cry for Tea Partiers against the Occupiers. In the culture war between the left and right over who can save the economy, this round goes to the Tea Party. Occupy protesters will tell you that it wasn't supposed to get ugly. Progressive activists had known for months that Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party group chaired by the industrialist/philanthropist David Koch, would spend the first weekend of November in Washington for its Defending the American Dream Summit. It was a soft, bloated target. Progressives have been protesting the Koch apparatus all year. In January, they'd marched outside the semiannual invite-only political summit that David and his brother Charles (combined net worth: $32 billion) put on for fellow Masters of the Universe. In February, the gonzo journalist Ian Murphy posed as ""David Koch"" on the phone to draw Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker into a lengthy, awkward, recorded conversation about how to crush protesters. They had ""changed the conversation"" about the Kochs, prompting stories about Republican ""ties"" to the brothers, as if they were capos of some criminal enterprise. ""The Koch brothers are at the head of the snake,"" Occupy protester Cecilia Azurduy told me, ""but what they represent is a lot more insidious--this idea that humankind is greedy, and we can only succeed if we're trying to get more for ourselves. We were protesting their promotion of radical, neo-liberal, free market ideas which have been proven to fail people."" They wouldn't get into the convention center, so they wouldn't get a clear idea of what they were protesting. AFP has an operating budget in the mid-eight digits, and at its annual conferences, it shows. AFPers collected handsome leather binders branded with an AFP logo and lined with info sheets and swag and free T-shirts (size L only) with AFP's new slogan (""SOS: Sick of Spending""). They gazed upon crisply designed banners and an electronic billboard. They were wooed by two Republican presidential candidates. It was swank. It was also obsessed with Occupy Wall Street. The Occupiers had been around for only six weeks, and already they were public enemies. They were getting on David Koch's nerves. ""You see the left trying to rejuvenate itself at the grassroots,"" said Tim Phillips, the president and public face of AFP, opening up the conference in that massive ballroom. ""The Occupy Wall Street movement offers our nation a crystal-clear choice between what the radical left's vision is for this nation and what AFP and our Tea Party allies' vision is. They openly call for socialism and they disparage job creators!"" He offered a warning, too. ""Often, the Occupy Wall Street movement has called for and resulted in violence. They break the law."" This was the mood when the Occupiers got to the convention center. There was also their lack of plans. As it happened, more Occupiers showed up than anyone expected. They got mocked and name-checked as, inside the convention center, AFP celebrated its ""Tribute to Ronald Reagan"" dinner. Outside, the Occupiers realized that they could surround the building and prevent Tea Partiers from getting out. This was when the trouble began. One group ran up to an entrance, closed off by security, and banged on the doors as Flipcams filmed them. Other groups yelled at a video reporter who had turned a camera on them. Inside the building, AFPers were warned about the shenanigans and told to stick around. Some of them tried to head out anyway, and one of them was Dolores Broderson, a 78-year-old retiree from Michigan. Broderson was held off by protesters who'd linked their arms to block the doors. Helped by a friend, she tried to move past them. Seconds later, she was sprawled out on the ground, with a bump on her head and a bloody nose. ""All of a sudden, they opened their arms,"" she later told me. ""I went flying down the stairs."" A video on YouTube misses the moment when the Occupiers move and Broderson falls. It does show several seconds of her trying to get her bearings and shows AFPers telling the Occupiers off. ""They're the ones doing this shit!"" says one AFPer. ""Why are you attacking old ladies?"" says another. On Saturday morning, back inside AFP, the speakers take the high ground. ""We're gonna be respectful and civil,"" says Tim Phillips, ""unlike the left wing nuts last night."" Outside the ballroom, some of the AFPers are still rattled. There were countless short Zapruder films showing different angles of the moment a car driven by one of their own gunned it in front of an Occupier and showing moments when Occupiers shouted obscenities at AFPers. I talked to Caleb Hays, Gavin Kreidler, and Jerrod Mendicki, College Republicans from Kansas who tried to keep their distance from the shouting crowd. Hays showed me an iPhone video clip of the mob of Occupiers moving toward the car as it drove off. It's hard to see. ""I stayed pretty far away,"" he said, ""because when we moved closer, they were shouting stuff like, 'Fuck AFP.' I felt like I was going to be injured, just for my beliefs. That's completely un-American."" ""When I was in high school,"" said Kreidler, ""I was at a big pro-Iraq War rally in Wichita. And that wasn't even violent."" ""People want to compare the Tea Party and this movement,"" said Hays, ""but you can't do that after last night."" McPherson Square, the home base of Occupy D.C., is only seven blocks from the convention center. I headed over there to reconstruct the mess from Occupiers' accounts. Steve Hartwell, a former construction worker from Richmond (he quit the job to come up here), recalled some events and explained how he became one of the few people arrested. ""I saw the cops start to let the driver go after the car hit one of us,"" he explained. ""I walked up to the cop like this."" (He demonstrated by holding up the middle fingers of both hands.) How did he feel about the scuffling and shouting? What did he think of the plight of people like Dolores Broderson, who ended up going to the hospital for a head injury? ""Some of them I talk to and seem like fine people,"" said Hartwell. ""Some of them seem like total assholes. It was not the best situation to understand the other, which is important. Yeah. There probably should be some more understanding."" ""In some ways it was a success,"" said Drew Franklin, an audio engineer who'd been part of the protests. ""And in other ways ... well, I'd say we learned that we need to do more planning."" Back at the convention center, the ugly stories from Friday night were circulating. The most popular afternoon session, with dozens of people grabbing floor space when chairs run out, was hosted by Andrew Breitbart. In his morning speech he ripped into the Occupiers, ""freaks"" embarrassing themselves with ""rape and public masturbation."" Later, he gleefully mocked the movement. ""Let's have a general assembly consensus,"" Breitbart said. ""Twinkle fingers up!"" Everyone lifted their hands and wiggled their fingers, a parody of the Occupy organizing tactic. ""First issue on the docket is rape,"" says Breitbart. ""Should we allow rape to happen at the Tea Party?"" They wiggle their fingers toward the ground, meaning no. ""OK, we're already different than them."" Breitbart later sought out Dolores Broderson to tell her he was sorry for what happened to her and to ask her how she was doing. She was healing. AFP gave her a plane ride home to spare her the possible jostling she would have gotten on her AFP bus ride. It would be OK. ""Congratulations,"" he said. ""You're now a martyr of our cause. Unfortunately, the mainstream media doesn't care about you. If this were the other way around, you'd be on ABC News, live. It'd be a media circus."""

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/why_herman_cain_is_not_ready_to_be_president_.html	"Herman Cain is finally running his campaign by the book. Confronted with new allegations about sexual harassment, Cain has fingered the Perry campaign as the source of the media leaks that started the whole thing. Depending on your version of the Modern Campaign Manual, this is either on page 43 or page 61, under the heading ""When in Trouble, Create a Diversion."" The harder it becomes to remember what this story is about, the better it is for Herman Cain. The Perry campaign has denied the charge, but even if Perry personally called Jonathan Martin at Politico and gave him the story, it's beside the point. Also distracting: the recollections of people at dinner parties where Cain may or may not have misbehaved, and whether Cain did or did not tell past aides in 2004 about harassment charges he'd faced. Cain has at least two sexual harassment settlements in his past. The questions are whether these make him unfit for the presidency, and whether the contradictory explanations Cain has offered in the wake of these disclosures tell us anything important about his ability to be president. Wait a minute, I may have gotten ahead of myself. Before we even reach the question of what all this tells us about Cain's ability to be president, we have to face the question of whether he has a realistic chance of becoming president at all. For those who say yes, the question then becomes whether a candidate who seems to travel with an extra pair of shoes--so as always to have the next one ready to drop--is just too big a risk to put into a campaign against a vulnerable President Obama. Then we can approach the question of whether Cain can handle the presidency. His reaction to the latest set of challenges is not encouraging. But there is already plenty of evidence out there that suggests Cain is not a serious candidate--or at least has yet to prove he is. The Cain campaign has been disorganized from the start and has seen a host of defections from aides who say the candidate doesn't seem serious. ""Throwing out the playbook"" is an exciting move for a long-shot candidate. But when you're leader of the free world, you need a little more planning than a diagram of a play drawn in the dirt during the huddle. Cain's foreign policy knowledge is thin. He's cramming, say his aides, but he got a little confused on China recently saying, it's ""trying to develop nuclear capability."" (It has had it since 1964.) The issue he may have been reaching for is that China is upgrading its capacity in a way that suggests that it may one day rival U.S. capability. Cain offered confusing or conflicting positions on exchanging Guantanamo prisoners for hostages, the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, and whether there should be an electrified fence on the border with Mexico. Cain, who campaigns on the idea that foreign policy should provide ""clarity"" above all, has had some difficulty providing it. Cain lacks any experience in elected office, which is an applause line for him. But the president is not just a CEO. He's also the most important player in the political system. To get anything done, he must engage other politicians. Some experience in this dark art would be helpful. After all, Obama isn't very good at managing and handling pols, at least not the way a president needs to, and it shows. Cain would be starting from scratch. If Cain didn't have any other shortcomings, maybe none of these deficiencies would matter too much. Taken in sum, it is a substantial set of interlocking challenges. George W. Bush was a foreign policy neophyte, but he had political skills. His campaign organization was a model of precision. Ronald Reagan had a disorganized staff and no real foreign policy experience, but he'd been a two-term governor. We know that Cain's supporters don't see his deficiencies as problems. The message from Iowa over the last couple of days of interviews has been uniform: No one is ready to throw Cain overboard because of these stories about sexual harassment. Conservatives who like him are particularly distrustful of the mainstream media. Other voters have said that we all have some parts of our past that we're not proud of and that on those grounds Cain should be forgiven. However, there is also a consensus that Cain's current problems could weave into a bigger liability, one that connects to his underlying weakness: He may just be too unpredictable.  Republicans above all else want to defeat Obama. The end result of all of these questions swirling around Cain may be that Republicans conclude that he's just too big a risk in a year where their chances to unseat the incumbent are very good. It's not clear whether this problem is addressed at all in the campaign manual."	Allegations of Sexual Harassment Are the Least of Herman Cain's Problems
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/_2012_campaign_gingrich_surge_doesn_t_matter_.html	"There are 10 Republican candidates for president running in two campaigns. In Campaign No. 1, the nominee will be chosen in a matter of months, starting with caucuses in Iowa, then a primary in New Hampshire, then primaries in South Carolina, Florida, and so on--boring stuff, we're all used to it. Mitt Romney is dully, ploddingly doing exactly what he needs to win this campaign. And then we have campaign No. 2. A tag team of quotable, viral-video-ready TV stars are taking turns as frontrunners. The press stages rigorous guessing games about which of them is going to surge next. Campaign No. 2 is suspenseful and entertaining. Sexual harassment! Migraines! Ellis the Elephant! Donald Trump's hair! Campaign No. 1 is as boring as the second draft of a Henry James novel. So it's been a really long time since we paid attention to campaign No. 1. Let's run a controlled experiment with the sidebar to the Cain drama, the other story of the week: the phantom, fantastical ""Gingrich surge."" You see, Newt Gingrich is about to surge. Paul Gigot says so. The Wall Street Journal's editorial page editor moderated a News Corp./College Board rap session about education last week, and Gingrich managed, somehow, to outshine and out-wonk a lineup that included Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. It got Gigot, one of the more influential conservative editorialists, thinking hard about Gingrich's I-can-win-this-thing spin. ""Voters are worried enough about the condition and direction of the country that they are willing to consider someone with proposals that are bolder than the political norm,"" writes Gigot. ""In a year when GOP voters are still searching for someone who can go head-to-head with President Obama, don't be surprised if Mr. Gingrich gets another turn in the spotlight."" We have read/endured some version of this story since Aug. 29, when Paul Bedard saw the first stirrings of a Newt comeback. (""In Missouri and Louisiana, for example, he is fourth behind Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, and Rep. Michele Bachmann."") The polls showed Gingrich creeping slowly up from high single digits to low double digits. Prefab Newtmania reached its dizzy heights on Monday night, when Monica Crowley got a chance to interview the man on Fox News. ""So, I am looking at these polls,"" said Crowley, ""and you are enjoying something of a surge. To what do you attribute that uptick?"" Tough question. ""I think part of it is just substance and real solutions,"" explained Gingrich. ""You are such a serious conservative intellectual,"" challenged Crowley. Gingrich has scabbed over the self-inflicted wounds of May, when he said that Paul Ryan's budget amounted to ""right-wing social engineering,"" happening too fast. He and Cain have proved that it's possible to win over Republican voters by saying big bold things and spending a lot of time on TV, instead of camping out in Iowa and New Hampshire. What they haven't proved is that they can beat Romney. The GOP base's flirtation with absolutely every other candidate has occurred as Romney's own support has firmed up. In New Hampshire, Romney started the year polling about 40 percent. That was soft, and he fell to 30 percent over the summer. He's back in the 40s now, stronger than any Republican was in the 2008 primary, much better than his eventual 32 percent finish. It's messier in Iowa. Four years ago, Romney was able to buy an early lead in the state with $10 million of TV ads and gimmicks like a 99-county bus tour led by his son Josh. (This was before The Walking Dead; weeks spent exploring highways in RVs were less creepy.) Romney started the year in the teens in Iowa, gulping for air amid a bunch of fantasy candidates like Sarah Palin. He's in the mid 20s now; he got 25 percent of the vote in the 2008 caucuses. Cain's surge has pushed him ahead of Romney in Iowa for now. Gingrich's big surge has put the former speaker and part-time book salesman roughly where he was eight months ago. Romney's slow, unnoticed progress in the polls has kept him out of the fray. He doesn't pander to siphon away support from another candidate. Romney hasn't changed any policies or promises in order to stave off one of the ""anti-Romneys."" Cain, Huntsman, Perry, and to a lesser extent Gingrich have proposed massive, regressive tax reform packages. Romney has stuck to his modest, Bush-like tax plan from earlier this year. The only new ideas he's absorbed have come from the House Republicans--the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" pledge that evolved out of the debt limit fight, the Ryan budget. Think of it like a solar system map. The House Republicans, with their visceral links to the GOP base, are the sun. Romney's a planet rotating around it. The other candidates are meteors that keep plunking into each other. You can see this in the televised debates, the forums where Cain and Gingrich keep thriving, and where Perry might have lost his shot to get into the race with Romney instead of the parallel campaign of the fringe. At Dartmouth, when he was offered up a chance to ask a candidate a question, Romney took the regular amount of flak on his health care plan, then tossed a puffball to Bachmann: ""What do you do to help the American people get back to work, be able to make ends meet?"" In the last debate, in Las Vegas, Romney took a different tack and punched down. The way he did it, though, revealed how little he had to fear from the parallel track candidates. Romney put a hold on Gingrich's usual monologues about ideas and boldness to remind him that he once supported a mandate-based health care plan. ""Wait a second,"" said Gingrich. ""What you just said is not true. You did not get that from me. You got it from the Heritage Foundation."" Over the next 20 seconds, Romney got the great intellectual to reverse himself. Did he once support a plan with a mandate? ""I absolutely did with the Heritage Foundation against Hillarycare."" It was a minor moment, but it was a reminder of something: Gingrich has only improved in polls because he's no longer getting (or deigning to answer) relevant questions about the campaign, or current policy. He's running a campaign of Ideas, things like abolishing judgeships if the judges rule the wrong way on whether ""under God"" should be in the Pledge of Allegiance. Romney's able to ignore this, completely. He's able to ignore 9-9-9. He gets to spend another week out of the news as Republican voters think harder about nominating a candidate who can win. Michele Bachmann, the one Republican candidate who's taken any kind of swing at Cain, said yesterday that the GOP can't afford ""any surprises"" with its nominee. That's an argument for the boring guy who came second in 2008, not an argument for her. Exactly one year ago, Pew's Project for Excellence in Journalism crunched the data on which candidates had gotten the most coverage in the midterms. The winner was not Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who would end up driving the Cut, Cap, and Balance plan that is now a plank of Romney's platform. It wasn't Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who is now the pivotal vote on the ""supercommittee"" who could propose tax hikes or gutted tax loopholes. It was Christine O'Donnell of Delaware, a perennial candidate who won a U.S. Senate primary in an upset and was set to lose the general election even before networks played and replayed a decade of dumb statements she'd made on TV. There were parallel campaigns in 2010, too--one in which a few exploiters of the ""Tea Party"" brand bungled elections, and one in which hundreds of Republicans ran smart campaigns and won. The more interesting campaign, with the hilarious characters and the comebacks by has-beens-- that's not the one likely to produce a president."

He has a week of Washington commitments ahead of him, but he'll spend Monday avoiding questions about the sexual harassment claims settled back when he ran the National Restaurant Association. Right at 9 a.m., when Cain was supposed to take a chair at AEI and discuss--ha, ha--his tax plans, a black SUV zoomed into the garage next to the think tank. Reporters chased it down, winter boots clanking, pursued by a security guard who had been watching their stakeout. Cain exited the SUV, wearing a black trench coat and black fedora that would have given him a mien of guilt if they weren't what he always wore in the cold. ""Do you have anything to say--"" ""About the allegations in Politico--"" ""Good morning!"" said Cain. He was whisked up to AEI's conference room, where moderator Kevin Hassett warned the crowd that ""questions have to be about the topic at hand."" Going into this, there were worries and tremors about whether Cain would even show up. What was the upside? The story broke at 8 p.m. Sunday. By 10 p.m., his spokesman J.D. Gordon had given Geraldo Rivera an exclusive interview in which he repeated talking points about the liberal media so robotically that he managed to convince the sympathetic host--""[Cain] may deserve much better than this""--that something was up. You could hear the flop sweat plopping through your speakers. By the time Cain was speaking at AEI, his chief of staff Mark Block was telling MSNBC that the story was ""questionable at best,"" even though the network was confirming pieces of it. Cain's task looked difficult. It wasn't. With presidential frontrunner status comes a sort of reality-distortion sphere, one that lets you avoid answering annoying questions as long as you make it hard to do. With Republican frontrunner status, you get a push-button army of defenders who spring into attack mode as fast as any leveled-up Pokemon. They wanted the story to be dismissed, the media minimized, the official response clear and concise. They would get at least one of these things. The reality-distorting bubble was impenetrable at AEI. Over a full hour, only one reporter tried to bend Hassett's rule. Jon Karl of ABC News asked a two-part question, saving the dirty stuff for Part 2. ""As you're well aware,"" he said, ""there is a big cloud right now that is affecting your ability to get this out, which is this story in Politico. And I was just wondering if you could clear up for us right now--did you ever ..."" ""That question is inconsistent with the ground rules of this event,"" said Hassett. ""He's going to be at the press club later today."" ""I'm going with the ground rules that my hosts have set,"" said Cain. ""Now, what was your other question?"" Later, he promised that he'll ""take all the arrows"" across town, so nobody should sweat it. Cain finished, and Hassett steered him toward an escape hatch, but the candidate turned back to tell the audience something important. ""Yes, I do have a sense of humor,"" he said. ""And some people have a problem with that. But to quote my chief of staff, and all the people I've talked to around this country: Herman, be Herman."" What did that mean? Cain headed off to a quiet space to finish strategizing the official response to the story: Answer everything, because he had nothing to apologize for. He was off to Fox News for the first of two interviews on the channel. His economic adviser Rich Lowrie, the maestro of the 9-9-9 tax plan, stuck around for a panel. Most of the crowd, there to see Cain, emptied out. (According to staff, there were already 16 cameramen RVSP'd for the speech even before the story broke.) For an hour, AEI remained home to a parallel universe much like our own, only this was one in which Cain was on track to become president, and no other issues were pertinent. Lowrie lingered to talk to every diehard about the power of 9-9-9. The new scandal didn't faze him. ""At some point, that story's going to die down,"" said Lowrie, ""and then we'll get back to this."" One of the fans leaving late, a Tea Party activist and real-estate agent who preferred to use the name ""Scout,"" dismissed the whole affair, compared it to ""the Clarence Thomas attack."" It was unfair, only coming out because ""they're scared of him."" Who, exactly? ""The blue team,"" she explained. This wasn't how it came off on Fox. Cain admitted that the gist of Politico's story--that there were settlements during his tenure at the restaurant association--is true. But he'd been blameless. ""Yes, I was falsely accused while I was at the National Restaurant Association,"" he said. ""I say falsely because it turned out, after the investigation, to be baseless."" He would say the exact same thing at the National Press Club. The place was packed. One staffer performed random checks of the people sitting in the cramped balcony that overlooks the newsmaker luncheon, ejecting them if they didn't have hard plastic press credentials. Cain easily eluded the rest of the press and arrived to take his seat at the front table, near Block and Gordon. He held up a cupcake with icing that read ""9-9-9""-- there were cupcakes like this all over the room, most of which disappeared as souvenirs. He showed it off to cameras, grinning, for nearly 90 seconds. The NPC format (""unchanged since FDR,"" boasts NPC president Mark Hamrick) is for the speaker to give a brief address, then take questions curated by the host. Hamrick made the first one an air-clearer about the Politico story. ""I would be delighted to clear the air!"" said Cain. He answered, but the air never penetrated his protective bubble. ""When the charges were brought,"" he says, ""as the leader of the organization, I recused myself and allowed my general counsel and my human resources officer to deal with the situation. And it was concluded, after a thorough investigation, that it had no basis."" This was actually new. In Politico's story, and in other comments from Cainworld, there was no hint that Cain even knew about the settlements. Hamrick asked Cain if he wanted the National Restaurant Association to clear things up some more. Cain said no. No more questions on the topic. For 30 minutes, Cain returned to his usual role--the straight-talking guy with an adviser for every problem and a silly streak. He let Lowrie swing for him on a tough question on taxes; Hamrick, looking quizzical, let it slide. Hamrick asked him to sing a song, and he actually did it."

The Obama White House had just rolled out the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, another fat, hanging pinata for CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" panelists. They took their turns, then went to the Chicago-based Santelli. For five minutes he ripped into the plan, calling it the sort of pay-the-losers nonsense that was wrecking America. ""We're thinking of having a Chicago Tea Party!"" Santelli shouted. ""All you capitalists that want to show up to Lake Michigan, I'm gonna start organizing . . . we're going to be dumping in some derivative securities!"" He'd just started a political movement. At the D.C. offices of FreedomWorks, a semi-obscure libertarian action center, Web designers quickly put a picture of Santelli on their home page. In the Atlanta suburbs, a struggling housewife named Jenny Beth Martin heard Santelli's rant and founded the organization that would become the Tea Party Patriots. Eight days later, there were Tea Party protests in 48 cities. ""I was taken aback to the nth power,"" Santelli remembers. ""I'd said many things like that on previous episodes.  . . .  I didn't have an inkling,"" he says, that a political force would flourish ""because I said the words Tea Party. "" Santelli likens the 2009 political climate to a tinderbox with lots of dry wood; he was just ""the guy who threw a match."" Is he right? Before his fiery speech, the right had been protesting President Obama but struggling for traction. Some of the groups that would drill the Tea Party into an electoral force, such as David Koch's Americans for Prosperity, were already campaigning against the $787 billion stimulus bill and the pro-union Employee Free Choice Act. But according to Jared Bernstein and other veterans of the White House's economic team, Santelli's rant and the subsequent rallies spooked the right people. Suddenly, a president who had entered office with a 70 percent approval rating had to explain why his policies made people so angry. ""The left had always protested,"" explains Brendan Steinhauser, director of state campaigns for FreedomWorks, now one of the most influential Tea Party groups. ""Conservatives getting out into the streets--that was a paradigm shift. Republicans were coming to us, asking how they could be more effective."" Now, insTead of fighting the GOP, a Party with a dingy brand and no credibility, the Democrats were fighting a new political force that voters kind of liked. If the Tea Party hadn't caught on, the Obama Team would be fighting the same conservative movement that it had defeated in 2008. And a few more victories could have meant life for some legislation that died prematurely. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel's ""big bang"" strategy of win after win after win could have happened -- if it hadn't been for all those people waving ""Don't Tread on Me"" flags and panicking about ""death panels"" when members of Congress went back to their districts. What bills could have passed in a Tea-Party-free America? For one, some kind of climate legislation to limit national greenhouse-gas emissions could have moved. One massive problem with the cap-and-trade bill that passed the House in June 2009 was that Democrats faced angry crowds at home when they defended it. That happened again and again on other issues, too, as Tea Partyers -- talking to each other online, tuning in to Glenn Beck -- would learn of some nightmare moving through Congress and turn their muskets on it. The in-person pressure, tactics they'd seen the left use for years, slowed down the Obama agenda. But the Obama agenda would have had tough going anyway. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) was determined to block the Democrats, and the Tea Party only helped him do it. So let's consider what the Tea Party prevented him from doing. McConnell wanted Trey Grayson, Kentucky's capable, conservative secretary of state, to be the next U.S. senator from that state. But the Tea Party made sure that Grayson lost to the libertarian scion Rand Paul. It brought down Sen. Bob Bennett in Utah, and it almost beat Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska. For two years, it declared war on any Republican who had backed the bank bailout or suggested compromising with Democrats. Without the Tea Party, there still would have been some GOP primary challenges. In many ways, the new movement just amplified what the Club for Growth was already doing--making life impossible for Republicans who voted for tax increases. But Republicans weren't proud to come from the Club; there's nothing particularly populist about a tax-exempt 527 organization that vacuums up money from the private sector. Without the Tea Party, the 2010 Senate bids by Mike Lee (Utah) and Marco Rubio (Florida) would have been tougher. And just as important, the Republicans who didn't face Tea Party challengers wouldn't have looked in their rear-view mirrors. The 2010 primaries--the wins and the threats--kept Republicans honest. In 1995, the GOP briefly fought a debt-limit vote but then balked. In 2011, there were rallies and new conservative power brokers demanding concessions in exchange for raising the debt limit. Without the Tea Party, Paul, Lee and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) wouldn't have been in the Senate to give the debt standoff form and focus. That is where this alternative history starts to look good to Republican leaders. The debt fight hit both parties, but it knocked the most out of the GOP.  As the party has turned its attention to the presidential race, it has watched the man with the most endorsements--Mitt Romney--spar with pretenders, candidates who shouldn't be competitive, given their fundraising and organizing limitations. Why is Herman Cain relevant? Because the Tea Party learned last year that it can demand the world--and nearly get it. A world without the Tea Party would have been a little brighter for the Republican establishment. But it wouldn't have been so bright for conservatives. They learned that there's nothing like a megaphone-blaring, flag-waving populist movement to move the country your way. That's why the Democrats now embracing the Occupy movement are kicking themselves for not getting into the streets sooner to protest Wall Street. Why did they ever imagine a world without it?"

This week, Slate staffers brainstormed a list of perplexing legal questions raised by the potential law. Proponents of the amendment say it's necessary to prevent abortions and other forms of birth control within the state. But as the New York Times pointed out on Tuesday, the proposal could also spawn an array of dilemmas for doctors, women with life-threatening pregnancies and in-vitro fertilization participants. To help us get a sense of the amendment's broader implications, Slate Editor David Plotz asked readers to submit their questions about what passing the proposal might mean. They responded in full force: As of this writing, there were over 1,000 comments on the post. Some of the questions readers posed were clearly tongue-in-cheek, but most indicated serious concerns over the measure's far-reaching potential. Here are some of the questions readers asked that caught our attention: 1. Could my wife use the carpool lane if she's pregnant, and how would the police be able to tell if she's lying? 2. Would Mississippi declare March 25 as Christmas Day? 3. Could I claim my frozen embryos as tax deductions? 4. Could a landlord or a hotel charge a pregnant woman for double occupancy? 5. If fertilization occurs just before a divorce, could the father get visiting rights or custody of the fetus? 6. Would the conception of a child have to be registered with the state? And would legal conceptions require a witness? 7. If a woman is on an individual health insurance plan, must she switch to family coverage while pregnant to receive prenatal care? 8. Could Mississippi force women of childbearing age to have monthly pregnancy tests during census years? 9. Would I be required to turn my birth control pills over to the state police upon crossing the Mississippi state line? 10. Would you be able to jail a pregnant woman? Would it be okay to keep a person (the fetus) in prison without a fair trial? 11. Would every miscarriage result in a murder investigation? Do we have enough detectives for that? 12. If I have a life-threatening pregnancy, can I get an abortion on the grounds of self-defense? Or would the police content themselves with investigating my subsequent painful death as a murder-suicide? 	"Slate Readers Ask Questions About Mississippi's Anti-Abortion Amendment

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/how_paul_ryan_tried_to_answer_the_supercommittee_and_ows_protest.html	"The seventh-floor auditorium at the Heritage Foundation was sardine-box-stuffed with interns, staffers, and reporters who had been promised a speech equal to our political moment: ""Rejecting Fear, Envy, and the Politics of Division."" Instead, the speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan, used the occasion to reframe a point he'd been making over and over for months. ""Instead of working together where we agree,"" said Ryan Wednesday, ""the president has opted for divisive rhetoric and the broken politics of the past. He is going from town to town, impugning the motives of Republicans, setting up straw men and scapegoats, and engaging in intellectually lazy arguments, as he tries to build support for punitive tax hikes on job creators."" A few blocks away, there was a group trying to do exactly what Ryan was calling for. The joint congressional ""supercommittee"" was meeting to discuss the options for long-term budget cuts. Democrats wanted to match the cuts with long-term tax hikes. Republicans were planning to kill any compromise that did that. Slightly farther away, Occupy Oakland protesters were gathering near City Hall after being tear-gassed the night before and subjected to mass arrests. So Ryan had two goals on Wednesday. He had to portray Occupiers and Democrats as un-American extremists. He also had to mark time, as Republicans wait for the supercommittee drama to end without what Democrats call ""going large""--big reforms that would demand some kinds of tax increases in exchange for entitlement cuts. The first part should have been easy. All Ryan really needed to do was generate a headline. Something like: ""Ryan, Obama Team Clash Over 'Class Warfare.' "" The actual class warfare clashes happening in major cities made most of the argument for him. Handy, that, because the data wasn't doing the trick. ""We are an upwardly mobile society with a lot of movement between income groups,"" Ryan said. ""The Treasury Department's latest study on income mobility in America found that during the 10-year period starting in 1996, roughly half of the taxpayers who started in the bottom 20 percent had moved up to a higher income group by 2005."" That's pretty much what the study says. It's from 2007. As of four years ago, it provided a rosy picture of economic mobility. But why stop four years ago? What Ryan didn't say was that more recently, Americans have been moving up and down between economic brackets at a punier rate than the French, or Germans, or Swedes, or some of the other peoples of Europe, the GOP's continental cautionary tale. One reporter tried to get at this, reminding Ryan of a brand-new CBO study of economic inequality. It had found that the ""wealthiest 1 percent""--the gorgons that the Occupiers want to stop slanting the economy for--had tripled their wealth from 1979 to 2007. Ryan said he hadn't heard the report. But would you like some bromides? ""If we try to go down the path where we put the government in the place where we try to equalize people's lives,"" he said, ""where we try to equalize outcomes, we'll all be equally miserable. Rather, let's focus on equality of opportunity. Let's focus on getting prosperity and economic mobility into those parts of America where they haven't seen them yet."" That's what the Occupiers are saying, too. They're just saying that the political system can't or won't fix it. The rest of Ryan's speech was essentially an acknowledgement of this. The threat facing America was the long-term deficit. The way to cut the deficit was flatter taxes (""tax reform must broaden the base and lower rates"") and entitlement cuts. ""Deficits are set to rise by a whopping $9.5 trillion over the next 10 years,"" he said. Allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for the wealthy would reduce the deficit's increase by only about 8 percent. Of course, that's just what Democrats want the supercommittee to do. That's what they have in common with the Occupiers. As Ryan finished, the committee's meeting was about halfway done, with CBO Director Doug Elmendorf taking all varieties of leading questions. When I got there, Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., was prodding him about the inequality report, and about the GOP's line that 47 percent of people don't pay income taxes. ""They don't owe anything because they haven't made anything, right?"" asked Clyburn. Elmendorf managed to maintain complete and total mathematic disinterest. Sen. John Kerry tried to get him to endorse a ""$3 trillion to $4 trillion"" package of tax increases and spending cuts--conveniently enough, that was what Democrats were offering behind the scenes. What if the top tax rate rose from 35 percent to 39.6 percent? Sure, Ryan had just said it would save on only 8 percent of the projected deficit. Wouldn't that be worth it? ""In our estimate,"" said Elmendorf, ""the negative effect of a larger debt would be larger than the positive effects of the tax rates."" This was about as much as Democrats could hope for: Paul Ryan and Doug Elemendorf admitted that taxing the wealthy a little more would reduce the deficit. Of course, Democrats have been stacking up quotes and admissions like this for years, and proving totally unable to force a discussion about higher taxes or inequality. The only positive sounds they were hearing from committee Republicans--especially freshman Sens. Rob Portman and Pat Toomey--were about some closing of loopholes and lowering of rates. This was stuff that House Republicans had never been open to. But there was an Occupier in the crowd. After Rep. Dave Camp finished speaking, she got up and walked right behind Elmendorf to give a short, awkward lecture. ""It's very clear, the American people want you to tax the rich and end the war. That's how we fix the deficit. All this obfuscation with percentages of GDP--that's just trying to confuse the issue."" She kept talking, repeating those basic points, for about 30 seconds. It took that long for Capitol police to pull her out of the room. She went easily, but not quietly. ""I represent the 99 percent,"" she said. The door swung shut."

The primary goal of the amendment, conceived and pushed by pro-life activists, is to bar all abortion in Mississippi, as well as the kinds of birth control that affect fertilized eggs. But the legal implications are much more profound: The amendment, writes the New York Times, ""effectively brand[s] abortion and some forms of birth control as murder,"" raising the possibility that doctors and even expectant women could be prosecuted for ending pregnancies. The amendment is expected to pass, but it would face immediate legal challenges, and is unlikely to survive intact. Still, it made us wonder about the weirder legal, political, and cultural effects of declaring embryos to be fully human. (Mississippi is not first to this idea: Philip Roth's satiric 1971 novel Our Gang was inspired by a Richard Nixon quote declaring that the unborn are legal people.) My Slate colleagues and I spent a few minutes imagining some of the possibilities raised by the Mississippi amendment.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/rick_perry_campaign_can_his_tax_plan_revitalize_it_.html	"If Rick Perry is going to reboot, he'll have to take one of them out of his mouth. Just before introducing an economic plan intended to reverse his campaign's slide, he engaged in his second flirtation with birtherism in just a few days. While the issue of Obama's birth was not important and a distraction, he told CNBC's John Harwood, ""It's a good issue to keep alive. It's fun to poke at him."" The same could be said about Perry's hunting camp, I suppose. Good issue to keep alive. Facts? Who cares. This is fun! You'd think a guy who has had questions raised about whether he's a racist might root around for his fun in other pursuits. But there's no need to get up on a high horse to think Perry's dalliance is cockeyed. Even a committed birther (nice hat! tinfoil?) can see how it's unwise to embrace this distraction at the moment you're trying to be treated seriously. Going birther may not affect a single vote, but it's a symbol of a lack of discipline. And discipline is a quality Perry will need if he's going to haul his campaign out of the tar pit it's in. In the latest CBS News poll, Perry is fifth among the contenders with 6 percent. Tea Party voters have thrown him overboard: 30 percent once supported him. Now only 7 percent do. He's doing equally poorly in the early primary and caucus states. To help fix this, Perry has brought on a slew of seasoned campaign hands. If only they'd gotten there a few days sooner: Ixnay on the irtherbay. Perry's embrace of the issue has flushed out Republican governors like Haley Barbour and Jeb Bush, who have told him to knock it off. Every campaign is a tug of war for a candidate's true self. ""Let Reagan be Reagan"" was the cry during the 1980 campaign, when Reagan's handlers were accused of making him act like a standard-issue candidate, hiding his true warmth and character. (Reagan ultimately shook up his staff, not unlike Perry has just now.) Perry has not wanted for authentic moments. They're what's killing him. His instinct--whether it was to call opponents of his tuition plan for immigrants heartless or to falsify the story of the HPV vaccine--were not the product of over-management. At the debates he conveyed a direct message from his gut: I'm sleepy and don't want to be here. Perry's economic plan, which centers around a 20 percent flat tax, is a possible vehicle for renewal. It's potentially more popular among conservatives than Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan. It allows him to blow off stupid side issues and say he wants to talk about more important things. Republican voters are not fixed in their views. Only 19 percent of those surveyed in the CBS poll say their mind is made up. He can use the plan to talk about his Texas record. Mostly it's meant to be a vehicle to convey his conviction, boldness and sense of leadership. That's why he could wrap up his speech introducing the plan with the rousing call ""Let's be the land of the free again!""  He can try to convey some of the twinkle and authenticity he did when talking about bedeviling Obama with birther talk on this issue people actually care about. Whether Perry can do any of this will depend on whether he can stop fishtailing and stay focused on his new message. (After two days and flirting with birtherism Perry finally tried to put a nail in it Tuesday.) He doesn't just need to stop coining new distractions. He needs to stay focused. He has to execute with some precision. Kinda-sorta getting the point across is not going to lift him out of the hole he's in. Perry likes to talk about his boldness. Of course, the really bold thing for him to do would be to play against type. When confronted with birtherism or anti-religious bigotry or questions about Obama's patriotism, he has exchanged candor for what he would call ""shape-shifting nuance."" It would be bolder to shun politics for a second. Humphrey did that in 1960 when he said he didn't want votes from people who didn't like Kennedy because he was a Catholic. McCain did it in 2008 when he defended Obama against the hecklers in his crowd. Newt Gingrich gave an eloquent defense of religious differences in the last debate. Of course those candidates lost, or are likely to. So maybe those are bad lessons. It's much more fun to win."	"Does Rick Perry have the discipline to revitalize his campaign?

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/mitt_romney_on_the_flat_tax_he_s_not_a_flip_flopper_.html	"President Obama's aides and allies have been working hard to put energy back in the ""Mitt Romney is a flip-flopper"" story. Today, the New York Times presented them with a new opportunity, with a story suggesting that Romney was embracing the flat tax after once opposing it. The Democratic National Committee sent out a memo to reporters: ""Imagine that--Mitt Romney Hedges (Flip-Flops) on an Issue."" The Democratic Party of New Hampshire issued a similar release. But Romney's statements about the flat tax show the opposite: He's been consistent over the years. In 1996, when Steve Forbes threw the Republican presidential primary into turmoil with his flat tax plan, Romney jumped into the fray. Using $50,000 of his own money, he bought full-page ads in New Hampshire and Des Moines bashing the idea. He called it a ""tax cut for fat cats"" because it did not tax dividends, capital gains or interest. The flat 17 percent tax would mean taxes for ""Kennedys, Rockefellers and Forbes[es]"" would be  ""DOWN or GONE,"" read the ad. Taxes on ""you"" would be ""UP and UP!"" (Forbes didn't forget. On Monday he endorsed Perry, who is offering a flat tax of his own in a speech Tuesday.) Usually Republicans balk when Democrats start talking about the difference between the poor, the middle class, and the wealthy. Romney was not alone in making this distinction in 1996. Dole warned the ""middle class will take it on the chin."" Lamar Alexander, Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm--who called himself a ""blue-collar Republican""--also criticized the plan because it would allow the wealthy to live off investment income without paying taxes. Newt Gingrich was also against that provision. ""That's nonsense,"" Gingrich said at the time. ""That's not going to happen."" The Forbes response was that the money had already been taxed once at the corporate level. One of Forbes' key points was that removing double taxation was a matter of fairness. At the time, Romney said he liked the flat tax in theory. ""There are a number of flat tax proposals around that would be better than the tax system we have now,"" he told the Boston Globe at the time. ""The middle class should be the priority for a tax cut,"" he said. ""Those are the people struggling to pay college tuitions and make families work."" That answer from 1996 sounds almost identical to one Romney gave on the flat tax last Thursday in Sioux City, Iowa. In a town hall meeting, Romney was asked about the tax code, and in his response he brought up the flat tax. ""The flat tax has positive features. Then you have to make sure it doesn't raise taxes on middle income Americans. For me one of the key criteria in looking at tax policy is we help the people who need the help most. In our country the people who need the help most are in the middle class."" To help the middle class, Romney's current economic recovery package eliminates all taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest for those making less than $200,000. Here he runs into something that's not a flip-flop so much as an amusing irony: His plan won't make much of a difference for the middle class. Only a small percentage of the people who incur those taxes make less than $200,000. Who says? Why, Mitt Romney--in 1996. His ad cited those three famously wealthy families because it's the rich, not the middle class, that benefit most from elimination of capital gains, dividends, and interest taxes. The Times story digs up a quote from August of this year, in which Romney says, ""I love the flat tax."" But the rest of that quote contains all the usual ifs and buts. Since 1996 Romney has held essentially the standard GOP view, which is in support of effective and politically unrisky tax simplification. Taxes should be flat but not without hurting the middle class, which means retaining some of the trinkets and loopholes in the current code, such as the mortgage interest deduction. Flat-tax purists say that's not really a flat tax, which is why Romney and others talk about a ""flatter tax."" Now that we've cleared this up, can we all agree that the Democrats have achieved their goal? People have been given another opportunity to think about Mitt Romney as a flip-flopper. And while they're thinking, they might judge other evolutions in that same vein. In that 1996 ad, Romney lists a host of priorities he says the candidates should focus on instead of the flat tax. In addition to balancing the budget and reducing the number of abortions, he also lists campaign-finance reform and universal health care--issues he doesn't talk about much in 2011."

Rick Scott called for reductions in state appropriations for particular academic disciplines so that public universities can focus resources on producing graduates in the STEM fields--science, technology, engineering, and math. This shift, he claims, would better serve the state by spurring job creation. For some reason, he seemed especially concerned that Florida universities might be producing too many anthropologists. He was quoted as saying: ""We don't need a lot more anthropologists in the state. ... I want to spend our dollars giving people science, technology, engineering, and math degrees. That's what our kids need to focus all their time and attention on, those types of degrees, so when they get out of school, they can get a job."" As a university president, I can assure Gov. Scott that his approach to both higher education and economic development is misguided and counterproductive. The notion that we must strip away academic programs not seemingly relevant to workforce development reflects a simplistic and retrograde view of the role of higher education in the American economy. The governor is correct in one regard: The imperative to advance STEM education cannot be overstated. Given the importance of scientific discovery and technological innovation to our national competitiveness, we should focus on increasing the quantitative, scientific, and technological literacy of all of our students. But resolving the complex challenges that confront our nation and the world requires more than expertise in science and technology. We must also educate individuals capable of meaningful civic participation, creative expression, and communicating insights across borders. The potential for graduates in any field to achieve professional success and to contribute significantly to our economy depends on an education that entails more than calculus. Curricula expressly tailored in response to the demands of the workforce must be balanced with opportunities for students to develop their capacity for critical thinking, analytical reasoning, creativity, and leadership--all of which we learn from the full spectrum of disciplines associated with a liberal arts education. Taken together with the rigorous training provided in the STEM fields, the opportunities for exploration and learning that Gov. Scott is intent on marginalizing are those that have defined our national approach to higher education. The significance of a liberal arts curriculum for engineering students, for example, has been underscored by recommendations from within the National Academy of Engineering. James Duderstadt, president emeritus of the University of Michigan and an international figure in engineering education, has argued that professional demands in the various fields of engineering have become sufficiently complex to warrant greater emphasis on broadly based undergraduate preparation in anticipation of subsequent specialization at the graduate level, consistent with professional education in law and medicine. It is essential that we develop in our students the ability to understand the complexity and interrelatedness of our cultural, economic, natural, political, social, and technological systems. The point here is that we need all of the skill sets from anthropology to zoology as well as transdisciplinary perspectives to reinvigorate programs in civil engineering. Inspired engineering, in other words, could come as a consequence of familiarity with the development of counterpoint in Baroque music or cell biology. Or even the construction methods of indigenous tribes. Moreover, if we were to restrict opportunities for higher education only to the set of degrees associated with science, technology, engineering, and math, we would in fact oversupply the workforce with capacity in technological transformation and undersupply the knowledge-based economy with the broader set of skills necessary for high-speed, creativity-driven innovation. The objective of public universities should not be to produce predetermined numbers of particular types of majors but, rather, to focus on how to produce individuals who are capable of learning anything over the course of their lifetimes. Every college student should acquire thorough literacy in science and technology as well as the humanities and social sciences. Every student should have an understanding of complexity and sustainability and decision-making matched with a general awareness of entrepreneurship and business. From this breadth of experience, students gain the perspective and focus necessary to succeed in any academic field and subsequent career trajectory. Given the multiple dimensions and global interconnectedness of many professional sectors, the trend toward choosing two or even three majors is entirely appropriate. Needless to say, the challenge is to design universities that have the capacity to produce such individuals who are also ready to work within the contexts of initially narrower assignments. At the end of the day, the objective of our universities, both public and private, should be to create teaching, learning, and discovery environments capable of producing learners of the highest caliber. Differentiated learning platforms must accommodate the immense variability in types of intelligence and creativity that have made the United States the dominant source of innovation worldwide. Within this context, it is critically important that students develop the ability to move from subject to subject and problem to problem, and from environment to environment and opportunity to opportunity, in ways that unleash and utilize their innate capacities and creative potential. Such mental agility will allow them to establish new business enterprises, scientific or technological capabilities, social initiatives, and creative endeavors in every sector of the economy. It may come as a surprise to Gov. Scott, but the perpetual innovation that drives our economy could even be inspired by anthropologists."	"Memo to Florida Gov. Rick Scott: America Needs Anthropologists as Well as Engineers

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/can_mitt_romney_win_in_iowa_he_s_beginning_to_think_so.html	"SIOUX CITY, Iowa--Iowa is a dusty place this time of year. Billows rise up from the combines in the field as the corn is harvested. Your eyes get scratchy. But no dust sticks to Mitt Romney. He is the stainless-steel candidate: precise, technically flawless, and lacking warmth. ""I love this country,"" he said at the end of his town hall at Morningside College Thursday morning. ""I hope I made that clear. I didn't say that as directly as I'd like to: I love America."" Yes, he was sincere, and, yes, the delivery was synthetic. This was Romney's first visit to the state since the Ames straw poll in August, so he had some explaining to do. ""I'll be back again and again,"" he said. ""I'd like to win Iowa."" Throughout the day he told Iowans how important they were to the electoral process. The Romney campaign has been coy about how hard it's going to campaign in Iowa in an attempt to lower the stakes so that if Romney doesn't do well, no one will draw larger conclusions about the weakness of his candidacy. But it is becoming increasingly clear among Iowa's political class that Romney can win Iowa. And if he were to win the caucuses here, his strength in New Hampshire would make him almost impossible to beat for the nomination. Romney has a chance to do well in Iowa because he starts with a solid base of available voters. He won 26 percent of the vote in 2008. If you add the percentages other moderate candidates such as Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson and John McCain received, that's another 27 percent of the electorate that may be inclined to consider him. And there are signs that social conservatives are willing to give him a fresh look, too. In 2008 James Lewis of Sioux City voted for Mike Huckabee. But Lewis is going with Romney this year. Why? ""I went with Huckabee because I liked his values stance,"" Lewis says. ""Today the values are important, but cutting spending and getting the economy back rather than bailing out the banks is more important."" Romney has one of the best organizations in Iowa, but it's hidden. The theory is that if it stays active but under the radar, it can make a smash-and-grab at the last minute if the environment is right. ""They have kept Mitt Romney's name in front of my face every week,"" says Steve Armstrong, chairman of the Linn County Republican Party. ""He may be out of view in Iowa, but he's not out of view on e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter."" The question is whether the vestigial support Romney worked so hard to earn in 2008 is like a car battery that has sat dormant all winter. Can it be turned on easily, or will it require more of the retail politicking Iowans pride themselves on demanding? The non-Romney vote is so split and the issues of this election are so favorable, Romney may not have to work that hard to do well in Iowa. On the other hand, if someone like Rick Perry were to take off, Iowa would become a geographic symbol of the fact that he hasn't been able to gain more than one-quarter of the electorate's support in the polls despite all the time Romney has spent campaigning, his natural fit for the economic moment, and Republican voters' desire for someone who can beat President Obama. As he toured the Western part of the state, Romney was all business all day. Even in rural areas, he campaigned in his natural habitat, sitting in the ersatz leather swivel chair the end of a conference table of business leaders at a local bank in Treynor, speaking at the Council Bluffs Chamber of Commerce. He stressed his 25 years in business about as often as the rest of us inhale and exhale. ""I love you. I love business,"" Romney said in Council Bluffs. He talks about himself as ""a business guy,"" in the detached, third-person way Bob Dole used to talk about ""Bob Dole."" To the extent that Romney ever struts, it's when talking about his inner CEO. ""I am a capable enough business guy to know when people are blowing smoke and when they're not,"" he said when explaining how he would determine what federal programs should stay and which ones should go. The questioner had asked about farm supports, which Romney said he may or may not continue to support. ""I'm not running for office based on making promises about handing out money--more money for schools, more money for farmers."" Romney said Obama didn't know how to lead. That's not a new critique, but Romney's emphasis was on how Obama lacked the leadership skills necessary to build consensus with the other party. Referring to his own time in Massachusetts with a heavily Democratic legislature, Romney argued that he knew how to compromise without compromising his principles. In 2008 Obama ran as a bipartisan consensus builder based on his theory of how it might be done at the executive level. Romney argues he has the practical knowledge. For a state in which 60 percent of the caucus voters describe themselves as evangelicals, Romney stressed electability. He mentioned social issues only once--in an awkward exchange with a woman about birth control. She asked him if he knew that an abortion pledge he'd agreed to sign, which stipulated that life begins at conception, prohibited the use of birth control. She cared, she said, because she used birth control. He said he didn't support blocking birth control. Romney acted as if Tuesday's acrimonious debate in Las Vegas hadn't happened.  He was so focused on Obama and the general election that he made only the most glancing reference to his opponents. In response to a question about immigration, he noted that one of his rivals (Perry, though he didn't name him) had supported a program to give in-state tuition rates to the children of illegal aliens. Though Romney's aides tamp down talk of inevitability--they do not mind the repeated rise of alternative candidates--their candidate sounded pretty confident that his focus on the general election was warranted. ""There s a good shot I might be the president of the United States,"" he told the business leaders in Treynor. ""If I do, I will benefit from your thoughts."" If it sometimes seems as if Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rushing around in their headspace looking for facts to string together, Romney is the opposite. He knows the details of energy expenditure and output in ethanol production. He knew the kinds of cattle raised and the graduation rates of the local school district. At the roundtable with local business leaders, he dished out his fair share of generalities. But it was clear, as he connected the dots between the comments of the feed lot operator and the ethanol producer, that he was actually listening.  His only slight slip was that he was about $2 off on the price of a bushel of corn. He will never get that fact wrong again."	"Mitt Romney Returns to Iowa, and This Time He Means Business
