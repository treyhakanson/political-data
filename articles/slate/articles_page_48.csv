Through Monday, about 908,000 U.S. Senate-focused TV ads have aired this election cycle, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of preliminary data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking firm. With a week's worth of advertising yet to be tallied, to say nothing of the deluge of messaging that would flood anticipated runoff contests in Georgia and Louisiana, the million-ad mark will be eclipsed soon. Last week alone, candidates, party committees, super PACs, nonprofit groups, and others together produced 83,000 U.S. Senate-focused ads--more than any other single week during the 2014 election cycle. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee, and pro-Democrat super PAC Senate Majority PAC were tops among about 110 U.S. Senate-related ad sponsors. Most of the ads contained highly negative content, as Republicans are fighting to capture six seats needed to win control of the U.S. Senate. North Carolina's race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan and Thom Tillis, her Republican rival, drew more ads last week than any other contest--about 11,000 from Oct. 21 through Monday. That's more than one ad per minute, on average. Meanwhile, in Iowa, where Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and GOP state Sen. Joni Ernst are battling for an open seat in the wake of Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's retirement, voters saw about one U.S. Senate-focused ad a minute. And in both Colorado and Georgia, voters were subjected to about two TV ads every three minutes, according to the Center for Public Integrity's analysis of estimates provided by Kantar Media/CMAG. U.S. Senate races in Louisiana, Kansas, Kentucky, and Arkansas all saw about one TV ad every two minutes last week. That illustrates a massive change in the dynamics of Kansas' race. During the week after Labor Day, for example, Kansas TV viewers only saw, on average, one U.S. Senate-focused ad every 22 minutes. In Kansas, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts is being challenged by independently wealthy independent Greg Orman--the Democratic candidate dropped out of the race in early September--and the state's U.S. Senate race has unexpectedly turned into a dead heat. Conversely, in Michigan, TV viewers have recently received more of a reprieve. There, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters is running against Republican Terri Lynn Land for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Carl Levin. In early and mid-September, Michigan's U.S. Senate race ranked among the hottest in the country, attracting nearly one TV ad every two minutes at its height. But last week, the contest saw only about 1,700 TV ads--about one spot every six minutes. Twelve other U.S. Senate races drew more ads last week. Recent polls have shown Peters with a solid lead, which may largely explain the TV ad decline. While the tone of last week's U.S. Senate ads remain, on balance, overwhelmingly negative, a few of the most spite-filled states found themselves filled with slightly less bane. Notable among them: North Carolina, the most negative U.S. Senate race in the nation for mid-October. The week before last, the Tar Heel State played host to more than 10,800 U.S. Senate-focused ads--and all but two-dozen of them contained at least some negative content, attacking either Hagan or Tillis. But last week, about 530 of North Carolina's more than 11,000 U.S. Senate-focused TV ads--roughly 5 percent--curbed the negativity for messages that strictly promoted one of the candidates. So, how ugly is North Carolina's political discourse these days? Ugly enough that an exasperated child at Vance Elementary School in Raleigh, North Carolina, wrote a letter to Hagan and Tillis asking them, in the name of respect and civility, to chill the heck out. ""All I hear in your ads are you saying mean things about each other,"" student Carson Park wrote. ""Will you act like this after the election? Seeing the ads on TV makes me sad and I don't want to vote."" But one class of people--broadcasters--is enjoying the advertising boom. KUSA-TV 9 in Denver, where more than 900 U.S. Senate-related ads ran last week, attracted more than any other station in the country. It's followed by KMGH-TV in Denver; WHO-TV 13 in Des Moines, Iowa; WSOC-TV 9 in Charlotte, North Carolina; KAKE-TV 10 in Wichita, Kansas; and KSNW-TV 3 also in Wichita, according to the analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data. For the first time in three weeks, WMUR-TV 9 in New Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is locked in a close race against Republican Scott Brown, didn't air the most U.S. Senate-related TV ads during a one-week period. This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C."	We Are About to Reach 1 Million U.S. Senate Ads

Bush. That might sound premature, as the state still has two Democratic senators, a Democratic governor, a Democrat-controlled House of Delegates, and a Democrat-controlled state Senate. But it isn't. Next week, it's almost guaranteed that the state will send a Republican to the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1958. There's also a realistic chance that all three of West Virginia's congressional seats will be filled by Republicans. In 2012, it elected its first Republican attorney general in almost 100 years. And it's voted for the Republican presidential nominee in every election of this millennium. West Virginia used to be blue. It's not anymore. Here's how that happened. Historically speaking, West Virginia was reliably cobalt until 2000. Coal dominated the state's economy, and unions dominated its politics. There was also deep-seated, long-lasting loyalty to the party of FDR. Mike Plante, a Charleston-based Democratic consultant, says that WPA projects dotting the state are constant visual reminders of the New Deal's impact. And West Virginians didn't just love FDR: Eleanor Roosevelt also won affection for helping start Arthurdale, a planned community for economically disadvantaged West Virginians. John F. Kennedy was also beloved. Though the state had a tiny Catholic population in 1960, he worked hard to win it in the Democratic primary (a victory that was key to winning the Democratic nomination). On a rainy day in 1963, he gave a speech in the statehouse courtyard that included a line West Virginia Democrats have been quoting ever since: ""The sun does not always shine in West Virginia, but the people always do."" They liked him, a lot. But by 2000, tectonic changes in the state's politics were underway. West Virginians tended to be economically liberal but socially conservative, and as social issues like abortion came to the forefront in national politics, the state started looking better for Republicans. The leftward tilt of the national Democratic Party helped matters, too. And in 2000, that shift in the state--from blue to purple--caught Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore off guard. Former West Virginia Democratic Party chairman George Carenbauer, who worked on Bill Clinton's West Virginia presidential campaigns, said Gore's team ignored warnings that they needed to fight to win the Mountain State. ""I think they spent $300 there or something,"" he says with a laugh. George W. Bush and his strategists saw polling that indicated that the state could be in play, so they outspent the vice president there, and they won it. Bush won the presidential election by 5 Electoral College votes, the same number allotted to West Virginia. For Democrats, it's been downhill from there. West Virginia has voted for the Republican nominee in every subsequent presidential election. And in the 2012 Democratic presidential primary, President Barack Obama beat prison inmate Keith Judd by just 16 percentage points. Part of the reason for the president's popularity problem is--no debate here--coal. The Environmental Protection Agency's tough new coal regulations have hit the state's economy hard. And though Democrats, including Plante, argue that the story of the state's economic woes is more complicated than ""Obamacare and the war on coal are taking all your jobs,"" that's largely the message voters have heard. And it's a message that, per Carenbauer, has gone largely unchallenged by the state's Democrats. ""Democrats have accepted being on the defensive,"" he said. ""That's the most frustrating thing."" He added that West Virginia is one of the states that could benefit most from the Affordable Care Act, but that Democrats have done an ineffective job of communicating this to voters. ""Can you imagine FDR being on the defense in West Virginia for Social Security?"" he said. The Republican Senate nominee, Shelley Moore Capito, will probably walk away with a win. She'll be the first Republican to win a Senate race there since 1958, and she'll make it look easy. The state's two competitive House races are both toss-ups, so it wouldn't be shocking (and it certainly wouldn't buck the trend lines) for West Virginia to send an all-Republican House delegation to Congress in 2015. But even more significantly, Republicans could flip the House of Delegates. ""Republicans have their best chance in 80 years of gaining control of the House of Delegates,"" said longtime West Virginia radio broadcaster Hoppy Kercheval, ""and because of that, they've recruited good candidates, they've run aggressive campaigns."" He added that labor unions have responded with a $1 million ad campaign aimed at keeping that from happening. It's an enormous amount of money to be spent on state legislative races (in a state with a fairly cheap media market, no less), and it indicates they're taking Republicans' ambitions seriously. So here's a hypothetical: Let's assume that this fall Republicans win the House of Delegates, and narrow Democrats' majority in the state Senate. And let's also assume that they win the race for the governorship in 2016--it will be open, as the incumbent Democrat Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin will be term-limited out--and that they then consolidate their control of the state Senate. Then what? Per Americans for Tax Reform state affairs manager Paul Blair, who keeps close tabs on the state, Republicans would likely flirt with a right-to-work bill and some form of paycheck protection legislation. In other words, it's possible there would be a head-on collision with the interests of organized labor. And if that happens, things could be very interesting in West Virginia in 2017. ""With regard to so-called 'right-to-work' legislation, it could become a rally point for labor and revitalize the labor-progressive coalition,"" Plante said. Republican state governments have happily taken on unions in deep-blue Michigan and Wisconsin. West Virginia could be next."	How Republicans Turned a Democratic Stronghold Into the Newest Red State
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/al_jazeera_america_s_reveals_massive_gop_voter_suppression_effort_millions.html	"Let's assume--despite what  most liberals suspect--that the most vocal voter ID boosters are sincere. That, as National Review's Rich Lowry argues in Politico, they want nothing more than to protect the vote from fraud with a minor imposition on the time and effort of prospective voters. ""Where you come down on this issue,"" he writes, ""really depends on whether you think it's reasonable to require the minimal effort to establish your identity by producing an ID at the ballot box or not."" Fair enough. That's a reasonable sentiment. Despite substantial evidence to the contrary, Republicans and other voter ID supporters don't want to make it harder for more vulnerable voters to cast a ballot--although that's the practical outcome of an ID requirement--they just want to secure the process and protect the integrity of the vote. But this doesn't explain the Republican-led push to end or limit same-day registration (condemned by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as a ""trick"") and early and weekend voting, procedures used most by minorities, black Americans in particular. Nor does it explain an incredible effort just uncovered by Al Jazeera America that could shift the direction of the midterm elections. According to a six-month-long investigation conducted by Greg Palast for Al Jazeera, ""voting officials in 27 states, almost all of them Republicans, have launched what is threatening to become a massive purge of black, Hispanic, and Asian-American voters. Already, tens of thousands have been removed from voter rolls in battleground states, and the numbers are set to climb."" Specifically, officials have a master list of 6.9 million suspected ""potential double voters."" And in Virginia, Georgia, and Washington the lists are ""heavily over-weighted with names such as Jackson, Garcia, Patel, and Kim,"" all common to Democratic-leaning minority groups. The process for checking those names, a computer program called Crosscheck--touted by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a vocal supporter for voter identification--is incredibly inaccurate. ""The actual lists,"" notes Al Jazeera America, ""show that not only are middle names mismatched, and suffix discrepancies ignored, even conflicting birthdates are disregarded. Moreover, Crosscheck deliberately ignores any Social Security mismatches, in the few instances when the numbers are even collected."" Given the tight races in Georgia and other battleground states, even a small number of false positives could turn the tide of an election, giving a strong advantage to Republican candidates for statewide and congressional offices. Yes, voting officials have to prune the rolls of deceased or inactive voters. The question is whether they're taking the narrowest route and trying to avoid mistakes. They aren't; compared with other voter lists, Crosscheck is incredibly broad with a strong bias toward removing people from the rolls. And the means for verifying voter identity--sending postcards to addresses on file--puts the burden of proof on individual voters and is almost designed to take people off the rolls; with false positives and duplicate names, there's no guarantee that anyone gets their verification card, to say nothing of voters who have moved or don't have a permanent address. Whether Republican officials are trying to nudge the electorate in the GOP's favor is almost beside the point--since, intentions aside, that's what's happened. And when you take this out of its isolation chamber and put it in context--a world where Republicans want voter identification and reduced early voting and stiffer registration laws--it looks like a pattern of deliberate suppression, where some officials prune voter rolls with lists of minorities while others make it harder to vote altogether. This news comes just a day after the verdict in Georgia, where a state judge denied a petition from the New Georgia Project--a group that spearheaded registration drives across the state--to process 40,000 missing registration forms, striking a blow to voter mobilization efforts in the state. Last month, after it submitted 80,000 forms, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp accused the group of fraud and opened an investigation into its voter drives. Soon after, thousands of forms went missing, prompting this lawsuit. Again, it's the pattern that makes this suspect; the consistent effort from GOP officials, lawmakers, and judges to make voting more difficult, or facilitate efforts in that direction. Conservatives across the country are working to weaken voting laws and put new barriers to the ballot box. And in every case, Democratic constituencies are those most affected. Which is why it's hard to take pro-ID arguments--like Rich Lowry's--in good faith. Liberal and Democratic claims of voter suppression aren't just about voter identification, they're about the package of policies and techniques that burden voters and shrink the electorate in the process. Indeed, it's worse than this. Voter ID advocates insist that their reasonable moves are intended to protect the integrity of the process and the sanctity of the vote, but the reality is that their policies have created confusion and chaos for hundreds of thousands of voters. Put another way, there's not a serious Republican effort to expand the electorate and bring new people into the process. But there is a major one to do the opposite. And it hasn't popped up in response to threats to the sanctity of the vote--even conservatives are beginning to acknowledge there isn't much voter fraud--it's emerged in a world where electorates are increasingly filled with people who don't support Republicans. It's brazen, it's indefensible, and it needs to end."	The GOP's Most Brazen Attempt at Voter Suppression Yet
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/house_republicans_have_been_unproductive_that_won_t_change_even_if_republicans.html	"Even on their own terms, House Republicans have been stunningly unproductive. It's not as if they've had a large agenda. Writing at Bloomberg View, Jonathan Bernstein counts four major promises: to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, to pass piecemeal immigration reform instead of a comprehensive bill, to reform the tax code with a broader base and lower rates, and to sue President Obama for ad hoc rulemaking with Obamacare and the employer mandate. Yes, the realities of divided government mean that almost nothing the House passes would clear the Senate, much less become law. Still, there's symbolic value in acting on priorities. Other than a few dozen repeal votes for Obamacare, however, the GOP has all but ignored acting on these goals in favor of just talking about them. Take the Affordable Care Act. In January, Senate Republicans offered an alternative--called the Patient CARE Act--that would repeal Obamacare but preserve popular provisions like dependent coverage up to age 26 and an end to pre-existing conditions restrictions. It wouldn't aim for near-universal coverage--a cornerstone of the ACA--but it was something. The House never got that far. Rep. Eric Cantor promised to move on a replacement during the House Republican retreat, but he lost his seat to his right-wing primary challenger, Dave Brat. After that, the plan for a replacement went by the wayside. Republicans still voiced their support for a plan--""I am ready to debate the difference between the Affordable Care Act and what's in our bill,"" said Rep. Phil Roe, co-chairman of the House GOP Doctors Caucus, in July--but there was no bill to discuss, much less hearings for ideas and proposals. At this point, it's a political Detox--allegedly in production, and occasionally glimpsed, but never released. The situation is just as bad with tax reform. Shortly after Cantor announced his plan to pursue conservative health reform, House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp released his tax reform plan, which met the stated Republican goal of lower rates, fewer brackets, and greater aid for families with children. What's more, it ended the carried interest loophole, imposed a new fee on banks, and slashed various industry subsidies. But Republican leaders weren't interested. When asked if the GOP would adopt Camp's proposal as its official position on tax reform, House Speaker John Boehner scoffed. ""You're getting a little bit ahead of yourself,"" he told a reporter. Wall Street threatened Republicans over Camp's bank fee--canceling commitments for ""big dollar fundraising""--dooming the proposal to a quick death. Since then, there's been zero action on changing the tax code, although Republicans say they want to revisit the issue next year, if they win control of the Senate. With immigration reform, it suffices to say that after a year of discussion on ""piece-by-piece"" reform, there's nothing in the GOP pipeline. At most, Boehner has said he can bring his party along on reform if Obama declines executive action. ""That would poison the well,"" he said. ""And I've told the president this directly: If you want to get immigration reform done, and you want to get it right, don't do things that will poison the well."" The problem, as Dara Lind notes for Vox, is that Boehner has made this deal before:"	No Matter What Happens, House Republicans Aren't About to Become Productive
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/republican_candidates_won_t_win_a_mandate_the_midterm_elections_will_only.html	"Republicans are going to pick up seats in both houses of Congress. They may even take control of the Senate. Those victories will provide an unequivocal mandate for support of one proposition: widespread dislike of President Obama. That's it. More than $4 billion will be spent on the 2014 campaign, and when it's over, that will be the message on the little slip of paper that emerges from that huge machine of activity. This year's contest is a no-mandate election, in which the winning side will succeed with no great animating idea other than the fear (or avoidance) of the Obama nightmare. Republican debates, speeches, and advertisements have been so thoroughly concerned with the president and how much the Democrat on the ballot agrees with him, there is no other message that competes. That's a smart political strategy, but it's not a governing strategy. Republicans may take control of Congress, but it will have been by clobbering a president they'll then have to work with at a time when a majority of Americans say they want leaders in Washington to compromise. But a majority of Americans are not a majority of the voters who will likely give the winning party their tide-turning victory. According to a recent Pew survey, 61 percent of Republican voters consider their congressional ballot as a vote against the president, up from 56 percent in 2010 when anti-Obamacare fervor caused Democrats to lose 63 seats in the House and six seats in the Senate. Republicans are likely to make the bulk of their gains in the seven states Mitt Romney won in 2012, six of which he won by double digits. In Arkansas--a state Obama lost by 24 points--Republican Senate candidate Tom Cotton said Obama's name 74 times in his 90-minute debate against Sen. Mark Pryor, prompting the Pryor campaign to make this hypnotic video. As Dan Balz pointed out in the Washington Post, this campaign may be about nothing, but it's still about Obama. In states like Colorado, Iowa, and North Carolina, which do not tilt heavily toward the right, Republican victories will nevertheless be spurred by dislike of Obama because that's what candidates are running on in those states. GOP candidates have mentioned they prefer less regulation, lower taxes, and a reformed version of Obamacare, but simply mentioning a preference isn't the same as running on a set of ideas. Political communication requires repetition. When you really want to drive home a message, you drill it right into the brainpan. Ads by Karl Rove's Crossroads PAC are an example of the form. In North Carolina, Crossroads is running an ad where a child is asked to spell the name of the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Kay Hagan. ""Hagan. O-B-A-M-A,"" says the girl. ""Close enough,"" say the three judges. A similar version of the ad is running in other states. Two other closing-stretch Crossroads ads in North Carolina are also focused entirely on Obama. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has made the same point in the race. It's like this in all the close races. A press release sent out one week before Election Day from the National Republican Congressional Committee called ""closing argument,"" says: ""We released our final ads of the cycle today and President Obama is featured in almost all of them. These closing argument ads demonstrate just how toxic Obama has become for House Democrats.""* The only policy prescription that comes remotely close to matching the anti-Obama mantra is the promise to secure the boarder, which is still pretty vague. This is the difference between the GOP's congressional wing and its governors. Among GOP governors, the mantra has been that you must run on ideas in order to build a mandate to implement them. That is the gospel promoted by Govs. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Mitch Daniels, the former governor of Indiana, popular Republicans held up as models of how to turn campaign successes into governing progress for conservative ideas. (That is why those governors were critical of Romney for running an anti-Obama campaign that didn't emphasize much of a policy vision.) That's also why GOP governors have been using their Washington counterparts as a foil. They offer themselves as the wing of the Republican Party that gets things done, implicitly (or not so implicitly) distancing themselves from the solution-free part of the party. In the congressional wing, success comes from being fuzzy on ideas. The 2014 midterms aren't the first time that a lack of a governing agenda served as part of the Republican playbook for getting elected. In 2010, the GOP won the House with a program that rested on the vaguest mush pulled together as a unified program. Democrats had no unifying message when they ran against Bush in 2006 either, other than his unpopularity. When you run on no platform and win, it means the mandate is up for grabs. That means there will be some exciting debates among Republicans and conservatives in 2015. If the GOP takes control of the Senate because of red-state victories in states Romney won by double digits, that's not a recipe for compromise. In a recent Wall Street Journal poll, 38 percent of Republicans said new members should compromise; only 32 percent of Tea Party voters agreed. (Fifty-one percent of Independents and 68 percent of Democrats wanted compromise.) Do you dance with the conservative electorate that brought you or the more moderate electorate that you're going to face in 2016? Because, in the next election cycle, Republican senators are up for reelection in Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, all states that President Obama won. The jockeying for the 2016 GOP nomination will supercharge this debate. The stakes are high. Republicans will be trying to fashion a unified agenda without the ratifying clarity that can come from an election, while a public with little patience looks on. Voters trust Republicans on a host of issues from national security to the economy, but they also have a low opinion of the party. In the Pew poll, 38 percent say they have a favorable view of the Republican Party, while 54 percent express an unfavorable view of the GOP. The public remains divided in its outlook of the Democratic Party: 47 percent have a favorable opinion and 46 percent have an unfavorable view. ""If we don't capture the House stronger, and the Senate, and prove we could govern, there won't be a Republican president in 2016,"" says House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a recent in-depth story in Politico on his efforts to bring the party together after the election. That's a start, but what shape ""proving you can govern"" takes is tricky. Of the two parties, Republicans may be more self-aware of how this election masks unresolved internal issues. Democrats can blame their losses on an unpopular president and voters in states where Republicans dominate. But progressives and union strategists suggest the problem is that Democrats didn't run on an economic message that could touch middle-class voters. By narrowcasting to women with a focus on abortion rights and contraception, Democrats downplayed a more populist economic message that might have attracted voters with family income hovering around $50,000. This isn't the kind of conversation that will likely break out in the open, however, because if Republicans win, Democrats will be unified. What will their issues be? Republicans are bad. *Update, Oct. 28, 2014: This piece was updated to include reference to a press release from the National Republican Congressional Committee that indicated that almost all of its final ads in this election cycle featured President Obama.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/new_york_and_new_jersey_s_mandatory_ebola_quarantine_is_about_politics_not.html	"As of late Sunday night, Kaci Hickox remained in an isolation tent at a New Jersey hospital in circumstances she described as ""inhumane."" Hickox, a nurse who had been working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone, has twice tested negative for the Ebola virus. Even so, she has been involuntarily isolated under a mandatory 21-day quarantine instituted for anyone who arrives in New Jersey or New York from West Africa after having contact with an Ebola patient. But that quarantine, imposed by Gov. Chris Christie and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, appears to be less about public health than the politicians' own public images. (Update, Monday, Oct. 27, 10:15 a.m.: Gov. Chris Christie announced this morning that Kaci Hickox will be discharged from Newark's University Hospital and transported to Maine via a private carrier. ""She will remain subject to New Jersey's mandatory quarantine order while in New Jersey,"" according to a statement from the New Jersey Department of Health. ""Health officials in Maine have been notified of her arrangements and will make a determination under their own laws on her treatment when she arrives."") ""It was my conclusion that we needed to do this to protect the public health of the people of New Jersey,"" Christie said on Fox News Sunday, adding that he was having ""no second thoughts"" about the decision. Cuomo, meanwhile, appeared to soften his stance slightly in the face of a weekend's worth of White House pressure, announcing his state would allow asymptomatic individuals to be quarantined at home, where family can join them and friends can visit. The state will also compensate the medical workers for any income lost during those three weeks. ""My No. 1 job is to protect the people of New York, and this does that,"" Cuomo said Sunday night, adding, ""It's a home quarantine but it is a mandatory quarantine."" Following Cuomo's press conference, Christie's office released a statement saying that home quarantines were always an option for state residents without any symptoms. Hickox, however, lives in Maine, and so New Jersey authorities may well confine her in the Garden State for three weeks. If Cuomo, a Democrat, and Christie, a Republican, do believe they're acting in the public's best interest, then they haven't done their research. Public health experts have made it clear that quarantining asymptomatic individuals will do little if any good. More troubling is the risk of a cascade of unintended consequences that could make it more difficult to contain the virus in West Africa, where it has already claimed more than 5,000 lives and will likely claim thousands more. At best, the bipartisan pair is giving in to the fears of a misinformed public. At worst, Christie and Cuomo--whose respective presidential ambitions are no secret--are capitalizing on those fears to score cheap political points by appearing to be guardians of their constituents' safety. The chance to bolster their respective profiles appears too good for them to pass up, even if such gains are paid for by risking West African lives. The most serious concern is that the new policies will make doctors and nurses less likely to volunteer to go to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. American medical workers are crucial to international efforts to contain an outbreak that the World Health Organization warns could result in 10,000 new cases a week before the end of the year. The American presence in West Africa helps at home, too. Containing the virus there is the only way to guarantee that it does not spread globally, and that cases do not continue to reach U.S. soil. That already difficult task becomes a much bigger challenge if American doctors and nurses know they'll lose the better part of a month to a quarantine at the end of their trip. ""All of us need to make clear what these health workers mean to us and how much we value their services, how much we value their contribution,"" Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said on NBC's Meet the Press. ""We need to make sure they are treated like conquering heroes and not in any other way."" Hickox didn't receive anything resembling a hero's welcome when she landed at Newark Liberty International a few days ago. As she documented in an op-ed in the Dallas Morning News, her arrival was met with something between confusion and hostility. ""This is not a situation I would wish on anyone, and I am scared for those who will follow me,"" she wrote. ""I am scared about how health care workers will be treated at airports when they declare that they have been fighting Ebola in West Africa. I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a frenzy of disorganization, fear and, most frightening, quarantine."" Don't expect to see that blurb on a Doctors Without Borders brochure. (New York's income-reimbursement policy will reduce the burden on returning health workers, but it will do little to ease the stigma that is associated with a mandatory isolation.) It's not just the long-term risks that make forced quarantines bad policy. There's also good reason to believe that Christie and Cuomo are offering a solution when there's no problem to begin with. The ostensible logic behind their mandatory quarantines is that health workers can't be trusted to self-report potential Ebola symptoms voluntarily. ""I don't believe that when you're dealing with a serious situation like this that we can count on a voluntary system,"" Christie told Fox. ""This is the government's job."" In reality, all three health professionals who developed Ebola symptoms while in the United States were quick to alert authorities. Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, the two nurses who were infected while treating Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas, were admitted to the hospital earlier this month while displaying low-grade fevers--an early sign of Ebola but one that occurs before someone becomes contagious. (Even Vinson, who sparked fears by flying to and from Cleveland, only boarded the flights after getting the green light from authorities, a decision the CDC has since suggested was a mistake.) To date, no one who came into contact with either nurse has become infected. And even Duncan, who wasn't a trained medical professional, went to a Dallas emergency room at the first sign of his own symptoms--only to be sent home by an unprepared hospital. Likewise, Craig Spencer, the New York City doctor who was diagnosed on Thursday after returning from Guinea, was transported to Bellevue Hospital immediately after falling ill. According to New York City Health Commissioner Mary Travis Bassett, Spencer had a fever of 100.3--just below the 100.5 threshold at which doctors believe a patient is contagious. Meanwhile, city health officials proved that they've learned from the early mistakes that were on display in Dallas. The paramedics who went to get Spencer wore protective suits, and he was quickly placed in a state-of-the-art isolation ward. While health officials will continue to monitor those who came in contact with Spencer for the virus' full 21-day incubation period, there's been nothing to suggest that the virus spread, which happens only through contact with bodily fluids. In all three cases, trusting health workers appears to have paid off. That shouldn't be a surprise--after all, it is the doctors and nurses who have been exposed to Ebola that know firsthand just how horrible a virus it is. Hickox, for one, says she spent her final night in West Africa treating a 10-year-old girl. ""I coaxed crushed tablets of Tylenol and an anti-seizure medicine into her mouth as her body jolted in the bed,"" Hickox wrote. ""It was the hardest night of my life."" Christie and Cuomo's quarantine isn't just a bad policy. It's also being implemented poorly. Two days after the pair made their announcement at a hastily called press conference, details of how the quarantine will work remained hard to come by. Medical workers who fly in to JFK or Newark are expected to be isolated, but it is unclear if the states will take the same measures for Ebola-exposed travelers who enter the state by other means. That uncertainty was only amplified Sunday when both states clarified that individuals could be quarantined in their homes, but neither governor spelled out how such quarantines would work in regards to family members who live in the same dwelling. The White House asked both Christie and Cuomo to reverse their original policies, and it's unlikely the administration will be completely satisfied with the clarified home-isolation protocol.  Meanwhile, the federal government is moving ahead with its own new policy, one that will require anyone returning from Sierra Leone, Liberia, or Guinea to routinely check in with local health authorities, and to provide details of where they'll be staying during the three weeks after they arrive. The federal plan splits the difference between New York and New Jersey's overheated response and Dallas' lack of one. What's worrisome is that Christie and Cuomo's shortsighted policy could catch on in other states. Already, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn has issued his own emergency order calling for similar mandatory quarantines. Other governors could follow suit, further muddling the government's response to a virus that has yet to spread to a single American outside of a hospital. ""We don't need politicians to make these kinds of decisions,"" Hickox told CNN on Sunday from her isolation tent inside Newark's University Hospital. ""We need public health experts to make these decisions."" Let's hope Hickox's message gets through, and that Christie and Cuomo recognize that they're not the right men for this job.

The problem: The man she was stumping for is named Bruce Braley. The first lady made the same mistake six more times over the next 16 minutes. Finally, after she twice urged the audience to visit the nonexistent ""vote dot brucebailey dot com,"" the crowd couldn't take it anymore. ""Braley!"" they shouted toward a stage that featured a giant purple sign prominently displaying the candidate's correct name. Obama's abashed response: ""I've been traveling too much."" It was an inconsequential mistake, but a fitting one in the unexpectedly tight race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. Braley, a four-term congressman without much national name recognition, entered the campaign as a moderate favorite to defend the seat for Democrats. His early lead, though, evaporated in the face of a surprisingly strong challenge from Republican Joni Ernst, a folksy state senator with an extremely conservative track record. The race moved into tossup territory over the summer, and the Republican now leads Braley by somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.5 points. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight and the New York Times' The Upshot peg Braley's chances of winning at 34 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The Washington Post's Election Lab, meanwhile, gives Braley a mere 14 percent chance. The Democratic Party desperately needs Braley to pull off the comeback win. The Iowa race remains one of the few tossups on the Senate map, and what happens in Iowa between now and Election Day will go a long way toward deciding which party controls the upper chamber during President Obama's final two years in office. But unfortunately for Democrats, Braley feels like the wrong candidate in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that won't change even if everyone remembers to call him by the right last name. Braley's smooth ride during his uncontested primary came to a quick end when video surfaced of him taking a cheap shot at Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, suggesting at a private fundraiser that the state's senior senator was unfit to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee because he was ""a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school."" You don't have to know that Grassley is one of the state's most popular politicians to understand why that comment wouldn't go over well in the heartland. The audience (wealthy trial lawyers) and setting (boozy, out-of-state fundraiser) only made it worse. The ""gaffe-prone"" label quickly followed--as did the attack ads. While that high-profile misstep didn't help, Braley was always going to struggle in a year when voters hate Washington politicians even more than usual. As a member of the most unpopular and least productive Congress in history, Braley didn't have the luxury of running as an outsider who could shake up the current state of Beltway affairs. And while he is carrying congressional baggage, he lacks the benefits that come from being an incumbent. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, for instance, can sell voters in oil-and-gas-rich Louisiana on the fact that she wields the gavel of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee; Braley can't even tell Iowans what committees he'll be on. The fact that he's defending a seat for the incumbent party without being the incumbent only makes things more difficult. Fair or not, Braley's pitch to voters can come across as: I won't fix Washington, but I won't make things any worse. That's hardly the stuff of bumper stickers and campaign posters. With no way around those hurdles, Braley has attempted to crash through them. Unlike many of his fellow candidates in more conservative states, the congressman hasn't run away from his party or the president. During his debates with Ernst, he offered a strong defense of Obamacare, complete with a personal anecdote about how his nephew, who survived liver cancer as a small child, no longer has to worry about becoming uninsurable due to a pre-existing condition. Braley has also placed Democratic proposals, like increasing the minimum wage and closing corporate loopholes, at the center of his campaign. ""Although I may have slipped up on Bruce's name a couple times, what I know I got right are Bruce's values,"" Michelle Obama told a crowd during a return visit to Iowa earlier this week. That Braley is trailing is hardly a shock. What is a surprise, however, is who he is losing to. Ernst, a conservative state senator, is best known for a serendipitously timed ad about hog castration. And if you ask liberals, voters don't know nearly enough about her extremely conservative views. The Republican has logged some serious time out on the conservative fringes, dabbling in U.N. conspiracy theory, backing a ""personhood"" amendment, and calling for Obama's impeachment. As my colleague Jamelle Bouie put it last month, Ernst is ""not quite Sarah Palin part deux, but she's close."" Democrats and their allies have so far been unable to make the ""extreme"" label stick to Ernst. But as the clock nears midnight, they're still holding out hope that they can. On Thursday, Ernst bailed on a sit-down with the editorial board of the Des Moines Register, providing the type of opening that Democrats have been waiting for. ""It's no surprise she's hiding from Iowa editorial boards and TV reporters,"" Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told Bloomberg. ""This is a campaign on the run and in trouble."" Braley has 11 days left to convince Iowans that's true. Voters in the Hawkeye State need to decide between a flawed candidate who's more likely to preserve Washington's unpopular status quo and a flashy one who is unlikely to make things any better. If they pick the former, Braley won't have to worry about Democrats forgetting his name anytime soon. If they choose the latter, he'll probably be hoping they do."

But what if pregnancy envy, not penis envy, has been the central driver of human history? Several years ago, feminist political scientist Jacqueline Stevens offered a fascinating, contrary theory of childhood sexual development that made exactly that point. ""Although each of us is born from a woman,"" Stevens writes, ""half of us are told that we are boys, and hence we will not be able to reproduce this feat."" This realization is so disturbing to boys that, according to Stevens, they spend much of their lives compensating for their inability to give birth. While the connection between a mother and child is visceral and direct, the one between a father and a child has long been mediated through kinship rules crafted by males anxious to assert their relevance and power. Men can't give the gift of life to a child, so they obsess over what they can give: They can accumulate property, and they can pass it on to their heirs, regulating their behavior in the process. Stevens suggests that our society is screwed up in large part because men have created myths, rituals, and laws that entrench their power as a way to compensate for a profound sense of inadequacy instilled early in life. Not everyone will embrace Stevens' theory, I realize, and men in particular might consider it ungenerous. But I've always found it a useful framework for understanding traditional gender roles. Now, however, we're faced with a different landscape. In affluent societies at least, paternity uncertainty is a thing of the past, thanks to genetic testing and the Maury Povich Show. And while men continue to dominate our economic and social lives, that dominance is being contested. Among younger cohorts, women are pulling ahead of men in educational attainment, a disparity that is already having powerful social and economic consequences. A large and growing number of women are raising children without men, for whom the drive to accumulate property to pass on to their heirs has attenuated, if not vanished entirely. Roles that had once been limited to men, by law and custom--it was not so long ago that female doctors, lawyers, engineers, and managers were vanishingly rare--are now open to women, and women are excelling in them. They are excelling in them to such an extent that the opportunity costs associated with motherhood (the foregone wages, the lost productivity) are becoming unacceptably high not just for individual mothers, but for their employers. These are new historical developments, and we're still struggling to adapt to them. So, here's a prediction: Instead of adapting our jobs to accommodate the demands of biology, we will adapt our biology to accommodate the demands of our jobs. The fact that only women can give the gift of life is an enviable distinction, yet it is also a burden that can make it harder for working mothers to reach the pinnacle of their professions. One way to ease this burden would be to move away from pregnancy as we know it and toward a reliance on artificial wombs. For now, artificial wombs are the stuff of science fiction. Those of you who read Brave New World in high school will recall its chilling portrayal of the ""Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre,"" where vast numbers of identical children spring from the same genetic soup. If ectogenesis, a fancy word for the use of artificial wombs, ever happens in the real world, it will be a more banal next step from the technologies that already keep premature babies alive. Ectogenesis will start out as a way to allow older women to have children or to abet pregnancy for women who would otherwise be unable to carry children. Eventually, it will be considered safer to have children via ectogenesis than the old-fashioned way, and the practice will spread far and wide. This all comes to mind in light of the latest news from Silicon Valley. Recently, Apple and Facebook, two of the most esteemed employers in America, agreed to finance egg-freezing coverage for their employees. This news has been met with a great deal of cynicism, from those who see it as ""a hasty technological stopgap for a cultural problem"" or a privatized pseudo-solution to a problem that ought to be addressed by government. Egg freezing is far from foolproof, and I can see why some find the concept dismaying. There is something vaguely creepy about the notion that corporations are pushing women to delay childbearing until their 40s just so they can squeeze as much work out of them as possible. To some, this is proof that the Apples and Facebooks of the world are led by heartless capitalists who don't care about women's best interests, regardless of what their press releases claim. But perhaps Silicon Valley is simply seeing the future before the rest of us do. Many talented female employees are balancing a desire to climb the corporate ladder with an unwillingness to foreclose the possibility of having children. The executives who've embraced the idea of paying for egg-freezing coverage are doing their best to meet the needs of these workers. That said, the fact that a growing number of working women are interested in the procedure is in itself an acknowledgment that it is difficult to combine child-rearing with the all-consuming, more-than-full-time professional work that we find in the uppermost echelons of the American economy. As women and men begin their careers, the earnings gap between them is quite small when we control for hours and skill levels. Yet the pay gap grows dramatically with age. Why does the pay gap widen? While there are many factors to consider, it's striking that women without children earn more than mothers, and the earnings of women without children are almost equal to those of men. Earlier this year, Harvard economist Claudia Goldin argued that a substantial part of this gender gap can be attributed to the fact that the most privileged and lucrative occupations are those that most generously reward those who put in long and inflexible hours. When you have to leave the office, when you can't be on call, and when you take time off, your workplace runs less smoothly. For women who've spent years in a hypercompetitive company like Apple or Facebook, leaving for a year or two, or even downshifting to work fewer hours, isn't an easy decision, as it can make a material difference in terms of how valuable you are to your employer. Goldin observes that there are some elite professions that aren't subject to this dynamic. Pharmacists tend to have more manageable hours, which has made the field more attractive to working mothers. Veterinary medicine has gone from being a male-dominated to a female-dominated profession, in part, it seems, because hours have grown more predictable in small veterinary practices. These professions evolved for a number of reasons, including a desire to reduce the high labor costs associated with long and erratic hours. But they also changed due to employee pressure. One possibility moving forward is that many other elite professions can evolve in this direction as workers demand change. I don't doubt that we'll see some of this, particularly if such shifts save employers money. Yet the most elite jobs are also the least susceptible to change. ""There will always be 24/7 positions with on-call, all-the-time employees and managers, including many CEOs, trial lawyers, merger-and-acquisition bankers, surgeons, and the U.S. Secretary of State,"" writes Goldin. Apple and Facebook are keen to retain female employees who can take on these 24/7 positions, which don't lend themselves to the kind of flexibility that parenting demands. And that is why they're taking egg freezing seriously. If our goal is to achieve gender equality, there is another obvious approach: Fathers could demand flexibility alongside mothers, and they could commit to devoting more time and effort to child-rearing. Even as working mothers face a wage penalty, working fathers enjoy a wage bonus, which is at least partly because working fathers rarely demand flexibility. So the solution is simple, right? Working fathers need to step up! I completely accept that this is true. (It helps that I have no children of my own.) But shifting attitudes in this direction will take longer than you think. Even as single-parent and two-breadwinner families grow more common, 60 percent of Americans believe that children are better off when a parent stays at home, according to a Pew survey from earlier this year. In 2012, Pew found that while 37 percent of working mothers with children under 18 report that full-time work would be ideal for them and their families, 50 percent favored part-time work, and 11 percent would choose to stay at home full time if possible. Working fathers, meanwhile, placed a higher value on compensation than working mothers (40 percent versus 30 percent said that a high-paying job was extremely important to them), and they value flexibility far less (48 percent versus 70 percent). This helps explain why men are more likely than women to stick with 24/7, on-call, all-the-time positions that happen to pay particularly well and why the women who succeed in these jobs are so often childless. The share of American women ages 40 to 44 who've never had children now stands at 19 percent, one of the highest rates in the world. And if we want to achieve gender equality by changing attitudes, it can't just be male attitudes that change. Men will have to become more interested in spending time with their children, but women will also have to become less interested. If the miracle of childbirth is a central component of what bonds women to their offspring, and pregnancy envy is a force that drives men to accumulate wealth, outsourcing pregnancy might be the best solution. In August, Zoltan Istvan, author of The Transhumanist Wager, touted the potential benefits of artificial wombs for women, from the most obvious (""females would no longer have to solely bear responsibility for childbirth"") to the less obvious (""ectogenesis could unchain women from the home""). Even some of the criticisms of ectogenesis--that it will reduce the intimacy between mother and child--could be a good thing if your concern is that when it comes to raising children, the attitudes of women and men are too different. I should stress that I'm not endorsing ectogenesis. There are many good reasons to be wary of the concept. In ""Why Not Artificial Wombs?"", Christine Rosen, a senior editor at the New Atlantis, quoted a warning from Rosemarie Tong, a feminist bioethicist: ""I think the physicality and embodied nature of pregnancy is a real and material way for one generation to connect to the next. ... Without that rootedness in the body, relationships between the generations become more abstract, less feeling-filled."" I think Tong is probably right and that something essential would be lost if pregnancy becomes obsolete. Yet, artificial wombs still seem inevitable. The powerful, feeling-filled bond between a mother and her child is a big part of what leads working mothers to take their child-rearing responsibilities more seriously than working fathers. If this essential difference is the problem, if it is the root of gender equality in the workplace, and if our highest priority is to eliminate gender inequality, then ectogenesis offers a way forward."

That is Sen. Mary Landrieu's election-eve message, both figuratively and literally. ""Who will be here for us if there is another Katrina?"" asked state Sen. Ben Nevers at a Monday rally for Landrieu in Baton Rouge that featured Bill Clinton. Landrieu ticks off the names of the hurricanes that have hit the state in her stump speech. Another storm will come, and voters shouldn't trade away her proven ability to fight for relief in the aftermath. After nearly 18 years in office, the senior Louisiana senator is now chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which is why she says she can deliver for the state's sizable oil and gas interests. ""If my opponent wins, we'll lose that gavel,"" she told a rally earlier in the day. Later she boomed, ""He won't even be on the committee."" When making the case for her campaign, a Democratic political operative boasted about the money she receives from oil and gas interests. (Usually campaigns try to hide the influence purchasing.) She's also warning seniors that after paying into Social Security for decades, they might lose some of their benefits if her opponent, three-term Rep. Bill Cassidy, makes the changes he'd like to make to the program. The race in Louisiana is perhaps the best 2014 test of the old campaign adage that candidates and campaigns matter. It's usually something the underdog says to get past conversations about how bad the environment is for a candidate of his or her party. In a bad year for Democrats--hampered further by an unpopular president--Landrieu's platform of seniority, Social Security, and sandbags is about the strongest bulwark of any being erected by vulnerable Democratic incumbents. She's also a tough campaigner who comes from a popular political family. Despite all those advantages, she is still struggling, down by four points in the average of polls. That's because President Obama lost Louisiana by 18 points, and even in a state that benefits from federal largess, members of Congress are not popular. Landrieu is the Democrats' last remaining statewide elected official. Campaigns may matter, but some disadvantages are too great to overcome. Of all the incumbent Democrats in trouble, Landrieu has served the longest. When she took the stage at the Crowne Plaza on Monday, it was obvious she had been in the game a long time, as she went through the interminable process of introducing supporters, local officials, and family members who had backed her during her nearly two decades in the Senate. Organizers said 900 people had showed up to sit at tables of eight, each festooned with a cluster of gold and blue helium balloons that made it hard to see the woman in turquoise who sounded like the candidate. The audience was mostly women, whom Landrieu repeatedly referred to as ""ladies."" She repeated the phrase the way some people repeatedly touch your arm in conversation. ""Ladies, there is a lot at stake,"" and ""Ladies, we're building energy jobs that pay our kids coming out of high school $70,000 and $80,000 a year."" Landrieu has jokingly referred to herself as ""Landslide Landrieu,"" because she has faced so many close races. She recounted that history to the audience to remind them that every vote counts. ""I stepped up to run for the Senate, and we beat--all of us in this room--we beat Woody Jenkins by 5,778 votes out of 1.7 million votes cast,"" she said, referring to her conservative Republican opponent. ""Ladies, that is 1.2 votes per precinct. You sent me there, and let me tell you what happened just a few years late: Katrina and Rita slammed in to South Louisiana and sent a million people homeless, including half of my family and families in here, who never thought they'd experience homelessness in their life. And you know who was in that seat when that happened? Think about the difference between Mary Landrieu--and I know I have my flaws and my weaknesses--but think about having to go to Woody Jenkins to ask Woody Jenkins to help New Orleans. Baton Rouge, do you have any concept the difference it made? And I made the difference because I was there, but you made the difference by putting me there."" At the next event, as local politicians and labor leaders praised Landrieu to a crowd gathered to hear Bill Clinton, Hurricane Katrina came up again and again. ""When the hurricane hit and she had to battle everybody, she stood up and showed up and fought and she delivered,"" said her younger brother, Mitch Landrieu, the popular mayor of New Orleans. ""New Orleans, the whole southern part of Louisiana, would not be where it is today if she had not fought."" In a focus group of New Orleans female voters later that night, part of the Walmart Moms series (female voters selected because they have children age 18 or younger and shopped at Walmart at least once in the past month), several women used Katrina as a reference point when talking about their economic anxieties. The next day Landrieu was issuing new dire warnings to a group of seniors gathered in the windowless community room at the East Baton Rouge Council on Aging. She was there to kick off a day of stops throughout the state publicizing her endorsement by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. As the group's director outlined the difference between the score they had given Landrieu (100 percent) and her opponent (0 percent, or ""minus zero"" as one elderly woman yelled), the candidate reacted in horror to each description of her opponent's votes, throwing up her hands, shaking her head like she was being attacked by a bee, and at one point covering her eyes. The audience of almost entirely black seniors was just as active, interjecting ""amens"" at key moments and affirming every statement with applause or a groan or some other verbal sign of agreement. When Landrieu polled the group for who had earned the least in their lifetimes, one man reported making 25 cents an hour at the Baton Rouge General. ""Do you think we owe this man our best work?"" she asked to applause. Democrats had hoped to register 120,000 new black voters at the start of the campaign. They represent 30 percent of the state's electorate, and their turnout may be the difference for Landrieu. That's why Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, joined Landrieu on the campaign trail. ""If I came from Ohio, you can go up the block and vote,"" she said. The campaign says that more blacks are registered to vote than in 2012. Landrieu's opponent, Bill Cassidy, has been described as a ""generic Republican,"" holding conservative positions but running a cautious campaign, unlike Reps. Tom Cotton in Arkansas and Cory Gardner in Colorado, or other House members running for the Senate who have been more aggressive on the stump. A doctor, Cassidy is not a part of the state's colorful tradition of lawmakers, which includes his backer, Sen. David Vitter, whose longtime patronage of a prostitution ring was discovered in 2002. On the congressional ballot this year is convicted felon and former Gov. Edwin Edwards, a Democrat, and the ""kissing congressman"" Vance McAllister, a Republican, who was caught on CCTV in an amorous embrace with a staffer and decided to run for re-election anyway. However bland Cassidy may be--he apologizes for all the TV ads when meeting new voters--Landrieu was doing her best to screw devil's horns on his head. Cassidy has spent his entire career caring for people who have little or no insurance. After Hurricane Katrina, he organized hundreds of volunteers to help turn an abandoned Baton Rouge K-Mart into a temporary medical center. He says that experience is what led him into public service. Yet this is how Landrieu described him as she recounted his support for raising the retirement age for Social Security: ""Bill Cassidy lives in a big fancy house right on Lakeshore Drive. You know how he paid for that house? Medicaid! He was a Medicaid doctor. It paid him a lot of money. He took those big checks and built a big house, and he wants to go to Washington and take your check away from you. Oh my God!"" Landrieu also has house issues. She is being criticized for claiming her parents' house as her residency and living in a multimillion-dollar home in Washington. The house is a topic of a series of ads being run by Karl Rove's super PAC American Crossroads. Landrieu has also been on the defensive from Cassidy's claims that it is Landrieu who cut Medicare when she voted in 2010 for the Affordable Care Act, which reduced payments for private policies under the Medicare Advantage program. If no candidate reaches 50 percent in Louisiana, there will be a runoff. In Washington, Democratic strategists assume the race is headed for that outcome, which will make the state a zoo (book your hotel rooms now!) if the runoff winds up determining which party controls the Senate. Landrieu's team assumes Republicans are playing for the recount so that Cassidy, who faces a challenge from the right in the multicandidate field, can consolidate Republican votes when there are just two candidates. ""We are not going to go to a runoff,"" Landrieu assures audiences. One local Democratic official wouldn't even speak of a runoff as if it were some Voodoo hex. But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has reserved $2.1 million of television time for the one month period between Election Day and the runoff election. It's always good to have a little insurance."	Can Sen. Mary Landrieu Pull Off One More Louisiana Miracle?

The expert is you, the American people. According to polls, most of us want the government to ban all travel to the United States from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Therefore, the argument goes, the government should do it. ""We couldn't agree more with the American people that a travel ban must be put in place,"" seven Republican senators wrote in an Oct. 17 letter to President Obama. Congressman Cory Gardner, running for the Senate in Colorado, says ""an overwhelming majority of the American people believe that we should put this in place."" Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas is introducing a travel ban in Congress because Obama ""is refusing to listen to the American people."" Virginia lawmakers, citing the views of ""the American people,"" are calling for a ban on travel from West Africa to their state. Behind these initiatives, an army of conservative media outlets is quoting polls and trumpeting what ""the American people want"" and ""the American people favor."" On some issues, this kind of thinking is healthy. It's democracy. But on matters of science and medicine, it's reckless. The reason why public opinion on Ebola diverges sharply from what experts recommend, not just on a travel ban but on everyday behaviors to avoid the virus, is sheer ignorance. Telling health officials to listen to the public, rather than the other way around, is the worst kind of demagoguery. Most Americans do favor a travel ban. Depending on how you word the question, the percentage in favor ranges from 58 percent in an NBC News poll to 60 percent in a Fox News poll to 67 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll. But surveys also show high levels of misinformation. In a poll taken for the Harvard School of Public Health, 88 percent of respondents said it's likely--and 58 percent said it's very likely--that a person could catch Ebola from ""being sneezed or coughed on by someone who has Ebola."" In a Harris/Health Day poll, 75 percent said they were ""concerned that individuals carrying the Ebola virus will infect others before beginning to show symptoms."" Given these fears, many people are taking extreme measures. In the Harris survey, 26 percent of respondents said they planned ""to cancel or cut back on upcoming business travel plans,"" and 23 percent said they were ""less likely to leave my home if I can avoid it."" In a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 37 percent said they were ""avoiding domestic air travel,"" 33 percent were ""avoiding travel on trains,"" 33 percent were ""avoiding large crowds or public spaces,"" and 26 percent were ""avoiding individuals who I know have traveled recently within the U.S."" None of this makes sense if you know the evidence. According to the Centers for Disease Control, ""Unlike respiratory illnesses like measles or chickenpox, which can be transmitted by virus particles that remain suspended in the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with body fluids of a person who has symptoms of Ebola disease."" The CDC found that in studies, ""Airborne transmission of EVD among humans has never been demonstrated."" Furthermore, ""A person must have symptoms to spread Ebola to others."" Health officials have lots of experience with epidemics, including previous Ebola outbreaks. They know what works and what doesn't. Banning travel from the entire region does more harm than good. ""When countries are isolated, it is harder to get medical supplies and personnel deployed to stop the spread of Ebola,"" says the CDC's director, Dr. Tom Frieden. Moreover, ""people in affected countries still find a way to move, and it is even harder to track them systematically."" That's what happened with SARS and Swine Flu. Last week at a House hearing, Frieden tried to explain these drawbacks to angry Republican lawmakers. They were unmoved. They had the polls on their side. Rep. Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, the committee's chairman, responded to Frieden's testimony by invoking public opinion:"	When It Comes to Ebola, Ignore American Public Opinion

In both states, independent candidates have scrambled long-settled patterns. Races that were once considered safe wins for Republicans are attracting new money and attention from both parties. They will be hard-fought until Election Day. Usually you need three for a trend, and there are idiosyncrasies to both of these races that resist drawing grand conclusions, but with two weeks to go before the election, it is a time to start practicing grand-conclusion-drawing. Republican incumbents already know that they must be ready to get a Tea Party primary challenge, whether one appears imminent or not. Do rock-bottom public approval of Congress, a crack in the usual protections provided by incumbency, plus ready money available to rush into a race mean that incumbents--or near-incumbent party favorites--in heavily partisan states must also save up for late-breaking challenges? To create the conditions for a smash-and-grab campaign, the first requirement is a late start. In South Dakota, if the race had tightened six months ago as it has in the last few weeks, it would have given the Republicans time to rally. The minute Democrats started spending to tear down Republican Senate candidate Mike Rounds, his allies would have come to his aide. That would have initiated a protracted fight in a state where Democrats would have had to spend money introducing their candidate to an electorate that didn't know him--voters who chose Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by 18 points. Television time is inexpensive in South Dakota, but any state can turn expensive if the battle starts early. In 2012, outside groups spent $17 million in North Dakota, more than in Texas and Missouri. The individual campaigns spent millions more. Even now, Democratic groups are circling around South Dakota pondering whether they should invest, because every dollar they spend might lure in more Republican money that would obliterate the narrow and fragile path to defeating the Republican. That's what has happened in Kansas, where a flood of outside groups has come to the rescue of three-term Sen. Pat Roberts. In a smash-and-grab campaign, one party must dominate the state--otherwise it's a battleground fight where everyone starts early--but the representative of the dominant party must be weak. That's certainly the case in these two states. n Kansas, Roberts has an approval rating almost as low as President Obama's, according to a PPP poll.  In South Dakota, even Republican strategists admit that two-term Gov. Mike Rounds has run a lackluster campaign. These two states have particularly weak candidates, but there is a broader sentiment about Republicans and Democrats that suggests voters are liable to opt for independent candidates. In a recent CBS poll, Congress's approval rating was just 12 percent. In a recent NBC poll, only 30 percent say their member of Congress deserves to be re-elected. In that same poll, 57 percent of voters say they are more likely to support a rookie candidate. In a Gallup poll, for the first time, more Americans say their member is focused on the needs of special interests than on the needs of his or her constituents. These numbers suggest the electorate is in a mood to fall in love with someone who is neither a Democrat nor a Republican. That might be independent Senate candidates Greg Orman in Kansas or Larry Pressler in South Dakota. (Pressler may be unlikely to win, but he has split the vote, possibly opening a pathway for the Democratic candidate.) A candidate doesn't need to win to create late-breaking disruption, just as Tea Party candidates have changed election outcomes even when they've lost. (Libertarian candidates are complicating races in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina.) What helps the disruptive candidates survive and threatens the representative of the majority-party candidate is the access to ready money. If you're going to zoom in at the last minute, you need cash to blanket the airwaves and build an organization to harness the new enthusiasm. Both parties are obsessed with raising money, and the Democrats have done well enough raising it that they had money to spend on a long-shot race in South Dakota. But the presence of outside money at the ready can also help these raids. After the race became competitive, money flooded into the Kansas race, mostly to rescue Roberts, but Orman has also benefited from outside money, including what he raised last week at a New York event hosted by George Soros' son. The power of outside money in these races also colors what might seem like simply idiosyncratic developments. In Kansas, Democrats convinced their candidate to drop out of the race. That's hard to duplicate in future cycles in other states. On the other hand, the necessity of outside money from the national party and the network of donors makes all candidates vulnerable to pressure from those powerful sources. They can either withhold support, crippling a campaign, or withhold future support, damaging a young politician's future chances. The quick string-pulling that occurred in Kansas--and that's required to mobilize a last-minute insurgent campaign--is helped by the increased influence of big money. One of the ironclad rules of American politics is that incumbents have an enormous advantage. The majority of Senate races are not being discussed because they are locked up by people who already have a nameplate on one of the 100 chairs in the Senate chamber. It's also true that states are moving away from split-ticket voting, picking a senator from the party the state's voters preferred in the presidential election. Those are impediments to any smash-and-grab campaign, and it's possible that--despite little flare-ups--Kansas and South Dakota voters will revert to form and elect Republicans. But there is also another durable truth in politics: Congress has been overtaken by partisan freezer-lock. That creates frustration in the electorate that seeks an outlet to register its disgust. Perhaps it's impossible to pull off a heist, but for voters looking to disturb the current system, the prospect of instilling fear in incumbents may be enough to encourage more smash-and-grab campaigns in the future.	The Rise of the Smash-and-Grab Election
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/ebola_politics_13_ways_democrats_and_republicans_are_exploiting_the_virus.html	"Ebola has arrived in the United States, and our nation's leaders are wasting no time. They're consulting experts, holding hearings, and demanding action. Politicians across the spectrum are united in a common goal: exploiting the crisis to win the next election. It's a tricky maneuver, because they don't know much about Ebola. But they know their shticks, and that's enough. With a tweak here and a twist there, they can shoehorn Ebola into their customary talking points. Here are the emerging favorites. 1. The war on Ebola is like the war on terror. After an ugly decade in Iraq, some Republicans took a break to dabble in civil libertarianism. Now they're ready to get back to being the Daddy Party. President Obama is ""not protecting our country and our families from Ebola,"" says Rep. Tom Cotton, the Republican Senate candidate in Arkansas. Cotton promises to ""rebuild our military and keep your family safe and secure, whether the threat is terrorism or disease."" 2. Obama has no strategy. When Obama admitted he was thinking through his options against ISIS, Republicans turned his remark into a gaffe. Now they're applying the same spin to Ebola. Rep. Cory Gardner, the Republican senatorial nominee in Colorado, says Obama has no ""strategy to deal with the Ebola virus."" Thom Tillis, the GOP's candidate for senator in North Carolina, says Obama has ""no plan"" to stop people who would ""come to this nation and threaten our safety and security."" On Thursday, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tim Murphy convened a hearing on Ebola. He opened it by bashing Obama's ""failed policy"" and the ""demonstrated failures of the current strategy."" 3. Obama thinks Ebola is the JV. First he called ISIS the junior varsity of terrorism. Then he downplayed Ebola as a junior virus. Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Virginia, chides Obama for having discounted the risk of Ebola reaching the United States. So does Bobby Schilling, a Republican House candidate in Illinois. At Thursday's hearing, Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton sarcastically applauded Obama for leaving the campaign trail ""to finally focus on the crisis."" 4. We're on the case. Having ignored Ebola until it reached the United States, elected officials are scrambling to look as though they're on the ball. The first step is to say you've talked to an expert. The number of politicians who claim to have spoken in the last week with Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is almost mathematically impossible. But if you can't get Frieden on the phone, go to Plan B. In a debate on Wednesday, Gardner told voters he had talked to a nurse. Wendy Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor of Texas, where the virus had arrived from Liberia, said she had talked to a county judge. Don't worry, said Davis: Everything's under control. That was two weeks ago. Oops. 5. Screen all passengers. If Ebola is just like terrorism, the solution is obvious: airport security. At Thursday's hearing, Murphy portrayed Ebola carriers as infiltrators, noting that they could mask their fevers with ibuprofen to sneak through checkpoints. Republicans on the committee complained that screening 94 percent of passengers wasn't good enough: Everyone had to be checked. Democrats don't seem inclined to resist the GOP's demands. ""I don't think any measure is too extreme,"" says state Sen. Connie Johnson, the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Oklahoma. 6. Ban West Africans. Before the Ebola hearing, Republicans were clamoring for a ban on travel to the United States from the affected countries. Frieden and other health officials testified that this was a bad idea, in part because it could easily be circumvented (by stopping over in Europe), and it might force carriers to hide their symptoms. Republicans were unmoved. After the hearing, they went straight to the TV cameras and delivered precooked talking points they had imported from Iraq and Syria. With colleagues arrayed behind him, Upton called for a ""no-fly zone from that region of the world."" 7. Seal the border. It's the Republican answer to any questions about immigration. Why not use it for Ebola, too? Gillespie says Ebola and ISIS have made our ""porous Southern border"" a ""public health threat and a public safety threat."" Sen. Pat Roberts, running for re-election in Kansas, says it's all one issue: ""Ebola, ISIS, or whoever comes across the border--the 167,000 illegals who are convicted felons--that shows you we have to secure the border, and we cannot support amnesty."" While we're at it, says Roberts, let's impose ""a quarantine on West Africa."" 8. Blame budget cuts. For Democrats, it's all about the spending. Colorado's Democratic Sen. Mark Udall says Gardner, his Republican challenger, tried to cut $770 million from the CDC budget, which would have impeded the agency's response to Ebola. Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic Senate candidate in Iowa, says his opponent, Republican Joni Ernst, ""supported a radical plan to shut down the federal government,"" which ""dramatically cut funding"" for the CDC and the National Institutes of Health. At Thursday's House hearing, Colorado Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette suggested that Congress' tight purse strings on NIH had prevented the agency from developing an Ebola vaccine. (Slate's Josh Voorhees says the timeline lends credence to this claim.) California Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman blamed Republicans for a complex chain of events that began with the 2011 fiscal standoff, led to across-the-board budget cuts, and ended with Ebola. ""Those who allowed that sequestration to happen by closing the government,"" said Waxman, are responsible for leaving the country ""vulnerable."" 9. Blame tax cuts. This adds another layer to the budget-cut lament. Warner says the road to ruin began with conservative activist Grover Norquist, who drafted a no-tax-increase pledge in 1986, which forced Republicans to swear off tax hikes, which led to a fiscal squeeze, which crippled the CDC and NIH, which blocked the Ebola vaccine. 10. Bureaucrats misspent the money. This is the Republican answer to any budget-cut complaint. Just look up the agency's projects, pick the ones that sound stupid, and claim that if the agency hadn't wasted money on them, it could have managed its obligations. Gardner's version in his Wednesday debate with Udall was classic: ""Perhaps the CDC should quit spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening, and massage therapy."" 11. Blame lack of insurance. Now that Republicans are blaming everything on Obamacare, it's easy to forget that Democrats used to blame everything on a lack of Obamacare. The sick Liberian who brought Ebola to the United States gives liberals an opening to revive this complaint. ""The first Ebola patient showed up at the Dallas hospital with a 103 fever,"" Rep. Mike Michaud, the Democratic nominee for governor of Maine, pointed out in a debate Wednesday night. ""Because he had no insurance, they gave him aspirin and sent him on his way. He [then] had contact with 50 other individuals."" Michaud blamed all of this on Maine's Republican governor, Paul LePage, who stood six feet from Michaud and about 1,600 miles from Dallas. ""The fact that this governor has vetoed not once, but five times, expansion [of Medicaid] under the Affordable Care Act--that's reckless, it's wasteful, and it leaves us vulnerable."" 12. Blame neglect. When the other party controls the executive branch, it's easy to pin everything on them. Something bad happened--Benghazi, Katrina, 9/11--and the administration failed to stop it or manage it. But be careful. On Wednesday, Kevin Wade, the Republican Senate candidate in Delaware, tried to blame the Ebola mess on the absence of a confirmed surgeon general. The gambit backfired when his opponent, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, pointed out that Republicans had blocked Obama's nominee for the job because the nominee had called gun violence a public health issue. 13. Politics stops at Ebola's edge. After 9/11, Republicans tried to shame Democrats into supporting President Bush without dissent. Now Democrats want the same fealty to Obama. The argument sounds like a sermon against gamesmanship--let's ""put aside partisan differences,"" says Braley--but it's barbed with an exploitative brand of patriotism. ""When we stand together, we're going to meet this challenge,"" Udall told voters during his debate with Gardner on Wednesday. ""The virus is the enemy."" Then he accused Gardner of endangering the CDC and undermining the war. Even the pleas to rise above politics are infected with politics. It's the virus we can't beat.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/rick_scott_charlie_crist_and_a_fan_campaigns_have_fought_over_the_rules.html	"A very strange thing happened at the start of the Florida governor's debate Wednesday night. The event was delayed for nearly eight minutes because Gov. Rick Scott refused to take the stage. The reason: His opponent, former Florida governor Charlie Crist had a fan behind his lectern. ""The rules of the debate that I was shown by the Scott campaign say that there should be no fan,"" said the moderator. ""Somehow there is a fan there."" The audience would have been forgiven for feeling as if they had mistakenly attended Samuel Beckett's lost play. Finally, Scott acquiesced and took the stage. Both men then immediately demonstrated why some cooling apparatus was necessary--the debate quickly became a festival of mutual contempt. Neither man was a fan of the other. Outside of the venue, a thousand puns were launched. The laziest rolled over and called it fangate; the more enterprising labeled it the fantrum or fandango. It will pass into campaign lore as one of the stranger debate moments, but it has its origin in the most famous debates of all time, the first Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960. In their first debate (also the first televised political debate), Richard Nixon's sweaty upper lip, brow, and chin supposedly did him in while Kennedy looked cool and collected. (Watch Nixon sweat here and watch him use a handkerchief to rescue himself here and here.) It was the result of a bad mix of factors. Nixon arrived at the studio already simmering with a 102-degree fever. He declined makeup when he heard Kennedy had waved off the offer. Nixon didn't want to look less manly than his opponent. (He did send an aide to the corner store for some ""Lazy Shave"" to cover his five o'clock shadow. It didn't work.) Before the debate, Kennedy's aide Bill Wilson had been arguing with CBS's legendary Don Hewitt, who produced the show, for more cutaway shots of Kennedy, but that changed once the night wore on. According to David Halberstam's The Powers That Be, Wilson started yelling in the control room for more shots of the melting Nixon while Ted Rogers, Nixon's man, was arguing that the camera should stay focused on Kennedy. At the next debate, the temperature was set at 64 degrees, according to a Life magazine account, in part to accommodate all the stage lights required for the broadcast. ""I feel like I need a sweater,"" said Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy asked: ""What are they trying to do? Freeze my brother to death?"" Wilson, the Kennedy aide, went to the basement to investigate because he had heard that the Nixon staff had asked for the cooler temperature and had been fooling with the air conditioner the day before to avoid the disaster of the first debate. According to Chris Matthews, Wilson found a Nixon man guarding the air conditioner. ""There was a guy standing there that Ted Rogers had put there, and he said don't let anybody change this. I said, 'Get out of my way or I'm going to call the police.' He immediately left and I changed the air-conditioning back."" However, as John Kennedy said, success has a thousand fathers. Kennedy's other television adviser J. Leonard Reinsch also takes credit for the temperature change at the second debate, telling author Mary Ann Watson, in her great book about television in the Kennedy era The Expanding Vista, ""I finally located a janitor in the second basement below the studio and with a series of threats got him to locate the key to the thermostat buried in the bottom drawer of the desk. We turned the temperature up as high as we could."" (Reinsch tells this account about the second debate, not the first, as is claimed in some accounts.) In the third debate, according to Alan Schroeder's book on the history of debates, where Kennedy was in New York and Nixon in California, the temperature of Nixon's studio was at 58 degrees, whereas Kennedy's was at 72. Afterward Nixon was peeved that Kennedy had been looking at some notes, in contravention of the campaigns' agreement beforehand. ""I'm not complaining,"" Nixon told reporters. ""I never complain about debates after they are over. But before the next debate we had better settle on the rules."" Thus forevermore, whether it was fans, the size of the lectern, or the chairs behind the candidates, when it came to debates, campaigns would sweat the small stuff."	Why Fangate Goes All the Way Back to the Kennedy-Nixon Debates
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/bipac_how_the_business_industry_political_action_committee_teaches_corporate.html	"On the morning of Jan. 29, construction workers were building a seawater pipe at Oliktok Point, part of a sprawling network of oil fields owned by ConocoPhillips on Alaska's arctic North Slope, when they received an ominous notice. Workers at the icy camp would be required to attend a ""safety stand-down"" meeting, which is typically announced only after a job-site accident involving serious injury. One such meeting was called earlier this year, according to a contracted worker at the site, when a mechanic's fingers were mangled by an industrial fan. Working in one of the world's coldest and most isolated regions in the dead of winter--the nearest town of Deadhorse is roughly 40 miles away--comes with a host of potential hazards, and it was unclear to the crews what had happened and who might have been hurt. When nearly 200 construction workers assembled inside a large heated tent just outside the camp, they learned the meeting's true purpose. An unfamiliar manager, identified as John Schuelke from ConocoPhillips' Anchorage office, took to the stage and told them that there hadn't been an accident. Instead, the company had gathered the group, mostly construction contractors, to tell them how they should vote in Alaska's upcoming August primaries. The oil and gas industry, Schuelke said, was fighting Democrat-supported Ballot Measure 1, which sought to repeal a massive tax cut for oil companies that Alaska's Republican-controlled state Legislature had recently passed. Schuelke told the crowd to vote against the repeal, according to the contracted worker, who was present. Schuelke claimed that many of the area's jobs relied on the tax break. The implication was clear: Vote against repeal or your industry and your livelihood will suffer. ""I'd never seen so many confused faces and so many frowns,"" the contractor said. ""It was definitely an abuse of our safety culture."" (A ConocoPhillips spokeswoman said the primary purpose of the meeting was to reinforce safety measures.) This particular construction worker favored repeal, which Democrats argued would allow Alaska to equitably tax oil companies to fund its struggling public school system and other vital services. Yet the contractor said that corporate management's forceful political agenda at the site, where ConocoPhillips oversees a patchwork of oil field contractors, made it unwise to express a dissenting point of view. ""The feeling was that if we didn't stay quiet we could get blackballed from the Slope,"" the contractor said. A welder and a pipefitter did jump up during the meeting to yell, ""What does this have to do with safety!"" and another worker walked up to Schuelke afterward to say she wouldn't vote as he'd instructed. But everyone else was ""in fear of their jobs and said, 'I didn't agree with what that guy was saying but you guys better be quiet or you're gonna get fired.' They were scared."" Afraid of becoming unemployable on Alaska's North Slope, the contractor spoke with me on the condition of anonymity. It isn't the first time in recent years that large American employers have told their employees how to vote. For instance, in the lead-up to the 2012 presidential election, employees of Koch Industries and Cintas, the uniform company, leaked letters they had received in which CEOs indicated a strong preference for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney; the Cintas letter predicted heavy job losses if President Obama were re-elected and asked workers to visit the company's political website, which featured negative rankings of legislators thought to be hostile to a pro-business political agenda. But there is a common thread that links those efforts to those associated with ConocoPhillips and scores of other American companies: the Business-Industry Political Action Committee, or BIPAC, a political organization that has attracted little media scrutiny. Each of Alaska's ""big three"" oil companies--ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and BP--is affiliated with BIPAC, which has ties with more than 100 prominent American firms, including Campbell Soup Co., eBay, Nationwide Insurance, and Walmart. Include its partnerships with hundreds of the country's major trade associations, and BIPAC can reach more than 25 million employees in the United States. Based in Washington, D.C., BIPAC donates directly to political candidates just like other traditional political action committees; this year, it has contributed to a variety of campaigns, including Republican Senate contenders Cory Gardner of Colorado, Terri Lynn Land of Michigan, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Eighty-nine percent of BIPAC's contributions in House and Senate elections this year have gone to Republicans, and not a single dollar or endorsement has gone to a Democrat in a U.S. Senate race. But its primary aim isn't to help individual candidates win office; rather BIPAC's goal is to turn as many private employers as possible into ""employee political education"" machines for business interests. BIPAC urges major companies to transform their workforces into a voting bloc and provides sophisticated tools that show employers how to do it. Although BIPAC claims nonpartisanship, in the races that matter most--such as this year's hotly contested battles that will determine control of the Senate--BIPAC has the GOP's back. Companies do not generally advertise their affiliation with BIPAC. The websites that BIPAC builds and hosts for businesses often contain no indication--other than the BIPAC URL--that the information is coming from a third party. ConocoPhillips' employee engagement website is typical, in that it appears to be wholly created by the company itself. The website even bears a ConocoPhillips copyright. But once employees click the ""election information"" button, they arrive at BIPAC's ranking of elected officials. For those in Alaska, that means seeing a BIPAC performance rating of 86 percent for Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, but only a 26 percent rating for the state's Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, who is fighting a tight race this fall to hold onto his seat. Publicly, BIPAC portrays itself as providing a helpful service that educates employee voters who may not be well versed in political or public policy issues. Citing research BIPAC itself commissioned, the group even claims that workers want their bosses to feed them political information. But of the half-dozen Alaskan workers I interviewed who described being subjected to vigorous political messaging at their workplaces--ties with BIPAC were apparent in at least five cases--all but one asked not to be named. They feared that speaking publicly about their experiences could cost them their jobs. Some feared being blacklisted from the Alaskan oil industry. One worker even said his employer, an oil field construction contractor, would likely be barred from doing business with ConocoPhillips if his identity were discovered. ""They let it be known that if SB 21 was repealed that there would be layoffs,"" said one BP employee, referring to Alaska's Ballot Measure 1. ""It was clear how they wanted us to vote."" The employee said that BP, another BIPAC affiliate, fed its employees a consistent stream of information about the repeal effort through emails and virtual town-hall meetings. He said it was ""absolutely not"" an environment in which it was acceptable to express any dissent over management's political positions. An email sent to every BP employee in Alaska, and obtained by the Investigative Fund, encouraged employees to wave signs rejecting repeal along some of Anchorage's busiest thoroughfares. ""At no time did BP indicate to employees that layoffs would occur in connection with ballot measure 1,"" BP spokesman Brett Clanton said in an emailed response. ""The issue of tax reform was an important issue for BP and was communicated broadly with our employees. Any BP employee that participated in campaign activities did so voluntarily."" BIPAC has particularly strong ties with ConocoPhillips--in 2009, BIPAC held its western regional conference in ConocoPhillips' Anchorage offices--and its presence in Alaska is robust. BIPAC has an active partner in the state called ProsperityAlaska, which is run by Scott Hawkins, a Republican activist and CEO of a logistics contractor for both BP and ConocoPhillips. After the repeal of the tax break failed by roughly 10,000 votes, ProsperityAlaska boasted of having pitted businesses against one another in a contest to turn out the most employee voters. In May, BIPAC leaders traveled to Anchorage to hold a training session for firms seeking to politically engage their employees. More recently, BIPAC has waded into the Senate race, endorsing GOP challenger Dan Sullivan against Begich. ""We very clearly communicate that employers should never tell their employees who to vote for,"" BIPAC's president and chief executive officer, Greg Casey, said in an emailed statement. ""Whether it is ConocoPhillips or Randy's Radiator Repair Shack, the efforts are their own."" He said that while ProsperityAlaska was opposed to Ballot Measure 1, BIPAC itself did not take a position ""on the Alaska bill or any other bill."" A spokeswoman for ConocoPhillips said the firm was a ""primary supporter"" of No on 1 campaign but said that while the firm is a member of both BIPAC and ProsperityAlaska, it did not coordinate its campaign with either group. BP likewise said it has a relationship with BIPAC but did not use them for the campaign against Ballot Measure 1. ""ConocoPhillips does not make employment decisions based on an employee's views on a ballot measure,"" the firm's spokeswoman said. ""ConocoPhillips believes strongly in individual participation in the democratic process regardless of a person's party affiliation or beliefs."" * * * In April, I attended a BIPAC training session for employers at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel in Durham, North Carolina, co-hosted by the state's chamber of commerce. That morning, Joe Savarise, a senior vice president at BIPAC, took to the mic to pitch BIPAC's grand vision to the roughly two dozen representatives of local employers and business associations who had assembled. The group, he said, works through major trade associations, such as local chambers of commerce, to partner directly with a diverse set of businesses that can reach tens of millions of private-sector employees. Companies have the option, Savarise explained, of having BIPAC create branded political materials that have the appearance of having been created by the company itself. Between the businesses and trade associations present in the Sheraton ballroom that day--including North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Co., the North Carolina Hospital Association, the North Carolina Retail Merchants Association, and Piedmont Natural Gas-- BIPAC had the potential to reach some 700,000 workers in the state. Savarise reminded the business crowd of the uniquely advantageous position bosses have in influencing their employees' votes. ""Employers are the most credible source of information for employees about this type of material as it affects their jobs, their own prosperity,"" Savarise said. ""They're susceptible to the information. They're a willing audience."" He advised that political messaging should appeal to employees' sense of economic insecurity, or as he put it, their ""kitchen-table economics."" The group has partnerships with most companies on the Fortune 100 list, according to Bloomberg, and its affiliates have included Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin, Wendy's, Tyson Foods, and Yum Brands, owner of Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut. In a recent BIPAC video posted to YouTube, a Campbell Soup executive urged businesses to feed their workers ""constant streams of information via social media, email, and other technology."" BIPAC claims its tools generated nearly 2 million emails from private-sector employees in the 2012 election cycle alone. According to legal experts, BIPAC is generally on safe ground: Under federal law, employers have tremendous latitude to push politics on their employees. And the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, which expanded the First Amendment rights of corporations, only further entrenched the freedom of companies to express almost any political message to their employees. In contrast, most employees have no legal protections if they choose to object to politics being pushed onto them at work. Indeed, nonunion workers can be fired for almost any speech at all--political or otherwise--that an employer objects to. ""This might surprise some people,"" says John Snyder, an attorney at Jackson Lewis, a law firm based in White Plains, New York, that often represents companies in actions against unions. ""But the First Amendment does not generally stop private employers from firing employees for their political views."" Employment ""at will"" is the rule of the land in the United States, points out Cynthia Estlund, a professor of employment and labor law at New York University School of Law. ""The First Amendment only protects against government action, so in the private sector, you don't have a First Amendment right against employer reprisals based on your speech,"" save for some exceptions, including discrimination against protected classes, Estlund points out. All summer long at ConocoPhillips' massive Kuparuk River oil field, not far from Oliktok Point, management distributed signs, buttons, branded pens, and magnets urging workers to vote against the tax break repeal. Pamphlets were distributed threatening that the oil giant would ""re-evaluate"" previously announced projects if the repeal passed. Managers plastered giant stickers on the floors of hallways around the company's dining hall asserting that the tax cut was ""not a giveaway."" ""The whole crew would talk about how it was complete bullshit,"" one Kuparuk worker said of the ConocoPhillips' campaign. However, no one at the job site dared to express these feelings to management. Almost everyone, he said, suspected that doing so could get you fired. At no point during the April 10 training session in Durham did I hear anyone from BIPAC encourage employers to adopt rules or policies allowing their employees to express their own political opinions. And no such recommendations are present in any of BIPAC's publicly available literature. When I asked BIPAC to provide examples of such language, CEO Greg Casey offered one: a few lines in a forthcoming report that encourage employers to make political emails customizable. ""If form messages are necessary, encourage employees to add a line or two of their own about how the issue impacts them, even at the risk that they will go off message,"" the report reads. * * * While employers can electioneer among their employees with near impunity under federal law, some state laws do place curbs or prohibitions on the practice. At the Durham training session, BIPAC's chief operating officer, Darrell Shull, issued an important caveat: ""BIPAC makes a good-faith effort to represent federal law, but we are not your legal counsel; always consult with your own competent legal counsel before engaging in any activity,"" Shull said. ""We provide you tools from our best practices from working with companies and we know they're very effective, but the disclaimer part is that we're not going to warranty to you that they comply with all election laws at the state level."" Indeed at least nine states have laws on the books that may afford workers protections against components of BIPAC's approach and practices. Mississippi, for instance, forbids employers from making statements or circulating material to ""influence"" the votes of employees. An employer caught doing this in Mississippi can only escape criminal charges by publicly renouncing the practices. Nonetheless, when Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran unexpectedly faced a credible primary challenge from Tea Party candidate Chris McDaniel, BIPAC raced to the senior Republican's aid. After Cochran narrowly won the June primary, BIPAC boasted that its company affiliates in Mississippi had impelled their employees to vote on a large scale. On a post to one of its websites, called Fight for Jobs, the group claimed BIPAC's efforts in the state helped to ""save Cochran"" and that ""many BIPAC members with Mississippi operations undertook a strong GOTV [get out the vote] effort amongst their employees."" Rickey Cole, chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party, says that despite the questionable legality of the practice, employers in Mississippi commonly apply pressure to influence workers' votes. Cole says that several workers subjected to job-site political harassment have called the Democratic Party seeking help. ""The direct statement is usually that if you like your job, you've got to vote for this man because the other man is going to take your job from you,"" Cole said. ""And people here have a great deal of fear for their jobs."" At 7.9 percent, Mississippi's unemployment rate is the country's second highest. Under the banner of its ""Prosperity Project,"" BIPAC has established more than 70 regional partnerships, in nearly every state. These groups typically work in close coordination with, or are even run out of, states' dominant business associations, such as state chambers of commerce. The Prosperity Project is BIPAC's ground game, complete with a sophisticated database of virtually every state-level elected official in the country and websites that issue ""action alerts"" urging employees to contact their legislators in support of pro-business legislation. An action alert on the Illinois Prosperity Project website recently invoked the specter of job loss four times in telling employees to press their legislators to reject a Democrat-sponsored bill to raise the state's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. In California, BIPAC has a well-established Prosperity Project partnership that has close ties to the California Chamber of Commerce. That state forbids ""controlling or directing, or tending to control or direct the political activities or affiliations of employees."" Even some Southern states, such as Louisiana and Kentucky in addition to Mississippi, hardly associated with stringent regulation, have laws on the books placing restrictions on employers' political engagement with their employees. BIPAC has Prosperity Projects in both Louisiana and Kentucky, too, and BIPAC affiliates have publicly acknowledged their role in turning out voters for the re-election campaign of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican. What effect the Citizens United ruling will have on these state laws has yet to be tested in the courts. But already the ruling has enabled corporations to spend wildly on elections through their political action committees--and sometimes the key to raising these funds is the solicitation of donations from a firm's own employees. In an Oct. 1, 2013, email to employees, obtained by the Investigative Fund, BP America President and Chairman John Minge links to a BIPAC-hosted website in announcing that, beginning in January of 2014, employees who donate at least 2.5 percent of their yearly income to BP's political action committee will receive preferential parking spaces at BP offices. * * * BIPAC takes every opportunity to claim nonpartisanship. Strictly speaking, the assertions are true--BIPAC has supported some pro-business Democrats, typically those who represent noncompetitive districts. But they are the exception. This year, despite having donated $16,000 to Republican candidates in competitive Senate races, BIPAC hasn't contributed to a single Democratic Senate candidate. In 2012, BIPAC gave nine times more to Republicans than Democrats in races for the House, according to the Center for Responsive Politics; in races for Senate seats, that proportion rose to 19 to one, with BIPAC's only donation to a Democratic Senate candidate going to Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Behind closed doors at the Durham training session, Greg Casey, BIPAC's CEO, was explicit about the group's political inclinations, referring to Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina as ""the guy who crushed your head in 2012."" On the state level, BIPAC sometimes works hand in glove with GOP operatives. Take Scott Hawkins, the head of BIPAC partner ProsperityAlaska. During the 2012 election, Hawkins set up his own super PAC in order to bring in $100,000 of outside money from the Republican State Leadership Committee to target Democratic state legislators and a few moderate Republicans. A BIPAC slideshow brags of having ousted prominent Democratic state Sen. Joe Paskvan with the help of ProsperityAlaska ads attacking his ""job-killing regulations."" Hawkins personally donated to Alaska Republicans in 2012, according to public disclosures, and ProsperityAlaska is equally partisan. It posts a list of state politicians, each graded A to F. The first page of the list, titled ""the best,"" lists 36 state legislators, all but one of them Republican. (A single Alaska House Democrat appears as the very last name on the list.) As groups, the Senate and House Democrats are given F's. Hawkins did not respond to multiple interview requests. But in comments to local media, Hawkins has claimed to be motivated by the political power of Alaska's unions, some of whom, most prominently the Teamsters, joined with oil companies in the campaign to defeat Ballot Measure 1. Certainly, labor unions have aggressively engaged their members in partisan politics, and Citizens United bolstered these efforts. Yet, when it comes to pushing politics on workers, there are important differences between unions and businesses, according to Charlotte Garden, an assistant professor at Seattle University's School of Law. ""Unions cannot fire someone from  their job for voicing disagreement,"" says Garden. ""This is a power that employers have over employees that unions don't have."" Moreover, union contracts provide protections from job-site political pressure by forbidding employers from unfairly or arbitrarily firing workers. ""Unions can say, 'If you want to be part of this union you have to pay dues,' "" she said, ""but that's about all they can require of their members."" In August, after the effort to repeal Alaska's corporate oil and gas tax break failed, a ProsperityAlaska Web post applauded employees for helping to vote it down. If it had passed, it would have posed ""risks to our pocketbooks."" The group ended on a forward-looking note: ""Let's keep the momentum going this Fall. There is a lot on the line once again.""

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/midterm_elections_may_bring_a_republican_wave_a_guide_to_what_that_would.html	Will this be a wave election? In these uncertain times, when we use a weather metaphor it should be clear. You're either wet or you're not. But it's not clear, because we're using the wrong metaphor. The Republican tide is coming in this election--the GOP will pick up seats in the House and Senate--but the question remains: How big will the wave be? Will it be a gentle lapping that excites the ankles or will it knock you back and part your hair? This isn't just a matter of abstract classification. Whether a party's victory is declared a wave or not sets the conditions for the conversation when that party turns to governing. It is a shorthand expression about the power of one party's ideas, or at least a signal of public revulsion about the ideas of the losing party. It matters in the public debate; if the GOP does well enough, Republicans will point to that strong result as a ratification of whatever they're pushing (even if they didn't mention those ideas during the actual campaign). If Republicans win in states where Democrats traditionally do well, there will be less introspection about party positions. If they are only victorious in the places where they were expected to win, the internal spats over hot-button issues or whether candidates were too moderate (and not proud conservatives) will recommence. Political scientists would warn us about drawing conclusions about the fundamentals of politics based on a handful of off-year election victories--and they'd be right. But one thing is certain: The outcome of these races and how they are characterized will provide the language for strategists, politicians, and party fundraisers in the conversations to come. It is in that context that we offer a preliminary classification scheme for the results in the Senate races. In other words, how to read a wave: Undertow: The GOP doesn't take the Senate. Republicans have everything going for them this cycle. They recruited good candidates, the president is unpopular, and they have plenty of money to compete. If Republicans do not win the six seats needed to take control of the Senate, it will be because they lost at least one state Republicans regularly win in presidential elections. Not only would they have failed to take advantage of Obama's dismal approval ratings, they would have failed to win on their home turf. Nature's Course: Victories in the six states Mitt Romney won by double-digits. If Republicans win in Louisiana, Alaska, Arkansas, Montana, West Virginia, and South Dakota that's great for the party, and it would give the Republicans control of the Senate, assuming they don't lose in any states Republicans currently hold. Simply winning control of the Senate would give the Republican brand a good push. A lot of voters would equate winning the big prize with a national ratification of GOP ideas. But for people in the trenches, such a victory would only be meeting expectations. Historically, six seats is about the number of seats a president's party loses in the sixth year of a presidency. This result would also represent the new norm for Senate elections, where the trend has been that voters elect senators from the same party as the person for whom they cast their presidential ballot. As a matter of policy the verdict it would render would be that Republican voters agree with Republican policies. Life raft: A GOP victory in Kansas. This doesn't really fit the tide analogy, but that's fine because Kansas didn't fit any model of how this election was supposed to proceed. President Obama lost the state by 22 points and Sen. Pat Roberts, the three-term Republican incumbent, should never have been in such serious jeopardy, but then it was unexpected that the Democrat would be convinced to drop out and previous Democrat would run as an independent. Given how bad things looked for Roberts, defeating independent Greg Orman will be a victory, but the fact that he required buckets of emergency cash and a squadron of surrogates is not a sign of party health. Don't move the beach towel: Republicans win the Romney Red Six and hold Georgia. David Perdue, the Republican candidate in Georgia, has had some stumbles. The former business executive has defended his support of outsourcing in a state that has the second highest unemployment rate in the country. If Republicans win, it will be a sign the party is strong enough to save even bad candidates in a state where shifting demographics have given Democrats a shot. Georgia was the state in which Romney received his second smallest margin of victory after North Carolina. A moat for your sand castle: A Republican victory in Iowa. This is the spiritual homeland of the Obama movement. The president won the Iowa caucus in 2008 and then captured the state in the general election twice. The Democratic ground game there is robust. But Democratic Senate pick Bruce Braley has drawn mixed reviews as a candidate and had what may be the gaffe of the season, when a video surfaced of him insulting the state's senior senator as merely a farmer to an audience of Texas lawyers he was asking for campaign donations. Republican candidate Joni Ernst has run a disciplined campaign, but she has been trying to downplay her conservative roots to make as few waves as possible. Nothing about the race suggests a grand victory for Republican ideas. Bringing in driftwood: Winning North Carolina. Barack Obama won in North Carolina in 2008, and Tar Heel country was once considered the kind of modern southern state where the Democratic coalition was on the rise. A GOP win would be the second consecutive victory in the state after Romney's win in 2012. Knocking off an incumbent isn't easy, and Republicans will be able to claim that state Rep. Thom Tillis wasn't hurt by the conservative policies he enacted as speaker of the House--policies Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan talked about relentlessly. Message: You can govern like a conservative and survive in a purple state. Goodbye sand castle: Winning in Colorado. Barack Obama carried the state twice, and Democrats paid particular attention to the ground game there. They also made it ground zero for their appeal to female voters. If the Republican candidate Corey Gardner wins, it will suggest that well-worn Democratic play may no longer be enough. Suitable for Body Surfing: If Republicans win in New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado, and North Carolina. Taking four purple states, most of which Obama carried twice, would allow Republicans to say that they have a message that can win almost anywhere. It would also represent bragging rights in Iowa and New Hampshire--two primary states that tend to get more press coverage than the others. For the next two years, commentators and reporters would reference those Republican victories whenever they ran stories on the presidential jockeying. The Senate races aren't the only factors that will determine the post-election national landscape for Republicans. The gubernatorial races may, in fact, send equal or greater political shockwaves through the political class. If Govs. Scott Walker and Sam Brownback survive, their names will be repeated by conservatives who argue that you can govern as a conservative and prosper politically. If they lose, they will be cautionary tales as the GOP tries to fashion a message to build support for their next presidential candidate's platform. Every tide contains a ripple of the next big wave.

It's a gun. Despite mass shootings in every part of the country--Tucson, Aurora, Fort Hood, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook--firearms seem more popular than ever. The contest among candidates to prove which of them is more gun-friendly has literally become an arms race. Here's how they're using their weapons. 1. I'm my own rifle association. In West Virginia's Senate race, Republican Shelley Moore Capito has the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. Democrat Natalie Tennant says that doesn't matter. ""I grew up on a farm surrounded by guns, with my brothers, going hunting and shooting,"" Tennant bragged in their Oct. 7 debate. ""Having a muzzle loader myself that I use quite frequently,"" said Tennant, ""I don't need the NRA"" to tell West Virginians which candidate loves guns. 2. I own guns, so I know background checks aren't a hassle. ""I have two guns,"" independent Senate candidate Greg Orman claimed in an Oct. 15 debate in Kansas. ""When I bought those guns, I had to go through a background check. And I don't believe it was intrusive."" So it's no big deal, Orman concluded, to apply the same rule to sales at gun shows. 3. I'm an environmentalist because I love guns. In an Oct. 13 Senate debate, Montana Democrat Amanda Curtis was pressed to explain her F rating from the NRA. She turned the question toward her opponent's weak environmental record. ""My husband and I, just in the week before the nominating convention, were out shooting the Browning 12-gauge light that his grandfather, who recently passed away, left to us,"" said Curtis. ""Montanans should be much more worried about ... accessing our public lands so that we can use our firearms."" 4. I don't own a gun, but my spouse does. Aimee Belgard, the Democratic nominee for Congress in New Jersey's 3rd District, favors gun restrictions. But she claims a family connection to the other side. ""I fully understand and appreciate the Second Amendment,"" she assured gun owners in an Oct. 2 debate. ""My husband actually owns guns."" 5. I don't own a gun, but my neighbors do. ""I'm from York County, where the first day of deer season is a holiday,"" Democratic candidate Tom Wolf pointed out in an Oct. 8 gubernatorial debate in Pennsylvania. Those roots, he argued, made him the best person to lead a statewide conversation about legitimate and illegitimate uses of firearms. 6. I don't own a gun, but my mom used to shoot one. Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado doesn't claim to own a gun. Instead, he reminisces about his mom. ""I strongly support the Second Amendment,"" Udall declared in an Oct. 7 debate. ""My mother was the person who taught me how to handle a gun. She was a Coloradan. She was a member of the NRA."" 7. I don't just own a gun. I have a concealed weapons permit. ""I have always believed in the Second Amendment,"" Nikki Haley, the Republican governor of South Carolina, pledged in an Oct. 21 debate. ""And I believe in it because I'm a certified weapons permit holder myself."" Moments later, one of Haley's challengers announced that he, too, had a concealed weapons permit. 8. I don't just own guns. I teach my kids to use them. Dennis Richardson, the Republican nominee for governor of Oregon, sounds a bit wimpy. But then he starts talking about his family. ""I've got one son and eight daughters. I've trained them in the use of handguns. We've done target practice,"" says Richardson. ""I've got one daughter who is a dead-eye."" 9. I don't just own guns. I'm pals with gun manufacturers. Asa Hutchinson, the Republican nominee for governor of Arkansas, says he's been courting companies whose firearms violate other states' laws:"	For Candidates, Posing With Guns Has Become an Arms Race
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/state_ebola_quarantines_chris_christie_andrew_cuomo_and_other_american_governors.html	"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo caught everyone off guard this past Friday when they announced mandatory 21-day quarantines for medical workers arriving from West Africa. Public health experts, who had been warning against such measures for weeks, quickly voiced their displeasure. Undeterred by those expert opinions, at least a half-dozen other governors scrambled to follow Christie and Cuomo's lead, announcing their own state-specific Ebola protocols that go beyond the active monitoring the federal government has deemed sufficient for all but the highest-risk individuals. This is the problem with states designing their own Ebola policies: We now have a patchwork of competing and sometimes contradictory regulations that at times even government officials have struggled to explain. The resulting mess could have disastrous effects both at home and abroad. It could convince American doctors not to volunteer in Sierra Leone, Guinea, or Liberia, where they are desperately needed. And it risks encouraging medical workers to evade hostile state governments, which could leave local health officials unprepared to act if the worst happens. As the editors of the usually reserved New England Journal of Medicine put it Monday: ""[Christie and Cuomo's] action is like driving a carpet tack with a sledgehammer: It gets the job done but overall is more destructive than beneficial."" Worse still, neither President Obama nor anyone else appears to have the power to pry that sledgehammer from the governors' hands. State and local officials are tasked with controlling the spread of disease within their jurisdictions. The role of the federal government, meanwhile, is to keep the virus from arriving on U.S. soil or spreading between states. The White House could, in theory, step in if a state wasn't doing enough to contain an outbreak, but its hands are tied when it comes to stopping a state that goes too far. ""I guess you can take that up with James Madison,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest quipped Monday when asked why the administration hasn't mandated a single overarching set of standards for the entire country. Traditionally, federalism hasn't been detrimental to public health. States and cities have a history of success when it comes to controlling diseases like tuberculosis and the measles. But those infectious diseases are highly contagious and likely to spread locally, where state and municipal officials are best able to coordinate the necessary response. Ebola, meanwhile, is highly infectious but not highly contagious. It takes only a small amount of contact with the virus to become infected, but the only way for that contact to happen is through the bodily fluids of someone who is sick. That's why experts say there is no need to quarantine nurses and doctors who have been exposed. Even if they have been infected, they'll have a chance to self-diagnose and get themselves to a hospital before they become contagious. That's why a single, overarching national policy that is as unobtrusive as possible makes sense, especially given that there's just one person in the United States right now with a diagnosed, active case of Ebola. It's the only way to ensure that American medical workers answer the call abroad, while still receiving the attention they need once they return home. Ebola, of course, does pose unique challenges to each city and state. New York City's size alone makes it a special case, and explains why the city's health department went to great lengths to ensure that it was ready to go before Craig Spencer fell ill last week. That preparedness seems to have paid off. While health officials will continue to monitor those who came in contact with Spencer for the virus's full 21-day incubation period, there's been nothing to suggest that the virus spread. The need for local vigilance notwithstanding, Ebola is more of a global problem than a local one. When it comes to the disease's spread, it matters more what happens in the United States in general than in New York or New Jersey specifically, and even more what happens abroad than what happens at home. The only way to guarantee an Ebola outbreak won't happen here, where it has claimed only one life, is to end the epidemic in West Africa, where it has already claimed more than 4,900. But that message has been lost on Christie and his ilk, and the results are getting increasingly messy. Consider the rules that greet medical workers upon their arrival at one of five federally mandated points of entry. Land in New York City or Newark, and they face a mandatory 21-day quarantine, regardless of risk level. Arrive in Chicago, and they should be prepared for the same--unless, that is, they wore ""protective clothing"" while treating patients. Fly into Atlanta, and they can either agree to check in twice daily with health officials or be involuntarily quarantined at a ""state-designated facility."" Touch down at Dulles International in Virginia, and they face the same active monitoring but without the threat of forced isolation. The already confusing hodgepodge is likely to get even more Byzantine as states continue to tweak and revise their rules. That's something Kaci Hickox, the Doctors Without Borders nurse who was quarantined against her will in a New Jersey hospital over the weekend, is experiencing firsthand. Hickox is now at an undisclosed location in Maine, where she has agreed to be quarantined for an unspecified amount of time. Her current isolation is supposed to be voluntary, but in reality it doesn't appear she had any other choice. ""We fully expect individuals to voluntarily comply with an in-home quarantine,"" Adrienne Bennett, a spokeswoman for Gov. Paul LePage, told Slate. ""If an individual is not compliant, the state is prepared to take appropriate action."" Bennett refused to elaborate on what an ""appropriate action"" might look like, but the subtext seems clear: Hickox can accept a ""voluntary"" quarantine or be subject to an involuntary one. Hickox's story is unlikely to convince other American medical professionals to go to Sierra Leone, Guinea, or Liberia. That's a problem for all of us. In an emotional appeal to the international medical community on Tuesday, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim estimated that West Africa needed at least 5,000 more medical volunteers to end the epidemic. We can't afford to give American doctors and nurses one more reason to stay at home. America's governors, meanwhile, say they are just doing their jobs. ""My first responsibility is to protect the public health and safety of the people of New Jersey,"" Christie told the Today show on Tuesday. That's exactly the problem. The fact that a governor, almost by definition, focuses first and foremost on the short-term risk to his own state leaves him unable to consider the bigger picture. America's governors are acting like they're the best men and women for the job. In reality, it's their jobs that make them uniquely unsuited to dictate the country's response to a global crisis."	America's Governors Are the Last People Who Should Be Making Rules About Ebola
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/republicans_want_a_general_to_fight_ebola_the_gop_prefers_the_u_s_military.html	"Republicans have a simple plan to deal with Ebola. First, ban travel from infected countries to the United States. Second, slap a three-week quarantine on any American returning from those countries. Medical organizations and federal health officials say these ideas are counterproductive, but that's OK. Republicans don't listen to doctors. They listen to generals. Republicans have an unshakeable faith in military leaders. In 2001, Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, blew the chance to kill or capture Osama Bin Laden at Tora Bora. That allowed Bin Laden to plot against the United States for another decade. Three years after Franks' mistake, President Bush gave Franks the Medal of Freedom. In 2002, Bush's Secretary of State, Gen. Colin Powell, assured Americans and the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Powell's presentation served as the basis for the Iraq war. The WMD never showed up, but Powell served out his term. Being an Ebola doctor in West Africa can be more dangerous than being a soldier in Afghanistan. From 2001 to 2014, the total number of American military casualties in Afghanistan was 2,350. That's an average of 14 per month. During the current Ebola outbreak, from March to August, the disease killed more than 120 health care workers in West Africa. That's at least 20 per month. Nevertheless, Americans worship the heroism of soldiers, not doctors. In Gallup surveys, only 35 percent of Americans say they have a ""great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in the medical system. The percentage who express that level of confidence in the military is twice as high. The gap is even bigger among Republicans, particularly since Ebola arrived in the United States. In a CBS News poll taken Oct. 15-16, Democrats were evenly divided on the performance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 49 percent rated the CDC's performance good or excellent, while 49 percent rated it fair or poor. Republicans, however, gave the agency a clear thumbs down: 64 percent rated the CDC fair or poor; only 35 percent rated it good or excellent. When respondents were asked about the armed forces, the partisan split went the other way: 89 percent of Republicans expressed a ""great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in the military, compared with 65 percent of Democrats. This broad, deep political support, particularly among the party faithful, undergirds the Republican response to Ebola. Essentially, the GOP has militarized the issue: Seal the borders, impose a ""no-fly zone"" on West Africa, and quarantine anyone who shows up at our airports. Those brave doctors returning from Liberia? Lock 'em up. And if the doctors say we're wrongheaded, tell people that the real authority on Ebola is our generals. On Oct. 7, Gen. John F. Kelly, the Marine Corps general in charge of the U.S. Southern Command, told a crowd at the National Defense University that ""there is no way we can keep Ebola [contained] in West Africa."" If Ebola breaks out in Central America, the general predicted, ""there will be mass migration into the United States."" Kelly said he'd been told by a U.S. embassy staffer that some guys who'd been seen waiting to enter Nicaragua from Costa Rica were Liberian and that they ""could have made it to New York City and still be within the incubation period for Ebola."" He offered no evidence that the men had Ebola. In fact, the number of verified Ebola cases in Central America was zero. But conservative websites pounced on his statements, reporting that he had said ""the real threat of a domestic Ebola outbreak"" was a ""flood of Ebola-carrying border jumpers."" Kelly's statements became a rallying cry on the right. Scott Brown, the Republican Senate candidate in New Hampshire, concluded that Ebola ""underscores the need to secure our borders."" When reporters pointed out that medical professionals disagreed with Brown's advice, the candidate invoked Kelly as his expert. In a campaign debate, Brown had this exchange with Wolf Blitzer: Brown: Gen. Kelly, who's in charge of the border in Mexico, has indicated that the clearest pathway to bring anything--whether it's criminals, terrorists, or disease--is through that southern border. So it's not me talking. It's also Gen. Kelly and many other people who care and understand this issue. That's why we need to close the border. It's so critical. I voted to close the border. Sen. [Jeanne] Shaheen has voted not to close the border, and that's a huge difference between us.

Blitzer: Sen. Brown, let's just be precise. Are you saying Ebola is crossing the border?

Brown: I've never said Ebola's crossing the border, but Gen. Kelly has indicated and stated that the clearest path to get any type of disease--especially if Ebola hits Latin America--people are going to be coming through that southern border like it's a wide-open situation, as it is, and even worse. And he recommends that we close it in the event that that happens. In other words, Kelly was fantasizing. But because he's a general, we're supposed to take his fantasy more seriously than the recommendations of public health officials. On Oct. 17, President Obama announced that Ron Klain, the former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, would coordinate the government's response to Ebola. Republicans were outraged. They ridiculed Klain, pointing out that he had no medical training. Instead, they said Obama should have chosen ""a four-star general or admiral."" A ""much more appropriate type of appointee,"" they suggested, would have been Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, the man who led the military task force that responded to Hurricane Katrina. Honore, like Klain, has no medical training. But he does have a lot of medals and a lot of ideas about how to fight Ebola. In a Fox News interview on Friday, Honore spoke of Ebola as though it were a military adversary (""We've got to go on the offense and go after this disease"") or a hurricane (""We need to have a plan right now to evacuate people""). He said doctors couldn't be trusted to follow protocols: ""Forty percent of them don't wash their hands. Forty-five percent of the doctors don't even take the flu shot."" He advised viewers not to rely on ""things that the CDC was saying,"" and he suggested that Ebola might be transmitted in ways that doctors hadn't acknowledged: ""There's still some unknowns about this disease. We ought to watch people who speak emphatically about how this disease operates."" By all accounts, Honore salvaged the federal response to Katrina after its disastrous start. But can you imagine this guy as the government's spokesman on Ebola? On Friday, Republicans tried to enlist another general in their campaign against the doctors. At a congressional hearing, they claimed that fighting Ebola was just like fighting terrorists, and they accused Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC's director, of giving false testimony about how Ebola is transmitted. They summoned health officials and pressed them to endorse a travel ban and an automatic quarantine for doctors returning from West Africa. When the officials said these ideas were misguided, the Republicans turned to the witness in uniform, Maj. Gen. James Lariviere. They asked him to back up their claim that people could get Ebola by sitting next to an infected person on a bus. Instead, Lariviere deferred to guidance from the CDC and other medical authorities. Eventually, the congressmen grew exasperated. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky told Lariviere:"	Why the GOP Wants Generals to Wage War on Ebola

And--as evidenced by a 2013 survey from the liberal-leaning Democracy Corps--we've also known that this majority is most responsive to a rigid base of older conservative whites, who fear demographic change and everything it represents. None of this has changed. If, as projected, Republicans win the Senate on Nov. 4, they will do so on the strength of majorities in conservative to moderate states like Iowa, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska, Colorado, and New Hampshire. And overwhelmingly, they'll rely on older whites, who vote at higher rates than younger voters and minorities. Republican candidates like Joni Ernst in Iowa and Cory Gardner in Colorado might have moderate affects, but their core support comes from the most conservative parts of their respective electorates.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/medicare_and_social_security_reform_is_toxic_in_midterm_elections_republicans.html	"WINGATE, North Carolina--For a short time, there was a feeling, shared by Republicans and Democrats, that Medicare and Social Security were losing their power as third rails in American politics. In the final weeks of the 2014 midterm campaigns, it seems like the electricity is once again flowing nicely. Candidates in opposing camps can agree on little, but they both know that telling horror stories about what your opponent might do to Social Security and Medicare is effective. ""Kay Hagan cast a tie-breaking vote not only for the Obamacare law but to take $716 million from Medicare to spend on Obamacare,"" said Rep. Paul Ryan on Wednesday at North Carolina's Wingate University, as he campaigned for Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis. Ryan reminded voters that his mother is on Medicare and that Hagan had voted against the program. (The Affordable Care Act reduced the rate of Medicare growth, which Republicans have traditionally not considered a cut, and the reductions were aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. Fact-checkers say that this does not constitute a threat to the Medicare system, as Ryan claims.) Ryan regularly makes it seem as though sensible people could agree on budget reforms if they only reasoned together. He has criticized Democrats, saying that when it comes to entitlement reform, their tactic is ""to wait for Republicans to propose solutions, then attack them."" But that's a pretty good summation of what he's doing here. No one is going to chance putting forward new reforms if Ryan is going to hit the campaign trail and accuse him or her of ""raiding, robbing, and cutting Medicare,"" as he did Hagan. Campaigning on threats to Medicare and Social Security is a familiar play, but it takes on special meaning when Ryan does it: It's a testament to just how irresistible it is. After all, Ryan was supposed to be the politician who had touched the third rail of entitlement reform and lived. He proposed changes in Medicare before the last several elections and continues to be re-elected in a district that is not heavily tilted toward Republicans. Democrats attacked Republicans for supporting his plan, but most of these GOP members were also re-elected. But by leveling this blunt attack on Hagan--which obliterates all nuance--Ryan is testifying that the issue is more powerful than any policy details that might explain why a particular reform doesn't constitute a dire threat to the system. Before watching Ryan, I had been in Louisiana to cover Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu's race against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy. For two days Landrieu lambasted Cassidy's plans for Social Security and Medicare. ""I want you to talk to the seniors, 'cause they're going to vote strong in this election--they always do--I want you to tell them my opponent voted to end the Medicare program as we know it,"" she said, addressing a group of local female leaders in Baton Rouge. Her attack is actually rooted in Cassidy's support for the Republican Study Committee budget, which raises the retirement age for Social Security. Ryan and Cassidy also believe in giving Medicare enrollees a fixed amount of money that can be used to buy insurance in the private market. Landrieu said she understood the entitlement programs need fixing, but not if it was going to fund tax breaks for millionaires at the expense of working people. ""If you've been changing hotel beds since you were 20 years old and you're making $11 to $12 an hour, I think changing beds for 50 years is enough, don't you? And if you're building roads in Louisiana in the hot sun, it can be 110 degrees, and when you are driving those tractors and breathing those fumes, I think that 50 years of paving roads is enough."" That's old-time religion in Democratic campaigns, but some Republican campaigns are now sounding a lot like Landrieu. As Lori Montgomery of the Washington Post notes, Republicans are attacking Democrats for Social Security reforms that much of their party supports. For example, Republicans are attacking Georgia Democratic Rep. John Barrow for supporting Ryan's proposal of raising the age for receiving Social Security. The conservative group Crossroads GPS is running ads attacking Democrats on the same issue. In North Carolina an ad says that Hagan is a ""big believer"" in a controversial plan that ""raises the retirement age."" (The ad is referring to the Simpson-Bowles budget reform plan.) Karl Rove founded Crossroads GPS; you may remember Rove once tried to help President Bush reform the Social Security system but failed because members in Congress worried that they would be attacked in just the way members are being attacked now. Bush supported the idea of raising the retirement age, too. Stalwarts in both parties say that their plans are the real reforms and that the criticisms of their opponents are totally valid. When you watch this play out on the campaign trail, those facts don't seem to matter at all, nor does the fact that every year for the last six years in a row the Congressional Budget Office has reduced its estimate for how much the federal government will need to spend on Medicare in coming years. The political benefit of the attacks are too juicy for the details to get in the way. The next time a budget deal collapses over entitlement reforms, it will be because these vignettes from the campaign trail are the ones that Congress members remember best."

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/michael_brown_leaked_autopsy_results_darren_wilson_s_and_brown_s_supporters.html	"In his account to investigators, Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson said Michael Brown charged him. Specifically, Wilson said Brown struggled for his gun during a scuffle in his police SUV and almost reached the trigger. After blocking his grab for the gun, Wilson fired two shots--hitting Brown in the hand--and fired again when, he says, Brown stopped running, turned around, and took another lunge. On Wednesday, a new analysis of the official autopsy report--released by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch--seemed to support this account. The newspaper asked two independent experts who aren't involved in the investigation to review the evidence. The first, St. Louis County Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Graham, says that the report ""does support that there was a significant altercation at the car."" And while the report notes the lack of short-range gunpowder burns or stipple around Brown's hands, Graham says, ""Sometimes, when it's really close, such as within an inch or so, there is no stipple, just smoke."" One of the experts--Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist in San Francisco--was even more certain on the autopsy's implications. It ""supports the fact that this guy is reaching for the gun, if he has gunpowder particulate material in the wound,"" she said. ""If he had his hand near the gun when it goes off, he's going for the officer's gun."" What's more, she said that the autopsy didn't support witnesses who claimed Brown was running away. ""The wound to the top of Brown's head would indicate he was falling forward or in a lunging position toward the shooter,"" writes the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in a summary of her remarks. But there's a problem here. Melinek says she was misconstrued. ""I'm not saying that Brown going for the gun is the only explanation. I'm saying the officer said he was going for the gun, and the right thumb wound supports that,"" she later told MSNBC. ""I have limited information. It could also be consistent with other scenarios. That's the important thing. That's why the witnesses need to speak to the grand jury and the grand jury needs to hear all the unbiased testimony and compare those statements to the physical evidence."" That the autopsy is consistent with Wilson's account is a godsend for the police officer. And to that end, there's speculation that the autopsy was leaked as a prelude to news that Wilson would escape an indictment from the grand jury. At the same time, it's important to note the extent to which this autopsy agrees with one conducted in August by Dr. Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner for New York City. According to his autopsy, Brown was shot six times, including twice in the head. ""This one here looks like his head was bent downward,"" he said, referring to the wound at the top of Brown's head. ""It can be because he's giving up, or because he's charging forward at the officer."" And both autopsies fit the opposing accounts from other witnesses. ""[Wilson] reached out the window and tried to choke my friend. We were trying to get away, and he tried to pull my friend into the car,"" said Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown, saw the whole encounter, and never claimed there wasn't a fight at the police vehicle. The question, rather, is what precisely happened. Later, we learned of two witnesses who saw the shooting and filmed their near-instant reaction. ""He had his f-ckin' hands up,"" said one of the men, echoing other reports. The Justice Department is conducting its own autopsy, and it's likely to fit the results of the previous ones. (It has also condemned this leak, calling it ""irresponsible and highly troubling."") Which is to say that--barring new evidence--we're stuck with the facts we've had since August, none of which gives a conclusive answer to the key question in the case: Who started it? And even if it did--and even if Brown was at fault for the whole encounter--we're still left with the other important question: Why did Wilson keep firing after Brown moved away? At this point, any answer is tied tightly to your sympathies. Side with Michael Brown and the Ferguson protesters, and you're likely to think Wilson overreacted or--at worst--actively abused his power. And if you support Darren Wilson, you're just as likely to see an honest cop just defending himself from a dangerous aggressor. Put another way, Ferguson is still thick with tension from Brown's shooting, and if Wilson isn't indicted, it could explode into a new round of protests. Indeed, it's possible this is why Gov. Jay Nixon--who received low marks for his initial response--has announced a Ferguson Commission devoted to studying the social and economic conditions that led to the initial August protests. ""The commission will be empowered to call on experts to address topics ranging from governance, poverty, education, and law enforcement,"" said Nixon. ""The commission will also recommend changes to make the region a 'fairer place for everyone to live.' "" It's a fine goal. But given the anger on the ground, it's hard to believe that any commission--however well-meaning--could bring normalcy to Ferguson. For that, the people of Ferguson need accountability from the police, and on that score, all signs point to disappointment."	Michael Brown's Autopsy Results Won't Solve Ferguson's Tragedy
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/democratic_candidates_are_bashing_china_liberals_are_trying_to_tarnish_republicans.html	"Democratic candidates are on the run. In ad after ad, debate after debate, they're being hammered for ""voting 97 percent with Barack Obama"" and supporting ""the policies of this failed president."" They need a boogeyman. And they've found one: China. Exploiting American anxiety about Asia is a long, unsavory tradition. As the Soviet Union unraveled in the 1980s and 1990s, many candidates turned their xenophobic fire from Russia to Japan and Korea. The threat was no longer military; it was economic. Now the enemy is China, whose economy, by some measures, has just surpassed that of the United States. Democrats, tired of looking soft on ISIS or Ebola, are talking tough on China. And they're trying to make Republicans look un-American. Liberals don't like to think of themselves as xenophobic. They don't believe in war or global domination. But they do believe in government intervention in the economy to protect the little guy. And in a global economy, the little guy is often willing to believe that the chief threat to his livelihood is a foreign power. A few months ago, when Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia was asked in a debate about subsidies for American exports, he answered with the language of war. ""I'm not going to unilaterally disarm American businesses,"" said Warner. ""And Lord knows, when you go against the Chinese, it's not a level playing field."" The most aggressive anti-China campaign in this election cycle is the one in Kentucky against Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican. Last year, a liberal PAC, Progress Kentucky, tweeted a link to an article that accused McConnell's Chinese-American wife, former U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, of making ""racist remarks about U.S. workers."" The tweet said: ""This woman has the ear of @mcconnellpress-- she's his #wife. May explain why your job moved to #China!"" The PAC later deleted its tweet. But the anti-China message has been picked up by McConnell's Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes. In one ad, the Grimes campaign has chastised McConnell for working to ""create jobs for China"" instead of Kentucky. Another ad says he ""toasted the Chinese vice president for 'China's great achievements.' "" Grimes says McConnell ""led a filibuster against cracking down on China's currency manipulation"" and ""repeatedly voted to give special trade benefits to China."" She even faults him for saying that ""by engaging economically with the PRC, the U.S. can support and promote continued economic development in China."" Grimes has targeted China's leaders and policies. But other Democrats have appealed directly to anger at Chinese workers. Two weeks ago, during a debate for Congress in Illinois, Rep. Cheri Bustos accused her Republican opponent of supporting tax breaks that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Bustos described how a doomed American worker met her foreign usurpers: ""I know the woman who had to scrape the tape off the floor--after she trained the Chinese replacements who were taking her job--to get that plant ready for closure."" Every state has its own angle. ""Idaho has lost 18,000 jobs to China,"" said Nels Mitchell, the state's Democratic senatorial nominee, in an Oct. 6 debate. Two weeks later, in a debate in New Hampshire, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was offered the chance to question Republican challenger Scott Brown. ""Here in New Hampshire, we have the highest percentage of jobs that have been shipped to China of any state in the country,"" Shaheen told Brown. ""So why in the world would you support outsourcing American jobs overseas?"" The China threat puts a backbone of nationalism in Democrats' appeals for domestic spending, as the Soviet Union did in the 1950s and 1960s. For Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, it's an argument for funding education: ""We need a first-rate education system"" because kids in Arkansas ""are literally competing with people in China and India and Europe and Mexico."" For Gov. Jerry Brown of California, it's an argument for mass transit: ""Fifteen other countries have high-speed rail. China, which on a per capita basis is poorer than America ... just built 5,000 miles."" For Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, it's an argument for highway construction--""the investments we need to make in order for America to be competitive again against other countries, like China and others, that are investing heavily in world-class, modern infrastructure."" For Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic senatorial nominee in Iowa, it's an argument for a government-guided manufacturing strategy. ""In 2000, U.S. manufactured exports were three times those of China,"" says Braley. ""In 2012, China's manufactured exports were 58 percent greater than the United States'."" China also gives Democrats a way to neutralize traditional Republican issues.  For Warner, China makes the case against budget cuts: ""We have to be very guarded with the Chinese. ... Education, infrastructure, and research and development--if we are going to have a strong America economically, that's not where we should be cutting."" For Pryor, China makes the case against tax cuts. He says his Republican challenger's pledge not to raise taxes is really a pledge ""to protect special tax breaks for corporations that outsource our jobs,"" such as ""tax breaks for moving expenses when they pack up and leave for China and Mexico."" Several Democrats have used China to deflect Republican demands for the Keystone pipeline. NextGen Climate Action, a liberal PAC, ran an ad that declared:"	Democrats Are in Trouble. Time to Bash China.
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/age_of_candidacy_laws_should_be_abolished_why_18_year_olds_should_be_able.html	"In January, state Sen. Linda Lopez of Arizona retired after 13 years in the legislature. Before announcing her retirement, Lopez looked for a candidate to endorse to fill her vacancy. She soon settled on Daniel Hernandez, Jr., a friend and a board member of Tuscon's Sunnyside Unified School District. He agreed and began gathering support to run for office. A win seemed likely. There was just one problem. Hernandez was 24. Arizona law requires legislators to be at least 25 years old. But Hernandez initially hoped he could run because he would turn 25 just 13 days after being sworn in. It wouldn't have been unprecedented. Young federal and state legislators-to-be have found ways to work around age of candidacy laws for almost as long as the laws have existed. Back in 1806, antebellum statesman Henry Clay was appointed to the U.S. Senate at the age of 29 and reached the Senate's age of eligibility, 30, more than three months after being sworn in. No one seemed to mind. Hernandez wasn't so lucky. As he found out, Arizona state law requires candidates to sign an affidavit proving that they will be eligible for the office they seek on Election Day, barring him from running altogether. The law was clear: 24-year-old Hernandez was unqualified to serve in the state Senate this year. But a 25-year-old Hernandez would have been fine. It didn't matter that Hernandez had already worked on education legislation as a lobbyist and director of the Arizona Students' Association. His service on the city of Tucson's GLBT commission, a body that advises the city's mayor and city council on queer rights, was similarly irrelevant. His management of state Sen. Steve Farley's re-election campaign, his work as the Southern Arizona Director of former Surgeon General Richard Carmona's Senate campaign, and his role as a Latino Outreach Coordinator for the Arizona Democratic Party all counted for nothing. And the job he is best known for, in the eyes of the law, was just as meaningless. In January 2011, Hernandez began working as a staffer to Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. It was Hernandez who, just five days after starting work, delivered the initial care that saved Giffords' life after Jared Lee Loughner's assassination attempt. In a speech at a nationally televised vigil for the incident's victims, Hernandez claimed he wasn't a hero. President Obama disagreed and said so. But the age requirements of the Arizona constitution don't bend for heroes. According to the law, Daniel Hernandez is not an individual with a body of accomplishment. He is a 24-year-old. And 24-year-olds, the law presumes, are too immature to serve in the Arizona state house. ""I have more experience with legislation than a lot of people running who are in their 40s,"" he told me. ""It's been a really kind of interesting experience for me to listen to the argument that young people don't have experience when I've been doing this for years."" * * * Young people like Hernandez are rare, but not terribly so. Qualified candidates have their efforts thwarted by age of candidacy laws in elections across the country every year. Each time, people like Hernandez are told to wait their turn.

Here is a seldom discussed truth about our democracy: The citizenship enjoyed by American adults under the age of 35 is a second-class citizenship. We gain the right to participate fully in American democracy on our 35th birthdays, and not a day before. For on that day, provided all other requirements are met, we become constitutionally eligible to run for virtually all federal, state, and local offices, including the presidency. The fact that very few of us will ever exercise the right to run for any office is irrelevant to the milestone's significance. The consequence of the nation's age of candidacy laws is that one-third of American adults--the more than 74 million people between 18 to 35--don't enjoy full political rights: If they're citizens, they have the right to vote without necessarily having the right to be voted for. This is wrong. The right of Americans 18 and older to vote was guaranteed by the 26th Amendment, which, after being speedily ratified in 1971, lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. That amendment came into being after years of protest by youths who could not vote for or against the wars they were forced to fight. Those protests were about competence as much as they were about unfairness. How was it possible that an 18 year old could be mature enough to kill, but not mature enough to cast a ballot? Today, the very same kind of question can be asked about the right to run for office. As Pomona College professor John Seery writes in his book about the Constitution's age requirements, Too Young To Run, the age of 18, as the age of majority in most of the country, grants one the right to take on a whole host of consequential responsibilities. ""In our country, eighteen- to thirty-four-year-olds can buy cigarettes, donate organs, play the lottery, drive cars, fly airplanes, shoot guns, start businesses, own homes, sign contracts, have consensual sex, get married, get divorced, have children, have abortions, join the military, serve as jurors, and be tried in court as full adults,"" he writes. ""But for some reason they are still branded, as an entire group, as somehow too immature and too inexperienced to run for one or more categories of elected federal office."" Seery believes, given all the other rights and responsibilities one takes on by the time they've turned 18, that 18-year-olds should also be granted the right to run for federal office by a constitutional amendment. But one could go even further. The 26th Amendment granted 18-year-olds the right to vote in both federal and state elections. A new amendment inspired by the 26th could similarly grant all adults 18 and older the right to run in all elections federal, state, and local--an expansion of rights that would have helped Daniel Hernandez as much as it will a 24-year-old hoping to get into Congress. * * * Anyone who delves into the origins of the Constitution's age requirements with the expectation that the Founding Fathers thought long and hard about them will be disappointed. The Constitution's requirements represent yet another instance in which the Founding Fathers traded wisdom for simple prejudice. Age restrictions were never given the lengthy considerations given to property qualifications and restrictions based on citizenship--it was enough for men like John Adams to simply assume that civic competence grew naturally with age. In 1776, Adams delivered a hand-waving defense of Massachusetts' voting age in a letter to James Sullivan, who would later become the state's governor. ""What Reason Should there be, for excluding a Man of Twenty years, Eleven Months and twenty-seven days old, from a Vote when you admit one, who is twenty one?"" he wrote. ""The Reason is, you must fix upon Some Period in Life, when the Understanding and Will of Men in general is fit to be trusted by the Public."" Translation: ""You've gotta pick some age, right?"" One can almost picture him shrugging as he wrote those words. Had there been a near universal age of majority as there is now, Adams and the rest might have chosen it as the starting point for candidacy rights. But in the absence of one, most of the colonies came up with their own arbitrary age requirements for candidacy. The drafters of the federal Constitution, after virtually no debate on the subject, would do the same at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The only exchange recorded in James Madison's notes on the convention about any of the age requirements in the Constitution--for the House, Senate, or presidency--took place on the 25th day of proceedings between Virginia delegate George Mason and Pennsylvania delegate James Wilson. It was Mason--a statesman Thomas Jefferson called the ""wisest man of his generation"" for his work drafting Virginia's highly influential 1776 Constitution and Declaration of Rights--who was responsible for the requirement that members of the House of Representatives be at least 25. His argument was simple: He had been an idiot at 21 and figured that most 21-year-olds were about the same. ""He would if interrogated be obliged to declare that his political opinions at the age of 21 were too crude and erroneous to merit an influence on public measures,"" James Madison wrote of Mason. ""It had been said that Congress had proved a good school for our young men. It might be so for any thing he knew but if it were, he chose that they should bear the expense of their own education."" James Wilson, a lawyer who would later become one of the first Supreme Court justices, was the lone dissenter. He argued, Madison writes, that age restrictions in general, ""tended to damp the efforts of genius"" and that old age restrictions made just as much sense as restrictions on youth. He also cited the competence of then British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger--the English had been willing to let a 24-year-old lead an empire. Nevertheless, Mason's view carried the day. The motion to set the House candidacy age to 25 passed 7-3. The ages proposed for the Senate (30) and the presidency (35) were later approved unanimously without discussion. Reading Mason's thoughts and the vote counts, you might assume that the convention was comprised solely of elder statesmen. In fact, 12 delegates were under the age of 35 and four of them--North Carolina's Richard Dobbs Spraight, Maryland's John Francis Mercer, New Jersey's Jonathan Dayton, and South Carolina's Charles Pinckney--were in their 20s when the convention began. All four, the finished Constitution would suggest, would have been too immature to draft and debate ordinary legislation in the new Senate. Yet all four were, incredibly, considered just seasoned enough to participate in the drafting of the Constitution itself. Since then, nearly all state constitutions have included age qualifications of their own. Some hew closely to those outlined in the federal Constitution. Many do not. Consequently, the right of a young person to run for office in the United States is determined by a nonsensical patchwork of statutes that is plainly indefensible for its arbitrariness, even if one genuinely believes that young people, by and large, can't be trusted with elected office. A 21-year-old can govern South Dakota, for example, but can't represent districts with a few thousand voters in Arizona or Colorado. North Dakota, like many states, can't accept a governor under the age of 30, while Oklahoma, for reasons that are either lost to history or nonexistent, expects its governors to be at least 31. Texas is fine with 26-year-old state senators. The state of Delaware forbids state senators under the age of 27. The picture gets even more distorted when mayors are thrown into the mix. Under current law, an 18-year-old is legally qualified to govern millions of people in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. But 18-year-olds are barred from being elected to Congress at all--it would be too risky, the Constitution presupposes, to let someone so young represent, say, Wyoming, a state with a population of about 500,000. Some might argue that the differences are justified by the notion that states and localities should be laboratories of democracy, with the ability to set many of their own rules and regulations. But it's a perversion of that notion to suggest that laboratories of democracy should be given the freedom to be so plainly antidemocratic. In this case, what is and is not democratic isn't dictated by the federal Constitution, which is also in the wrong. It is dictated by common sense--the right to run for office is something fundamental, something that shouldn't vary from place to place for taxpaying, law-abiding young citizens who are otherwise equal under the law. The current patchwork of laws suggests that there are innate differences between being 21 in South Dakota and 21 in Arizona that make one qualified to hold office in one place and not the other. Even George Mason did not believe this. * * * The one thing these barriers to public service have in common, of course, is their foundation in cliches about youth that seem less true every year. Of course, many young adults are immature and unreliable. But others are making critical advancements in medicine. They are thriving on Wall Street. They are tending to the underprivileged at home and abroad. They have always excelled in the arts. They are today some of our most impressive inventors, physicists, lawyers, media executives, social scientists, and civil servants. And they have been, for decades now, among our most transformative businesspeople--backing and producing technologies that have altered everyday life. Young people today found multibillion-dollar corporations and successful NGOs. As young staffers, researchers, and yes, interns, they do much of the analysis that our lawmakers depend on. Yet we've kept in place laws that suggest they lack the intelligence, dedication, and maturity to legislate and govern--at least until they reach a random set of arbitrarily predetermined ages. The fact that these preconceptions have been codified and stubbornly retained says something about how deeply some implicitly fear the idea of young people exercising full political rights. The drafters of these constitutions believed that voters could be trusted to make judgments about foreign policy, taxes, and nearly all of the other qualifications candidates present about themselves. But they could not, evidently, be trusted to assess the competence of young candidates on a case-by-case basis--for that would risk the chance of some ne'er-do-wells actually being elected. Young ones, anyways. The right of ne'er-do-wells older than 35 to run for president is constitutionally protected. In a few places though, very young candidates are allowed to run. And they often win. Vermont is one of a handful of states that allow adults to run for any office they choose. When Kesha Ram was elected to the Vermont legislature in 2009, she became the youngest state representative in the country at the age of 22. She and Hernandez are both members of the Young Elected Officials network, a group that helps young progressive politicians navigate the electoral landscape. Surprisingly she says, she had little trouble winning the support of voters. ""I went to knock on doors with this fear that people wouldn't take me seriously or would really question my age and I found that the opposite was true,"" she says. ""Most people I talked to were thrilled that a young person was trying to carry the torch and wanted to get involved in this way. And so I actually found by the end of the campaign that it was an incredible benefit to my race rather than a detriment."" Cutting through preconceptions about youth in the legislature has occasionally been more of a challenge. Early in her first term, Ram participated in a hearing on youth and alcohol policy. ""One of the legislators requested a whole session on brain development and how people don't really have their brains developed until they're 25 or older, and here I was 22 in the committee. And I said, in a big hearing, 'Well I'm only 22, so take my question as a legislator with a grain of salt.' "" Like Hernandez and many twentysomethings, Ram's accomplishments fly in the face of what developmental psychologists might have to say about young people in the aggregate. She was heavily involved in environmental activism as a high school student in her hometown of Los Angeles and debuted a documentary about globalization at the World Social Forum in India. She was awarded the Morris K. Udall Scholarship for her environmental work and was a finalist for the Rhodes Scholarship. As a legislator, she's sponsored legislation on homelessness, college education, housing regulations, and domestic violence--an issue she took on as the legal director of Chittenden County Vermont's Women Helping Battered Women, a nonprofit that provides services to victims of domestic abuse. Or consider John Tyler Hammons, who in 2008 was elected mayor of Muskogee, Oklahoma, at the age of 19. Hammons never thought he'd get elected. ""I probably didn't think I was going to win because who's going to vote for a 19-year-old,"" he says. But he did win--twice--and returned to the University of Oklahoma to study law after his second term. During his time in office, he pushed for reforms to the city's charter, campaign finance regulations, and increases in infrastructure spending. He left office, the Muskogee Phoenix opined, as perhaps the city's most popular mayor ever. ""I think my openness to ideas won me a lot of support in city hall very fast,"" he says. ""I think that they were honestly initially very skeptical, but at the end of my tenure, by the time I left, there were people in city hall who trusted my judgment over people several times older than me, because I'd taken the effort to learn."" People like Ram and Hammons offer good examples of the kind of public service young people can engage in if they're allowed to. The idea that either one of them might have been barred from running because of their age should concern us. * * * To be sure, there are broader reasons to back an end to age restrictions. There are legions of youth activists and earnest young people across the nation who will tell you that boosting young adult candidacy would unleash an unprecedented wave of youth activism, make races more competitive, and lead to new action on issues such as student loans and youth unemployment. And they may be right. But such hopes aren't the central justifications for change. Even if progress on youth issues continues to stall and even if young candidates are beaten out by older and more established politicians--as they certainly will be most of the time--establishing a universal right to stand for public office is worthwhile on its own merits. ""It's sort of like in 1919, when the franchise was extended to women for 1920, if people had said, 'Well all of this hinges on whether women will actually start voting in big numbers next year,' "" Seery says. ""The principle sort of trumps the practice."" Whether it yields policy changes and boosts participation or not, a constitutional amendment doing away with age of candidacy restrictions will simply extend rights to a politically underprivileged constituency just as the 15th and 19th Amendments did for women and blacks--a worthy objective in and of itself. After every election cycle we take stock of gains for women, blacks, Latinos, the LGBTQ community, and others in Congress. Over time, we hope, the body will come to look more like the United States and less like a country club--a truly representative body. Lost in these assessments is the fact that it is virtually impossible for young adults to ever achieve a share of Congress proportionate to their share of the population. Only 1 percent of the current Congress is under the age of 35 despite the fact that, again, nearly one-third of adult Americans are. Of course, it isn't a given that constituencies are necessarily better represented by politicians from their ranks--a white politician can champion policies that help black Americans, a male politician can promote policies that help women. But it should be within voters' rights to select candidates like them if they believe shared experience really does make a difference. A black voter who thinks a black politician would be better attuned to the issues affecting him can vote for a black politician. A woman can vote for a woman. But a 20-year-old cannot, by law, vote to send another 20-year-old to Congress. Because the 26th Amendment established an implicit separation between the right to cast a ballot and the right to run, he is required to vote for someone at a different station in life than himself. The most critical argument presented against age restrictions at the convention was an argument against precisely this kind of separation--one couched in the idea that the right to run and the right to vote represent halves of a cohesive whole. Wilson, Madison writes, was ""against abridging the rights of election in any shape. It was the same thing whether this were done by disqualifying the objects of choice, or the persons chusing."" He was right. To cleave apart the right to choose and the right to be chosen is to cleave apart democracy itself. Age of candidacy laws should, intuitively, clash with notions about representation and democratic fairness that we all share. But ours is a society that, for years, sent young people to die abroad without granting them a say in the matter at home. We are all too willing to subvert the rights of youth when we can get away with it.

As of Monday, 43 of the 48 people on the original watch list had been told that they are no longer at risk of contracting the virus that killed Duncan and infected Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, two nurses who cared for him at a Texas hospital. The rest of the people on the list are expected to be cleared soon. ""It's a significant hurdle for us to get over,"" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said. ""It brings a little bounce in our step, because we know the science is working."" It's not time to declare ""mission accomplished"" just yet. Texas health officials say they are still keeping tabs on roughly 120 people who may have had contact with Duncan, Pham, or Vinson. Once that surveillance runs its course, it will take an additional 42 days--twice the virus' incubation period--from the last day anyone in the country had contact with a confirmed or probable Ebola victim before the World Health Organization is ready to declare the United States disease-free, as it recently did Nigeria and Senegal. With Vinson and Pham still in the hospital, that means Ebola fears will likely continue to swirl through the end of the year. And of course, a new case could arrive on U.S. soil, resetting the clock and further testing the public health system's ability to contain a virus that is ravaging the West African countries of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. But despite the long road ahead--and the mistake-filled one behind--there's mounting evidence that America's public health system bent but did not break during its first run-ins with Ebola. The system is also now significantly better-prepared to deal with Ebola cases going forward. Among the reasons for optimism is that Duncan's girlfriend, her 13-year-old son, and two other young men who lived in the apartment where Duncan was staying when he became ill have all been cleared. That the foursome remains symptom-free is particularly noteworthy given that they were in close contact with Duncan while he was sick, and were also involuntarily quarantined in Duncan's apartment--along with soiled linens and sweat-stained sheets--for several days before being moved to another location. That none of them contracted the disease confirms what health officials have long been saying: Ebola is not easily spread through casual contact. While health officials can't say for certain exactly when Pham and Vinson contracted the virus, it appears most likely that they were exposed between when Duncan was admitted to the hospital and when he was officially diagnosed with Ebola two days later. Tuesday will mark 21 days since that test result, the point at which the hospital staff first began donning hazmat suits and taking additional protective measures. Tuesday will also mark 13 days since Duncan died. While 21 remains the magic number, the average incubation period for the virus is between eight to 10 days. So each passing day brings with it additional hope that Pham and Vinson were the only workers infected while caring for Duncan. The two infected nurses, meanwhile, are both in isolation in hospitals equipped with biocontainment units. Both were admitted with low-grade fevers but before their symptoms progressed to diarrhea and vomiting, bodily fluids associated with the spread of the disease. So while it remains mind-boggling that someone at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave Vinson the green light to board a plane to Ohio, there's little reason to fear she spread the disease across the country. Now that both are in isolation, there's good reason to believe the virus is contained, particularly given that the two hospitals where they are being treated--Atlanta's Emory University Hospital and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland--are among the best in the nation. More generally, the federal government is taking steps to ensure that the initial mistakes at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital aren't repeated elsewhere. The CDC is rewriting its safety protocols, which will likely soon require full-body suits, site managers to supervise the putting on and taking off of equipment, and a ""buddy system"" for nurses and doctors. The government has also announced plans to dispatch a rapid response team of trained experts to any hospital with a confirmed case of Ebola. So while the virus remains a serious domestic concern, it's clear that the country is significantly better-prepared to contain it today than it was when Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia last month. Of course, that will do little to allay the fears of overprotective parents or opportunistic politicians. Take a quick survey of the country and you'll find plenty of examples of hysteria masquerading as vigilance:"	Don't Panic--Here Are All the Reasons You Should Be Optimistic the U.S. Is Containing Ebola

Or at least his reincarnation. Last Friday, the National Republican Congressional Committee began running an ad that hits all the beats of the original ""Willie Horton"" spot from the 1988 presidential election, from the attack on prison reform programs to the prominent use of imagery--violent, criminal black men--with heavy racial undertones. In particular, this ad--called ""Nikko""--ties state Sen. Brad Ashford, the Democratic candidate in the Omaha congressional race, to Nikko Jenkins, a former inmate who received early release and went on to kill four people. Here's the ad: What's unusual, as Dara Lind notes for Vox, is that the ""good time"" law was pushed by Republican lawmakers and signed by a Republican governor. It's a GOP accomplishment, and a good one--a sensible tweak to our overly draconian criminal justice laws. This ad wants to hit a Democrat, but it feels like friendly fire. That this is the national GOP's approach, however, isn't a surprise. In 2005, then Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman went to the NAACP to apologize for the GOP's use of the ""Southern Strategy"" to prime anti-black views and polarize white voters on race. The implicit promise--to never again bait white voters against their black counterparts was almost immediately abandoned. In the 2006 Tennessee Senate race, the RNC ran a widely panned ad against then-Rep. Harold Ford--a black American--that ended with a young white woman saying, ""Harold, call me,"" which was read as a coded racial appeal. Since then, the GOP has been in a rehab/relapse cycle with the use of race in elections. During the 2008 election, Sen. John McCain tried admirably to restrain the worst impulses of the conservative base, going as far as chastising a supporter who suggested the Democratic nominee Barack Obama was a foreigner. Most mainstream Republicans followed suit after the election, but conservative voices like Rush Limbaugh went in the other direction, embracing the crude racial language of Willie Horton and the Southern Strategy. That continued into the 2012 presidential election, with ads and rhetoric that played on racial anxiety, from Newt Gingrich's ""Food stamp president"" to a Romney spot accusing Obama of taking ""your"" money from Medicare and giving it to unnamed others through Obamacare. If the comprehensive RNC report on diversifying the party was the GOP's rehab on using these messages--""The Republican Party must be committed to building a lasting relationship within the African American community year-round, based on mutual respect""--then ""Nikko"" is the relapse, an abrupt return to the kind of politics Republicans have condemned and promised to reject again and again. For as much as it's tried, the GOP--or at least, some of its members--can't quit the ""Willie Horton"" appeal. But it needs to, desperately. Because of their heavy support for Democratic candidates, black voters hold disproportionate sway over Democratic chances. In national elections, for instance, high black turnout is vital: It turned North Carolina blue in 2008, kept Virginia and Florida blue in 2012, and might make Georgia a ""purple"" state in 2016. Republicans will never contest blacks, at least, not in the near term. But if they can boost their numbers to 10 or 11 percent of the black vote--up from 5 or 6 percent--they will have strengthened their ground in an important way. Suddenly, Virginia is more competitive, North Carolina is more red, and Democrats have to work harder in key states like Ohio. There's a path to this outcome. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has made criminal justice reform a centerpiece of his efforts, and there's a real chance that this could reopen the relationship between some blacks and the Republican Party. With their explicit race-baiting, ads like ""Nikko"" aren't just a huge step in the wrong direction, they're an obstacle and an insult to Republicans working to build a more diverse party, and trying to reach out to skeptical black communities."

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/the_whiteness_project_whites_and_blacks_are_still_living_in_separate_worlds.html	"The interviews for the Whiteness Project--a new series from PBS and documentary filmmaker Whitney Dow--are varied, succinct, and candid. ""Because slavery happened, does that mean we owe black people something?"" asks one participant, who continues with other, similar observations. ""I think it's hard to talk about race as a white person because, maybe, black people are just looking for a reason to tell you why you're wrong, or tell you why you owe them something,"" he said. ""I just don't buy into that nonsense about discrimination,"" says a doctor. He insists: ""If you have it upstairs, and you really commit to doing what you want to do with your life, I don't think race has anything to do with anything."" These interviews are just the first part in a larger series, and already, they're valuable. It's rare that white Americans talk about race. It's even rarer that they do so on camera. And it's rarer still that they reveal ignorance, confess to prejudices, and share their fears. With that said, watching the interviews is jarring. In general, you don't expect anyone to openly say he or she is ""proud to be white"" or warn that ""a lot of white boys aren't going to be pushed around."" But although these interviews are often unpleasant, they're also useful, since they illustrate the extent to which blacks and whites really do inhabit vastly different worlds. Take social circles and relationships. According to a recent survey from the Public Religion Research Institute, 75 percent of white Americans have entirely white social networks ""without any minority presence."" Per the interviews, it's not just that people are unfamiliar with race, it's that--in all likelihood--they don't know many minorities, which leads to myths and misconceptions about their behavior and status. You see this in various survey data. Median income among black Americans is roughly half that of white Americans. But a narrow majority of whites believe blacks earn as much money as whites, and just 37 percent believe that there's a disparity between the two groups. Likewise, while 56 percent of blacks believe black Americans face significant discrimination--as evidenced by recent statistics on police shooting--only 16 percent of whites agree. The most striking result is the degree to which many whites--including many millennials--believe discrimination against whites is more prevalent than discrimination against blacks. I've written a lot about the black/white divide on a variety of issues, from the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, to differing views of government and the social safety net. Not only does this data underscore the vast gap in perception, but it suggests a solution--blacks and whites (and Latinos and Asians and others) need to share the same space if we're going to have any empathy or understanding. But life isn't an ABC after-school special, and fixing the problem of segregation isn't as easy as a plea to get along. Yes, the United States is more integrated than it's ever been, but it's still incredibly segregated with huge barriers to further progress, from exclusionary zoning and housing discrimination to concentrated poverty and hiring bias, and broader trends of resegregation in school systems and neighborhoods across the country. Sadly, at the same time we need to push harder for an integrated society, we have a mainstream political movement devoted to gutting our key tools for fighting bias, and indulging many white Americans in their misguided belief that we live in a racially equal society."	Why It Shouldn't Surprise Us That Whites and Blacks Have So Little Empathy for Each Other
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/michelle_nunn_leading_in_georgia_why_democrats_are_placing_big_best_on_this.html	"Alison Lundergan Grimes still insists she can beat Sen. Mitch McConnell and capture Kentucky for the Democratic Party. But she trails in almost every poll of the race, and has harmed her campaign with needless obfuscation and attacks on Democratic priorities. She still has donors, but with McConnell likely to win, national Democrats have turned their attention to a different red state, where a win is still possible. To that end, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has ended its ad buys in Kentucky, leaving Grimes to fend against a powerful opponent alone. Instead, the DSCC has moved its cash to Georgia, where it bought $1 million in ads--focused on the Atlanta area--for Michelle Nunn, the former nonprofit executive turned politician. As of this week, Nunn has opened a small margin over her opponent, Republican David Perdue, with a 3-point lead in the most recent poll of the race. And while polling averages still show her behind--3.8 points in the latest update of the Huffpost Pollster average--Nunn has the advantage of a powerful ground operation and rapid demographic changes. As I wrote last month, the New Georgia Project--led by state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams--has made a huge push to register blacks and Latinos, in hopes of shifting the electorate and giving Democrats a stronger chance in the statewide races. The project submitted 80,000 registrations to the Georgia secretary of state, Brian Kemp, who subsequently began a voter fraud investigation, citing unnamed allegations of ""significant illegal activities."" The most recent twist in the story came on Monday, when Third Sector Development--the parent nonprofit of the New Georgia Project--and the NAACP filed suit against Kemp. Abrams says the project is missing records from the state for more than 40,000 of its applications. ""We are concerned that given the speed with which Election Day is approaching, that if we do not resolve this quickly, and through legal means, these will be 40,000-plus disenfranchised voters in the state of Georgia,"" said Abrams on Sunday. But for as much as this is a problem, Nunn still has a solid shot at winning. As Nate Cohn explains for the New York Times, there's a fair chance that polls are underestimating the share of black voters--and overestimating the share of white voters--in the Georgia electorate. ""Combining the data on registered voters with census data on the voter-eligible population,"" he writes, ""I expect the 2014 electorate to be about 64.2 percent white and 28.8 percent black."" And yet, he continues, ""The last four nonpartisan polls that released demographic data showed an electorate that's 65.7 percent white and 25.7 percent black."" If Cohn is right and the Georgia electorate is more black and less white than it looks, then Nunn might have as much as an even chance to win the seat, which could transform the overall Senate landscape. Remember, while Republicans are favored to win the Senate, there's still a fair amount of uncertainty in the individual races. In addition to demographic questions in Georgia (and Colorado, where Latinos are a substantial portion of the electorate), there are the polling difficulties in Alaska and early voting dynamics in Iowa, where Republican Joni Ernst has a small lead but Democrats are winning ballots from Iowans who would not have otherwise voted. Which is to say that while odds for a Republican Senate are good, they're still a bit fragile. Come November, a win for Nunn could shift the Senate back to Democrats, saving their majority and giving them good legs for the next election cycle, when they can capitalize on a presidential electorate and a favorable Senate map. One last thing: Regardless of how Nunn fares, it's clear that Georgia will enter 2016 as a competitive state. And if blue Virginia was a serious wound for Republicans in 2008 and 2012, then purple Georgia will be a catastrophe for the party in 2016. A world where Republicans lose Georgia is one where--barring a major shift to the GOP--they can't win national elections. Indeed, if you want to know why Republicans have pushed voter ID in the most nationally competitive states, there's your answer."	Why the Democratic Party Is Placing Big Bets on Georgia
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/election_day_chaos_control_of_the_senate_may_hang_on_recounts_runoffs_and.html	"Election Day is coming and it's likely to stick around. The question of which party will control the Senate may very well not be decided on Nov. 4. Republicans look like they will have a good night, but there are so many close races--at least 10--and so many unpredictable factors in at least four of those races, that with recounts, independent candidates, and runoffs, the process could drag into next year. Here, in rough order of delay, are the possible outcomes and how long they could keep us all bollixed up. Hamlet Comes Home: Let's say the GOP wins five of the six seats it needs to regain control of the Senate and then one of the independent candidates in South Dakota or Kansas wins. Whether Democrats or Republicans control the upper chamber would then be determined by which party that independent decided to pick. Greg Orman of Kansas has said he would caucus with the clear majority, but in this case there wouldn't be one. Given that he ran as a Democrat and Republicans are pounding him pretty hard in his race, he'd probably stick with the Democrats. South Dakota independent Larry Pressler has said he will be ""a friend of Obama,"" which suggests he'd probably stick with the Democrats too, though he's the bigger long shot to win at the moment. Still, the leaders of both parties should probably have emergency gift baskets at the ready. The president would no doubt be called in to lobby, or perhaps Democrats would have one of their Hollywood backers make the pitch. On the Republican side, the Koch Center for Cowboy Poetry seems like a natural to round out South Dakota's tourist offerings. Senate leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell might put together a short list of choice committee assignments to offer. What are the chances any of this might happen? Orman is roughly even with Pat Roberts in the polls. South Dakota seems less likely. It's a bit of a black box as four candidates battle it out. Pressler was on the rise, but has little campaign cash and the GOP is sending the cavalry to a state where Republicans have the advantage. Recount: If the GOP wins five of the six seats it needs, there might be one race so close that the loser requests a recount. In Alaska and South Dakota, watch for debates over counting in Native American areas. Of the tight contests, Colorado has an automatic recount rule, so if the loser in that race gets less than or equal to the 0.5 percent of the highest vote cast, then the tally gets calculated again. That was the law in Minnesota in 2008, when Al Franken and Norm Coleman fought it out for months until the outcome was decided. As is now standard practice, both parties will have election lawyers at the ready to step in if one of the races is contested. If this runoff takes place to determine the sixth declared Republican victory, and Orman also wins, the recount will also likely determine which side he joins. (I am assuming, for the purposes of this fantasy, that Orman delays his party selection until the recount is complete.) Election 2015: In Georgia and Louisiana, the winning candidate must get more than 50 percent of the vote or there is a runoff. In Louisiana it would take place in December. In Georgia, that election would take place Jan. 6, three days after Congress is sworn in. What are the chances that either could go to a runoff? Pretty good. In Georgia the polls are close and neither candidate is cracking 50 percent. Things look better for Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, but she has not come close to the 50 percent threshold there.* But given the imprecision of polling, the volatility of politics, and the fact that this is Louisiana, a runoff still seems thoroughly possible. As with the recounts, if the runoff determines the sixth declared Republican victory, the voters of either Georgia or Louisiana (or both!) will likely be picking the party to which Greg Orman offers his allegiance. Armageddon: If you were a screenwriter, or had the sense of panic that seems to be prevailing in most of our discussion about Ebola in America, you might imagine a scenario in which both Orman and Pressler win, Colorado goes to a recount, and both Louisiana and Georgia end up with runoffs. That would leave control of the Senate up in the air, assuming Republicans win the minimum number of seats they're expected to win. It doesn't look like 2014 will be a wave election, but if this or any other combination of the above takes place, it will be a swampy one. *Correction, Oct. 16, 2014: This article originally misstated that Bill Cassidy is polling above 50 percent.

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/joni_ernst_and_cory_gardner_have_extreme_right_wing_views_the_press_gives.html	"For all Mitt Romney's aloofness and bumbling inauthenticity, he had one quality that served him well as a presidential candidate: He looked like a moderate. Yes, he used right-wing rhetoric in the Republican primary, and yes, he endorsed policies to the far right of the political mainstream (""self-deportation""), but in his affect and demeanor, he seemed centrist. To that end, in the final polls of the election, a plurality of voters perceived him as being a moderate candidate. Of course, President Obama won the election. But the reality of this perception of Romney is still important, since it confirms a truth of American politics: Most voters can't judge ideology from policies. They don't know how. Instead, they judge from appearance and presentation: angry-sounding politicians are ""extreme""--even if they hold mainstream views--and pleasant-sounding politicians are ""moderate,"" even if they fall far to the right or left of the median voter. Why is this important? Because it's popped up in the fight for control of Congress, and in particular, coverage of the races in Iowa and Colorado, two states that could decide who controls the Senate. Specifically, both states feature Republican candidates with substantively extremist views on a variety of subjects. In Iowa, Joni Ernst has endorsed impeachment for President Obama; gestured toward nullification of federal laws; supported ""personhood"" laws, which would classify the fetus as a legal person as well as outlaw abortion and some forms of contraception; and talked extensively about a far-right conspiracy involving an obscure United Nations document. Ernst has a partner in Cory Gardner, the Colorado Republican running a strong challenge to Sen. Mark Udall's re-election campaign. As a House member, Gardner sat on the right wing of the GOP majority. He supported the government shutdown, voted with Rep. Steve King to strip funding from the administration's deferred action program for young unauthorized immigrants, co-sponsored a bill narrowing the exception to federal abortion funding to ""forcible rape,"" and endorsed a federal personhood amendment that--like the state amendments--would radically redefine the scope of women's reproductive rights. With these out-of-the-ordinary views, you'd expect heightened scrutiny of Gardner and Ernst, above and beyond the criticism we give to more predictable mainstream candidates. Instead, we've seen the opposite. Reporters and observers have turned their attention to the not-substantive ""gaffes"" of their Democratic opponents. ""It's hard to think of a candidate who's made as many high-profile gaffes as (Bruce) Braley,"" writes Politico, citing petty complaints about the government shutdown--""There's no towel service, we're doing our own laundry down there,"" said Braley in reference to the House gym--and attacks on Republican Chuck Grassley as ""just an Iowa farmer."" Likewise, in Colorado, Udall has been criticized for the rhetorical focus of his campaign--reproductive rights--while Gardner has escaped any criticism of his substantive positions. Indeed, in the Denver Post endorsement of Gardner, the newspaper dismisses criticism of Gardner's campaign positions--""Contrary to Udall's tedious refrain, Gardner's election would pose no threat to abortion rights""--and turns its aim toward Udall's strategy: ""Udall is trying to frighten voters rather than inspire them with a hopeful vision. His obnoxious one-issue campaign is an insult to those he seeks to convince."" Gardner, by contrast, is praised as a reasonable force who could build compromise with President Obama in a GOP-controlled Senate. That this is incompatible with everything we know about his views doesn't seem to matter. Writing for Mother Jones, Kevin Drum says this is unavoidable: Most reporters don't parse the policy views of candidates and focus on optics in their coverage of the horse race. ""Generally speaking, policy views are out of bounds for political reporters, regardless of whether they've changed or whether they're transparently absurd,"" he writes. Added to this, I think, is affect. If Ernst were Michele Bachmann, she'd have a problem--in the eyes of most people, and the press, she'd look like an extremist. As it stands, and despite their hard-right views, neither Gardner nor Ernst comes across as an ideologue. Instead, like Rep. Paul Ryan--who blends a ""wonky"" persona with radical politics--they seem affable and pragmatic, even as they stand at the right-wing pole of the Republican Party. It helps too that they've run personality-centered campaigns, Ernst as an authentic Iowan par excellence, and Gardner as a ""nice guy"" with a ""smile and a backslap and the enthusiastic air of someone who treats every stranger as a friend."" To be clear, if Gardner and Ernst are leading the polls--and, all things equal, likely to win--it's largely due to demographics; with an older, whiter, and more conservative electorate, Republican candidates have much better odds of winning in a midterm election than in a presidential year. Still, Republicans should be thrilled by the success of Gardner and Ernst: As ideologues with moderate personas, they are templates for future success. After all, if--provided a smile and a firm handshake--the press will give a pass to far-right views, then for candidates, why would you choose otherwise?"
