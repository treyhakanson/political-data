Instead, I found conservatives starting to resign themselves to a Trump triumph well before it became inevitable. It was obvious then that Never Trump, for all its stalwart Twitter declarations, valiant internet petitions, and steadfast National Review epistles, was never going to happen. When the time for testing came, Republicans were always going to fall in line. Ted Cruz's speech on Tuesday night announcing the suspension of his campaign gives us some idea of how they're going to spin it. Cruz invoked parents and grandparents watching the July 4 fireworks with their children and pondering the future of the republic. ""Will we rise to meet the challenges that face our nation on the international stage, or will we withdraw and cower timidly from the world,"" he intoned. ""Will we secure freedom of thought, expression, and religion for future generations, or will we succumb to the tyranny of political correctness and the temptation of racial politics and balkanization here at home. Will we hold fast to our founding values of rewarding talent, hard work, and industry, or will we continue on that path of creeping socialism that incentivizes apathy and dependency. ... This is the responsibility with which we have been charged by history."" Trump wasn't mentioned once, but this was the speech of someone who is ready to unify his party against the Democratic threat, even if that means supporting the man who, just hours earlier, tried to link his father to JFK's assassination. It was the speech of someone who wants to make capitulation to Trump sound noble. We're going to hear a lot of others like it before the summer is through.

1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/trump_s_moronic_unpredictability_doctrine.html	"Donald Trump has a creative excuse for not answering questions about what he would do as president. He says he has solutions to all our problems, but he can't divulge his plans, because he has to remain ""unpredictable."" Last week, in a prepared speech, Trump assured voters that if they elect him, ISIS ""will be gone very, very quickly."" How? That's a secret. ""I won't tell them where,"" Trump said of ISIS, ""and I won't tell them how."" To skeptics, this is a laughable ruse. In a CNN interview that aired Sunday, Hillary Clinton mocked Trump for ""pretending [to] have some sort of secret plan"" to destroy ISIS. But Trump's unpredictability shtick isn't confined to one issue, like Richard Nixon's bogus ""secret plan"" to end the Vietnam War. It's a comprehensive pose. Trump is claiming the right--in fact, he's claiming the obligation--to conceal his plans on every issue from everyone: ISIS, China, our allies, congressional Democrats, and voters. Trump touted his unpredictability even before he announced his campaign. In a Fox News interview on May 27, 2015, he told Greta Van Susteren that he had a scheme to defeat ISIS. ""I'm not going to tell you what it is tonight,"" he teased. Van Susteren asked him why not. ""I don't want the enemy to know what I'm doing,"" said Trump. ""All I can tell you is that it is a foolproof way of winning."" A week later, on an Iowa radio show, he repeated that he had ""a way of beating ISIS so easily, so quickly."" But he declined to say more, warning that if he were to divulge the plan, we would ""lose the surprise."" Reporters called his bluff. ""You say you have a foolproof strategy to defeat ISIS,"" George Stephanopoulos told Trump in an ABC interview on June 17, ""but you're not going to tell anybody what it is."" Trump demurred: ""I hate to tell people, because if I win, I don't want ISIS to know."" Stephanopoulos persisted: ""I'm asking you right now, what is the strategy?"" Again, Trump ducked: ""The problem is, you'll see it, and so [will] everybody else, and so [will] the enemy."" When Trump said ""the enemy,"" he meant ISIS. But his pretense of a secret plan didn't seem to be hurting him. In fact, over the summer, his share of the vote in Republican primary polls soared from about 5 percent to more than 30 percent. Soon, Trump was using the same conceit to feign brilliance against Russia and China. At a rally in South Carolina on Aug. 27, he declared: ""We need unpredictability. We're so predictable. We're like bad checker players, and we're playing against Putin."" The crowd applauded. A week later, in a radio interview, Hugh Hewitt asked Trump: ""If China were to either accidentally or intentionally sink a Filipino or Japanese ship, what would commander-in-chief Donald Trump do in response?"" Trump played coy. ""I wouldn't want to tell you,"" he told Hewitt, because ""you don't want the other side to know. ... I don't want people to know my thinking."" Politicians often tiptoe around hypothetical military questions, but Trump went further. He used unpredictability as an excuse to say nothing at all. Crowds loved his Chauncey Gardiner routine. So did obsequious interviewers. ""It's a great point,"" Hewitt effused after Trump ducked the China question. ""It's a very good answer."" So Trump doubled down. On Sept. 21, he returned to Hewitt's show. This time, Hewitt asked about the 90 nuclear weapons in Pakistan. If the country ""goes unstable,"" Hewitt asked, ""Would you be prepared to send American troops ... to go and get their nukes?"" Again, Trump declined to answer. ""You want to have a little bit of guesswork for the enemy,"" Trump argued. ""So when you talk about Pakistan--and let's say they go rogue--I don't want to really be saying what my initial thought is. ... I want them to not know what my thought process is."" Them? The enemy? Who was Trump talking about? The Taliban? The Pakistani government? Either way, his pitch for unpredictability made no sense. Trump was being invited to send a message of deterrence to anyone who had eyes on Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. And he was refusing to do so. A sensible candidate might have kept his contingency plans opaque, but he would have made his position clear: that the United States wouldn't permit rogue control of Pakistan's nukes. Instead, Trump was keeping his whole ""thought process"" to himself. And Hewitt lauded him for it. ""It makes perfect sense,"" Hewitt fawned. ""It's Nixonian."" Now Trump was fully emboldened. He began to boast not just that he was evasive but that any candidate who answered foreign policy questions was stupid. In a CNN interview on Sept. 24, Trump castigated Sen. Marco Rubio for telling the public what he would do in Syria. ""Marco Rubio wants to tell every single thing he knows to everybody, so that the people on the other side, so that the enemy, can learn about it,"" Trump scoffed. ""I want to be unpredictable. ... I don't want the other side to know what my views are."" A few days later, when CNN's Don Lemon asked Trump to ""give more specifics about foreign policy,"" Trump said only ""a fool"" would do so. Up to that point, Trump had used the unpredictability dodge only in contexts where foreigners might need to be deceived. But in October, he began to make the case for deception at home. In a Fox News interview on Oct. 18, Chris Wallace asked Trump: ""Would you be willing to use the debt limit, and risk the possibility of the country going into default, to get more spending cuts?"" Trump hedged: ""I don't want to say. I want to be unpredictable, because, you know, we need unpredictability. Everything is so predictable with our country."" Wallace floated another scenario: ""Would you be willing to shut down the government in order to defund Planned Parenthood or to push some other key policy goal?"" Again, Trump begged off: ""I do not want to say that, because I want to show unpredictability."" Unpredictability to whom? In the context of Planned Parenthood or a fiscal standoff, who was the enemy? In an Oct. 25 interview on Face the Nation, Slate's John Dickerson pressed the point. He asked Trump whether a breach of the national debt ceiling would be ""an economic problem."" Trump waved the question aside. ""I don't want to say,"" he told Dickerson. ""We're so predictable, whether it's with ISIS or with Iraq or with the negotiation of a debt limit."" Trump called the debt ceiling, because of its gravity, ""an amazing tool to negotiate"" with. If Republicans promised not to hold the debt ceiling hostage, he warned, they would lose ""everything to the Democrats and to President Obama."" So the enemy was within. Originally, Trump had refused to divulge military plans on the grounds that foreigners might learn about them. Now he was refusing to clarify his positions, even on fiscal issues, because Democratic politicians had to be kept in the dark. The simplest premise of contemporary democracy--telling voters what you would do if elected--was being suspended, not in the name of national security, but for sheer partisan advantage. On Oct. 28, Trump extended this argument to personal weaponry. Responding to a debate question about the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, Trump bragged that he had a permit to carry a gun. ""I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot,"" he said. ""But I like to be unpredictable, so that people don't know exactly when I'm carrying."" The audience laughed appreciatively, and Trump went on. He juxtaposed his strategic ambiguity as an armed citizen with ""our country, where we're totally predictable, and the enemy--whether it's ISIS or anybody else--they know exactly what we're doing, because we have the wrong leadership."" The crowd applauded. Journalists didn't like Trump's evasions, but Republican voters didn't seem to care. By January, he had a 20-point lead in national primary polls. On Jan. 3, he declined to say under what circumstances he would use a nuclear weapon. ""We have to be somewhat unpredictable,"" he argued. The next day, he sidestepped a question about bombing Iranian nuclear facilities. ""I want to be unpredictable. I'm not going to tell you right now what I'm going to do,"" he told Bill O'Reilly on Fox News. ""We have to show some unpredictability. I want to be unpredictable. I don't want to tell you exactly what I'm going to do."" O'Reilly pressed the candidate: ""Don't the voters have a right to know how far you're going to go?"" Trump blew him off: ""No, they don't."" In fact, said Trump, ""The voters want to see unpredictability."" Since then, Trump has applied the argument liberally. On Jan. 25, he refused to answer Wolf Blitzer's questions about ISIS and Iraq, declaring, ""I don't want the enemies and even our allies to know exactly what I'm thinking."" On Jan. 31, he told Dickerson that the United States should behave less predictably in ""finance,"" too. On Feb. 17, he stiffed questions about what he would do in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, pleading that ""there has to be a certain amount of surprise, unpredictability"" in the president's plans. Everyone--voters, Democrats, allies, global markets--had to be kept off balance. To journalists, this was an obvious fig leaf. In three late-March interviews--a session with the Washington Post editorial board, a sit-down with Bloomberg Politics, and two phone calls with the New York Times--they exposed Trump as a fool. They asked him whether he would send troops to fight ISIS, whether he would halt spying on allies, what he would do about Chinese encroachment in the South China Sea, how he would make good on his threat to ""open up the libel laws,"" how he would identify Muslims in order to keep them out of the United States, what his criteria would be for deploying force abroad, and whether he might launch a nuclear first strike. Trump couldn't answer any of these questions. He was surprised to learn that North Korea's main trading partner was China (he thought it was Iran) and that South Korea covered half the nonpersonnel costs of the American deployment on the peninsula. Then there was this exchange with David Sanger of the Times:"	"How Trump's ""Unpredictability"" Dodge Became the Dumbest Doctrine in Politics"
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/bernie_sanders_electability_argument_is_still_a_myth.html	"Over the past year, Bernie Sanders' supporters have repeatedly criticized the undemocratic role of superdelegates in choosing the Democratic presidential nominee. In February, for example, MoveOn, which had endorsed Sanders the month before, started a petition saying, ""Democracy only works when the votes of the people--not the decision of a small number of elites--are what determines the outcome of elections."" The fear, then, was that Sanders would win the most pledged delegates but that Hillary Clinton would use her pull with insiders to trump the popular will. It is more than a little ironic, then, that Sanders is now urging those same insiders to ignore the intention of the primary electorate--which has given Clinton an edge in both pledged delegates and raw votes--and bequeath the nomination to him instead. In a Washington press conference on Sunday, Sanders, who has no discernible path to a delegate majority, outlined a plan to force a contested convention, where he apparently believes some superdelegates will flip to his side on the basis of electability. ""The evidence is extremely clear that I would be the stronger candidate to defeat Trump or any other Republican,"" he said. Sanders reiterated this on Monday at a rally in Evansville, Indiana, saying, ""We appeal to virtually all the Democrats, but we do a lot better with independents than Secretary Clinton. And I hope the Democrats at the national convention understand that while independents may not be able to vote in certain Democratic primaries, they do vote in the general election."" I have no idea if Sanders is serious about this superdelegate plan. It might just be a rationale for him to keep fighting until the end of the primaries, garnering delegates that he could leverage to push Clinton and the party leftward at the convention. But if he is serious, then what he is proposing is a presumption based on a falsehood. The presumption is that there is anything progressive about a plan that asks powerful figures to cast aside an electoral majority built on the choices of women and people of color. The falsehood is that Sanders' superior electability is, as he asserted on Sunday, ""extremely clear."" It is true, as Sanders pointed out, that polls show him doing better than Clinton against Republicans in November. But it is also true that Clinton has not hit Sanders with a single negative ad. Not one. Initially, her campaign didn't take him seriously. Later, it couldn't figure out a way to go after him where he's weakest--on the flakier parts of his far-left past--without alienating his supporters. A source close to the Clinton campaign tells me that because Sanders has high favorability numbers with Democrats, Clinton would have damaged herself by attacking him, especially since she didn't have to in order to win. The source points to the New York primary as confirmation of this view, arguing that Sanders hurt himself by going negative on his opponent. The right, meanwhile, had no incentive to rough up Sanders, a candidate who, by all accounts, Republicans would love to run against in the fall. And the mainstream media often failed to treat Sanders as a plausible contender, which would have entailed a much greater degree of scrutiny than he received. As a result, issues that, fairly or not, would be obsessively scrutinized in a general election have gone almost entirely unexamined. At this point in 2008, Barack Obama already had to account for his relationship with Jeremiah Wright, who sparked a nationwide epidemic of pearl-clutching over a 2003 sermon in which he excoriated the U.S. for its legacy of racism: ""Not God bless America, God damn America."" Hard as it is to remember now, there was a moment when some thought this would doom Obama's presidential bid, until he delivered his famous speech on race and demonstrated anew his political virtuosity. Perhaps Sanders is capable of this sort of virtuosity as well. Right now there's no way of knowing, because there's been only scattered excavation of Sanders' radical connections. He has never been asked to account for his relationship with the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party, for which he served as a presidential elector in 1980. At the time, the party's platform called for abolishing the U.S. military budget and proclaimed ""solidarity"" with revolutionary Iran. (This was in the middle of the Iranian hostage crisis.) There's been little cable news chatter about Sanders' 1985 trip to Nicaragua, where he reportedly joined a Sandinista rally with a crowd chanting, ""Here, there, everywhere/ The Yankee will die."" It would be nice if this were due to a national consensus on the criminal nature of America's support for the Contras. More likely, the media's attention has simply been elsewhere. The Clinton campaign has also ignored Sanders' youthful sex writings. Republicans are unlikely to be so decorous. Imagine an ad drawing from the old Sanders essay ""The Revolution Is Life Versus Death."" First it might quote the candidate mocking taboos on child nudity: ""Now, if children go around naked, they are liable to see each others [sic] sexual organs, and maybe even touch them. Terrible thing!"" Then it would quote him celebrating girls who defy their mothers and have sex with their boyfriends: ""The revolution comes ... when a girl pushes aside all that her mother has 'taught' her and accepts her boyfriends [sic] love."" Finally, it would remind viewers that Sanders was one of 14 congressmen to vote against the law establishing the Amber Alert system and one of 15 to vote against an amendment criminalizing computer-generated child pornography. The fact that these votes were cast for entirely principled civil libertarian reasons is, in the context of a general-election attack, beside the point. (It's also beside the point that lots of people, myself included, have no problem with either child nudity or teenage sex.) It takes no special political insight to see that Republicans will try to make Sanders seem like a sexual weirdo. Will it work? I have no idea, but there's no shorter route to the frightened lizard brain of the American electorate than dark talk about children and sex. One could go on and on in this vein. My colleague William Saletan has already written about how support for Sanders' positions tends to fall apart when people hear the details--particularly if they learn their own taxes would go up. As the nominee, Sanders would have to address his former opposition to public schools and praise for parents who believe that it is ""better for their children not to go to school at all than for them to attend a normal type of establishment."" He'd have to explain whether he still feels that sexual repression causes cancer, whether he still opposes the concept of private charity, and whether he still supports the public takeover of the television industry. One also assumes Republicans would, in keeping with Karl Rove's playbook, try to hit Sanders where he's strongest--on issues of financial integrity. They'd probably do it by going after Jane Sanders, who has been accused of trying to defraud the Catholic Church on a land deal she undertook as president of Burlington College. (After being forced out of that job, she received a $200,000 golden parachute.) If you think this can't blow up, remember that Hillary Clinton never personally profited off of Whitewater, the land deal that became a pretext for endless investigations of her and her husband. The Sanderistas appear to believe they were treated unfairly, even viciously, in this primary. In fact, they've been handled incredibly gingerly. That might end up being to Sanders' detriment: If we'd spent the past few months chewing over his glaring electoral weaknesses and he was still leading Clinton in head-to-head matchups against the GOP, he might have a case for a contested convention. It would be a cynical, anti-democratic case that contradicts the people-powered rationale of his candidacy, but it wouldn't be as nonsensical as the argument he's making now. It's understandable that Sanders, like anyone, would be carried away by the experience of hearing tens of thousands of people deliriously chanting his name. Perhaps it seems like the revolution might really be at hand, and thus any means are justified. But it's not. He's just losing. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."	This Is What a Republican Attack on Bernie Sanders Would Look Like

If the church is motivated primarily by electoral wins, he wrote, ""we end up with a public witness in which Mormon talk-show hosts""--ahem, Glenn Beck--""and serially-monogamous casino magnates ... are welcomed into our ranks, regardless of what violence they do to the gospel."" Moore was writing in 2013, but by time the book was published in August, a certain serially monogamous casino magnate was the front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination for president. With more than 15 million members, the Southern Baptist Convention is by far the country's largest Protestant denomination. Through its policy arm, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, it has been a powerful bastion of the Christian right since the 1980s, with a predictable slate of priorities: combating abortion and pornography, promoting prayer in public schools, and recently cheering the law in Mississippi that allows businesses and government employees to deny services to LGBTQ people. But under Moore, who assumed the ERLC presidency in 2013, the denomination has taken on a new assignment. Believe it or not, Southern Baptists have become the loudest chorus of anti-Trump voices within conservative evangelicalism. And as has happened in other precincts of the right, the real estate mogul's candidacy has forced evangelical leaders to confront the contradictions between their values and their political allegiances. ""My concern is not so much about the presidential election,"" Moore told me. ""I'm more concerned about the witness of evangelical Christianity, which I see compromised in the apologies from some Christian leaders for Trump and his behavior."" Moore effectively announced his new mission in September, when he published a searing op-ed in the New York Times in which he compared Trump to a ""Bronze Age warlord"" and concluded that evangelicals embracing him were promoting the idea that ""image and celebrity and money and power and social Darwinist 'winning' trump the conservation of moral principles and a just society."" In February, he wrote in the Washington Post that he had temporarily stopped calling himself an evangelical because the ugly election had turned the word meaningless:"	Can America's Largest Protestant Denomination Do Anything to Stop Donald Trump?
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/trump_hillary_cruz_and_bernie_give_bad_speeches.html	"On Wednesday, Donald Trump gave a foreign policy address billed as a first step in seeming ""presidential."" He used teleprompters and everything! Yet his language--scripted in advance, and then read from a screen--was still boring. No stirring metaphors, no clever similes. Really, no effort at all to raise up his rhetoric. That should come as no surprise. This election cycle has sorely lacked soaring oratory. ""It's something I've been talking about with people recently,"" said Peter Wehner, deputy director of speechwriting during George W. Bush's first term. ""There have been no memorable speeches. It's been a barren wasteland."" In an effort to understand why we're being deprived of high-flown language this year, I spoke to eight top-level speechwriters from both sides of the aisle--some of whom wished to speak anonymously, all of whom have worked for presidents, vice presidents, or governors. I wondered: Is the flat language simply the nature of these particular candidates and their personalities? Or does it have more to do with the tenor of our Twitter-ized times? And what, if anything, do we miss out on when our politicians don't bother to couch their ideas in elegantly crafted paragraphs? Jeff Nussbaum, a speechwriter friend of mine who has previously written for Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, theorizes that the deficit of speechy speeches is a result of the electorate's seeming thirst for authenticity. ""The political season launched with Ted Cruz making an announcement speech that looked and felt unrehearsed,"" said Nussbaum. ""And I think it was a calculation he made. If there's been a rhetorical metanarrative this season, it's that authenticity beats polish. We've thrown out the rulebook, and one of the things that's been thrown out to some extent is standing up at a lectern and delivering a traditional speech. It's been a really bad year for teleprompter operators."" Donald Trump's appeal stems in large part from his un-politician-like behavior. He's repeatedly boasted he doesn't use a teleprompter at his rallies, instead communicating with off-the-cuff, improvisatory riffs (or tweets). Trump's rah-rah spiels feature simple applause lines (""We're gonna build that wall!"" or ""We're gonna knock the hell out of ISIS!"") and call-and-response sessions (""Who's gonna pay for it?"" ""Mexico!""). His elementary vocabulary and playground taunts are apparently part of his charm. Hillary Clinton has never been much of an orator. Even when given good lines to sell, she struggles to muster a lofty, inspiring tone. She seems far more comfortable answering town hall questions that let her demonstrate how dutifully she's done her policy homework. She's also hemmed in by her brand positioning as a pragmatic technocrat. ""She's especially hindered in her ability to paint a grand, optimistic vision,"" says Paul Glastris, a former speechwriter for Bill Clinton. ""She's aware that the more lofty and grandiose she sounds, the more unrealistic she sounds."" Bernie Sanders reportedly eschews speechwriters altogether. He composes his own speeches, using blunt, stripped-down language to artlessly hammer at his themes. His supporters recite his greatest hits--""millionaires and billionaires,"" ""$27""--along with him. He effectively conveys his worldview. But his speech is not elevated. ""He's energizing thousands of people,"" says Glastris, ""so it's working for him. But you don't feel that you're listening to a statesman who's walking you through difficult territory and then persuading you that he's considered all sides."" As for John Kasich and Ted Cruz: With the possible exception of Cruz's Trump disses (""New York values"" and ""sniveling coward""), which are not about establishing Cruz's platform or vision, neither has uttered a single scripted phrase that's broken into the national consciousness. A few speechwriters I spoke to noted that Marco Rubio was the candidate most prone to using highfalutin oratory. If anything it hurt him, precisely because it made him seem so familiarly political at a time when the electorate has lusted after novelty. ""Rubio has a compelling life story to tell,"" said Wehner, ""and he can deliver a rhetorically impressive speech that moves people. But there just wasn't much audience for that in the Republican Party this year."" Rubio's penchant for the well-turned phrase brutally backfired on him during his infamous New Hampshire RubioBot meltdown, when he repeated the same carefully prepped sound bite over and over. ""Rubio really put a dagger in overly crafted and overly rehearsed speech with that glitch,"" says Nussbaum. Accidentally repeating his perfectly crafted line revealed the machinery beneath. And that became a liability--it made him sound scripted and phony. To be fair, it's possible that we've all been spoiled by Barack Obama. Speechwriters from both parties acknowledged the president's singular gift for oratory. Obama effectively launched his political career with his ""there's no red America, there's no blue America"" speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. His concession speech after losing the 2008 New Hampshire primary was so lyrical that Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am turned it into a song. At an existential moment for Obama's 2008 campaign, when the Jeremiah Wright controversy exploded, Obama opted not merely to respond to the accusations of the day but instead to offer a wide-ranging, stunningly ambitious speech on the topic of race in America. You could imagine Carly Fiorina employing a similar tactic this year after Donald Trump mocked her appearance--stepping behind a podium to speak expansively and elegantly about, say, her notion of feminism or what it means to be a woman in power--but she declined to seize that opportunity. Few politicians have the ability that Obama does to make scripted, fussy language sound natural and uplifting. And that's been true forever. ""It's pretty abnormal to have a consistently high level of rhetoric in our country,"" says Ted Widmer, a foreign policy speechwriter for Bill Clinton who edited a two-volume anthology for the Library of America titled American Speeches. ""We spend more time in the valleys than on the peaks."" So does it matter that we're deep in the valley this cycle? Do we lose anything when our candidates speak plainly? I think we do. Sure, we can wade through sound bites and tweets to get the gist of what a candidate thinks. But oratory is a vital skill for a politician who wishes to command the world's stage. A crafted speech, replete with well-turned phrases, a forceful worldview, a link to compelling biography, and an orderly presentation of a tight argument, is a unique opportunity for us to judge a candidate's capacity both to reason and persuade. Such a speech is also a gift to the listener. ""Aesthetics matter in the life of a country,"" Wehner insists. ""Art, music, and rhetoric all matter. There are words that elevate the human spirit and words that pull down the human spirit. And we often think of presidents because of a phrase, not a policy. 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' 'Ask not what your country can do for you.' 'Tear down this wall.' "" It seems unlikely that we'll add ""We are going to win so much, believe me"" to that pantheon. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Political Speechwriters Explain Why This Election's Speeches Have Been So, So Bad
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/why_donna_edwards_lost_her_senate_race_in_maryland.html	"It's tempting to read the Maryland Senate primary as a small-scale simulacrum for the race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. You have a full-throated progressive in the form of Rep. Donna Edwards facing her establishment colleague, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the very definition of an insider with a place in the Democratic Party leadership. And the results of the primary reflect that reading. Van Hollen took 53 percent of the vote to Edwards' 38 percent, a weaker margin than Clinton's 63 percent (to Sanders' 33 percent), but still a significant victory. But the comparisons between the two races end there. Where Clinton has always been near the center of Democratic politics, skating to the puck but never quite anticipating its destination, Van Hollen has been a reliable liberal vote in the House of Representatives, pushing progressive ideas as a deputy to leader Nancy Pelosi and a spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus. Edwards is a more vocal progressive--groups like Democracy for America have called her an ""Elizabeth Warren Democrat""--but the substantive gap between her and Van Hollen is small. And the symbolic angle is reversed. In the presidential race, it's the relative moderate--Clinton--who would make history as the first woman to win a major party nomination. In the Maryland Senate primary, it would have been the insurgent, Edwards, who would make history as only the second black woman to serve in the United States Senate. To scramble things further, Edwards gave support (though not an endorsement) to Clinton for the Democratic Party nomination, despite her clear ideological affinity for Sanders. Which may explain why Sanders didn't take this race as an opportunity to flex his influence and try to deliver a win for the progressive wing of the party. You can read the Democratic presidential primary as an ideological struggle, but that's the wrong frame for the Maryland Senate contest. This fight between two able public servants was more about ordinary representation--in all of its forms--than a vision for the state or the country. For Edwards, that meant touting her identity and making it a part of her campaign. ""I think it's appropriate to talk about our elective bodies, our boardrooms, our workplaces, being places where every one of us, no matter who we are or where we grew up, can find a place,"" she told MSNBC in an interview. ""If we could have gotten this right over the course of 240 years, we wouldn't be having this discussion. Clearly this strategy of just letting it go and letting elections take their course has not been one that's resulted in women gaining seats in the House or the Senate."" It's a serious perspective. Symbolic representation matters, and that's especially true for incredibly underrepresented groups such as black women. And the only way to build a presence of those groups is to work for it. It's why Edwards won early support from EMILY's List, which works to elect pro-choice Democratic women, as well as the National Organization for Women. Van Hollen ran on representation as well, but in the more quotidian sense. He touted his 25 years in Washington and deep ties to the party establishment, as well as his ability to bring benefits and services to a state that is unusually dependent on the federal government for economic progress. And he criticized Edwards for her inattention to the same sort of constituent service. One of his strongest endorsements, from Maryland Democrat Heather Mizeur (who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2014), made this point. ""Job No. 1 in politics isn't about passing the most bills, appearing on the local TV stations, carving out and advancing an ideology, or even voting the right way (though all of these things matter),"" she wrote for the Baltimore Sun. ""No, the most important job is first taking care of the people. ... By showing a sincere regard for the people he serves, Chris Van Hollen is the only one in this race ready to step into them."" Again, this makes sense. There are tangible benefits to having a long-serving lawmaker in office as senator, especially one in party leadership. This is especially true given the shape of Maryland's politics at the moment, where the Republican governor has taken an antagonistic approach to Baltimore city and other urbanized, Democratic parts of the state. Sen. Van Hollen might be a much-needed counterweight to a somewhat hostile Annapolis. Other issues played a part in this race. A super PAC working on behalf of Team Edwards made a major misstep, for example, when it tried to tie Van Hollen to the National Rifle Association in an ad, provoking a response from the White House and House Democratic leadership and giving Van Hollen an opening, which he used, running ads that conflated Edwards with the super PAC and implying a testy relationship with President Obama. On the same score, Van Hollen touted his own relationship with the president. But the crux of the election was this debate over representation: Which kind mattered most to the state's Democratic voters? The answer, it seems, fell along racial lines. Van Hollen won 72 percent of whites versus 19 percent for Edwards, while Edwards won 57 percent of blacks versus 37 percent for Van Hollen. Blacks were a greater share of the electorate, but his margins with whites gave Van Hollen a decisive advantage. Edwards, conceding defeat at a union hall in predominantly black Prince George's County, summed up the central conceit of her campaign, as well. ""Maryland is on the verge of having an all-male delegation in a so-called progressive state,"" she said. ""When will our voices be effective, legitimate, equal leaders in a big-tent party? ... This is a 21st -century question for the Democratic Party, and it is time for the Democratic Party to call the question."" Celebrating his victory with a small crowd of supporters at a hotel in predominantly white Bethesda, Van Hollen summed up the transactional nature of his candidacy. He praised retiring Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who, he said, ""understood that the job of a Maryland senator was, yes, to engage in the big battles at the national level, but she also understood [that] you never forget the people back home in our neighborhoods and communities and delivering results on the ground."" With the drama of the Republican primary on one hand and the battles between Clinton and Sanders on the other, it's easy to think that every fight within a party is about ideology. But Maryland shows that these contests are just as often about the boring parts of politics as they are about rhetoric and belief. Donna Edwards may have made a fine senator, but Maryland voters were looking for someone to help them now. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."

Take a breath and say this aloud: Donald Trump will be the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United States. Say it again: Donald Trump will be the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United States. I know. We're far past the point that this shocks anyone. It's been in the cards since his huge wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina and his massive sweep on Super Tuesday in early March. For a long time Trump's nomination has been the most likely outcome of this chaotic farce of a presidential primary. And Tuesday's results just make it impossible to deny any longer. By the time he took the stage at Trump Tower in New York City to celebrate his victories, Trump had won 61 percent of the vote in Delaware, 58 percent in Pennsylvania, 55 percent in Maryland, 58 percent in Connecticut, and 64 percent in Rhode Island. Excluding Pennsylvania's unbound delegates--which, as my colleague Jim Newell notes, he could also win--Trump now has around 950 delegates, just a few hundred short of the 1,237 he needs to win the nomination outright. What this means is that Trump is just a few states away from final victory. (You can play with the numbers using this calculator.) A win in Indiana, where he leads, next to likely wins in California, New Jersey, and West Virginia, puts Trump within 100 delegates of an unqualified triumph. If he fares well in New Mexico and Oregon--which use proportional distribution--he moves closer to the nomination. If he wins two to three of the four remaining contests--Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Washington--then he wins, period, and becomes the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Say it again. Donald Trump will be the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United States. Take it in. Meditate on it. Roll it around on your tongue. Remember the taste notes, the acrid weirdness of it. It's important never to let that sentence feel normal. Trump's success--his rapid climb to one of the summits of American politics, a major party nomination--has never happened before. We have never seen a nominee like Donald Trump. It's unprecedented. It's not just that Trump doesn't have the resume, since that's not too unusual. One of our most celebrated presidents, Abraham Lincoln, had a single House term to his name, while one of our most forgettable, William Henry Harrison, had spent six years and change in Congress. Famously (or infamously, depending on where you stand), our current president won the Democratic nomination after two terms in the Illinois state senate and a half- term in the United States Senate. It's not just that he lacks elected experience, either. We've seen those men before too. Herbert Hoover was an internationally known philanthropist and secretary of commerce but never served in elected office. The same goes for one of the most popular presidents, Dwight Eisenhower, and one of our most controversial, Ulysses S. Grant, who were career soldiers and war heroes before winning the White House. As nominees for president, both Horace Greeley and Wendell Willkie come close, in that they were businessmen with little or no experience in government at all, but they were prominent men in civic life, which is a kind of experience. It's not that he's vapid and ill-informed about the world. Warren G. Harding was president, after all. And the history of American politics is riddled with men who climbed far beyond their abilities. Nor is it that he's an outsider--so were William Jennings Bryan and Ross Perot. It's not even that he's racist or nativist or violent in his rhetoric. So were presidents Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk. So were candidates George B. McClellan and George Wallace. It's only in the last generation that American politics has filtered out the explicitly prejudiced, Trump notwithstanding. No, what makes Donald Trump something new in American political life is that he's all of these things at once: a racist, nativist demagogue with few ties to government, no experience in public office, no service in the armed forces, and little to no knowledge of anything involving governance, from policy to basic questions like, ""What is the Supreme Court, and what does it do?"" If you conjured all the ignorance and arrogance in America and gave it human form, you would have Donald Trump, give or take a spray tan. Americans have never chosen someone like him to lead one of their two major parties. And now that he's the presumptive nominee, Americans will--for the first time in their history--have a choice of whether they'll put him in the Oval Office, to lead the country for four years. They almost certainly won't. Trump is one of the most unpopular figures in recent memory, if not the most unpopular presidential candidate in modern American history. He unites the entire Democratic Party coalition against him at the same time that he divides and fractures the Republican Party. A political party that floats a parallel campaign against its own presumptive nominee is not a party united enough to wage a full effort for the presidency. Most Republicans may well vote for Trump, but ""most"" isn't enough to carry the day. This shouldn't comfort you. By definition, a presidential nominee has a decent chance of becoming president, where decent can mean anything from 1 to 100 percent. A sudden recession, a terrorist attack--these are the unknown unknowns that can hand an election to a challenger. I don't think Donald Trump will become president. But he could. And that's terrifying."	Donald Trump Will Be the Republican Nominee for President. Don't Ever Get Used to It.
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/why_bernie_sanders_should_stay_in_the_race.html	"Bernie Sanders can't win. If it's not a fact just yet, it's at least quickly hardening into one. Before the Tuesday slate of primaries, he needed hundreds of delegates to keep pace with Hillary Clinton and hundreds more to overtake her substantial lead, and he needed to accomplish the feat in environments that have vexed him from the start: large, diverse primary states. New York was one such shot, and he missed it. Tuesday's big prizes--Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Connecticut--offered another opportunity, and he missed that one, too. Clinton has lapped Sanders, and short a significant boost (or a blue shell) he will remain far, far behind. But Sanders isn't your typical losing candidate. By every other metric, he's still in the game. Sanders out-raised Clinton each month of this year. He outspent her, too, putting up ads at a 2-to-1 ratio in the New York primary. And that machine hasn't slowed down. Not only did Sanders outspend Clinton by the same ratio in almost every state that voted on Tuesday, but he'll likely beat Clinton in fundraising for April as well, surpassing her total amount after starting the race at a huge cash disadvantage. Even if Sanders is mainly capitalizing on existing trends and technologies, his swelling coffers are a remarkable and a dramatic change from the usual dynamic wherein challengers are more or less finished after Super Tuesday, and the ones who have the will to continue lack the money to do so. Sanders, by contrast, has both the cash and the will to press on. And he should. Far from packing up or giving in to any pressure to quit, Sanders should fight through the remaining primaries, and take his campaign to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. Team Sanders says that's the plan. ""We're going to go to the convention,"" said campaign manager Jeff Weaver in an interview with MSNBC's Steve Kornacki. ""It is extremely unlikely either candidate will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to reach the magic number of 2,383 needed for the nomination. So it's going to be an election determined by the superdelegates,"" he said. But this isn't a plan to take the campaign to the convention as much as it's a plan to win at the convention by wangling superdelegates--Democratic lawmakers and other officials--over to their camp. It's a bad plan. Barring a catastrophe, those lawmakers and elites will stick with Clinton. Sanders won't gain from trying to flip superdelegates to win from behind; more likely, he'll only alienate people. Team Sanders needs to give up on winning the nomination. That battle is over. But Sanders still has an unprecedented opportunity to leave a stamp on the Democratic Party. By fighting in remaining primaries and caucuses--by raising huge sums and drawing massive crowds--Sanders can show the extent to which his message resonates with millions of Democrats, including the young voters and activists poised to lead the party in the future. He shows, in other words, the extent to which the party belongs to his ideas, even if it doesn't belong to him--a fact he can underscore with new polls showing a large leftward swing among millennial voters, and a similar swing among Democrats writ large. It's also an opportunity to bring his support to down-ballot candidates. For the Sanders campaign to make lasting change as a Sanders movement, it needs to seed like-minded politicians throughout every office from the Senate to the school board. A presidential campaign of the size and scale attained by Sanders is a perfect opportunity to build a counterestablishment movement within the Democratic Party. Liberal groups like Democracy for America and the Progressive Campaign Change Committee have endorsed candidates vying for seats in upcoming states like California and New Jersey. Team Sanders can showcase them and even encourage donations to their campaigns, providing a tangible assist and building the kinds of political ties that last. And if Sanders can help elect these progressive Democrats, he has allies for when he returns to the Senate. All of this, together, will build leverage for the convention, so that Sanders can shape the Democratic Party platform and win real concessions from the Clinton campaign, on everything from the shape and design of future primaries to actual policies. But if Sanders wants to maximize that leverage, he needs to retool his message away from Hillary Clinton. As it stands, she's still in his crosshairs. ""This campaign is about taking on the entire establishment. The Democratic establishment, the financial establishment, and in Clinton's campaign, the most powerful political organization in the United States of America,"" said Sanders during a town hall interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes. Yes, Sanders plans to work against the Republican nominee for president, whoever he is. But in terms of his relationship with the Democratic Party, direct attacks on the standard-bearer--already bruised by a lengthy primary and persistent questions of trustworthiness--don't help. Indeed, for rank-and-file Democrats, they're ammunition for the eventual Republican assault. It may seem like useless theater to massage the feelings of the winning side, but it's not. There's strategy at work. Any negotiations between Team Clinton and Team Sanders will be hard work, as the former tries to protect its turf and the latter tries to press its advantage. Sanders will come to the convention with strength, but as the loser, he'll still be working from a position of weakness, not strength. Continued attacks on Clinton won't change that. Instead, they'll create enmity, and enmity is bad for negotiations. People dig in when they dislike each other. They don't want to concede. Beyond that, Sanders' leverage doesn't come from his ability to criticize Hillary Clinton--anyone can do that; it comes from his ability to raise money and build enthusiasm. To paraphrase Teddy Roosevelt, he has a big stick in the form of his primary success. Now he needs to speak a little softly. To win the most possible leverage, Sanders will have to return to his old rhetoric of ideas. And after years of official distance from the party, he will have to act like a loyal Democrat. This will be an uneasy posture for a lifelong gadfly. But the payoff--a Democratic Party bearing the Mark of the Bernie, with a full-on Sanders faction exerting pressure from the left--would be worth the price. That's how you create a lasting legacy in American politics. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 Democratic primary."	Why Bernie Sanders Should Stay in the Race, Math Be Damned
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/john_kasich_could_ve_been_the_gop_s_salvation_instead_he_helped_donald_trump.html	"Ted Cruz and John Kasich have joined together in a nonaggression pact, and I suppose it's better late than never. Had Cruz and Kasich agreed to an alliance earlier in the campaign, the race for the GOP nomination might look very different. In Missouri, to name just one example, lingering support for Marco Rubio appears to have cost Cruz a statewide victory. It was obvious months ago that a lack of coordination among anti-Trump candidates had turned what could have been victories into narrow defeats. Much of this has been Kasich's fault. The Ohio governor won his home state but has performed poorly almost everywhere else; he still has fewer delegates than Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the race a month and a half ago. But back in March, in the week following his victory in Ohio, Kasich acted like he was sweeping America off its feet. He headed to Utah to campaign, where he had no chance of winning. Rather than train his fire exclusively on Trump, he took just as many shots at Cruz. He campaigned hard in Wisconsin, where he had a fair number of friends and allies. Yet he was steamrolled by Cruz, thanks in large part to the fact that Gov. Scott Walker chose the firebrand Texas senator over his fellow Midwestern governor. That must have hurt. In the end, Kasich-mentum lasted for, at most, a couple of days and barely extended beyond Ohio's borders. So before we give Kasich any credit for sitting out the upcoming Indiana primary to clear a path for Ted Cruz, let's not forget that his campaign is running on fumes and that it's not as though he can afford to blanket Indiana's airwaves with attack ads. Even if we concede that there's no scenario in which Kasich would've agreed to drop out, he's still managed this campaign poorly. Imagine if he had spent the past month and a half scarfing down various regional delicacies in New York and Pennsylvania. These states are full of rotten boroughs, where Republican primary voters are harder to spot than leprechauns. It is here that Kasich could have, and should have, made his last stand. Kasich continues to flail wildly, with no discernible plan or strategy, other than a vague belief that a contested Republican convention would eventually turn to him and anoint him as the nominee, as Dwight Eisenhower was selected in 1952. I didn't know Eisenhower. Eisenhower wasn't a friend of mine. But John Kasich is no Eisenhower. Dwight Eisenhower led the fight against the Nazis. Kasich is a moderately popular governor of Ohio who had the good fortune of presiding over the fracking boom. The saddest thing about Kasich's baffling campaign is that if he'd played his hand differently, he'd have a decent case for being the Republican nominee in 2020. Until the rise of Trump, GOP nominating contests followed a fairly straightforward pattern, which Henry Olsen and Dante J. Scala describe in The Four Faces of the Republican Party. Before 2016, the Republican coalition had consisted of four loosely defined factions: evangelical conservatives (20 to 25 percent), secular fiscal conservatives (10 to 15 percent), moderates (30 percent), and somewhat conservatives, the last of which is the largest faction by a wide margin, representing 35 to 40 percent of the vote. Ordinarily, the Republican candidate who appeals most to somewhat conservatives--a group that's less ideological than evangelical or secular fiscal conservatives but not quite as squishy as the moderates--has emerged as the eventual nominee. This is the role that Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, and John Kasich all auditioned for. Ted Cruz, meanwhile, hoped to unite evangelicals and secular fiscal conservatives, and he had reason to believe that in a fractured field, their support would be more than enough to carry him through. The trouble with this analysis is that it doesn't account for Donald Trump. According to Olsen, Trump has given voice to a fifth faction of nationalist conservatives, who reject many aspects of conservative orthodoxy: ""They are suspicious of, if not opposed to, free-trade agreements and entitlement reform; they are not strongly pro-life; and they question the sort of foreign military intervention many strong conservatives favor."" Olsen argues that what really unites this nationalist faction is not opposition to immigration, though that certainly plays a role. (Republicans who see immigration as the most important issue facing the country are a small minority, and roughly half of Trump's voters oppose deporting unauthorized immigrants.) Rather, what unites Trump voters is a belief that government has failed to do enough ""to protect vulnerable Americans from perceived threats to their way of life."" This framework jibes well with an intriguing finding from a new CBS News survey of Indiana GOP primary voters. While Cruz fares well among the third of Republicans who want the next president to fix the nation's economy by ""doing what is most conservative,"" Trump wins among the two-thirds who'd prefer that he or she ""do whatever it takes, whether that is the most conservative policy choice or not."" Anti-Trump conservatives who are passionately ideological naturally recoil from do-whatever-it-takes-ism. In the future, however, one suspects that winning Republican candidates will find a way to bring together somewhat conservatives and nationalist conservatives. John Kasich could have been that candidate. Having governed a Rust Belt state, he's had to be attuned to the anxieties of blue-collar voters. After fighting organized labor in Ohio in his first term, he quickly pivoted to a more accommodating stance in the wake of massive statewide resistance. This chastened Kasich ideologically, and it may well have contributed to his vigorous defense of his decision to expand Ohio's Medicaid program. One could question the wisdom of Kasich's particular policy choices. I certainly do. Yet Kasich's willingness to defy conservative orthodoxy--to do whatever it takes--and his conspicuous empathy for workers suffering in a stagnant economy might have added up to a compelling campaign. Had Kasich also embraced a more hard-headed immigration policy, closer to Ted Cruz's more restrictionist stance than Jeb Bush's more open one, he might have proved a formidable candidate. His willingness to do whatever it takes could've been Kasich's salvation as a candidate. As a campaigner, it's been his undoing. His refusal to acknowledge reality--to clear the way for candidates who had a realistic chance--could doom the GOP this election cycle, and for years down the road. Kasich might have been the crank who rescued the Republican Party from peril. Instead, he'll likely be remembered as the crank who delivered Donald Trump the GOP nomination.

There was also a Super Tuesday III, maybe? Child's play, the lot of them. They were all warmups for April 26, in which a bunch of rando non-New York Northeastern states cast their ballots before the presidential campaign finally departs this unseemly domain of coastal elites until the New Jersey primary in June, ugh. Delegates The five states voting Tuesday are Pennsylvania, Maryland, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Connecticut. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders will vie for a total of 384 pledged delegates divided proportionally in each contest. The 172 total delegates up for grabs on the Republican side are, as usual, allocated through a byzantine mix of weirdo rules that vary state-by-state. Pennsylvania (71 delegates) will award 17 delegates to the statewide winner, who will be bound through the first convention ballot. The remaining 54 delegates, three per 18 congressional districts, are elected directly on the ballot with no candidate preference listed next to their names, meaning they're unbound on the first convention ballot. Maryland (38) awards 14 delegates to the statewide winner and three to the plurality winner of each of eight congressional districts. Connecticut (28) allocates its 13 statewide delegates proportionally, with a 20 percent qualifying threshold, unless a candidate wins a statewide majority, in which case he takes them all; its 15 congressional-district delegates go to the plurality winner of each of five districts. Delaware (16) is pure winner-take-all to the statewide winner. Rhode Island (19) divvies up its delegates proportionally at the statewide and district levels. Got all that? In case you can't memorize the numbers between now and 8 p.m., when the polls close, here's what to watch for in the various races. The Democrats If you see anyone on cable news television talking about how Hillary Clinton is ""taking momentum into Tuesday following her big win in New York""--and I guarantee you have heard/will hear this many times--you should punch that lousy TV right in its face. Clinton is indeed poised to do well on Northeastern Leftovers Blockbuster MegaVote Night, but it stems less from the ""momentum"" narrative than the fact that these contests take place in a favorable region of the country for her. But anyway: She's going to do well and continue finishing off the already finished-off Bernie Sanders. Clinton leads in most of the contests' polling averages, though more safely in some than others. Her safest bet is Maryland, a reliably blue state offering 95 delegates, where black voters, her strongest demographic, comprise a significant portion of the electorate--the number was 37 percent in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. Clinton has also been maintaining a healthy lead in Pennsylvania (189), a state that Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver nearly called a must-win last week before backing off and merely describing it as ""very, very important."" Other races are tighter. The most recent Connecticut poll, from Public Policy Polling, showed Clinton's lead in Connecticut (55) trimmed down to 2 percentage points. Rhode Island (24) is something of a mystery, while Clinton has a slight edge in the only recent survey of Delaware. Barring a Michigan-esque surprise in Pennsylvania for Sanders, the night ends with him losing delegates on net. Even if Sanders could pull off wins in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware, those gains would probably be wiped out entirely--or even surpassed--just by Clinton's pickups in Maryland. It's hard to sugarcoat it for Sanders and his supporters: He needed to win New York and he got blown out, and now he needs to blow out Clinton in Pennsylvania, an outcome that's not in the cards. Sanders will stay in the race for the remainder of the primary calendar. But barring some inexplicable mass conversion of superdelegates, Sanders' shot at the nomination is over. Below the presidential level, there will be two Democratic Senate primaries of note Tuesday between so-called ""establishment"" hopefuls and pesky challengers. Maryland's Senate race between Reps. Donna Edwards and Chris Van Hollen was absolutely neck-and-neck for months, but appears to have drifted in the past couple weeks toward Van Hollen, a leading House Democrat and the overwhelming preference of the party. In Pennsylvania, former Rep. Joe Sestak, who defeated the incumbent (and briefly Democratic) Sen. Arlen Specter in the 2010 primary only to lose the general to now-Sen. Pat Toomey, is running again, much to the annoyance of many Democratic leaders. His opponent, Katie McGinty, a former Clinton administration environmental official, has been endorsed by many leading Pennsylvania Democrats--as well as by President Obama. Sestak had been leading in polls, but the most recent ones either show them tied or give McGinty the slight edge. The Republicans Finally, some action! Sort of. Donald Trump will probably win every state, probably by double digits. But since this is the Republican side and every last delegate matters, let's run through some subplots to keep an eye on."	What's at Stake in Tuesday's Republican and Democratic Primaries
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/is_liberalism_smug.html	"Is liberalism ""smug""? In an essay for Vox, Emmett Rensin says yes. ""There is a smug style in American liberalism,"" he writes. ""It has been growing these past decades. It is a way of conducting politics, predicated on the belief that American life is not divided by moral difference or policy divergence ... but by the failure of half the country to know what's good for them."" This ""smug style"" is informed by programs like The Daily Show With Jon Stewart and its offshoots, The Colbert Report and Last Week Tonight With John Oliver. It manifests on Twitter and Facebook, in tweets and status updates and displays of liberal arrogance. It's present in how liberals talked about figures like Kim Davis, how they relate to people who disagree with them, in public and private. Where does it come from? Rensin ties it to a demographic shift. Where once the Democrats were a working-class party, they're now dominated by the professional and academic classes. ""A movement once fleshed out in union halls and little magazines shifted into universities and major press, from the center of the country to its cities and elite enclaves,"" writes Rensin. And he suggests that the smug style is one reason the working class, and the white one in particular, has kept its distance from the Democratic Party: ""Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt. The rubes noticed and replied in kind."" It's a comprehensive case. It's a full-throated case. And it's informed by a tradition of intra-left criticism of liberal elites, much of it fair and often needed. But it's wrong. Or at least, it has three fatal flaws that make it far from persuasive. The first is just history. That liberal smugness might deter the white working class from the Democratic Party seems reasonable, if unfalsifiable. But to suggest that it is a prime mover in their alienation from the party is to ignore the actual dynamics at work. The driving reason working-class whites abandoned the Democratic Party is race. The New Deal coalition Rensin describes was devoured by its own contradictions, chiefly, the racism needed to secure white allegiance even as the party tried to appeal to blacks. Pressed by those blacks, Democrats tried to make good on their commitments, and when they did, whites bolted. The Democratic Party's alliance with nonwhites is what drove those whites away, not the sniffing of comedians on cable television. And, looking at the politics of the last seven years, it's still keeping them away. (It's worth noting that, up until left-leaning whites and minorities elected Barack Obama president, Democrats suffered little loss with working-class whites outside of the South.) That said, there's no question that smug liberals exist. It's incontestable. (I've complained about them myself.) But Rensin doesn't argue for the mere existence of liberals who are smug about their beliefs and ideology. He argues that smugness is key to contemporary liberalism. That it's all but a plank of today's Democratic Party. But his evidence is lacking. ""The smug style in American liberalism"" is defined entirely through media and social media. It is The Daily Show, it is liberal Twitter, it is Gawker. (Rensin devotes a portion of the essay to excoriating an essay by writer Hamilton Nolan.) But these are small portions--fractions--of the Democratic Party. And they're far from representative of American liberals. Take The Daily Show. Under Jon Stewart, the show hit its ratings peak in 2012 during the presidential election. Its viewership in the last quarter of the year? Roughly 1.7 million viewers per episode. By the time Stewart left, The Daily Show pulled daily numbers of 1.15 to 3 million viewers. As Harry Enten notes for FiveThirtyEight, even if you include online viewers, you have a modest total of 1.5 million viewers daily. By contrast, Jimmy Fallon's The Tonight Show was seen by an average of 3.7 million people in the last quarter of 2014. Who are The Daily Show's viewers? According to a 2012 study, 40 percent held college degrees, compared with 25 percent of all news consumers. Similarly, 40 percent made more than $75,000 a year, compared with 26 percent of all news consumers. Maybe this represents an important liberal constituency--an integral part of the Democratic Party. Or maybe it's a minor and unrepresentative group of affluent people, likely clustered in a few major cities like New York City and Los Angeles. You can say the same for liberal users on Twitter (just a small minority of people use Twitter to talk about politics) and Gawker readers and perhaps even people who write for websites like Vox and Slate. Rensin seems to know this. He even tries to address it. ""The Daily Show, as it happens, is not the private entertainment of elites blowing off some steam. It is broadcast on national television,"" he writes. ""Twitter isn't private. Not that anybody with the sickest burn to accompany the smartest chart would want it to be."" This isn't persuasive. The Daily Show might punch above its weight but it's still at base a late-night comedy and talk show. It influences ""the conversation"" but doesn't constitute it. And while The Daily Show and its peers are indeed smug, Rensin has mistaken this segment of national political dialogue for something that actually drives political activity. To posit that a show made by (and largely for) affluent, college-educated liberals somehow drives liberalism as a whole betrays an achingly parochial view of national politics. That is the second fatal flaw. The final one is related. Affluent, college-educated liberals are just part of the Democratic Party. A substantial plurality of the party comprises nonwhites, spread throughout the country, and integral to its national and regional political victories (those liberals can't win without them). Even if you limit this to the nonwhites who voted for Barack Obama in 2012, it dwarfs the number of people who could possibly participate in the smug liberal culture Rensin describes. Many of them--middle-aged and working-class--likely aren't even aware it exists. Rensin tries to deal with this fact. At the beginning of the essay, he acknowledges minority voters as part of the Democratic coalition but asserts that ""bereft of the material and social capital required to dominate elite decision making, they were largely excluded from an agenda driven by the New Democratic core: the educated, the coastal, and the professional."" Later, he writes, ""The Democratic coalition in the 21st century is bifurcated: It has the postgraduates, but it has the disenfranchised urban poor as well, a group better defined by race and immigration status than by class."" This is supposed to be a rejoinder--""Elite liberalism, and the Democratic Party by extension cannot hate poor people, they say!"" he writes--but it's not. Rensin doesn't seem aware, for instance, of the partnerships between black and white Democrats in the South that delivered a measure of investment in public goods through the 1970s, '80s, and early '90s--until racial resentment helped kill the white Southern Democrat as a political figure. He seems blind to the ways in which Hispanics of all classes became a powerful force in California, shaping the state's politics in profound ways. Somehow, he's missed the extent to which nonwhite voters in the Obama era have become premier coalition members, moving Obama on everything from criminal justice reform to immigration. It is too much to say that nonwhite Democrats fully shape the party's agenda. But a quick survey of recent history shows, clearly, that they're prime partners in power. Missing from his description of the supposedly ""bifurcated"" Democratic coalition are the millions of blacks, Latinos, and Asian Americans--the large majority of each group, in fact--that aren't the ""disenfranchised urban poor."" Somehow, Latino military families in Hampton Roads, Virginia, black suburbanites in Atlanta, and Asian American entrepreneurs in Seattle have vanished, subsumed instead in a single, teeming, and undifferentiated mass. All of this gets to the central irony of the essay: Rensin wants to condemn ""elite liberalism"" and the Democratic Party as an institution. But he misses the huge degree to which his vantage point on American liberalism isn't the vantage point. Depending on where and who you are, liberalism looks different, both as politics and culture. This is blinkered. And the result is an essay that doesn't criticize ""liberalism"" so much as it positions Rensin against other members of his cultural cohort. It's what you might write if you've mistaken the consumption habits and shibboleths of your tribe for a politics that drives one of two major political parties in a democracy of over 300 million people, if you're convinced of your own centrality to the currents in American history.

His son compares the process to ""Communist China."" Bernie Sanders says unelected Democratic superdelegates are propping up Hillary Clinton. Sanders and Trump are running as populists, challenging a corrupt nomination system in the name of democracy. It's true that the system is full of quirks. Why do some states award their delegates proportionally, others by congressional district, and others by winner-take-all? Why do some conduct open primaries, while others restrict participation to caucusgoers? Why does a Republican delegate elected by Trump supporters get to vote for Ted Cruz at the convention? You can quarrel with any of these rules. But let's not pretend that everyone deserves a say in choosing the nominees. Parties are entitled to privilege their members and choose candidates who best represent their ideas. Trump and Sanders don't necessarily fit the bill. Last weekend, Trump's top aides went on the Sunday shows to complain about the Republican process. ""What this election has shown is that when voters participate, Donald Trump wins,"" said Trump's convention manager, Paul Manafort. That's misleading. What the election has shown is that in a multicandidate field, Trump usually gets a plurality. So far, the only place in which he has won a majority is his home state, New York. As the race has narrowed, Trump's advantage has shrunk. That's why he got spanked in Wisconsin. And that raises a hard question: Does Trump truly represent Republican voters? Or is his lead in the delegate race a residual artifact of a multicandidate field? Even now, John Kasich's persistence as a third candidate is propping up Trump. Look at two national polls taken this month. A Fox News poll shows that if Kasich were to drop out, 55 percent of his voters would go to Cruz. Only 24 percent would go to Trump. A CBS News poll indicates that if Kasich were to quit, Trump's lead over Cruz would shrink from 13 points to 10 points, leaving Trump still short of a majority. So when Trump complains about multistage delegate-selection procedures that leave him with fewer delegates than he should have won based on primaries held two months ago, bear this in mind: He's complaining about a result that might have happened anyway if voters had been allowed to register their second choices and reallocate their votes accordingly. A snapshot isn't necessarily better than a deliberate process. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, has another objection. On Fox News Sunday, he complained:"	The Nomination Process Isn't Democratic? It's Not Supposed to Be Democratic.

We're still waiting for the final margin, but any win puts Clinton much closer to locking up a the nomination if only because it takes a huge chunk of available delegates off the table for Sanders as the race enters the final stretch. Clinton is inching her way to a final pledged-delegate lead, and in her victory speech Tuesday night, she began the work of reaching out to Sanders supporters. But there's still no indication that Sanders supporters are ready to rally around her. In terms of delegate math it doesn't especially matter whether Clinton wins by 1 percentage point or 10 or 20. It wouldn't have changed the hard calculation if Sanders posted a narrow win, either. The only result that would have changed the course of the race was a decisive win by Sanders that cut hard into Clinton's pledged-delegate margin, which at the beginning of the night stood at 206 by FiveThirtyEight's count and 244 by the Associated Press's more cautious tabulation, which hasn't fully factored in Washington's results yet. Ever since Clinton's blowout sweep on March 15--since before that, really--Sanders' only strategy for taking the pledged-delegate lead was to win the slate of favorable primaries and caucuses over the next month and hope to parlay that into a strong shift away from Clinton before the remaining delegate-rich contests in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California. He was successful in the first leg, handily taking contests in Idaho, Utah, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington and Wisconsin. Now we know the energy he gained there was insufficient, at least in this first go-round, to propel him to a win on less favorable ground. Sanders is moving in the wrong direction and will be even further off the mark by this time next Tuesday as time passes, delegates are allocated, and the margin by which he needs to win each remaining state increases. But the Democratic race is in an interesting phase right now. (Not nearly as interesting as the Republican race, but few things in this life are.) Right at the moment that Sanders is struggling to make a necessary dig into Clinton's pledged-delegate lead, his national numbers are looking better than ever. For the first time he is in a statistical tie with Clinton in national polling. And Clinton's net favorability rating among Democrats, as Gallup reported last week, is at its lowest point in the cycle at +36 (66 percent favorable, 30 percent unfavorable). That +36 figure is a better number than any Republican candidate's net rating in his own party. But it's still only ""about half of what it was at its peak last fall,"" and below Sanders' +52 rating, Gallup's editor-in-chief Frank Newport writes. ""The big picture for Sanders is one of image improvement over time as he has become better known. This directly contrasts the big-picture trend for Clinton of a decline in her image over time, particularly in recent weeks."" It is possible that when Clinton does clinch a majority of pledged delegates, she will be trailing Sanders in national polling. This is not the way it's supposed to end up. Though Clinton was closer to then-Sen. Barack Obama in pledged delegates down the stretch in 2008 than Sanders has ever been to her, Obama seized and mostly kept the national polling lead from the beginning of February onward. Once all Democrats finished voting in 2008, Obama had the most delegates, and polls reflected that the national party was satisfied with him as the choice. In 2016, Clinton could finish with the most delegates but lack a majority of the Democratic public's favor in a two-person race. These national polls among Democrats could swing back Clinton's way after she accumulates a few Northeastern wins. And even if they don't, obviously, a national polling lead in the end wouldn't give Sanders any claim to being the ""real"" choice of the voters, since actual vote totals would suggest the opposite. The problem for the Democratic Party is that Sanders might think it does and use it as a justification to extend his campaign to the convention in an effort to sway superdelegates to his cause. This would only serve to increase the disappointment that Sanders supporters feel when he officially loses and lessen the available timeframe for unifying the party ahead of November.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/indiana_is_a_trump_state_that_looks_like_a_cruz_state.html	"The last time the Indiana Republican primary mattered was 40 years ago, in 1976, when Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan battled for the presidential nomination of a Republican Party convulsing over its ideological future. Indiana mattered then for much the same reason it matters now, only the valences have reversed. Ford, the sitting president, was the standard-bearer for a moderate Republicanism that was waning against a vigorous and ascendant brand of conservatism. Ronald Reagan, a one-time actor and two-time governor of California, was the champion of that conservatism, channeling right-wing anger over Ford and other moderates into a fierce challenge for the GOP nomination. This was a new, open fight for control of the party, and conservatives had the zeal and organizational muscle to excel, winning low-turnout primaries and open caucuses in a fight where every delegate mattered, including the ones in Indiana. Reagan won the Hoosier State by just a few thousand votes, on the strength of religious conservatives, the bedrock voters of this new right. Assisted by this nascent conservative movement and propelled by his bellicose message of national strength, Reagan fought Ford to a near-draw, losing by a scant 117 delegates at the convention in Kansas City, Missouri. As historian Geoffrey Kabaservice writes in Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, ""Reagan's campaign illustrated both the gathering strength of the conservative movement within the Republican Party and its ability to stir the blood of voters with emotional appeals moderates conspicuously lacked."" Now, in 2016, it's conservatives who are on the ropes, battered by a foe of their own making in the form of Donald Trump. And once again, Indiana matters. Although this time, it's not just an important state; it's a decisive one. If Ted Cruz can win--as one of two remaining candidates with traditional credentials--he can deny Trump the delegates he needs to win outright, throwing the nomination fight into an open convention, where he hopes to prevail as the only figure left with any democratic legitimacy. If Trump wins, well, then he wins full stop, marching to the nomination under the rules. What makes Indiana especially interesting is that it's potentially fertile territory for both candidates. The first is that it looks a lot like a Cruz state. Texas aside, Cruz strongholds share a profile. In places where he wins--Iowa, Alaska, Kansas, Maine, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah--white, churchgoing evangelicals are a prominent part of state politics. Indiana fits that mold. Thirty-one percent of Indiana adults identify as ""evangelical"" in a state that's 86 percent white. (To compare, 28 percent of Iowa adults identify as evangelical in a state that's 91 percent white.) Indiana evangelicals lifted Republican Mike Pence to the governorship in 2012 and backed some of the most controversial measures of his administration, including strict anti-abortion laws and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which sparked a national firestorm over religious liberty and discrimination. Assuming these evangelicals are regular churchgoers, they stand as a potent anti-Trump voting block. This should make the state easy to predict, right? Not so much, since Indiana looks like a Trump state, too. What do his strongholds have in common? They tend to be larger (Indiana is the 16th-largest state by population); they tend to be denser (it's also the 16th-most dense state); and they tend to be segregated, with predominantly black cities (often old industrial cores) surrounded by predominantly white suburbs and exurbs. In other words, Trump does best where racial tensions are highest. It's why the Mid-Atlantic and the South were fertile ground for his campaign; white voters in these regions score highest on implicit-bias tests. Where do white voters in Indiana fall? A touch past the median for implicit bias, higher than average, but not especially high (like whites in New Jersey) or particularly low, like those in New Mexico. This makes sense. Indiana contains three of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the United States, including Gary, which tops the list for most segregated. Where you find segregation, you find anti-black attitudes, and where you find anti-black attitudes, you find Trump voters. Between evangelicalism and racism, we're left with a state that either Trump or Cruz could win, although available polls give Trump the clear advantage. Either way, it's a state that's reflective of the narrative of this Republican race. Which is to say that the present fight is a kind of inversion from the one in 1976. Then, evangelical Christians were part of a rising conservative vanguard that promised to wrest the party away from moderates. Today, they're trying to beat back a candidate who represents a waxing faction of nativists and ethno-nationalists, who aren't as interested in ideological conservatism--some are even ""moderate,"" in a way--as much as they want to take the country back to a past where white Americans were truly dominant. Donald Trump is their Ronald Reagan, and at this stage, he is on his way to victory. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	Indiana: A Trump State That Looks Like a Cruz State
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/why_we_know_so_little_about_indiana_s_primary.html	"For such a decisive contest, the Indiana Republican presidential primary was fairly late in sneaking onto the political intelligentsia's radar. It was presumed to be Trump-friendly in March following his wins in neighboring Illinois and, well, just about everywhere else. Then, in early April, Cruz buried Trump in nearby Wisconsin, prompting prognosticators to revisit their assumptions about its fellow Midwestern state. Only now, due to a few very recent polls, have prognosticators swung back and considered Tuesday's primary the event during which Trump could effectively seal the nomination. It was this inability to determine which way Indiana would go that made the state so important, since its results couldn't be baked into any hard evidence-based delegate forecasts well in advance. So Indiana's status as a true turning point in this grinding slog of a primary can be attributed, in no small part, to one factor: It's a really expensive state to poll, and few outlets bothered to do so until recently. A grand total of zero (0) polls of likely Indiana Republican primary voters were released prior to April 22, a mere 11 days before the climactic contest. Compare that with the polling frequency of other recently important states. Pennsylvania, which voted April 26, was polled dozens of times with some regularity going back to March 2015. Pollsters surveyed New York Republicans 20 times between mid-March and the April 19 primary. California Republicans, who don't vote until June 7, have already been polled eight times since the beginning of March. Indiana's polling paucity traces back to a 1988 state law that, with certain exceptions, banned auto-dialed calls, or ""robocalls."" Though largely targeted at unwanted sales calls, it's also banned similarly annoying political campaign calls--along with the interactive caller surveys that many low-cost pollsters this cycle use to gather their results. The penalty for violations, according to a release the Indiana attorney general's office sent out in March as a warning to politicos about to descend on the state, is ""up to $5,000 per call."" For polling purposes, this means that all surveys of the state must be ""live-caller,"" i.e. real human beings calling other human beings in order to collect their opinions. Those get pricey. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute--a prolific pollster this campaign season that hasn't bothered with Indiana--estimates that automated surveys are roughly ""as much as 10 times cheaper"" to commission than live-caller ones. Public Policy Polling's director, Tom Jensen, backs up this estimate. ""You're talking the difference between a poll costing $2,500 to $3,000 and $25,000 to $30,000,"" he says. ""A lot of the public polling that gets released over the course of primary season is polling companies doing it out of their own pocket as a public service, but you just can't do that when you're talking that kind of expense,"" Jensen, whose firm also hasn't surveyed Indiana, adds. ""So at that point it falls to media organizations being willing to make that kind of expenditure, and obviously in this day and age most outlets don't have that kind of money to commission a poll."" Indiana isn't the only state that regulates robocalls, but it is one of the strictest. ""Indiana's the only [state] that I know of that has that total prohibition"" on such calls, Murray says. Jensen says that, ""the only other state with laws as restrictive as Indiana's is North Dakota,"" which doesn't hold a Republican primary. The law is consistently under assault from political groups, but so far to no avail. It was less than one month ago that Patriotic Veterans Inc., a political action committee, lost another round in its years-in-the-works court battle arguing that the auto-dialer law violates its First Amendment rights. Banning irritating commercial and/or political robocalls would seem to be a no-brainer for any legislative body. Who enjoys having dinner interrupted by some nosy robot asking personal questions? It seems, at first, that most states would have such prohibitive laws. But lawmaking is never quite as simple as distilling the will of the voters into corresponding legislation. Market-research firms lobby heavily against such laws. And politicians might hesitate to ban automated calls because that takes a major tool out of their arsenal. Lobbies can usually bat away these laws ""because of politicians who use these for their own campaigns,"" Murray says. Private-sector lobbyists plus lawmakers looking out for their personal campaign interests make, as ever, a strong coalition. So why Indiana? It's hard to trace to any particular incident; occasionally a legislative push to protect people's privacy squeaks through. Paul Helmke, a former three-term Republican mayor of Fort Wayne who now teaches at Indiana University's School of Environmental and Public Affairs, remembers the prominence of the debate in the 1980s. ""I remember people running ads when they were running for office, and this was one of their campaign planks,"" he says. ""You know, showing the couple at dinner getting call after call after call--a 'vote for me and I'll get rid of this' kind of thing."" He adds that incumbents justified supporting it by believing that they could muster the resources to do ""traditional polling,"" so ""who cares if the challenger can't do it?"" Which brings us to 2016, when the Indiana Republican presidential primary suddenly matters, but few had a clue until recently how the contest was shaping up. A few major news outlets with the resources at their disposal (Fox News, CBS, NBC, and the Wall Street Journal) scrounged up the change to commission surveys, as have a few other, less reliable outfits (Gravis, American Research Group, some Republican operation called Clout Research). There's no doubt now that Trump, who holds a 9.3-percentage-point advantage in RealClearPolitics' polling average, is the front-runner heading into Tuesday's contest. It may be that he's earned a jolt of momentum following his six consecutive blowout Northeastern wins, but momentum has mattered much less than geography this cycle. Indiana may have always been Trump country, and its primary outcome far less than the mystery it's been treated as. But discovering that was never going to be cheap.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/carly_fiorina_ted_cruz_s_unfathomable_choice_for_vice_president.html	"Sen. Ted Cruz is denying that his selection of Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential pick was a ""desperate"" maneuver to stop Donald Trump in Indiana. They don't call him Lyin' Ted for no reason. This was objectively a desperate move. It looks more and more desperate as the hours pass. By this hour, it's beginning to smell like an all-timer in the annals of political desperation. This could go down as the one thing for which Cruz's candidacy is remembered. ""Pulling a Cruz"" will be shorthand for political desperation, which is the only way to interpret the hilarious act of a candidate trailing by 400 delegates naming a vice presidential candidate in order to somehow pick up a few percentage points in friggin' Indiana. How does the selection of Fiorina theoretically help Cruz pick up a few percentage points in friggin' Indiana, by the way? Most of the delegate analysis of the pick has focused on her ability to help Cruz in some Northern California congressional districts in June. That's a stretch. There's little evidence that voters, in California or otherwise, care at all about Carly Fiorina. But even if she could help Cruz pick up a few delegates in Silicon Valley, none of that will matter if their ticket loses Indiana. Here's one of the many ways to describe what makes this move reek of desperation: Cruz is using one of the best weapons in a presidential candidate's arsenal, one of the most effective ways of seizing the public's attention and defining his candidacy, to win a couple of news cycles in April. You can argue that he needed to try something this desperate since his campaign is in a commensurately desperate position. It's not clear that the pick will even achieve these simple goals, though, as the Fiorina news was quickly crowded out by coverage of Trump's Indiana rally with Bobby Knight and former Speaker John Boehner's unflattering comments toward the Texas senator. Cruz was lucky to have an establishment figure like Boehner criticize him so colorfully and keep him in the news, because his veep stunt was about a 12-hour story. We can understand the why now?, however sad and unsuccessful that may be. But what about the who? Perhaps Fiorina is the only person in the world who can tolerate Cruz enough to serve on his ticket. Simpler yet: Condi gave him the hard no. There is one way in which Fiorina makes perfect sense as a means of quickly and acutely shifting the political terrain before Indiana votes. It essentially involves using Fiorina as bait for Trump. If the Cruz campaign is lucky, the Fiorina selection will provoke Trump into saying or doing something egregiously sexist before May 3. For Trump, the only thing standing between him and the nomination may be his ability to avoid that simple trap. Will he be able to do it? Wisconsin was not a great fit for Donald Trump, but he didn't help himself by going on a crusade against Heidi Cruz. It dominated the news for several days heading into the primary. Insane sexism might not have lost Trump any of the supporters he already had, but it did make it difficult for him to grow at all beyond that. He won the 35 percent of the vote that he always had in the bag and nothing more. In the three recent polls of Indiana, the only polling we have in that state, Trump sits at 40 percent. Cruz's goal is to keep Trump stuck there and hope that his campaign can leapfrog his rival's now that John Kasich's out of the picture and eating meals all over the Willamette Valley. Trump already has a history of making crudely sexist remarks about Fiorina during her own candidacy. ""Look at that face!"" he infamously said to a Rolling Stone reporter last fall when she appeared on television. ""Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?"" Fiorina enjoys going after Trump, and she will try her hardest to get Trump to break through whatever paper-thin filter Paul Manafort has worked tirelessly to install. Will it work? So far Trump has shown surprising restraint in responding to the announcement. ""I think it's really a waste of time, honestly,"" he told Fox News on Wednesday night about the Cruz campaign's rollout. Even Trump sees this move as too desperate to require the usual string of insults--for now. His mind could change. The bars are always set so low for Trump to prove his ""presidential"" qualities. Can he make it through next Tuesday without calling Carly Fiorina ugly? is this week's painfully, embarrassingly low bar. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	Why Carly?

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/the_democratic_primary_ruined_my_friendship.html	"A couple months ago, one of my husband's former colleagues from a progressive digital strategy firm popped up on his Facebook page to castigate him for supporting Hillary Clinton. ""Matt, do you remember the exact date when you gave up?"" the man wrote. ""Was it when Obama turned out to be a damn conservative? Or were you never 100% behind this progressive thing to begin with? Tired of losing, so pick a candidate who, if she loses, it won't really matter that much? I think it's the last one. Sellout."" That was the moment I realized that the Democratic primary, while incredibly high-minded compared with the Republican one, is creating lasting interpersonal enmity. On Saturday, Peter Wehner wrote in the New York Times about conservative friendships fraying in the age of Trump, describing people for whom ""differences over the Trump candidacy have caused such a loss of respect that they feared their friendships would not survive, and that even if they did, they would never be the same."" I wish I could feel schadenfreude, but the same thing is happening among some committed progressives. Even now, with the primary season limping toward its foregone conclusion, collegial disagreement has given way to hostile incredulity, as people wonder how those who they thought saw the world in the same way could be so utterly, bafflingly wrong. A necessary disclaimer--evidence for this is entirely anecdotal. The people who came to hate each other over the Democratic primary are a small, unrepresentative group of political obsessives. Most people never talk about politics online; in a 2012 Pew Research Center study, 84 percent of social media users said they'd ""posted little or nothing related to politics in their recent status updates, comments, and links."" Like those Wehner writes about, people who've spoken to me about damaged relationships either work in liberal politics or are serious activists. They are part of a fairly minuscule subculture. Among this little group, however, it's easy to find people whose ties are being tested. ""It has been an eye-opening and heartbreaking election cycle that has revealed some ugly truths about 'progressive bros' in my circle that will take some time for me to digest,"" says Maryna Hrushetska, a 47-year-old curator and art adviser in Los Angeles who supports Clinton.* In the past, Hrushetska tells me, she's worked on behalf of Palestinian rights and the environment, and she's been shocked to see men she knows through those movements repeating sexist anti-Clinton slurs. ""The conflict is very unpleasant, but it's also clarifying,"" she says. ""I believe there was a misogyny that existed below the surface among progressive men, thinking that because they're environmentalists and drive Priuses and support the Palestinians, they are unassailable."" On the other side is Khaldoun Khelil, a 39-year-old of Palestinian-Algerian descent who is appalled to see some of his female friends overlooking Clinton's awful rhetoric on Palestine.* ""I'm a passionate supporter of women's rights and other progressive ideals, but when I ask for the same support from them to stand behind me and Palestinians--suddenly I'm a Bernie Bro,"" he says. Khelil feels personally wounded by the silence of his Clinton-supporting friends in the face of their candidate's lopsided pro-Israel rhetoric. ""It just turned my stomach,"" he told me. ""I think the bad feelings will persist. It showed me that I'm kind of a lower peer."" Talking to people on both sides of the divide, I heard similar sentiments over and over. People thought their friendships were built on a shared worldview. They thought their friends respected their experiences, their judgments, and their identities. But the primary has revealed opposing priorities and, fundamentally, different apprehensions of reality. ""I feel like I'm living in the Twilight Zone,"" says Katie Halper, a writer, radio host, and outspoken Sanders supporter. To her, Clinton's flaws are manifold and glaring, and watching fellow feminists deny them is driving her mad. ""This is the first time I've ever felt gaslit in my life,"" she adds. The term gaslighting refers to a manipulative denial of reality; it derives from the 1944 thriller Gaslight, about a man trying to make his wife believe she's going insane. In talking about the primary, several people used it to describe frustration with friends who refuse to acknowledge obvious truths. ""Here's the thing about the gaslighting,"" Hrushetska says of the anti-Clinton men she knows. ""You're trying to explain to them: 'Her experience mirrors my experience of being a woman that's trying to achieve something. Can you please listen to me?' And they're saying, 'No, no, no, that does not exist, you're using that as an excuse.' "" As with so many modern relational ills, much of the problem lies with the internet. It's not just that people tend to be more obnoxious online than they are in person. The primary is revealing rifts among people who are used to assuming that their friends agree with them. Ordinarily, social media users who talk about politics congregate in polarized communities. Particularly on Facebook, they expect to revel in a shared sensibility, not to argue. ""We find that our participants who perceive more friends as holding viewpoints different to their own engage less on Facebook than those with more similarity in their network,"" says a 2014 Georgia Institute of Technology study about politics and online relationships. (The italics are in the original.) This primary--the first Democratic one since social media has become ubiquitous--has shattered the illusion of bien pensant unity. ""The first time I posted something critical of Sanders, the starting assumption was that I was somehow for greed or corruption or endless war,"" says Mark Hershberger, 40, who once considered himself a leftist but now identifies as ""pragmatic left-of-center."" ""It's hard to forget that someone implied that you're a horrible person for not supporting their preferred candidate."" Online political differences are particularly likely to poison relationships that aren't all that deep to begin with. Before social media, we might not have known much about the opinions of friendly acquaintances. Now we're confronted with them every day. ""These experiences sometimes made our participants change their opinion about the friends,"" the Georgia Institute of Technology study said about political conflict among the loosely connected. ""Other times, it resulted in questioning the relationship and ultimately disassociating from the friend."" Some of the current animosity among progressives could dissipate when the primary finally ends. That's what happened in 2008, when tensions were at least as high as they are now. The ideological divide between Sanders and Clinton, however, is much wider than that between Clinton and Barack Obama. The 2008 primary was a battle over representation, raw because it pit the first female candidate with a legitimate shot at the presidency against the first black one. There was not, however, much of a gap between what Clinton and Obama hoped to accomplish in office. This year is different. It's a split between liberalism and the left, between those who seek greater representation within the existing system and those who would replace it entirely. Liberals can't understand why those to their left refuse to recognize that incremental progress is better than none, particularly given the intolerable danger of the modern GOP. Leftists are increasingly convinced that liberals, ever eager to compromise, aspire to nothing beyond a more diverse ruling class and are thus obstacles to revolution. ""When I look back at the failures of the last 40 years, I don't see it as the fault of Republicans, because they're doing their job to advance their agenda,"" says Angie Aker, a 37-year-old web writer and progressive activist in Kenosha, Wisconsin. ""They've done a great job of it largely because the Democratic Party has let them."" When I first spoke to Aker last week, she was unapologetic about alienating some of her friends with her ceaseless attacks on Clinton. ""Relationships have cooled or fizzled because of my unwillingness to temper what I say about turning a blind eye to Hillary's war hawkishness,"" she said. On Tuesday night, I emailed her to see if she saw any prospect of interpersonal tensions easing as the primary winds down. ""I'm not going to refuse to do business with Hillary supporters or start fights with them at our friends' bridal showers, but neither will I ever forget that when they had a chance to vote for and support a truly progressive future for people worse off than them, they decided a neoliberal feminist-in-name-only getting her turn was more important,"" she replied. ""It will color the way I see them from here on out, as I'm sure the force with which I've spoken against their views will color how they see me.""

It doesn't, for instance, quite compare with Mezhyhirya, the gilded estate of deposed Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych. Trump may have 33 bathrooms and three bomb shelters, but his mansion lacks a herd of ostrich, a galleon parked in a pond, and a set of golden golf clubs. Yet the two properties are linked, not just in ostentatious spirit, but by the presence of one man. Trump and Yanukovych have shared the same political brain, an operative named Paul Manafort. Ukrainians use the term ""political technologist"" as a favored synonym for electoral consultant. Trump turned to Manafort for what seemed at first a technical task: Manafort knows how to bullwhip and wheedle delegates at a contested convention. He's done it before, assisting Gerald Ford in stifling Ronald Reagan's insurgency at the GOP's summer classic of 1976. In the conventions that followed, the Republican Party often handed Manafort control of the program and instructed him to stage-manage the show. He produced the morning-in-America convention of 1984 and the Bob Dole nostalgia-thon of 1996. Given Manafort's experience and skill set, it never made sense that he would be limited to such a narrow albeit crucial task as delegate accumulation. Indeed, it didn't take long before he attempted to seize control of the Trump operation--managing the budget, buying advertising, steering Trump toward a teleprompter and away from flaming his opponents, appearing on air as a primary surrogate. Some saw the hiring of Manafort as desperate, as Trump reaching for a relic from the distant past in the belated hope of compensating for a haphazard campaign infrastructure. In fact, securing Manafort was a coup. He is among the most significant political operatives of the past 40 years, and one of the most effective. He has revolutionized lobbying several times over, though he self-consciously refrains from broadcasting his influence. Unlike his old business partners, Roger Stone and Lee Atwater, you would never describe Manafort as flamboyant. He stays in luxury hotels, but orders room service and churns out memos. When he does venture from his suite for dinner with a group, he'll sit at the end of the table and say next to nothing, giving the impression that he reserves his expensive opinions for private conversations with his clients. ""Manafort is a person who doesn't necessarily show himself. There's nothing egotistical about him,"" says the economist Anders Aslund, who advised the Ukrainian government. The late Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory described him as having a ""smooth, noncommittal manner, "" though she also noted his ""aggrieved brown eyes."" Despite his decades of amassing influence in Washington and other global capitals, he's never been the subject of a full magazine profile. He distributes quotes to the press at the time and place of his choosing, which prior to his arrival on the Trump campaign, was almost never. (Indeed, he did not respond to requests to comment for this story.) His work necessarily entails secrecy. Although his client list has included chunks of the Fortune 500, he has also built a booming business working with dictators. As Roger Stone has boasted about their now-disbanded firm: ""Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly, lined up most of the dictators of the world we could find. ... Dictators are in the eye of the beholder."" Manafort had a special gift for changing how dictators are beheld by American eyes. He would recast them as noble heroes--venerated by Washington think tanks, deluged with money from Congress. Playing tennis with Yanukovych at Mezhyhirya might have been the culmination of Manafort's long career. He spent nearly seven years commuting to Kiev. Over that stretch, he remade Ukrainian politics and helped shift the country into Vladimir Putin's sphere of influence. It was an impressive achievement, at least according to the ethical calculus that governs Manafort's world. But then along came Donald Trump--another oligarch in desperate need of his services. * * * The genesis of Donald Trump's relationship with Paul Manafort begins with Roy Cohn. That Roy Cohn: Joe McCarthy's heavy-lidded henchman, lawyer to the Genovese family. During the '70s, Trump and his father hired Cohn as their lawyer to defend the family against a housing discrimination suit. (Cohn accused the Feds of using ""Gestapo-like tactics."") But Cohn and Trump became genuine pals, lunching at the Four Seasons and clubbing together at Studio 54. It was Roy Cohn who introduced Stone and Manafort to Trump. During those disco years, Stone and Manafort were tethered together. They were both kids from Connecticut, attending colleges in Washington, though they couldn't have been more different. Stone loved attention and garnered it with theatrical flair. He was a bad boy, soi-disant. As a student at George Washington University, Stone moonlighted for the Nixon campaign and gravitated to Jeb Magruder, deputy director of the Committee to Re-Elect the President. Dirty tricks came naturally to Stone. He assumed a pseudonym and made contributions on behalf of the Young Socialist Alliance to one of Nixon's potential challengers. He hired spies to infiltrate the McGovern campaign. Stone wasn't shy about his handiwork. In fact, he wasn't shy about anything. He loved to sit for interviews and vamp. Stone is a bodybuilding fanatic who posed shirtless in the New Yorker. The photo captured his implanted hair, but not the tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back. Manafort had a very different mentor. He studied under the future secretary of state, James A. Baker III, who wielded his knife with the discipline of a Marine and the polish of a Princetonian. It was a good fit for Manafort, who shared his mentor's pragmatic conservatism and his thirst for politics. (His father spent six years as the mayor of New Britain, Connecticut, a Republican who flourished in Democratic terrain.) Baker, an avid collector of young talent, had managed Gerald Ford's re-election campaign. That's where he spotted Manafort and anointed him aide de camp. When Baker needed his own manager for his 1978 campaign to become attorney general of Texas, he tapped Manafort. The experience of whispering in Baker's ear left a lasting impression. ""Paul modeled himself after Baker,"" one of his friends told me. Despite his Yankee stock, Manafort ran Reagan's Southern operation, the racially tinged appeal that infamously began in Philadelphia, Mississippi, the hamlet where civil rights activists were murdered in 1964. The success of the 1980 campaign gave Stone and Manafort cachet. More important, they helped run Reagan's transition to power. They stocked the administration, distributing jobs across the agencies and accumulating owed favors that would provide the basis for their new lobbying business. They opened their doors in 1981. Manafort and Stone pioneered a new style of firm, what K Street would come to call a double-breasted operation. One wing of the shop managed campaigns, electing a generation of Republicans, from Phil Gramm to Arlen Spector. The other wing lobbied the officials they helped to victory on behalf of its corporate clients. Over the course of their early years, they amassed a raft of blue-chip benefactors, including Salomon Brothers and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Another early client was Donald J. Trump. What Trump wanted was help fending off potential rivals to his Atlantic City casino business. He especially feared the rise of Indian gaming. As the 2016 campaign has graphically illustrated, Trump doesn't treat rivals gently. Testifying before a congressional committee in 1993, he began with his rote protestations of friendship. ""Nobody likes Indians as much as Donald Trump."" He then proceeded to worry that the tribes would prove unable to fend off gangsters. ""There is no way Indians are going to protect themselves from the mob ... It will be the biggest scandal ever, the biggest since Al Capone ... An Indian chief is going to tell Joey Killer to please get off his reservation? It's unbelievable to me."" Trump poured money into a shell group called the New York Institute for Law and Society. The group existed solely to publish ads smearing his potential Indian competition. Under dark photos of needles and other junkie paraphernalia, the group asserted, ""The St. Regis Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented."" (It wasn't.) ""Are these the new neighbors we want?"" We know that Trump and Stone were behind the New York Institute because Gov. George Pataki investigated its doings. He slapped Trump and Stone with a $250,000 fine and required them to publicly apologize for running the ads. Manafort didn't own the Trump account at the firm. But one of his former partners told me that he would dispense advice and pitch in, winning Trump's trust. When Manafort took an apartment in Trump Towers in 2006, he would kibitz with his old client when they'd run into one another on the elevator. ""Trump knew this guy was top drawer,"" says one Republican operative. * * * Manafort and Stone built a glamour firm. The Black in its name belonged to Charles Black, who as a 25-year-old launched the Senate career of Jesse Helms. Later, they lured Lee Atwater, the evil genius who would devise the Willie Horton gambit for George H.W. Bush. The firm had swagger. In the early '80s, the partners spoke openly to the Washington Post of their annual $450,000 salaries. According to the consultant Ed Rollins, Black would later boast that the firm had schemed to gain cartel-like control of the 1988 Republican presidential primary. They managed all of the major campaigns. Atwater took Bush; Black ran Dole; Stone handled Jack Kemp. A congressional staffer joked to a reporter from Time, ""Why have primaries for the nomination? Why not have the candidates go over to Black, Manafort and Stone and argue it out?"" Manafort actively avoided the spotlight, though he had a knack for garnering unwanted attention. He took on clients and causes that even most of his colleagues on K Street considered outside the usual bounds. Black, Manafort, and Stone hired alumni of the Department of Housing and Urban Development then used those connections to win $43 million in ""moderate rehabilitation funds"" for a renovation project in Upper Deerfield, New Jersey. Local officials had no interest in the grants, as they considered the shamble of cinder blocks long past the point of repair. The money flowed from HUD regardless, and developers paid Manafort's firm a $326,000 fee for its handiwork. He later bought a 20 percent share in the project. Two years later, rents doubled without any sign of improvement. Conditions remained, in Mary McGrory's words, ""strictly Third World."" It was such an outrageous scam that congressmen flocked to make a spectacle of it. Manafort calmly took his flaying. ""You might call it influence-peddling. I call it lobbying,"" he explained in one hearing. ""That's a definitional debate."" Strangely, the HUD scandal proved a marketing boon for the firm. An aide to Mobutu Sese Seko told the journalist Art Levine, ""That only shows how important they are!"" Indeed, Manafort enticed the African dictator to hire the firm. Many of the world's dictators eventually became his clients. ""Name a dictator and Black, Manafort will name the account,"" Levine wrote. (Levine's piece, published in Spy, featured a sidebar ranking the ethical behavior of Washington lobbyists: It found Black, Manafort the worst of the bunch.) The client list included Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos (with a $900,000 yearly contract) and the despots of the Dominican Republic, Nigeria, Kenya, Equatorial Guinea, and Somalia. When the Center for Public Integrity detailed the firm's work, it titled the report ""The Torturers' Lobby."" Indeed, the firm was an all-purpose image-buffing operation. As the Washington Post has reported, Manafort could book his clients on 60 Minutes or Nightline--and coach them to make their best pitch. He lobbied Congress for foreign aid that flowed to his clients' coffers. He might even provide a few choice pieces of advice about tamping down domestic critics. Manafort understood the mindset of the dictator wasn't so different from his corporate clients. According to one proposal unearthed by congressional investigators, the firm boasted of ""personal relationships"" with administration officials and promised ""to upgrade backchannels"" to the U.S. government.

This wasn't empty rhetoric. On a Friday in 1985, Christopher Lehman left his job at the National Security Council. The following Monday, he was flying with Manafort, his new boss, to the bush of Angola to pitch the Chinese-trained guerilla Jonas Savimbi, who wanted covert assistance from the U.S. to bolster his rebellion against Angola's Marxist government. Savimbi briefly left a battle against Cuban assault forces and signed a $600,000 contract. The money bought Savimbi a revised reputation. Despite his client's Maoist background, Manafort reinvented him as a freedom fighter. He knew all the tricks for manipulating right-wing opinion. Savimbi was sent to a seminar at the American Enterprise Institute, hosted by the anticommunist stalwart Jeanne Kirkpatrick, a reception thrown by the Heritage Foundation, and another confab at Freedom House. (Kirkpatrick introduced Savimbi, who conscripted soldiers, burned enemies, and indiscriminately laid land mines, as a ""linguist, philosopher, poet, politician, warrior ... one of the few authentic heroes of our time."") Manafort's campaign worked wonders. His lobbying helped convince Congress to send Savimbi hundreds of millions in covert aid. Indeed, every time Angola stood on the precipice of peace talks, Manafort, Black worked to generate a fresh round of arms--shipments that many experts believe extended the conflict. Sen. Bill Bradley was blunt in assigning blame. ""When Gorbachev pulled the plug on Soviet aid to the Angolan government, we had absolutely no reason to persist in aiding Savimbi. But by then he had hired an effective Washington lobbying firm, which successfully obtained further funding."" Or as Art Levine concluded, ""So the war lasted another two more years and claimed a few thousand more lives! So what? What counts to a Washington lobbyist is the ability to deliver a tangible victory and spruce up his client's image."" * * * Who pays Paul Manafort? The question can be devilishly difficult to answer. He doesn't always file the forms demanded by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. And he may not even need to disclose who cuts his checks. The law is porous, and over time revisions in the act have created various ways for lobbyists to hide their deeds. Like Henry Kissinger, Manafort can claim that he merely ""consults"" with foreign governments, relieving him of the legal burden of announcing his benefactors. Money arrives to Manafort circuitously, sometimes through the dodgiest of routes. We know this because he admitted one instance to investigators. If there's one place on the planet inhospitable to American political consultants, it is France. So when Manafort wrote a campaign strategy for Eduoard Balladur's presidential campaign in 1995, his role was kept from the public. Payments traveled beneath the table. In fact, the French investigation revealed, the money came from a good friend and old client of Manafort's, a Lebanese arms dealer called Abdul Rahman al-Assir. (Manafort took Assir to George H.W Bush's inauguration in 1989; Assir once loaned Manafort $250,000, as the Washington Post reported this week). Manafort's fee was a small piece of a larger kickback scheme. At least $200,000 came to Manafort, some of it via accounts in Madrid. It was part of a deal brokered by Assir. He arranged for France to sell Pakistan three Agosta submarines--with tens of millions of euros in ""commissions"" returning to the coffers of the Balladur campaign. The scandal, known in France as the ""Karachi Affair,"" has hovered over the country's politics ever since it broke in 2010. (The English ex-wife of another Franco-Lebanese arms dealer involved in l'affair revealed the Manafort payments to a French judge.) It wasn't the only time that Manafort received money from the Pakistanis. Michael Isikoff has reported that Manafort was paid $700,000 by the Kashmiri American Council--ostensibly a grassroots organization advocating against Indian control of the contested borderland. Funding for the group, however, came from Pakistani intelligence. The assistant U.S. attorney who investigated the Kashmiri American Council has called it a ""false flag operation."" Manafort flew his own false flags in the name of his stealth client. In 1993, he traveled to Kashmir to obtain footage for a video his firm was producing on behalf of the Pakistanis. The work entailed interviewing Indian officials, who would have never granted access if Manafort announced his true purpose. To get in the door, he lied about his identity, telling the Indians that he worked for CNN. Manafort has denied that he ever misrepresented himself, but he so offended the Indian government that a spokesman for its foreign ministry issued a public rebuke: ""The whole thing was obviously a blatant operation of producing television software with a deliberate and particularly anti-Indian slant by lobbyists hired by Pakistan for this very purpose."" * * * Among the Republican establishment, there's hope that Manafort will prove the turnaround artist who fixes the mess of the Trump campaign, giving it a professionalism that nobody could have expected. Indeed, he has a track record of successfully making over candidates, though his greatest success came in an entirely different political ecosystem. In 2005, the Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Ahmetov summoned Manafort to Kiev. Ahmetov hailed from Donetsk, the Russian-oriented heavy-industry east of the country. Ahmetov had cause for panic. The best political hope for his region, and, more to the point, his own business interests, was a gruff politician called Victor Yanukovych. As a teen, Yanukovych spent three years in prison for robbery and assault. After his release, he was again arrested for assault. None of this past history--these ""youthful mistakes,"" which he once instructed the KGB to expunge from his record--slowed his rise through the political ranks. In 2002, he served a brief stint as prime minister in a sclerotic pro-Russian government, mired in corruption scandals. When Ahmetov summoned Manafort, in 2005, his candidate had suffered a crushing defeat. Yanukovych had just run for president of Ukraine, a campaign that involved rampant fraud and the possible poisoning of his opponent with dioxin. His bid ended in massive protests against him and his crude attempts to overturn the will of the people. The protests, the Orange Revolution, were a burst of optimism that Ukraine might transcend its past and take its seat as a European-style democracy. They should have destroyed Yanukovych's career. Yanukovych seemed a hopeless case. ""A kleptocratic goon, a pig who wouldn't take lipstick"" is how one American consultant who worked in Ukraine described him. Yet Manafort saw hope, as well as a handsome paycheck. Despite Yanukovych's Soviet style, Manafort considered him political clay that could be molded. ""He saw raw talent where others didn't and he shaped it brilliantly,"" one former State Department official told me. Manafort set about giving Yanukovych a new look: well-tailored suits, shirts and ties that matched, a haircut that tamed his raging bouffant. Manafort taught the pol a few simple lessons that helped sand down his edges. He showed him how to wave to a crowd, rather than keep his arms locked to his sides. He instructed him to refrain from speaking off the cuff. He taught him how to display a modicum of empathy when listening to the stories of voters. ""I feel your pain,"" Yanukovych would now exclaim at his rallies. One Ukrainian columnist cheekily asked his readers to identify the 10 elements of Yanukovych rallies that Manafort had imported from the Republican conventions he'd run. The buffed image was born from opinion surveys, conducted by a team of pollsters Manafort brought to Kiev. He found that the hope of the Orange Revolution had curdled into frustration with the government's incompetence. So Manafort crafted a new image of Yanukovych--businesslike, not likable but persistent--that stood as a pragmatic antidote to the hapless Orange Revolutionaries. People believed that when Yanukovych was prime minister, ""there had been an order to things,"" Brian Mefford, a Ukraine-based consultant told me. ""That's the sentiment they tried to run on."" At the same time, Manafort understood how to accentuate divisions in the Ukrainian electorate. He had overseen Reagan's Southern strategy; he understood the power of cultural polarization. His polling showed that Yanukovych could consolidate his base by stoking submerged grievances. Even though there was little evidence of the mistreatment of Russian language speakers by the Ukrainian state, he encouraged his candidate to make an issue of imagined abuses to rally their base. To the same end, he instructed Yanukovych to rage against NATO, which he did by condemning joint operations the alliance was conducting in Crimea. When American Ambassador William Taylor arrived in Kiev in 2006, he summoned Manafort to a meeting in his office. Manafort would become a fixture in the offices of American ambassadors to Ukraine, the U.S. government's primary conduit to Yanukovych and the pro-Russian camp. As Taylor told a group of American democracy activists just after the meeting, he had asked Manafort to tamp down Yanukovych's criticisms of the joint operations NATO was conducting with the Ukrainians. The implications of his ask were clear: The interests of American security were hurt by such rhetoric. ""American to American, I'm asking you to talk to him."" Manafort scoffed at the notion. He bluntly announced that he wouldn't ask Yanukovych to dial back the rhetoric. It polled too well. To be fair, Manafort was hardly the only American in Yanukovych's orbit. Bernie Sanders' consultant Tad Devine went to work for him in 2009. Ukrainians spent heavily in Washington, hiring a small army of top-drawer Republican lobbyists, including former congressmen Vin Weber and Billy Tauzin, to bolster Yanukovych's image in Washington and ultimately stave off American support for Ukrainian democracy. But Manafort set up the largest shop in Kiev, housed in a well-guarded office just off Independence Square. During elections, his operation swelled to six American consultants, in addition to Ukrainian translators and drivers. He procured a special role in the Yanukovych camp. Anders Aslund told me, ""Manafort became Yanukovych's closest political advisor."" * * * In 2005, John McCain received a call from a staffer on the National Security Council. There was a problem, the staffer told the senator. The man orchestrating McCain's presidential campaign was Paul Manafort's partner, a lobbyist named Rick Davis. The administration wanted the senator's help dialing back the duo's work in Ukraine, two top McCain aides told me. By promoting enemies of the Orange Revolution, they were undermining American policy. The call came after Manafort and Davis had already drawn McCain into their eastern escapades. It wasn't just Ukraine. That year, the pair had consulted on behalf of pro-independence forces in the tiny principality of Montenegro, which wanted to exit Serbia and become its own sovereign republic. On the surface, this sounded noble enough, so noble that McCain called Montenegro's independence the ""greatest European democracy project since the end of the Cold War."" A report in the Nation, however, showed that the Montenegrin campaign wasn't remotely what McCain described. The independence initiative was championed by a fantastically wealthy Russian mogul called Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska had parochial reasons for promoting independence. He had just purchased Montenegro's aluminum industry and intended to buy broader swaths of its economy. But he was also doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin, on whose good graces the fate of all Russian business ultimately hangs. The Nation quoted Deripaska boasting that ""the Kremlin wanted an area of influence in the Mediterranean."" Manafort and Davis didn't just snooker McCain into trumpeting their client's cause; they endangered him politically, by arranging a series of meetings with Deripaska, who the U.S. had barred from entering the country because of his ties to organized crime. In 2006, they steered McCain to attend a dinner with the oligarch at a chalet near Davos, where Deripaska speechified for the 40 or so guests. (The Washington Post reported that the oligarch sent Davis and Manafort a thank-you note for arranging to see the senator in ""such an intimate setting."") Seven months later, Manafort and Davis took McCain to celebrate his 70th birthday with Deripaska on a yacht moored in the Adriatic. Not everyone within the McCain camp felt comfortable with this relationship. One group of aides pushed hard for McCain to fire Rick Davis for sullying the senator with the firm's muck. McCain intended to do just that. The senator had backed the cause of Ukrainian democracy and he couldn't stomach his top aide's firm working to undermine it. What's more, aides had come to McCain with the rumor that Deripaska had purchased an apartment in Trump Tower for Davis and Manafort. But in the moment, McCain lost his nerve, as his aides have recounted the episode. Davis supplied a tear-filled soliloquy that saved his job. ""Rick's plea somehow worked--and that was the root of the divisions that tore apart the campaign,"" one of McCain's top advisers told me. It was just unsubstantiated hearsay that Deripaska had paid for Manafort's flat. Yet McCain aides were right to suspect the relationship. Manafort and Davis were hungry for the oligarch's cash. As the Washington Post reported, they even convinced Deripaska to invest in a $200 million private equity fund they created. For their efforts, Deripaska paid Davis, Manafort, and another one of their partners a $7.5 million management fee. But apparently they didn't do very much managing, or investing either. When Deripaska asked for an audit of the fund in 2008, Manafort and Davis never delivered one. In fact, according to a complaint that Deripaska filed in court, Davis and Manafort ""provided no additional updates."" Deripaska was desperate to get his money back--which, the Post noted, coincided with Manafort's strange disappearance from public view. At the time, Roger Stone wrote friends a cryptic email titled, ""Where's Paul Manafort?"" He supplied a multiple-choice set of answers including ""Was seen chauffeuring Yanukovych around Moscow"" and ""Was seen loading gold bullion on an Army Transport plane from a remote airstrip outside Kiev and taking off seconds before a mob arrived at the site."" Deripaska wasn't the only dubious oligarch to invest with Manafort. He orchestrated a major deal with a Ukrainian called Dmitry Firtash. A fireman and soldier, Firtash found ways to flourish in the post-Soviet economy as a middleman, selling natural gas--by his own admission, he did so thanks to his connections with Seymon Mogilevich, the Russian Mafia's ""boss of bosses."" But his crucial connection was to Vladimir Putin. Firtash's grand scheme was detailed in a thorough investigation published by Reuters. Gazprom, the Russian state-owned natural gas conglomerate, would sell to Firtash at a deep discount. Firtash, in turn, resold the gas to the Ukrainian government, investing the profit in funding for pro-Putin politicians, including Victor Yanukovych. Reuters was blunt in describing the pernicious effect of Firtash's dealings:"	If You Don't Think Paul Manafort Can Get Trump Elected, You Don't Know Paul Manafort
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/donald_trump_s_major_foreign_policy_address_was_a_pseudo_event_staged_to.html	"""The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security,"" Donald Trump said Wednesday in Washington, D.C., roughly a quarter of the way into what his campaign had billed as a ""major foreign policy address."" He continued, ""A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded."" That's where the line was supposed to end according to Trump's prepared remarks. But he couldn't help himself. ""And funded beautifully,"" he added. This speech was almost assuredly one of those things that the new, ""grown-up"" Trump is doing at the behest of his freshly hired advisers, led by Republican lobbyist and operative Paul Manafort. The goal is not necessarily for Trump to become more ""presidential"" so much as it is to trick idiots in the media into swallowing the narrative that he is becoming more presidential. One of the most tiresome and successful rituals for tricking media suckers into believing a presidential candidate is legit is the spectacle of the Major Foreign Policy Address in which a candidate Lays Out His Foreign Policy Vision. This speech, usually delivered near the beginning of a presidential campaign but, in Trump's case, delivered after he's convinced primary voters to select him without demonstrating any knowledge whatsoever, does not have to be coherent. All it needs to do is toss a little Pentagon lingo and a few out-of-context numbers into a broth of wild threats and unearned projections of strength. The setting for such an address is critical, too, and Trump's team went with what you might call the Full Washington: a ballroom at the ornate Mayflower Hotel downtown stocked with white-haired old men in suits who've spent their careers musing pensively about whom to bomb next. It made for an interesting moment when, near the end of his speech, Trump went on a riff against the established foreign policy expert community for its ""continued losses at war."" ""We have to look to new people,"" he said, off script now, ""because many of the old people, frankly, don't know what they're doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television."" The address also brought out old Washington journalistic hands who might not be used to the Trump campaign's strong-arming of reporters at events. Shortly before the speech began, for example, Washington Post legend Bob Woodward was instructed to move inside the designated press pen. Everything about the setting was perfect, down to the smell of cigarette smoke (even though no one was smoking). Smoke in a D.C. room connotes seriousness; perhaps it was pumped in artificially. This was Manafort making his candidate eat his broccoli. Trump read his prepared remarks briskly and woodenly, cheering up only during his ad-libbed flourishes. He checked off certain statistics about, say, the number of ships the Navy maintains. He said secondly and thirdly at various points in the speech, as a serious policy speaker does, even if it was unclear whether there had been a first plank or if he had even introduced a numbered list. He delivered the standard lines about how neither President Obama nor Hillary Clinton will say radical Islam, how our allies no longer trust us to have their backs, how he will do whatever it takes to destroy ISIS. He bravely refused, however, to tell ISIS specifically how he intends to eliminate the terrorist group, because he believes it's imperative to be ""unpredictable"" in foreign policy. (""We tell everything!"" he ranted, off-script. ""We're sending troops, we tell them. We're sending something else, we have a news conference."") Mostly clean sentences, a few statistics, vague threats, and an oversimplification of how easy it is to conduct foreign policy: That's most of what's important in Laying Out a Foreign Policy Worldview. Perhaps most important, though, is a lack of substance beyond the superficialities listed above. Here, Trump succeeded, too. To put it simply: Trump tried to blend his own twists on foreign policy--making allied nations pay up for American protection, for example--with typical orthodox Republican foreign policy thinking. This led to a speech rife with fundamental, glaring contradictions. He lacerated the Clinton administration for working to bring China into the World Trade Organization only to declare later that ""a strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China."" Every section about how the United States needs to reassure our allies that we have their backs at all costs was followed by a section about how our cheap allies need to ""pay their fair share"" for mutual defense or be cut off. Another way of describing Trump's foreign policy worldview: He doesn't have one. He makes it all up minute by minute, and the words his aides made him read on television today were simply words his aides made him read on television. This speech was television; it was spectacle, just like the rest of his presidential campaign, which did not in any way begin a new, more serious phase today. Surely even the suckers in the media weren't naive enough to take the ""wow, this is some serious presidential stuff"" bait today, right? We're doomed."	"Trump's ""Major Foreign Policy Address"" Was a Pseudo-Event Staged to Sucker the Media. Did It Work? "
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/donald_trump_shatters_his_ceiling.html	"There wasn't any mystery about how Tuesday night's five Republican presidential primaries would end up: in Donald Trump's win column. The only thing to watch were his margins: Could he close out against John Kasich in certain highly educated, suburban congressional districts in Connecticut and Maryland, and could he break a 50 percent statewide winner-take-all threshold in Connecticut? Yes, he could! He could do all of that, and he did. He won every state by double digits and cruised in every congressional district awarding bound delegates. He made a joke of his competition and the #NeverTrump cause, just as he did last week in New York, and there he was again Tuesday night, addressing supporters in Trump Tower with that same shrugging, blustery triumphalism. Sure, the Northeast is his smoggy backyard, and he won't see it again until the New Jersey primary in June. But as he wraps up this friendly swing, he showed his close observers that he could do something he hadn't been able to do much of yet: outperform predictions. If that's a new trend that he can carry over to Indiana and California, then he's the nominee. Think back to all of three weeks ago, when Cruz and associated anti-Trumpers--with a little help from Trump's tweeting thumbs--humiliated the front-runner in Wisconsin. The results followed the narrative that the most dedicated anti-Trumpers believe to be true about the Republican Party nationally: that Trump had a ceiling of 30 to 40 percent and couldn't win a majority. Cruz would stop Trump in red states; Kasich would stop him in blue states; and the nomination would be decided at the convention. Well, funny thing. Trump didn't just get a majority in New York; he outperformed his final polling average by 7.3 percentage points and lost only one of 27 congressional results. Tuesday night's contests told a similar story. In Connecticut, RealClearPolitics' polling average had him at 53.7 percent. As of this writing, with 88 percent of the state reporting, he's at 57.9 percent statewide and should carry each congressional district. In Maryland, Trump's polling average sat at 47.7 percent; with 80 percent reporting, he's at 55 percent--and he has easy leads in each congressional district. In Pennsylvania: 48.3 percent polling average, 57 percent support with 98 percent reporting. He surpassed 60 percent in Delaware and Rhode Island with all precincts reported. Trump is going to win about 110 to 112 out of 118 bound delegates Tuesday night, leaking oil only because Rhode Island awards its delegates proportionally. And then there's the rest of Pennsylvania's delegation. Once the dust clears, he will win most if not all of Pennsylvania's congressional districts. He will also have a strong claim on the unbound delegates elected Tuesday night, who, if they haven't opted to support him already, have said they would throw in with the winner of their districts on the first ballot. And a cursory glance at early delegate-election results suggests that Trump's preferred slate of delegates is performing well. In the 4th District, for example, three of the 15 delegate candidates said they would support Trump at least on the first ballot, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review's survey. Right now, with 73 percent of ballots counted, those three delegates are leading. What has happened since Wisconsin is anyone's guess, but it seems likely that Trump's recent howling over the GOP's ""rigged"" nomination system caught on with voters. Looking ahead to next week's showdown in Indiana, we can't predict a similar majority romp yet. Though Cruz and big anti-Trump spenders weren't very active in the Northeast, they will give Indiana absolutely everything they have. And Indiana is not, say, Connecticut. (But is it sort of like, say, Pennsylvania?) Trump is maintaining a single-digit lead over Cruz in the state's sparse polling, though Cruz's numbers should jump a little given Kasich's decision not to contest the state. Following the patterns of just a few weeks ago, we'd all expect Cruz to rise in the closing days of the Indiana contest, with Trump bumping up against his 40 percent ceiling. But now we know Trump is capable of outperforming his expectations. If he can do the same in Indiana, then Cruz will lose the state. A convention that doesn't end with Donald Trump accepting the Republican presidential nomination after that would require a special sort of thievery.

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/tweets_on_the_pennsylvania_maryland_connecticut_delaware_and_rhode_island.html	It's Super Tuesday again! Sort of. Today voters in five Northeastern states--Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island--are voting to decide their party's presidential nominees. Up for grabs are 384 Democratic delegates and 172 Republican delegates. Hillary Clinton, who is polling comfortably in Maryland and Pennsylvania, is expected to widen her delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. Among Republicans, Donald Trump is expected to win all contests, but the question is whether John Kasich and Ted Cruz will be able to pick off enough delegates to make it harder for him to reach the minimum he needs to prevent a contested convention. Pundits and politicos will be watching closely to find out. Below are their live tweets, drawn from a list of top accounts curated by Slate. Those who lean left are on the left; those who lean right are on the right. Enjoy the instant spin! Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign.	What Twitter Pundits Are Saying About Today's Primary Results

He wants to persuade the party's superdelegates--officeholders, luminaries, and party officials who can vote at the convention--that he's the Democrats' best hope to win the general election. Never mind that Hillary Clinton has won more votes and elected delegates. ""There are a lot of delegates out there who are looking at the general matchup,"" Sanders argued Sunday on CNN. ""And what they're seeing in polls is that Bernie Sanders is running a lot stronger against Donald Trump than is Hillary Clinton."" It's true that Sanders does better than Clinton in hypothetical matchups against the Republicans. Currently, Sanders outperforms Clinton by more than seven percentage points against Trump, and by nearly nine points against Ted Cruz. But that's not because Sanders is the stronger nominee. It's because Republicans haven't yet trashed him the way they've trashed Clinton. Once they do, his advantage over her would disappear. In recent days, several writers--Sahil Kapur in Bloomberg Politics, David Corn in Mother Jones, Greg Sargent in the Washington Post, Ed Kilgore in New York, and others--have sketched this argument. But is it true? Polls suggest it is. A concerted attack on Sanders' weaknesses would hurt him badly in a general election. Here's how it would look. The problem with current polls that test Sanders against Trump or Cruz is that they don't capture the effects of the fall campaign. As Harry Enten points out in FiveThirtyEight, early general-election polls in previous cycles were predictively worthless. Early in the 2000 election, for instance, George W. Bush led Al Gore by 12 percentage points. ""Bush, then the Texas governor, burst onto the national scene with relatively little negative media scrutiny,"" Enten observes. Between December 1999 and November 2000, as the scrutiny intensified, Bush's net favorability fell 27 percentage points. He ended up losing the popular vote. The best way to account for this kind of damage is to conduct a campaign within a poll. That sounds perverse, but campaign pollsters, unlike media pollsters, do it all the time. It's called message testing. Here's how it works: You're running against another candidate. There are a lot of bad things you could say about him. You want to pick the message that will hurt him most and hurt you least. So you call up a bunch of people and ask them how they're planning to vote. Then you try out the various messages you're considering. After each message, you ask the person on the phone to what degree this statement makes her less likely to support your opponent. When you're done, you ask her once more how she's planning to vote, given the information you've provided. Congratulations: You've just conducted a campaign in a poll. You've ascertained how the election might turn out, depending on how you go after your opponent. That's what a pro-Clinton phone bank did to Sanders two months ago. Thanks to a voter who recorded the call and passed it to ABC News, you can listen to the whole spiel. First the caller asks the voter which candidate he's planning to support. Then she reads talking points from each candidate and asks the question again. Then she tries out some pro-Clinton and anti-Sanders messages. ""Next, you're going to hear some statements that someone could make about Bernie Sanders,"" she says. ""After each one, please tell me how much it concerns you."" One statement is: ""Bernie Sanders is making big campaign promises that will cost up to $20 trillion. The New York Times said his plans are not realistic. Other independent experts said his plans are unworkable and dead on arrival in Congress."" Another statement is: ""Bernie Sanders' plan is to replace Obamacare and put all Americans into a whole new health care system. His plan would force 70 percent of Americans to pay more for health care through higher taxes. Sanders himself said he will raise taxes."" That's what a general-election campaign against Sanders would look like--except it would be much, much worse. Republicans would rip Sanders as a big-spending, big-taxing socialist. They have plenty of ammo. They could quote the 2015 letter in which Sanders urged President Obama to ""raise revenue"" through ""executive action."" They could dig up quotes from decades ago, in which Sanders called himself ""clearly anti-capitalistic,"" complained that U.S. interventions in Latin America ""have been for the benefit of large corporations,"" and praised communist countries as culturally superior. ""Contrast what the young people in China and Cuba are doing for themselves and for their country as compared to the young people in America,"" Sanders argued in 1976. Republicans could hammer the back-seat foreign policy Sanders conducted as a mayor in Vermont: going to Cuba to seek a meeting with Fidel Castro, visiting Lenin's tomb in the Soviet Union, and traveling to Nicaragua, where he met with Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega and praised the country's cultural minister as a ""hippie"" whose government was ""teaching poetry not only to peasants and to workers but in the military."" They could go after Sanders' countercultural mockery of ""respectful clerks, technicians and soldiers."" They could rehash his attacks on compulsory schooling, dairy laws, and fluoridation, or his Freudian analysis of napalm use in Vietnam, or his advocacy of public toddler nudity and genital touching as cures for porn, or the sexual quackery through which he attributed breast cancer and cervical cancer to orgasm deficiency and capitalist conformity. Basically, if you were designing the perfect target for Republicans--a candidate who proudly links socialist economics to hippie culture, libertinism, left-wing foreign policy, new-age nonsense, and contempt for bourgeois values--you'd create Bernie Sanders. Clinton could have attacked these weaknesses in the primary--her supporters had an opposition research file on Sanders' ""associations with communism""--but she didn't. In a general election, Republicans wouldn't hesitate. Would a GOP assault along these lines hurt Sanders? Absolutely. Start with his spending plans. Two months ago, an Associated Press-GfK poll asked Americans about Sanders' proposal to replace ""the private health insurance system ... with a single government-run and taxpayer-funded plan"" that ""would cover medical, dental, vision, and long-term care services."" A 39 percent plurality favored the idea. Then the poll asked people whether they'd still support the plan if it meant ""your own taxes would increase."" Suddenly, the plurality disappeared: Only 28 percent still favored the plan; 39 percent opposed it. When the poll mentioned that people would have to ""give up other coverage like employer coverage"" as part of the government-run system, again, 39 percent opposed it, while only 28 percent supported it. Surveys by Vox and Morning Consult got similar results. In late January, 54 percent of registered voters said they would support ""a single-payer health care system, in which all Americans would get their health insurance from one government plan that is financed by taxes."" Fifty-eight percent said they would support ""the government using taxes to pay tuition at public colleges and universities in order to make college free for students."" But in April, when the same pollster asked voters how much they were willing to pay each year in additional federal taxes to fund these programs, only 15 percent and 17 percent, respectively, were willing to pay more than $1,000 for the health care plan and the free college system. ""That's well short of how much more the average taxpayer would pay under [Sanders'] tax plan,"" Vox noted. These polls show what would happen in a general election: Once Republicans focus attention on the per capita cost of Sanders' health care plan, voters would turn against it. Sanders would fight back, noting that a single-payer plan could reduce premiums to make up for the tax increase. But Vox details elements of Sanders' plan--a 2.2 percent surcharge on incomes and a 6.2 percent earnings tax levied on employers and passed through to workers--that make it unlikely Sanders could stay within the limit of what people are willing to pay. Republicans wouldn't just expose the cost. They'd also reframe the debate around the role of government. Sanders would argue that corporations are the greater menace--and he'd lose. The January Vox poll asked voters, ""Which do you think is a greater potential threat to the country's future?"" Twenty-seven percent of respondents picked ""Big Businesses."" Fifty-eight percent picked ""Big Government."" Politically, Clinton's approach is smarter. A few months ago, Gallup asked Americans: ""Do you think it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage, or is that not the responsibility of the federal government?"" A bare majority, 51 percent to 47 percent, said it was a federal responsibility. But Gallup also asked: ""Which of the following approaches for providing healthcare in the United States would you prefer--a government-run healthcare system, or a system based mostly on private health insurance?"" A slightly larger majority, 55 percent to 41 percent, preferred a private system. So Republicans would probably lose a debate against Obamacare. But they'd win a debate against Sanders' single-payer plan. Sanders' explicit socialism would help Republicans broaden this critique into an all-out scare campaign about a government takeover. There are lots of reasons to believe such a campaign would succeed. In a national Reason-Rupe poll taken two years ago, capitalism had a net favorable rating of 55 percent to 38 percent. Socialism had a net unfavorable rating of 58 percent to 36 percent. Last year, Gallup asked Americans: ""If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be socialist, would you vote for that person?"" Forty-seven percent of respondents said they would, but 50 percent said they wouldn't. Every other kind of candidate tested in the Gallup poll--black, Mormon, gay, Muslim, atheist--garnered majority support, probably because the question stipulated that the candidate had already been nominated by ""your party."" Only a socialist nominee was rejected. Among Democrats, a socialist was the only type of nominee who didn't get 60 percent support. Sanders supporters discount such polls, noting that Sanders calls himself a ""democratic"" socialist. That stipulation helps, but not enough. A January YouGov poll asked Americans: ""Bernie Sanders has described himself as a 'democratic socialist.' Does this make you more or less likely to support him, or does it make no difference either way?"" Twelve percent of respondents said more likely; 18 percent said less likely. Among independents, 8 percent said more likely; 15 percent said less likely. That's in addition to the 39 percent of all respondents who said it made no difference because ""I wouldn't support him anyway."" Polls in swing states show the same pattern. In New Hampshire, 20 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said a ""Democratic socialist"" president would be unacceptable. In Virginia, 52 percent of all voters said they'd be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who ""was a Democratic-Socialist."" The phrase was a net loser with every audience. Two out of three Democrats didn't care, but among those who did, the percentage who said they'd be less likely to vote for such a candidate (15 percent) slightly exceeded the percentage who said they'd be more likely (12 percent). After beating up Sanders for his domestic socialism, Republicans would turn to his dalliances with communist regimes. Five years ago, in a Rasmussen survey, 77 percent of likely voters said the American system of politics and economics was ""morally superior to communism."" Eighty percent said the American system was ""better for middle class workers."" (Ten percent said communism was better.) Fidel Castro's most recent favorable rating in a poll of Americans, taken two years ago, was 6 percent favorable and 81 percent unfavorable. In a Gallup poll taken two months ago, China's unfavorable rating was 52 percent, Russia's was 65 percent, and more than 85 percent of Americans said both countries were critical or important military threats to the United States. Sanders could point out that he made the right call on Iraq. But that wouldn't help him against Trump, who also criticized the war. As for Sanders' comments about compulsory schooling, genital touching, and carcinogenic chastity, those views have never been polled, because they're too flaky. It would be a cheap shot to bring them up, since they're decades old, but that wouldn't deter Republicans. What might hold Republicans back from the flaky stuff is that they don't need to get personal to kill Sanders. They could kill him just by talking about his health care takeover, his spending plans, his taxes, his socialism, and his admiration of totalitarian regimes. Instead, Republicans face a showdown with Clinton. After three presidential elections, eight years in the White House, eight in the Senate, and four as secretary of state, she's one of the most thoroughly investigated people in American history. Everyone's heard about Whitewater, Benghazi, her Wall Street speeches, and her email server. That's why she does worse than Sanders in general-election polls. But it's also what depresses Republican strategists. They've subpoenaed everything they can find on her, unloaded all their oppo, and she still wins. Their only hope is a fresh piece of meat, an alternative Democratic nominee who looks clean to liberals but is loaded with unexploited vulnerabilities and is easier to caricature as a wild-eyed socialist.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/cruz_kasich_alliance_won_t_help_against_trump.html	"At every turn in the Republican presidential primary, the anti-Donald Trump brigade has been too late in arriving. By the time Republican candidates and super PACs began an ad barrage against the real estate mogul, it was late winter, and Trump had already swept contests in New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and most contests on Super Tuesday. He wasn't the presumptive nominee, but he was close, and the money spent on ads wasn't enough to stop him. By the time Republican elites made a push to unite around Ted Cruz--as flagging candidates such as Jeb Bush and Chris Christie left the race--it was early spring, and Trump had claimed new wins in Michigan, Mississippi, Illinois, and North Carolina. And the effort to coordinate against Trump couldn't stop him from winning Florida; knocking Marco Rubio out of the race; and claiming a large, delegate-rich state for his coalition. At this point, desperate Republicans had formed a ""Never Trump"" movement meant to keep Trump from winning the nomination outright. But once again, they were too late, as any momentum gathered during Cruz's victory in Wisconsin dissipated when Trump dominated the New York primary, taking 60 percent of the vote and all but a handful of delegates. Now, the remaining non-Trump Republicans have made an agreement--call it the Cruz-Kasich nonaggression pact. Under this deal, the Texas senator will bypass the primaries in Oregon (May 17) and New Mexico (June 7), opening space for John Kasich, while the Ohio governor will give up on Indiana (May 3) to make room for Cruz, who is just behind Trump in the available polls. It's not that Cruz backers will vote for Kasich or the reverse, but the candidates will stay out of each other's way and campaign elsewhere. If either candidate stops Trump in one of those states, he can keep the front-runner from hitting the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination, uncontested, at the convention. Then, presumably, Cruz and Kasich would jockey between themselves for the nomination, despite the fact that most Republicans voted for Trump, who won the most states and (more importantly) the most delegates, even if he didn't clear the bar for outright victory. The great weakness of this scheme is that it's delusional, full stop. And the extent to which it's delusional is easy to understand. If we've learned anything watching Republicans battle for their party nomination, it's that many Republican voters support Trump, and most (or at least a large plurality) would accept him as standard-bearer for the party. Trump is poised for victory Tuesday in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, as well as subsequent primaries in West Virginia, New Jersey, and California. More broadly, Trump has nearly 50 percent support among Republicans nationwide and is the second choice for voters in both the Cruz and Kasich camps. According to a national survey from Quinnipiac University conducted before the Wisconsin primary, Trump would win in a two-man race against either candidate. This is critical. Technically, presidential primaries aren't elections as much as they are intraparty deliberations: a complicated set of rules, procedures, and contests meant to help a party decide on a nominee. Democracy, or at least majoritarianism, isn't the point. At the same time, it has been decades since we haven't had a majoritarian primary. For most people, that is how this works--the candidate with the most votes wins, like in any other election. It's why, when asked, more than 60 percent of Republican voters say that in the event that no candidate hits the threshold for delegates, the person with the most votes should be the nominee, rather than the person judged the best standard-bearer for the party. To do otherwise is to challenge a basic intuition about how the process works; it's to ignore the public's democratic faith. (It's also why ""superdelegates"" were an object of controversy in the Democratic primary. Voters hated the idea that elites could choose a winner rather than leave the process to them.) Cruz and Kasich might well outmaneuver Trump and keep him from his magic number with wins in Indiana, New Mexico, and Oregon, even as the bumbling start to their nonaggression pact has left them looking more like the Superior Foes of the Donald than actual competitors. But it won't matter either way. Whether he gets to 1,237 or not, Trump has an unbeatable advantage--democratic legitimacy. And if Republican leaders try to take the nomination from his hands, he'll have a powerful rallying cry: They're trying to steal your vote. For once in his campaign, he would be right. To take the nomination from the candidate with the most votes is to tell ordinary Republicans that their ballots don't matter--that the will of elites outweighs the will of the voters. That many of those elites are elected officials--and themselves accountable to voters--doesn't matter; that they might make a good choice doesn't matter, either. What matters is the widespread belief that votes count and that voters have the final say on the choice of nominee. Ignoring this belief wouldn't just confirm every possible critique of ""the establishment""; it would tear the party apart. This is why it matters that those elites were too divided and short-sighted to act quickly against Trump. By waiting until Trump had won to unleash attacks and coordinate efforts, they also lost their shot to influence voters and amass the votes needed to challenge Trump at the convention with at least a patina of democratic legitimacy. That might have worked. Instead, they're left with the worst possible outcome. Trump holds all the cards--he's all but the winner. Cruz and Kasich and GOP elites can play grab-ass as much as they'd like. The simple fact is that, now, the Republican Party belongs to Trump. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	Why the Cruz-Kasich Alliance Won't Change a Thing
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/donald_trump_can_t_change.html	"The grown-ups who've taken over Donald Trump's presidential campaign would like the Republican ""establishment"" to know that it's all been an act, and he's ready to pivot to something resembling a viable general-election candidate come Cleveland. The new head of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, promised Republican National Committee members as much on Thursday at a closed-door parley during the group's spring meeting in Florida. This meeting, obviously, was recorded and leaked forthwith to the press. ""That's what's important for you to understand,"" Manafort reassured the assembled, as reported by the New York Times. ""That he gets it, and that the part he's been playing is evolving."" Translated into formal D.C.-ese, a language in which Manafort is fluent, he is saying that Donald Trump gets the joke. He's perfectly self-aware and is just playing the game, riling up the nativists en route to the Republican nomination. This was meant to quell RNC members' concerns about Trump's jaw-droppingly poor favorability ratings, which Manafort believes (or is paid to say he believes) are pliant. Consider the chin-stroking distinction he struck between irrecoverably low popularity versus unpopularity by, uh, design? ""Fixing personality negatives is a lot easier than fixing character negatives,"" Manafort said. ""You can't change somebody's character. But you can change the way somebody presents themselves."" You don't get to be a lobbyist to a who's-who of autocrats if you can't bullshit like this. But let's follow through with this distinction that he almost certainly made up five minutes before addressing the RNC. There is personality, as in the construction one presents to the public, and there is character, as in the sort of person one really is. Manafort would have us believe that the personality--that of a pig, which appeals to a requisite number of white males to win the Republican presidential nomination--is just a lie; the character, meanwhile--to be unveiled in the general election!--is more akin to, say, Abraham Lincoln, or some other really terrific guy. A couple of red flags here. The first would be that a person willing to project a total lie of a personality for personal gain is axiomatically a lousy character. But we don't even get that far. Because there's no reason to believe that the personality Trump has presented in his campaign is anything other than an extension of his truest self, which is a pig. Trump has been successful in his brief political career, which has taken place totally within the context of a Republican presidential primary. Within whatever context, the politicians who are usually most successful run campaigns that are extensions of their personalities--i.e. ones that can project ""authentic"" versions of themselves rather than total constructs, which leads to easily sniffed-out phoniness. It confuses some observers as to how Trump's fans can really believe that he's ""authentic"" or ""honest,"" which they all really do believe, because on the policy level he's changed his mind so many times in his career that the rank opportunism of it all is unmistakable. But it makes sense--he's put together the package that clicks! The piggish positions and piggish postures he's adopted strike just about everyone as the honest and authentic extension of Donald Trump, pig. Trump politicks like a real estate developer. He doesn't want a whole bunch of poor people spilling over onto his property and disturbing the members. So of course he wants a wall around the perimeter. The idea of a wall lights up a mind like Donald Trump's with euphoria. And then there are Muslims. Muslims: bad, scary, not a good look, bad for property values--don't let them in. Trump believes that a woman's worth directly correlates with her looks and that a man's worth directly correlates with the eye candy on his arm. A former associate, for example, said that he did not want to be seen in public eating lunch with a woman he deemed ugly. When Trump couldn't believe people would consider voting for a ""face"" like Carly Fiorina's, or when he retweeted a side-by-side photo of his wife, Melania, and Heidi Cruz, this was not an act, put on to get the rubes interested. That was Donald Trump, all right, and if he captures the nomination, it won't matter what pressure Paul Manafort or Rick Wiley or Reince Priebus puts on him: The over-under on how long it takes him to call Hillary Clinton a ""bitch"" during a general-election prime-time press conference will be two weeks. Thirty percent of the country will love it. Seventy percent will not. He can't change who he is, and he can't shed the baggage he's accumulated as a result of being who he is, which is a pig.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/no_labels_centrist_fantasies_are_the_problem_not_the_solution.html	"Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, co-chairman of the nonpartisan ""problem-solving"" advocacy group No Labels, has a novel theory of what we're seeing this campaign. ""Take a look at the two most interesting, surprising candidacies of the presidential year,"" he said Thursday at an event celebrating the release of No Labels' ""policy playbook"" for the 2016 election. ""They want people to do something different. The best politics may be unconventional politics."" Lieberman, unconventionally, was explaining why he believes the moment is ripe for entitlement reform. Perhaps No Labels has been watching a different election. Anger and the appetite for breaking the status quo in Washington are absolutely the gusts lifting the campaigns of Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders. But working people across the country are not packing these rallies to demand the sort of technocratic dickering No Labels offers in its new 60-point policy platform, introduced Thursday at a luncheon in Washington's luxury Mayflower Hotel. There has been bipartisan energy linking the anti-establishment bases of both parties this year, which theoretically should please No Labels. That energy, however, has been populist and directed at the sort of Washington elites whom they no longer trust to represent their interests. For today's discontented voters, the sort of ballroom-luncheon centrism practiced for so long by the likes of Lieberman is more the target than the solution. No Labels was founded in 2010 as a group comprising centrist Democrats and Republicans to counteract the entrenched gridlock that had begun to define the Obama era. (Another purpose: to offer sinecures to figures like co-chairmen Lieberman and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, whose political careers were ended due to lack of popularity within their respective political parties.) A cursory glance at the news suggests that such gridlock still exists six years later and shows little sign of abating, ever. No Labels aspires to change all that through its 2016 election project, the National Strategic Agenda, a name clearly devised without much thought to its acronym. On Thursday, the nonprofit released a list of centrist policy proposals that it believes the next president and Congress, whether Democratic or Republican, can implement. It employed one gimmick that it hopes will critic-proof its proposals: A pollster tested out each idea under consideration, and the final list of 60 ideas includes only those that earned a majority of support from Democrats, Republicans, and independents. In some cases this probably saved No Labels from its worst centrist impulses. Social Security is the best example. Bill Galston, the Brookings Institution scholar who served as a policy aide in the Clinton administration and who did the legwork for No Labels' Social Security section, said the group polled just about every Social Security solution that's been put forth over the past decade. Four policies made the cut: raising the payroll tax cap from $118,500 to $240,000, increasing the payroll tax by 1 percent on both the employer and employee sides, slowing the rate of growth for the top 20 percent of beneficiaries, and tightening eligibility requirements and ""reducing fraud"" for Social Security disability benefits. There are criticisms that can (and would) be leveled against each of these tweaks. But polling ensured that the most unpopular ideas usually found in centrist Social Security reform proposals--like raising the retirement age--were wisely excluded. No Labels' theory is that polling support will make risk-averse politicians feel safe enough to stake out what otherwise might be considered treacherous political territory. ""I think the public would really honor and reward a leader who took the risks,"" Lieberman said. Let's just say that Lieberman never did have a good ear for moves that would draw widespread political support. Not all of No Labels' proposals are the sure things it makes them out to be. Some may draw more polling support than they really have because they're presented in rosier, abridged forms. Consider Idea No. 47: ""Allow Health Insurance Purchases Across State Lines."" This earns 77 percent polling support overall, with 70 percent of Democrats, 82 percent of independents, and 80 percent of Republicans in favor. It's an idea that sounds delightful when presented in brief. ""Currently, consumers can buy policies only from insurers licensed by the states where they live and state insurance markets are sometimes dominated by one or two insurers,"" the No Labels brief reads. ""Allow citizens to buy health insurance plans across state lines. By increasing customer choice, this step could increase competition and decrease insurance and overall health care costs."" Terrific! But? This abstract does not list the downsides of such a policy, such as a ""race to the bottom"" for cheap, lightly regulated health care plans offered in some states that would throw health care risk pools out of whack. The list otherwise includes ideas good and bad, ideas big and small, ideas that would likely pass with public support and ideas that would not. No Labels plans after the election to set up a network of grassroots activists in order to catalyze elected officials into action. We'll ... see ... how that works. What's infuriated so many observers about No Labels since its inception, though, and the reason why it's not taken more seriously, is its glib belief that ""politics"" is an unserious distraction from the important work of think tank-led technocratic tinkering. The group's pooh-poohing of politics as the ballyhoo of dingbats is what leads it to misinterpret the apoplectic tenor of the 2016 election and the rise of Trump and Sanders. This isn't a ""why can't these clowns in Congress just put aside their differences and get things done?"" sort of rage, as Lieberman and Huntsman seem to think. It's a reaction against a governing paradigm that more and more voters have come to believe works for elite special interests rather than for them. It may not be as difficult to extend Social Security's solvency as some make it out to be, and No Labels puts forth a couple of relatively pain-free ways to do it. The reason it's not happening, and the reason Sanders and Trump promise not to fiddle with it (unless it's to increase benefits), is that they recognize that people do not trust Washington even to try ""reforming"" it right now. It wasn't so long ago, after all, that the serious people of D.C. were trying to ""reform"" Social Security by shoving it into the stock market; the recession thankfully buried that idea for at least a generation. Likewise, Sanders' and Trump's opposition to trade deals--a subject area not considered in No Labels' list--is such a sturdy plank because people have seen what's happened in recent decades when Washington experts are trusted to negotiate free trade deals, and they don't believe those deals have worked for them. They don't want to hear about how the next one's going to be just swell. And the shared issue that's probably done more for Sanders and Trump than anything else is their disassociation with super PACs, which ostensibly disassociates them from the interests of the wealthy. Oh, there is a shared anger among Republicans and Democrats erupting this cycle. But it's not about how politicians haven't figured out a way to put their bickering aside and eliminate regulations that obstruct capital formation, or whatever. It's a populist anger against a system that people believe is rigged in favor of elites and unresponsive to average voters. In this environment, the bipartisan sentiment isn't a hope that the usual Washington players just get ""something"" done. It's a fear of it. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/the_domestication_of_donald_trump_has_begun.html	"""You heard Donald Trump tonight sounding ... more presidential,"" Megyn Kelly noted playfully on Fox News. You could tell he was presidential in his New York victory speech, she felt, because he did not refer to Ted Cruz as ""Lyin' Ted."" Everyone seemed to agree on this count. ""I think one of the things that's most significant,"" GOP strategist Steve Schmidt was saying over on MSNBC, was that ""it wasn't 'Lying Ted.' "" ""Exactly,"" said his co-panelist Nicole Wallace, also a Republican. ""It was 'Senator Cruz.' "" ""Yes,"" Wallace said. ""Yes."" Among a great many other things, this election has given us a good measure of just how far we've defined down presidential. Trump may indeed have been restrained on Tuesday night in celebrating his predictable but impressive win in the New York Republican primary, but he was certainly not presidential. He did his usual shtick (albeit at shorter length), mentioned the great businessmen in the room with him, told a story about a developer friend (undermining him at the same time), and inflated the night's actual primary results. His speech focused on, yes, our lost greatness. ""We are going to be, legitimately, so great again, and I just can't wait,"" he said. Trump was Trump, give or take. But it was clear Tuesday night that, with Bernie all but cooked and Hillary in need of a new foil, the narrative now demanded that Trump be a candidate transformed. There was nothing Trump could've done to change the story. He could've swallowed his tie on stage, and Chris Matthews would still have acted as if he'd seen the ghost of John Lindsay sitting in his green room. ""And I think,"" Matthews exulted, ""that that's going to be one hell of a general election campaign--with Trump starting out very behind and perhaps catching up to a very exciting conclusion."" Schmidt said Trump's speech showed a willingness ""to address the temperament criticism. ... You see a potent general election message."" On Twitter, the New York Times's Maggie Haberman, who has done extensive reporting on the Trump campaign, also noticed a new side to Trump, ascribing it to the influence of Paul Manafort, the GOP operative who has seemingly taken control of the ship. Will any of this nonsense about the newly presidential Trump have an effect? Perhaps he will claw back a few wayward moderate voters in upcoming states, thanks to the friendly turn in media coverage, but the coverage isn't going to help him beat Hillary Clinton in November. If he wants to do that, he is going to have to change his strategy entirely. Given that his strategy is an extension of his personality--given that his strategy is his personality--don't count on it. As it stands, should Trump get the nomination, Hillary Clinton would have the easiest path to the presidency imaginable: All she'd have to do is sit back and let Trump soak up the limelight. The problem for Trump isn't simply that his policies are unpopular; it's that people do not like him. His personality may appeal to certain segments of the electorate, but those groups combined don't constitute a majority of Republican voters, let alone the general population. He is a fringe figure in every sense. Still, you could see on Tuesday night the next step in the normalization of Donald Trump. Here was a new Trump, the TV people said. They knew all about the internal dynamics of the Trump campaign, how Corey Lewandowski had been supplanted as the brains of the operation. The ""curated, Manaforted,"" ""on-message"" Trump of Tuesday night was a manifestation of all that palace intrigue. To talk of a new Trump was to make a savvy, wised-up observation, even if it meant domesticating an American fascist. ""But the tone with Donald Trump tonight was so much more, so much more different than I had seen just a couple weeks ago,"" MSNBC's Trump reporter, Katy Tur, observed. ""He came out, and he was gracious in his campaign speech. It was really short. It was concise."" Why, he didn't even call Ted Cruz ""Lyin' Ted,"" she marveled. ""He called him 'Senator Cruz.'

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/twitter_commentary_on_new_york_primary_results.html	Another day, another primary. Republicans and Democrats in New York vote today for their parties' presidential nominees. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are favored to win, but there's a question of how many delegates they'll earn. Trump's haul will depend on the results in individual districts. As for Bernie, don't get your hopes up for another Michigan-like upset. As Josh Voorhees explains, the laws in New York have made it harder for younger and independent-minded voters, who have favored Sanders, to participate. Commentators and pundits are sure to have plenty to say about both races. You can watch the spin in real time as the results trickle in. Below are live tweets drawn from a list of top accounts curated by Slate. You'll see left-leaning commentators on the left and right-leaning commentators on the right. Let the spin begin!
