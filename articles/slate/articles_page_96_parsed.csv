He's watched a number of like-minded libertarians, including his own son, get elected to Congress. In short, his ideas are finally getting taken seriously. So Rep. Ron Paul is retiring. He won't run for re-election to the House; he'll focus on his third presidential campaign. ""Running for two offices in the past as I have was deserving of some criticism,"" he explained, finding a way to add some self-criticism to his big announcement. ""He's had a huge impact on the next generation of people who are coming to this place,"" says Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., after hearing the news. ""He's making the right decision."" Amash is one of the Republicans who are making it easy for Paul to leave. He watched Paul's 2008 presidential campaign and liked what he saw. He remembered thinking: ""You'd hear him speak as if he wasn't from one of the two parties."" When Amash ran for Congress in 2010, he asked to meet Paul and flew down to Texas. Paul grilled him on foreign policy and the Federal Reserve. Liking what he heard, Paul endorsed Amash and campaigned for him. When Amash got to Congress, he became a reliable vote against any bill he couldn't find constitutional justification for, a principle akin to Paul's. He co-sponsored--with Dennis Kucinich!--the nearly-successful effort to defund the U.S. military operation in Libya. Five years ago, Paul was a marginal political figure who could save reporters from a slow news week as the subject of a profile. He was ""Doctor No,"" the guy with the ""Don't Steal, the Government Hates Competition"" sign on his desk, the one Republican whose criticism of George W. Bush was entirely unsurprising. He announced his 2008 presidential campaign not with a rally, not with a lens-flared YouTube video, but with a dour interview on C-Span. Paul will leave Congress next year as arguably the most intellectually influential member of the House of Representatives in a generation. (I write ""arguably"" even though trying to think of a runner-up is a deeply depressing task.) He was not necessarily a successful legislator. But his career has been remarkable for its consistency. Starting with an uphill campaign for Congress in 1974, through a wilderness period where he won the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, and continuing with a 1996 comeback that the mainstream GOP opposed, Paul advocated the same economic and foreign policies for 37 years. A call to abolish the Federal Reserve, a campaign to return to the gold standard, a belief that America's foreign interventionism was illegal and unsustainable: Some of his positions remain on the fringe of politics, but others have proved remarkably popular in America's center-right party. ""I think Ron proves that the tortoise beats the hare--a lesson the Tea Party has yet to learn,"" says Bruce Bartlett. When Paul was first sent to Congress in a 1976 special election, Bartlett worked in his office. ""Ron started talking about his issues back in the 1970s and didn't really begin to get traction on them until the last few years. And during many of those years he labored in desolation with very little support or attention. Now he has succeeded in at least putting his issues and his philosophy in the forefront of American politics."" Paul believed, as the Tea Party does, in an alternate history of the 19th and 20th centuries. In that alternate history, the Civil War was avoidable, the Great Depression could have been shorter, and Americans could have saved countless lives and countless dollars by opting out of humanitarian wars abroad and drug wars at home. The evidence for this was in the work of Austrian economists like Ludwig von Mises and historians like Edward Jay Griffin; it was explained most thoroughly in the work of the economist Murray Rothbard, who wrote an introduction to Paul's book about the gold standard. ""The proper governmental policy in a depression,"" Rothbard wrote in 1963, ""is strict laissez-faire, including stringent budget slashing, and coupled perhaps with positive encouragement for credit contraction. For decades such a program has been labeled 'ignorant,' 'reactionary,' or 'Neanderthal' by conventional economists. On the contrary, it is the policy clearly dictated by economic science to those who wish to end the depression as quickly and as cleanly as possible."" This was basically what Paul said when the economic crisis began in 2008. ""We risk committing the same errors that prolonged the misery of the Great Depression,"" he said at the first congressional hearing after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, ""namely keeping prices from falling. Instead of allowing overvalued financial assets to take a hit and trade on the market at a more realistic value, the government seeks to purchase overvalued or worthless assets and hold them in the unrealistic hope that at some point in the next few decades, someone might be willing to purchase them."" Paul was calling for an austere response to the crisis, excruciating short-term pain and creative destruction that would be followed by a rebuilding. There was no public support for a plan like that--until there was. The bailout and the American Recovery Act didn't fail, nor did they bring about an economic comeback. Because they didn't, Americans were ready to hear alternative explanations for what was going wrong. Paul was ready. In the House, he held luncheons for members of Congress who could listen and talk to experts on the discarded, untested economic theories that could fix the country. One of the loyal attendees was Michele Bachmann; when launching her presidential campaign, she joked to the Wall Street Journal that she liked to read von Mises on the beach. The GOP's frontrunner in Iowa had been won over by Paul. ""His version of libertarianism is somewhat different from that of academics, and somewhat different from the so-called cosmopolitan version popular in East Coast universities and think tanks,"" says David Boaz, the vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute. ""But in his 2007-8 presidential campaign he emphasized excessive spending, ill-advised foreign intervention, and dangerous inflationism by the Federal Reserve, and all those issues have become more prominent and more popular among Republican voters in the past four years."" When he ran four years ago, however, Paul didn't have any ideological competition. He was solo and sui generis. It was part of his quirky appeal. Now, there are plenty of Republicans who can call themselves his successors, and as long as Barack Obama is president, Paul's ideas are rolled into the GOP's double helix. Ron Paul used to be alone in saying no to everything, doubting that the elites were telling the truth. Now, there are plenty of other Republicans who think that way. There are real debates now about war funding and debt default. That's the legacy of screw-ups by presidents in both parties, and that's the legacy of Ron Paul."

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/guilt_trip.html	"Nothing at the state fair this summer will match the gravity-defying act President Obama is trying with his push for a grand bargain on raising the debt ceiling. He is trying to convince House Republicans to agree to something their supporters will hate with someone they hate--and he's adding to the degree of difficulty by actively antagonizing them. Finally, he's trying to do all this in record time, faster than the usual rules of politics allow. At his news conference Monday, the president said he didn't want to speculate on whether House Speaker John Boehner could deliver enough votes to support any deal the two of them might make in private. But part of the president's job in getting something big is thinking rather a lot about House Republicans. He's got to help Boehner come up enough votes to win the 218 needed for a majority. The first hurdle in this effort is that Republicans are suspicious of any deal Boehner might make simply because of the person he's making it with. According to the latest Gallup poll, only 13 percent of Republicans approve of Obama. His rating among the GOP base is even lower. If you've attended any GOP rally over the last several months, you know this. Simply mentioning Obama's name, his penchant for administration czars, his use of a teleprompter, or his alleged ""bowing to Muslim leaders"" (as one Senate candidate put it recently), is sure to produce a roar of disapproval. The second hurdle is taxes. A grand compromise will require considerable revenue. The president and the speaker noodled the idea of a complicated set of trade-offs that would allow taxes to be increased in some places but lowered in others. One idea was tax increases today with a promise of tax reform in the coming months, with a fail-safe of across-the-board tax cuts if the reform never materialized. But there's no arrangement sturdy enough to convince conservatives (or the Wall Street Journal editorial page). No matter what Boehner might say, if it's a big deal, there must be a tax hike in there somewhere. To clear these hurdles Obama tried a variety of shaming techniques at the news conference based on self-respect, fairness, bravery, and logic. He is still trying to get a big deal, said the president, because this crisis has presented a special opportunity to put aside ideology and achieve something lasting. Sounding the bugle call, he asked ""If not now, when?"" Obama also returned to the idea of ""shared sacrifice,"" arguing that those who have disproportionately benefited in recent years and not suffered as much during the downturn should shoulder some portion of the burden. The majority of deficit reduction will come from spending reductions that are likely to affect those who are not so well off. The president's biggest gambit was to show how much grief he was willing to take in order to get a big deal. If he was willing to anger progressives by suggesting changes to Medicare and Social Security, he said, Republicans should be brave enough to take a little heat from their side. Questions at the news conference that stressed Democratic discontent helped Obama make this point (in fact, he may have even called on people he knew would raise these issues to improve the show). Finally, the president tried offending Republicans. He repeatedly praised Boehner for acting in good faith. ""I think he's a good man who wants to do right by the country,"" he said. (White House aides don't feel this way about, say, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.) But when talking about his predicament, the president said ""the politics that swept him into the speakership were good for a midterm election, they're tough for governing. ... Part of what the Republican caucus generally needs to recognize is that American democracy works when people listen to each other, we're willing to give each other the benefit of the doubt, we assume the patriotism and good intentions of the other side, and we're willing to make some sensible compromises to solve big problems."" A statement like this may not seem offensive to you or me. But think of the audience already unfriendly to the president and you start to hear notes of finger-wagging with notes of arrogance. (Imagine if George W. Bush had said this of Democrats when trying to build support for the surge). Is a sweeping generalization about the backward members of the Republican caucus a way to convince them? Though a larger deal seems a near impossibility, both sides are still optimistic about an agreement that averts an economy-buckling default. Fear unites them--but how that shared sense of doom gives birth to an agreement in the next 10 days or so is murky. Even a smaller deal that would put off another debt limit vote until after the election will still require tax compromises and pain. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/make_the_debt_limit_disappear.html	"On Thursday an overflow crowd of House Democrats--Rep. Rush Holt, who's been nursing an injury, had to hobble into the room on a crutch and sit with reporters and observers--gathered in a Capitol Hill hearing room. The object of their attention was a former Republican economist's views on the Constitution. The economist is Bruce Bartlett, who pointed out in an April 29 column in the Fiscal Timesthat the president didn't need Congress's permission to raise the debt limit. ""The debt limit is statutory law, which is trumped by the Constitution which has a little known provision that relates to this issue,"" Bartlett wrote. ""Section 4 of the 14th Amendment says, 'The validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned.' "" The way he read it, if Congress wouldn't raise the debt limit, the president could start creating debt anyway. ""Constitutional history is replete with examples where presidents justified extraordinary actions by extraordinary circumstances."" The idea got the usual amount of attention accorded a Fiscal Times column--we can define this as less attention than a slide show about Michele Bachmann--but some of the right people did read it. In a late-May interview with Politico, Timothy Geithner held up a pocket Constitution with one page paper-clipped. He read out Section 4 of the 14th Amendment. He hinted that Republicans, who seemed to have all the leverage in the debt fight, might have none. Threatening default was ""not a credible negotiating strategy, and it's not going to happen."" It looks like a paradox. The White House has a weapon on the shelf that can avert the whole debt fight. All that Democratic griping about the entitlement cuts that will be necessary as part of a deal with Republicans? All those Republicans demanding a balanced budget amendment, which would basically prevent Congress from ever raising taxes again? If Geithner is right, they're all irrelevant. If Reuters is right, Geithner is still considering this an option. After all, President Obama has been asked about it, and he's said, ""I don't think we should even get to the constitutional issue,"" which is not the same thing as ""no."" So how would the ""constitutional option"" work? It's deceptively simple. The government would keep auctioning off Treasury securities, as it has been doing, as if the debt limit didn't exist. Investors would consider just how much they cared about the unprecedented constitutional run-around they'd just watch happen. And Republicans, Bartlett said Thursday, would freak out. ""You're immediately going to have talk about impeachment,"" he said, pointing out that freshman Rep. Tim Scott, R-S.C., has already raised that possibility. ""But I think this becomes more of a constitutional crisis than an economic crisis.""Asked about it on Thursday, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. speculated that ""our only option at that point would probably be taking [President Obama] to court."" That's worked for Republicans in the past. In 2010, when Democrats briefly suggested that they could ""deem and pass"" the Affordable Care Act without holding a vote in the Senate, state attorneys general (led by Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli) threatened to sue. Congress backed down. It's just not so clear now who could sue over a debt limit runaround. Congress could pass a joint resolution and start a legal process, but the Senate's run by Democrats. The House could start impeachment hearings, but those would be doomed, too. According to Jack Balkin, a professor of constitutional law at Yale and probably the most prominent legal advocate of the ""option,"" the only clear legal path against Obama and Geithner would be a sort of Rube Goldberg scheme. ""If the president issued new debt,"" said Balkin, ""and somebody purchased the bond on credit, and then refused to pay on the grounds that they discovered that the bond was worthless, then the person who sold the debt might sue for payment. The purchaser might then try to defend the refusal to pay on the ground that the bond was worthless because it was illegal. That would bring the constitutional question before the courts as a defense."" That's the risk the ""constitutional option"" crowd likes to think about. Garrett Epps, a professor of law at the University of Baltimore, showed up at Thursday's hearing and sat behind Bartlett. He described a binary choice--watching the United States default, or watching Republicans raise hell over the 14th Amendment. Which would investors prefer? ""I'd think a constitutional crisis in which they're getting their checks affects them less than a constitutional crisis in which they're not getting their checks,"" he said. But not all the Democrats in the room were enamored of this 14th Amendment strategy. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is never shy about implying that he's speaking about a crazy idea to a crazy person, asked Bartlett to look again at the wording of the amendment. ""It says the debt of the United States shall not be questioned,"" said Bartlett. ""There are people who say the debt limit is unconstitutional."" ""There are people who say Elvis is alive!"" said Frank. Frank started to talk about a ""political cataclysm"" but was cut off. Before everyone had to speed away to take a vote, he warned that he would not resolve the constitutional issue. He finished his point. ""The anger in the country, the bitterness and the vitriol, would be magnified enormously,"" he said, ""and you'd be letting people off the hook for their irresponsibility!"" There was a lot to that answer. The ""constitutional option"" is not necessarily the Democrats' ploy. If Democrats want to use it, though, it could play the same role as Sen. Pat Toomey's Full Faith and Credit Act, a bill that would have ""codified"" the Treasury secretary's role in shuffling around money to avoid default. Toomey, a Republican, was successful in getting Republicans to agree on something that made little sense practically and, functionally, would mean that the government paid off debt before paying most bills. (On Thursday, Toomey tried to minimize this possibility by referring to a ""partial government shutdown,"" which sounds better than ""falling more than $150 billion short on revenue in August and being unable to pay out Social Security."") Democrats could try something like this, swearing up and down that they've got a solution to the problem that would cut Republicans out. They're not quite ready to go there. And it takes two people to play chicken."	14th Amendment: Does Obama need congressional approval to raise the debt limit?	['Rush', 'Obama', 'Hill', 'Garrett', 'Toomey']	[]
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/wish_you_werent_here.html	"The Senate floor is mostly empty. When the session begins on Tuesday, the Democratic and Republican leaders shuffle the notes for their first remarks. The well of the House is emptier; the doors are closed for a pro forma session in which literally nothing is happening. The hundreds of tourists walking in and out of the gallery look more bored than people wearing T-shirts and sandals really ought to look. You'd never know there was a debt crisis. Congress is in session this week because Republicans didn't want a weeklong holiday recess, and Democrats obliged them. ""Our country is going bankrupt,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., last week, making the ask. ""We should not be going on holiday."" It was a deal: no holiday. Congress is on emergency watch with weeks to go, maybe, before an analyst at Moody's or S&P gets cut off in traffic, needs to vent, and decides to downgrade the credit rating of the United States. What does Congress look like on emergency watch? Picture the way Congress looks at any other time. Got it? Now: Slow it down. The problem with this particular crisis is that Congress doesn't really have the power to make a deal on the debt ceiling. It will, eventually, vote on a compromise plan, which Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky libertarian, may or may not try to filibuster. In the meantime, the deal is being crafted by a combination of meetings, threats of meetings, and media manipulation by a few actors: the president, the vice president, and leaders in Congress. ""The fundamental reality,"" says Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who studies the Hill, ""is that Congress is going to vote up or down on a package that is put together by a small number of leaders. Coming back right now is 90 percent about optics."" How much is this about optics? On Tuesday, as he did last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell extends an offer: The president can come meet him and other leaders, and ""hear what can actually pass in Congress."" This will be reported as an invitation to a meeting, but that's not really what it is. The president is not going to give the thumbs-up to what McConnell has just described as a one-way lecture about Republican demands. In their prepared statements, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and McConnell don't even agree on the timeline. Reid says it could be a ""matter of days."" McConnell says ""weeks."" No one has figured out the right way to goad the White House about this. About the only thing anyone has figured out today is that spiking other legislation will confirm that Congress is really, really serious. The only business on the Senate floor is a resolution on the military intervention in Libya, drafted by John Kerry and John McCain. There have been objections to this, including an outright ""no"" vote in the House. It takes on water today because senators want to talk about debt instead. ""Instead of focusing on the issue at hand,"" says Sen. Bob Corker on the floor, ""we're gonna focus on something, possibly, that is irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the issue at hand! It's just to show that we're doing something!"" It becomes clear that his fellow Republicans will vote against the resolution; after a little more than an hour, the resolution is pulled, and senators declare victory. ""While Libya is important,"" says Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., ""the issue before us right now is not Libya."" Technically, there's nothing else for the Senate to do all day. One more vote is put on the schedule--a vote to request that all senators show up for votes. This lasts more than an hour, and gets 83 ayes and eight nays. Just like that, the day's work is done. This is the first day of the surprise post-holiday session, which will, theoretically, hammer out deals on debt. Nobody's happy about it. ""One of the main reasons I started to object last week was because of the process,"" says Johnson in a chat with reporters. ""For just a few people, a limited number of individuals, to go behind closed doors, far from the view of the American public--is that really going to be how we decide the financial fate of America? I do not think so! I do not believe that's what the founders envisioned!"" And yet, it keeps happening. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., reminisces about how in December, a deal on taxes was figured out in a few high-level meetings, then voted on, and in April a deal to keep the government running was figured out in high-level meetings, then voted on. Why does this keep happening? Well, consider these two headlines from the Los Angeles Times. From June 30: ""Senate To Scrap July 4 Recess To Work on Debt-Limit Deal."" From July 4: ""112th Congress Is One of the Least Productive in Years."" Both of those stories were written by the same reporter. Taken together, they don't make sense--at least not until you realize that legislating very little, and forcing the biggest spending cuts or caps they could get, is what a lot of Republicans came here for. And not until you realize that Senate Democrats benefit if they bring up good political votes. The only debt vote scheduled for this week is a ""sense of the Senate"" resolution, co-signed by 17 Democrats, which concludes:"	Congress reacts to the debt-limit emergency by staying in session and doing nothing.

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/no_tv_until_youre_done.html	"Two months ago the narrative of the Washington crisis over the debt limit suggested that at this exact stage in the drama the president would step forward, call on both parties to stop playing politics, and position himself as the voice of reason, if not wisdom, in search of a final agreement. This scene would take place in a news conference in the White House briefing room. My prediction was wrong. The press conference was held in the East Room. ""The question is whether Democrats and Republicans are willing to put aside the expedience of short-term politics to get it done,"" said President Obama, reflecting on the letters of anguish he gets from Americans struggling with the weak economy. ""These folks are counting on us. ... [I]f all the leadership in Washington has the faces and stories of those families in mind they will solve this debt limit issue,"" he said. ""These are solvable problems, but it does require us just getting out of the short term and, frankly, selfish approach that sometimes politics breeds."" We've seen this posture before from a president--at the same period in the negotiations over extending the Bush tax cuts and averting a government shutdown. Obama is trying to stay in his loft, above the squabbling that voters hate while simultaneously asserting enough (but not too much!) pressure on Republicans to make a deal. The direct pressure on Republicans wasn't subtle. Obama effectively said they favored oil companies and owners of private jets over food safety and scholarship students. If Republicans don't relent, the United States will default on its debt, which would damage the nation's bond rating and destroy its standing as an economic superpower. Demagoguery! say Republicans. It's class warfare! He isn't being honest about the scope of the tax increases he wants! Republicans may want to overcome their outrage so they can enjoy the really good celebration they could be having. They have maneuvered the president into making a stand on a very small patch of turf: Obama is no longer talking about raising tax rates on those who make more than $250,000 a year. Gone is the tough language of his negotiating posture from last year's debate over the Bush tax cuts or the rhetoric of his speech responding to House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan's budget. Indeed, he sounded like a Republican when he argued that tax cuts were necessary to promote economic growth. Obama's demands for tax increases are puny, less than $200 billion over 10 years. That isn't much when you're talking about trying to cut $4 trillion in that same period. Republicans will argue that Obama is really asking for more tax increases as a part of the debt limit deal. Sure, by talking about a ""balanced"" approach and ""shared sacrifice,"" he'd like to shame GOP leaders into giving up more. But that's only going to get him so much. If he wanted big sweeping tax increases of the kind Republicans warn about, he'd have to make the case for them. The  president's modest aims match what his advisers say privately *: The big fight over tax increases is coming later, after the debt limit agreement is reached. That's what the presidential campaign will be about. He can't risk taking that stand now. If the economy craters as a result, it's the president, not congressional Republicans, who will pay the steeper price. That's why he framed this moment in terms of the economy, not philosophy or equity. ""What we need to do is restore business confidence and the confidence of the American people that we are on track."" Plus, Obama needs the deal to establish his credentials as someone who can cut spending. After the debt limit debate is over, and every day until Election Day, he can return to the more heated rhetoric about the philosophical differences with Republicans who refuse to increase tax rates for the most well-off. While they are enjoying their Champagne, the president's critics can have a justified grouse about his tactics at the news conference. Obama said Republican leaders were making outlandish statements in order to play to the crowd and cable-news audiences. Meanwhile, he was doing a version of the same, framing Republicans as so obsessed with protecting corporate jet owners that they were willing to send the government into default. ""If everyone is willing to take on sacred cows and do tough things to reach the goal of deficit reduction, I think it would be hard for Republicans to say [that] tax breaks for corporate jets is sufficiently important that we're not willing to get a deal done."" Which is worse? This kind of game playing, or the games House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was playing when he abandoned the debt limit talks last week? Discuss this at your July 4th parties. The president's press conference ended with another familiar tactic from the president. He called on Congress to stay in town until they came to an agreement. What was different this time was that instead of calling for adult behavior, he compared Congress unfavorably to his own children. Sasha and Malia are able to get their homework done before deadline, he said. But Congress only seems to be able to meet its vacation deadlines. ""They're in one week, they're out one week, and then they're saying, 'Obama's got to step in,' "" he said. Addressing Congress, he added: ""You need to be here. I've been here. I've been doing Afghanistan and Bin Laden and the Greek crisis. ... You stay here. Let's get it done."" The threat of a government default has so far not quickened the pace of negotiations. Maybe what they need is the threat of a delayed summer vacation. Correction,  June 30, 2011:The article originally said advisers say this publicly.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/adults_gone_wild.html	"The way Rep. Brad Miller sees it, his fellow Democrats started the debt-ceiling crisis by accident. In December, after the announcement of the deal that would temporarily keep the rates set by the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts, the vice president and the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget met with House Democrats (Miller represents North Carolina's 13th District) for the hard sell. Democrats still ran Congress, for a few more weeks, but had barely been notified of the deal; they ""had to read about it on right-wing blogs."" Tough luck: They were told they had to vote for it anyway, without more conditions, or they'd kick off a double-dip recession. ""I argued that we should not vote to extend all the Bush tax cuts,"" Miller said. He argued not to give Republicans ""everything that they would want in any potential compromise on the debt ceiling and make the discussion entirely about spending. It might have been a good idea to put in a provision that the cuts in the deal were revoked if we hit the debt ceiling. We didn't have anything like that, and I voted no. I think, with the benefit of hindsight, that was the right vote."" Were Democrats giving up leverage? Were they signing off on the GOP's ideas? The White House dismissed all that at the time. ""Once John Boehner is sworn in as speaker, then he's going to have responsibilities to govern,"" said President Obama in a December press conference. ""You can't just stand on the sidelines and be a bomb thrower."" In other words: This won't get out of hand. That assumption doesn't hold up very well in the wake of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's decision to bail on the debt-ceiling talks, with Boehner's sympathy (""I know the frustration he feels""). Sure, some grand debt compromise is possible, even if the players are increasingly, nervously discussing the impact of a possible default. But all of the discussion about a deal is happening on Republicans' turf. The issue that Cantor cited on his way out the window was tax increases. It's taken for granted that there won't be any tax increases in a deal, even though the White House wants them--even though that December tax deal moved the day of reckoning forward. The tax deal cost around $860 billion, giving up most of that in marginal tax revenue, around an eighth of it with a payroll tax cut and about one-sixteenth of it in unemployment benefits. The rationale for the deal: It would prevent an economic backslide. Now even the people who cut the deal don't think that worked. Discussion on the debt has come down to a couple of minor disagreements between Republicans. Democrats are basically sidelined, making catty comments and issuing press releases, as Republicans decide whether the deal can include the elimination of a few tax breaks--ethanol's the big one--or whether killing those breaks without lowering taxes somewhere else would be a violation of anti-tax pledges. ""It's a game of chicken,"" said Rep. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, who got most Democrats to sign on to a petition in support of a ""clean"" (no cuts, no bargains) debt limit vote, and watched that totally fail to matter. ""They have the leverage because they're saying no."" The debate's not over tax hikes--Cantor and Boehner have now ruled them out completely--but over tax breaks. Any Democratic optimism about a deal comes when hard-line Republicans say they could support ending some tax breaks without asking that their savings be applied to tax cuts. ""There's $1.2 trillion if you total the tax breaks,"" said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill. Yet ""they were never given performance criteria. You have no idea if an oil tax break works! You have no idea if a tax credit for a second home, something that wouldn't have been bought without that tax credit, creates a job. You have to deal with these tax breaks to make the math work."" And this is the progressives' only argument that doesn't involve further temporarily tax cuts, like yet another payroll-tax holiday. A little while after Cantor's announcement, Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., one of the conservatives who won his seat with the help of the Club for Growth, said he'd be willing to vote to eliminate tax breaks even if it violates the wording of Grover Norquist's anti-tax pledge.""I respect and admire Grover Norquist,"" said Lamborn. ""But I'd have to think, looking at the overall debt package, it would satisfy even the strictest tax cutter if we're cutting spending all over the place."" I posed the same question to Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. ""We're not for raising taxes, period,"" he said. ""I don't see how raising taxes is going to create jobs."" Referring to one of the tax breaks Democrats have marked for execution, he added: ""I still want someone to tell me how raising taxes on gas companies will lower gas prices."" Yet Democrats have a killer argument for debt reduction that they can't, or won't, deploy. Two months ago, a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 72 percent of Americans favored raising marginal tax rates on people making more than $250,000. Only 21 percent of Americans favored Medicare cuts; 42 percent favored defense cuts. It's a soft target that is, for some reason, politically impossible to hit. On Thursday, there was another reminder of how Democrats are finding themselves on the losing end of debt-limit politics. Chris Van Hollen, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, reminded reporters that Boehner had talked about the painful debt vote--a vote so unpopular that the party out of power often opposes it--as an ""adult moment"" for the GOP. Miller laughed at the characterization. ""I don't think this is an adult moment at all,"" he said. ""They're throwing crayons at each other."""	Debt-ceiling negotiations: Why Republicans are winning.

Rand Paul ushered in his father, Rep. Ron Paul. Sen. Jim DeMint grinned so widely you could see it from the fifth row. Sen. Orrin Hatch walked in late, strolled up to the line of senators, and stood quietly in front of a pack of conservative activists-- FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, Independent Women's Voice, Less Government. Some of them are trying to defeat him in 2012. Better take the pledge and take his chances. The pledge itself is short and radical: three lines, three promises. A signatory won't raise the debt ceiling unless there's a deal for ""substantial"" spending cuts, spending caps, and the passage of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that currently includes supermajority requirements for new tax increases. Ron Paul has signed it. Herman Cain just signed it today. ""There's an old country song that says if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything,"" said DeMint. ""That's what the American people see when they look at Congress."" That's something a few Republicans are tired of hearing. The debt-ceiling pledge is not the first blood oath offered from the conservative movement unto the GOP. It's the second one this month. Last week, the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List introduced a anti-abortion pledge and proclaimed that Republicans who didn't sign--Jon Huntsman, Cain, Mitt Romney--were more or less raspberrying the ""pro-life grass roots."" Campaigns are inundated with pledges; they get candidate questionnaires like the offices of the New Frontiersmen get unsolicited diaries from strange people. For Republicans, there are pledges to never raise taxes, pledges to repeal the estate tax (or ""death tax""), pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act. These are ways for candidates to win over interest groups. They're also traps. The attaboy you get from signing Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge comes with complementary attack ads claiming--not quite incorrectly!--that by doing so, you support ""tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas."" The two new pledges are two fat straws on a camel's back. Jennifer Rubin has opened all manner of scabs by reporting on dissent from the Susan B. Anthony List's pledge. Cain didn't sign it because he wants abortion left up to the states, and all of a sudden he's a shill for the abortion industry? How's that fair? ""Herman Cain's gone off on a tangent,"" shrugged Marilyn Musgrave, the former member of the House who runs point on the pledge for the SBA List. ""I was a candidate. I had pledges put before me. It's a commitment, so it's going to appeal to someone who's comfortable in her skin. Look, I know there are a lot of people who say they're pro-life but they've never broken a sweat on it. That's why we want people to sign a pledge."" Still, there are Republicans who resent this. Really, there aren't enough litmus tests for candidates? There aren't enough ways to trip them up and put them in the firing lines of ThinkProgress cameras? ""I would never want a presidential candidate to sign a pledge,"" said Rep. Charlie Bass, who as one of the two representatives from New Hampshire will have something to say about the party's nominee. The president will be ""the commander in chief,"" he says. ""He's going to make decisions about issues that come out of nowhere. Let's say--I'm just using this as an example--he signs a 'no war' pledge, and then we go to war? No advocacy group should be able to say, 'The president of the United States will never do something.' "" There needn't be downsides. The pledges can be useful for fights over small pieces of territory. June, the month of two new pledges, was also the month that Sen. Tom Coburn tried to show fellow Republicans a way around Norquist's pledge. The pledge, as written, binds the signatory to ""oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."" Coburn, an erstwhile member of the ""Gang of Six"" that's hammering out a debt compromise, tried a test: a vote on ending the ethanol tax credit without giving the savings back as tax cuts. The fight that ensued was reported as a victory for Coburn. His version of the ethanol amendment passed. But there was a second version, introduced by DeMint, to end the tax credit and apply the savings to--yes--tax cuts. Republicans also backed that one; they were not punished by ATR when the Coburn amendment passed. ""Every pledge taker voted against Coburn,"" said Norquist. ""Nobody broke the pledge. Our friend Coburn was trying to trick people--'Oh, you voted to end this, so now you'll support my extra trillion in tax hikes.' That's what he said happened. He knows better."" Today, after Republicans and 47 conservative groups introduced the debt-ceiling pledge, its promoters disagreed about how rigidly it needed to be enforced. Was this already a litmus test? Some candidates don't sign pledges. Huntsman says he won't sign a pledge. Sen. Mike Lee told reporters that there was a loophole. ""As long as a presidential candidate will say 'I don't support a debt limit increase, and I won't sign a debt limit increase into effect unless Congress passed a balanced budget amendment,' "" said Lee, ""that would have the same effect, as far as I'm concerned."" On his way out, reporters asked DeMint if a candidate had to sign this pledge to get his support. ""It's a deal breaker."" What if someone agrees to the concept but doesn't want to sign? ""Not enough,"" said DeMint. He slipped into an elevator, and the door closed."	Cap, Cut, and Balance pledge: Are members of Congress getting tired of signing pledges?	['Paul', 'Hatch']	['abortion']
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/crazy_popular_or_just_crazy.html	"NEW ORLEANS--This year's Republican Leadership Conference reminds me of that story about prisoners telling jokes. They have all become so familiar with the jokes that they assign them numbers. A  shout of ""Nine!"" can make everyone in the cellblock roar with laughter. But when a new guy tries it by yelling out ""Five!"" no one laughs. ""You told it wrong,"" his bunkmate tells him. At this weekend's conference, all a speaker had to do was mention a hot-button issue and the crowd would react. The greatest hits: Europeans, ATM machines, global warming advocates, Nancy Pelosi, White House czars, the Federal Reserve, Brazilian oil, and Obama apologizing for America. When Michele Bachmann announced that she was the author of the Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act, she got a standing ovation. The Republican Party is intense, fed up and worried. But until the primary process sorts itself out, activists sitting in the meat-locker temperatures of the New Orleans Hilton are frustrated in limbo: Desperate to take up the cause against President Obama, but determined not to pick someone who yells ""2012"" but tells it so wrong no one votes for the Republican. Two different approaches for success in next year's election emerged during the first two days of the conference, highlighting the central fault line in Republican politics between pragmatism and principle. This is not a new story--in politics or the Republican Party--but some of the players are new, and the stakes are high for a country whose voters are worried about the future. ""In my 42 years in presidential campaigns, this is the first time I've heard this statement,"" said Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi. ""I'm afraid my children and grandchildren are not going to inherit the country I inherited."" Barbour and other Republicans could be accused of hyperbole. The out-of-power party always tries to make the situation seem as dire as possible. But the fear he articulates animates both parties. 62 percent of the country thinks America is on the wrong track according to the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. An astounding 78 percent of the public is dissatisfied with the direction of the country, according to the Gallup poll. It's just that the two parties put the blame in different places: China, corporations, unions, Obama. Addressing this underlying worry will be the key task of the president elected in 2012. In the GOP there is agreement on the villain, but not quite on the method of deposing him. Barbour made the pragmatic case you'd expect from a former chairman of the national party.  ""Don't get hung up on purity,"" he said. ""In politics, purity is a loser."" He reminded the crowd of Ronald Reagan's saying that someone who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is your friend and ally--""he's not a 20 percent traitor."" The message was clear: Don't let a few disagreements prevent you from picking a presidential nominee who can beat Obama. Barbour was well received. So was his speech, which was full of the witticisms and the slow-rolling jokes that are his trademark. Barbour gives voters jokes they can take home in their pocket, a key skill for any successful politician. Anyone who ran their business like the federal government ""could write a book,"" Barbour said. ""And it would start with Chapter 11."" Unlike other speakers at the conference, who tended to grind the humor in with the heel of their shoe, Barbour's is merely needling: ""Obama's policy of driving up the price of energy seems to be the only policy that works."" As if to bring the opposing viewpoint in the GOP field into stark contrast, Barbour was followed by Rep. Tom McClintock of California, who argued the party would lose in 2012 if it compromised on principles. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina spoke an hour later and sounded the same theme, reminding voters of what he said last fall: ""I'd rather have 30 Republicans that believe in the principles of freedom than 60 Republicans who don't believe in anything at all."" Some in the crowd stood to applaud. DeMint noted that Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Rand Paul of Kentucky had all been elected on this theory. Barbour would agree with DeMint in principle, but might argue that where the line falls between pragmatism and principle has yet to be determined. Rep. Michele Bachmann thinks she knows. A crowd favorite, she was surfing off of the positive reviews of her New Hampshire debate performance where one poll shows she got a bump. In an era of no compromise, Bachmann presents herself as a fighter in the arena. For certain candidates it might be a liability to be a Washington politician. It isn't a liability when your message is that you are a constant irritant to business as usual. Much of the first two days of the conference were spent railing at Obama's policies. Health care reform and financial regulatory reform were the two main targets, with a big dose of irritation that Obama has not allowed sufficient exploration of domestic sources of energy. Even amid this constant stream of hyperbole, however, Bachmann stood out. ""You survived Katrina and you survived President Obama's oil-drilling moratorium,"" she said. ""There's nothing you can't survive."" Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana warned the audience late Friday to avoid too much bile. Recalling the ""shrill, absurd and negative rhetoric"" of those who hated George Bush, he said, ""We must not mimic their shallow approach."" Later, in an interview with Politico's Jonathan Martin, Jindal was more pointed: ""I think It's hypocritical to say, 'Well, it's not patriotic when they do that to President Bush but it's OK for our side to [do] it to President Obama."" Former Speaker Newt Gingrich offered the most actual ideas. Gingrich had a five-point plan for everything from taxes to energy. He would eliminate the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the nation's most liberal, allow businesses to expense all the new equipment they would buy and replace the EPA with the ESA: the ""environmental solutions agency."" Leaving aside for the moment whether any of his ideas are plausible or good, he does distinguish himself from the rest of the Republican field. He has spent time thinking (maybe that vacation was actually worth it). He has a notion of how to proceed, and some idea of how the presidency actually works. He is not timid about laying out what he wants to do with some specificity. This should be encouraged in every presidential candidate. Most are timid, waddling onstage in a Michelin Man suit of bromides and poll-tested phrases. When you're running against an incumbent, this is safe politics. House Republicans, now in the majority, proved this in the last election. Too much specificity gives people details to be unhappy about. Herman Cain knows this very well. He promises common-sense solutions, but his policy prescriptions are not deep dish. However, he does have lots of pleasing aphorisms and sayings that you can imagine would look nice on one of those motivational posters. Comparing himself, as he often does, to the aerodynamically challenged bumble bee that ""didn't get the memo"" that it wasn't supposed to be able to fly, he says: ""I didn't get the memo that I'm not supposed to run."" And then there is Rep. Ron Paul. A few minutes before taking the stage, the empty spaces in the ballroom were filled up with young, sign-wielding followers. When Cain said an attack on Israel should be considered an attack on the United States, the isolationist Paul forces booed. The establishment Republicans in seats stood to cheer and drown them out. Knowing the Paul was due to speak next, the men in blazers and women with elaborate pins trickled out of the VIP section. The hall, which had already been pretty lively, erupted into a roar. ""End the Fed!"" was the first loud chant, but it was hard to keep track as the message of personal freedom and liberty excited his crowd. (They applaud with a practiced enthusiasm that could pulverize a walnut). Paul was a roving abolitionist, singling out for elimination government regulations on milk, hemp, drugs, and abortion. He got a little wound up. Federal bureaucrats even ""get involved in education,"" he said. ""The TSA tells you what your kids can do. "" The VIP section grew very still while he talked about drug legalization and a highly limited U.S. foreign policy. When he cited Reagan to support his argument that U.S. foreign policy should be based on the simple rule that we wouldn't do anything to another country we wouldn't want done to us, it was almost too much for them. After two days filled with talk of freedom, Paul seemed like the pure form of the argument. Quoting from Samuel Adams, he defined his cause and followers as the ""irate tireless minority willing to start the brushfires of freedom in the minds of man."" Then he noted with a wry smile that ""others who are running for leadership are starting to use our language."" As if to prove his point, when DeMint took the stage he couldn't help but comment on Paul's speech. ""I used to think you were crazy, Ron,"" he said. ""But I'm starting to think I'm a little crazy myself."" Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	Republican Leadership Conference 2011: Pragmatism vs. principle.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/life_after_obama.html	"MINNEAPOLIS--The streets outside the spacious convention center and the massive downtown Hilton are filled with progressive bloggers, consultants, and hacks, walking from meetings and lunches, orange lanyards dangling around their necks. They occasionally walk past copies of Thursday's Star-Tribune, with headline in the sort of font usually reserved for celebrity deaths and declarations of small wars: ""Governor Outlines 'Painful' Shutdown."" The governor is a Democrat, Mark Dayton. The legislature is run by Republicans who won control in 2010 and who want to balance a budget with cuts that the governor opposes. They're at war, but these days, who isn't? The tone at the sixth Netroots Nation conference of progressive bloggers is not resigned and doomed. It's combative and doomed. There are big crowds for panels with titles like ""Where Crazy Comes From: Reckless Republicans in State Legislatures,"" and ""After Citizens United: Combating Corporate Power."" These rooms are so full that bloggers sit cross-legged on the floor with laptops that fulfill their anatomical promise. Meanwhile, the crowd for a panel about how political groups should lobby Congress can be counted on three hands. ""I'm glad there's not a hyper-focus on Obama,"" says Matt Osborne, a videographer and blogger from Alabama. ""I went down and filmed the new legislature in our state. It's the first Republican legislature since Reconstruction. They get power, OK. What do they do with it? They crack down on teacher's unions and pensions and they're debating an immigration law by asking whether they should 'save' the immigrants before they deport them."" He shakes his head. ""It's down the ballot where the real crazy is happening. If people want to whine about Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama--just shut up."" Osborne speaks for most of the people here. This is a national politics conference without much focus on a national goal. There is no sponsorship or booth from President Obama's re-election campaign. The biggest elected stars taking the main stage are Rep. Keith Ellison and Sen. Al Franken. Previous conferences had the speaker of the House, the majority leader of the Senate, and, in 2007, every major Democratic candidate for president. ""We've had Pelosi or Reid two of the last three years,"" says Adam Bonin, chairman of the Netroots Nation board. ""This year we wanted to have more issue-based plenary sessions, less ask-a-famous-person-a-question sessions."" In the past, Democratic candidates have flocked to this convention to meet potential staffers and donors. There are fewer now. The only one I see in person is Norman Solomon, the left-wing author who's now running for Congress if and when Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California retires. ""I'm running against an establishment, Obama Democrat,"" says Solomon. His campaign literature points out that he was an Obama delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. ""I was,"" he says. ""And I disagree with much of what he's done."" That's not new. Progressives were saying that as early as February 2009. What's new is that the activists can see a life and politics without and beyond Obama. They're at war with conservatives in this state; they're locked in battle in Alabama, Ohio, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and everywhere else Republicans gained last year. In Wisconsin, they're fighting to save civilization itself. Who are their allies? Not the White House, really. They're allied with labor unions. Every major union is present here, and the first big speeches of the weekend are given to a representative from American Federation of County, State, and Municipal Employees, and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. The AFCSME speaker introduces a video that links imagery of the civil rights movement with images of protests in Madison, all to the music of ""America the Beautiful"" sung by Aaron Neville. Weingarten gives a fist-pumping, arm-thrusting speech, taking on Republican governors by name, swatting at the movie  Waiting for Superman, and welding the angers of netroots activists with the fears of teachers. ""General Electric made $5.1 billion in profits last year but paid this much in taxes,"" she says, holding up her hand to form a zero. ""Yet in the aftermath of Gov. Walker's actions, a custodian at the University of Wisconsin will pay 16 percent more of his salary towards his health and pension. Where's the fairness? Where's the shared responsibility?"" The whack at GE is probably a result of a  New York Times story that focused on that company's fancy tax-law tricks. It has a double meaning: GE's Jeffrey Immelt was the guy Obama picked to lead his post-midterm-election jobs council. (Former Sen. Russ Feingold took on Immelt in his speech.) And Van Jones, the ex-""green jobs czar"" and patron saint of liberals torn down by Glenn Beck, is Saturday's keynote speaker. The fight's moved on from the White House. ""You do hear some people say, 'Oh, why won't Obama come to Wisconsin?'"" says Markos Moulitsas, the founder of Daily Kos (whose blog inspired this convention, although the planning has nothing to do with him). ""Why should he get involved? We're doing pretty good without Obama."" ""You've got a lot of people here who drink the Kool Aid,"" says Bob Borosage, the president of the Campaign for America's Future. ""This year looks like an effort to build from the ground up again, which is what we need."" On Thursday night, even as they weren't thinking about Obama, the Netroots activists bathed in warm nostalgia with the last presidential candidate they'd fallen in love with. Howard Dean took the stage after a video reel of supporters who said he'd brought them into politics or back into politics. He endorsed Obama quickly and then moved on. ""I don't care about the Democratic Party,"" he said. ""I'm not the DNC chair any more. I can say what I damn well please!"" It wasn't supposed to be a slap at Obama. It was a slap at the very idea that any candidate--himself included--could be trusted to do anything activists cared about. ""This is not about electing our president,"" he said. ""This is about keeping our promise to each other. Change does not come from Washington, D.C. Change comes from the bottom up."" Big applause for that. Winning now means reverse-engineering what the Tea Party did--which the Tea Party did by copying the left. Win in the school boards. Win in the states. Then work up. ""I'm all about Speaker Pelosi,"" says Moulitsas, relaxing and talking to Daily Kos's Web team. ""That's my rallying cry. The White House will take care of itself."""

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/run_anthony_run.html	"Rep. Anthony Weiner is in a tricky position. There is no evidence that he did anything illegal, but his actions--to put a good spin on it--cast serious doubt on his judgment. Worse, in an attempt to cover up his indiscretions, he lied. Still, the question lingers: Do Weiner's misdeeds require his removal from Congress? In her terse, two-sentence statement, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi pointedly did not accuse him of committing an expellable offense; she merely urged Weiner to seek help ""without the pressures of being a member of Congress."" Likewise, President Obama framed the issue in terms of effective service: ""I can tell you that if it was me, I would resign. Because public service is exactly that, it's a service to the public. And when you get to the point where, because of various personal distractions, you can't serve as effectively as you need to ... then you should probably step back."" But the president also said that ""ultimately there's going to be a decision for him and his constituents."" And perhaps therein lies our answer. Since Weiner hasn't committed a crime, and arguably has not even committed a serious ethics violation, why not let the voters decide? And the best way for him to do that is simply to resign and run in the special election that would be called to fill his seat. There is a long tradition in Anglo-American legislative practice that the voters should have the final say on ethical matters. In England in 1764, John Wilkes was expelled from the House of Commons for a series of ""scandalous"" publications. He fled to France for several years, but returned to London in 1768 and stood for Parliament. He won, but was not allowed to take his seat, and a new election was ordered. He won again, and again, and again. After his fourth consecutive victory, the House simply declared his opponent the victor. But Wilkes kept standing for election, all the time growing more popular as a symbol of public discontent at the ruling elite. ""Wilkes and Liberty!"" was a rallying cry in London and the colonies, and finally the House bowed to public pressure and seated Wilkes in 1774. Eight years later, all records of Wilkes' continued exclusions from Parliament were expunged from the House of Commons Journal ""as being subversive of the rights of the whole body of electors of this kingdom."" The Wilkes affair was understood to stand for the constitutional principle that no one should be expelled twice for the same offense--if the voters had forgiven him, who were the other members of Parliament to say no? At the time the American Constitution was drafted, all three state constitutions that contained an explicit power of expulsion (Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania) prohibited a second expulsion for the same offense. An early draft of the Constitution contained the same limitation on the congressional houses' expulsion power, but that limitation was dropped in later revisions. Still, it is widely understood that any body seeking to re-expel a re-elected member would be in serious tension with constitutional values, if not in explicit contravention of constitutional text. In 1857, Rep. Orsamus Matteson, a Whig from New York (what is it with my home state?), resigned to escape an expulsion resolution arising from corruption allegations. He promptly ran for and was re-elected to his old seat. In the debates over whether to expel him again, the Wilkes precedent was repeatedly invoked, and ultimately the House took no action. Likewise, Rep. Preston Brooks of South Carolina, who caned Sen. Charles Sumner nearly to death on the Senate floor in 1856, survived an expulsion resolution. Nevertheless, he chose to resign and seek re-election, seeking his constituents' blessing of his behavior. They gave it, re-electing him, and he was seated without controversy less than a month after he resigned. More nobly, Rep. Phil Gramm of Texas resigned his House seat in 1983 when he switched parties and won as a Republican in a special election later that year. Brooks may serve as something of a limiting example for my argument. After all, here was a pro-slavery representative from South Carolina seeking his constituents' approval for physically assaulting an abolitionist Massachusetts senator. Surely, the fact that his constituents approved should not bind the House. And, indeed, I have argued that the House can and should refuse to accept a resignation where it seeks, instead, to punish a member for unethical (or, in Brooks' case, downright brutish) conduct. We can imagine a world in which South Carolina was the only pro-slavery state, such that Brooks would have been re-elected, but there would also have been enough votes in the House to overcome the two-thirds bar for expulsion, and in that world, no constitutional values would have stood in the way of Brooks' expulsion, even after re-election. We the People of the United States are sovereign, and the representative of a small faction should not be allowed to interfere with the governance of the whole through brute force. But Anthony Weiner is no Preston Brooks. To the extent that Weiner has sinned against his wife and his marriage vows, that is a private matter. To the extent that his behavior has brought the House into disrepute, that is a public sin. But--barring the revelation of new and more disturbing facts--the sin in this case hardly warrants expulsion. Unlike, say, members who accept bribes, Weiner's behavior causes eye-rolling, not an actual loss of faith in the institution's ability to govern fairly. For bringing the House into (some) disrepute, Weiner may deserve a censure, but his behavior can hardly be said to warrant expulsion. Weiner's worst public sin is the lies he told. For those, he should do penance and seek the forgiveness of his constituents. And the best way for him to do that is to put his fate in their hands. He should offer his resignation. The House should accept it. And he should, if he still desires to be in Congress, run for his seat. He will have to humble himself; he will have to explain himself; and he will have to ask for the public's trust to be placed in him anew. And if his constituents do re-elect him, it will be because they've decided, with all of the facts on the table, that he is worthy of their trust. It will be a moment of political redemption, a vote of confidence in him from his real bosses, the people of his district. And there the matter should be left to rest."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/the_other_guys.html	"GREENFIELD, N.H.--First you notice John Burt's tie. It's a bold, money-colored green, stitched with gold letters that read ""CAPITALIST TOOL."" Burt proudly shows it off and tells the story. It was a gift from Steve Forbes, a memento after the two-time presidential candidate appeared on Burt's independent politics show. ""I interviewed him and he sent it to me personally!"" says Burt. ""I got that in the mail, and I thought: Oh, my God."" Burt's addiction to politics only got worse after that. He ran for the state legislature in 2010 on a platform of undoing years of tax hikes passed by the Granite State's ascendant Democrats and punishing the ""Republicans In Name Only."" He won, as did nearly 300 other Republican candidates for the 400-member lower House, and most of the GOP's candidates for the State Senate. The lesson from that was pretty obvious to Republicans in New Hampshire: Campaign on exactly what we think. Take Barack Obama's record apart. Say (almost) whatever you want. You'll win. Understand that, and you can understand why the voters who will winnow out their parties' nominees want them to be a hell of a lot bolder than they are now. And so as he gets ready to emcee a Flag Day picnic here for members of the Hillsborough County Republican Committee, Burt says he wants his candidates to follow the conservative movement's lead. ""I was definitely a Romney guy in 2008,"" says Burt. ""I just don't know this time. The two that I do like are [Rick] Santorum and [Tim] Pawlenty. I listen to both of them, and they speak the truth. The mistakes they make, they admit them. I'm a Tea Party guy, and we just want to hear him say, 'You're right, it wasn't the correct thing to do. We tried it in Massachusetts and it failed.' "" It's basically impossible to find a Republican primary voter who disagrees with this, even as Romney maintains a strong lead in the state. As the Hillsborough Republicans eat hamburgers and drank lemonade, the University of New Hampshire and the Boston Globe put out a poll giving Romney the backing of 41 percent of primary voters. No other candidate got out of single digits. But the same poll showed Republicans opposed to the Affordable Care Act by a 77-10 margin, and opposed to the idea of a health care mandate--an idea that grew out of the conservative movement--by a 78-17 margin. Can Romney be beaten in New Hampshire? Can he be bloodied up enough to take him down somewhere else? Maybe he can, if Republican voters here dig in on health care. The party activists in Hillsborough weren't just dug in. They'd put up lawn furniture. ""It bugs me when I see the media try to push Romney on us,"" says Stephen Lee, a local Republican chairman. He sells patriotic T-shirts and bumper stickers; he was wearing one of his own designs, reading No More [picture of a Democratic donkey]-Holes. ""I'm looking for an honest pro-American conservative. Last time we went with John McCain, and he's an honorable man, but he did not excite the base at all."" The picnickers are lucky: They're going to hear from two Republicans who live to excite them. Shortly after 12:30, Herman Cain arrives, trailed by cameras, and starts shaking hands. Everyone in the room gets the full shot of Cain charm--a grip on the shoulder, a laugh like a 727 taking off. His stump speech is all declarative sentences and optimism. He quotes the theme song that closed the 2000 Olympic games. He tells Washington not to screw up, and not to pass ""comprehensive immigration reform--Charlie!"" The ""Charlie"" is Rep. Charlie Bass, standing in the grub line. (He smiles and rolls with it; he agrees with Cain anyway.) ""I have run stuff, fixed stuff, turned stuff around, started stuff, and solved stuff,"" says Cain. ""I have a long record of stuff and I want to take it to the White House!"" One of the uncompromising state representatives has a question. Jordan Ulery asks Cain why Obama wants to appoint Elizabeth Warren to his administration, given that her expertise is in bankruptcy. Is the United States bankrupt?""Are we broke?"" asks Cain. He leans into the microphone. ""Yesssss!"" He gives his prescription for how to avoid defaulting on the debt. ""Pay the interest on the debt, so we don't default and have to pay more interest,"" says Cain. ""Pay the military and our families. Don't shortchange our fighting men and women. Send out those Social Security checks. People depend on them. Send out those Medicare bills. Then the rest is on the table. The strategy of this administration is, don't do anything, let it get close to the last minute, so they could tell the American people they have no choice."" He's a hit. Some of the people who ask him questions quickly locate Cain campaign buttons and stick them onto lapels. And that answer on the debt is a lot more than Romney's been giving--he, like congressional Republicans, is open to raising the debt ceiling if the vote comes with spending cuts. But the base is moving the game board. Ulery loved Cain's debt answer. He thinks China is planning for America to default or get so deep in hock that it loses the superpower wars. ""If you can't defeat them military, defeat them economically,"" he says. ""That's Sun Tzu."" There are a few more speeches, and some milling around, before Pawlenty can start. State GOP Chairman John Kimble reminds the crowd that defeat in this election means victory for ""socialist, European"" policies and means that the veterans who sacrificed for America had worked ""in vain."" And Pawlenty has just appeared on Fox News Sunday, where he coined the term ""Obamneycare"" to attack the law that gives Republican night terrors. He combines his speech with an attack on other candidates. It's subtle, but hard to miss, when he talks about the candidate Republicans need. ""Is this somebody whose words and deeds match up in their life?"" asks Pawlenty. ""Do they have a record not just of giving a speech, or offering a failed amendment in Congress--do they have a record of getting things done?"" After he's done, reporters press Pawlenty on ""Obamneycare"" and whether or not he's going to start opening up a front against the 40-point frontrunner. Does he not buy Mitt Romney's response to the attack--that his state plan and the federal plan aren't really comparable? ""President Obama said in his own words that he patterned Obamacare after the health care plan in Massachusetts, merged those two things together."" Same question. ""I was just making the point that the president himself embraces the Massachusetts health care plan as the blueprint for what they did with Obamacare. So I referenced and cited the president's own words in that regard."" Same question. ""I was just making the point that the president said that the Massachusetts plan was the blueprint for Obamacare."" Same question. The message gets out there, but Pawlenty isn't relishing it. That could be because he's holding his ammo for the debate, or it could be that he wants to dodge the sand trap that candidates like Fred Thompson have ended up in--becoming known for attacks and nothing else. There's a promised land for these candidates, in which Mitt Romney is reeling from voter anger over the health care bill, over assault weapons (to pick another issue a Greenfield Republican raised with me), over his record. How do you get there? ""There are too many candidates,"" shrugs one activist as he sips a lemonade. ""It's hard to settle.""

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/is_iowa_important.html	"In presidential campaigns, we learn where candidates stand on the issues, but we also learn whether they have the attributes necessary for the office. (We've learned that Newt Gingrich has trouble with staff, for example.) One of the things a president must know is when to stand by his plan and when to adapt based on new information--and that includes knowing when to feed the media and when to ignore the pundits. For Mitt Romney, the Iowa caucuses are a test of these attributes. Romney spent a lot of time and money in Iowa during the 2008 campaign. He came in second. This time, he says, he's going to run a lean campaign. Iowa GOP veterans read that to mean that Romney will try to do enough in the state to stay viable for future states where he's stronger but not risk time and resources that he can spend elsewhere. Focus too much on Iowa, and he'll raise expectations in Iowa, which would set up a repeat of what happened in 2008. Thursday Romney put that plan into action. His campaign announced that he would not be participating in the Iowa straw poll in August. In the Iowa Republican political family this is the equivalent of saying you're not coming to Thanksgiving dinner. An informal vote, it is seen as an early test of a candidate's organizing skills. It builds hype for the caucuses and raises money for the party. Last time he ran, Romney said the straw poll was key to the campaign; now he says it's not. Already rival campaigns are offering this as another instance in which Romney changes his mind to suit the moment. This Iowa slow roll strategy is based in part on the idea that Iowa voters are too socially conservative for Romney. That's why Mike Huckabee won in 2008. It's why Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson came in second in 1988. In 2010, these voters mobilized to defeat three judges from the state Supreme Court in retaliation for a 2009 ruling that legalized gay marriage. But this might be a caricature that masks an electorate more favorable to Romney. The leadership test for Romney is whether he can accurately evaluate the opportunity in Iowa. Many of the experts in the state are biased: They all want him to participate, because it adds to the greater glory of the Iowa first-in-the-nation process, which they all want to maintain regardless of which candidate they support. The political press, both in Iowa and nationally, wants a race in as many places as possible. That might affect the number of stories that suggest Romney is making a mistake by not competing fully. There are a lot of evangelical voters in Iowa. Sixty percent of those who participated in the last caucus in 2008 identified themselves that way. The longstanding question in Republican campaigns is just how many of those voters are going to make their final choice based on social issues. Republican strategists I talked to this week (the caveat from the previous paragraph applies) argue that the weak economy and Obama's vulnerability mean that social conservatives are in a transactional and not ideological mood. They are focused on a candidate who can address their concerns about jobs and the deficit and on someone who can defeat the incumbent. Those are the things Romney is running on. Gov. Terry Branstad uses his recent campaign as proof that the state is more diverse than the caricature. ""Social conservatives are concerned about [abortion] and marriage, but they're also concerned about fiscal responsibility. I ran against someone who was clearly identified as a militant on the social issues, and yet the people of Iowa voted for me. Evangelicals voted for me because they know that I am pro-life, but they also know that as governor I would focus on the things most important to the state."" Branstad's Republican opponent in 2010, Bob Vander Plaats, agrees. Social conservatives want to know a candidate shares their positions on key issues, says Vander Plaats, who supported Huckabee in Iowa in 2008. But ""the main conversation they want to have is, 'Now let's talk about the economy and the size of government.' "" But even if Romney doesn't buy the idea that social conservatives are more available to him than they were last time around, there is the other big chunk of the electorate--for lack of a better term, we'll call them the nonsocial conservatives--that should be his for the taking. In 2008, Huckabee was able to capture the social conservative vote and let the other candidates--Romney, John McCain, Fred Thompson, and Rudy Giuliani--fight for the nonsocials. The situation is now reversed, with Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, and Tim Pawlenty all going making a play for the Huckabee constituency that leaves the rest open for Romney. The non-Huckabee vote in 2008 was about 54 percent of the vote. The issue terrain in Iowa looks good for Romney, and the electorate is there for him. If Romney decides to participate more fully in Iowa, and does well there, that would set up a powerful one-two punch: The New Hampshire primary is just eight days later, and Romney has real strength there. But if he doesn't work hard enough and Pawlenty does well, that could cause problems for Romney outside of Iowa. If the Iowa caucus turns on economic issues, Pawlenty, who is working the state hard, can make the case that Barack Obama did in 2008: Iowa is a reflection of the rest of the country. Pawlenty can claim that the state evaluated his positions on the key issues of the day--not merely the parochial farm issues or narrow debates about values--and liked what he offered. Evaluating the reality on the ground in Iowa is one task for Romney. He also has to figure out the irritatingly vague question of how the political press sees the race in Iowa. If the press decides it is a bellwether state full of deep significance, it will help the candidates that do well there. Or stories will start to appear about how Romney, as the frontrunner who beats Obama in the polls, should really be competing in the state. Yet any president--any good citizen for that matter--needs to know when to ignore the political press. Whether it's right, wrong, or just overexcited, it shouldn't affect your strategy. It might be wise for Romney to ignore the pull of Iowa and keep his focus on the long game and other states. But it will be hard, because the donors who write large checks will be susceptible to the influence of the chatter. Hillary Clinton also wrestled with how much to commit to Iowa, starting slow and then pouring it on in the end. That is what some people think Romney might try to do, deciding in the fall that he can swoop in. It didn't work for Hillary Clinton, but she faced a far more formidable field in the state. If Romney wants to go this route, he'll have to hope that his competitors don't improve while he's making up his mind. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/gop_to_palin_its_over.html	"DES MOINES--Sarah Palin says George Washington is her favorite founder because he was reluctant to serve but answered the call of duty. She likes to think of herself this way, answering the needs of a clamoring electorate. That is part of the cinematic beauty of her bus tour: The crowds that greet her can represent that call to take up their standard and head into presidential battle on their behalf. There's only one problem: The call isn't coming. That's the clear message in a new CBS News poll of the Republican field. Taken after the Palin bus tour started rolling, it asked Republicans whether Palin should run. By a 20-point margin (54 percent to 34 percent), Republicans said she should not run. Among Tea Party supporters, where Palin has her strongest following, she is also waved off against a run. Half say she should not run; 38 percent say she should. That isn't so much a referendum on her bus tour as it is a sign that the entire months-long Palin flirtation with the presidency is not creating an appetite. The biggest challenge to a Palin candidacy has always been that her image within her own party has been getting worse.  (If she can't improve among her friends, she isn't going to improve in the wider circle of voters). Some 36 percent of Republican voters have an unfavorable view of her, compared with the 37 percent that have a favorable view. Her favorability rating has declined since April. Why? Some of the reluctance may be that voters don't think Palin is qualified. Almost two of five Republicans say this in a recent Washington Post poll. Interviews suggest some who really like Palin think she'll never get a fair shake from the media, making the presidential race a distracting nightmare. Others cite her poll numbers in the general electorate, where her unfavorable numbers are at toxic heights. Then there are what we seasoned political reporters like to call ""the facts on the ground."" I've been in Iowa the last few days, and voters and activists here are in a shuffle-the-cards mode. They cycle through all the candidates, even the ones far back in the polls like Rick Santorum. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has come up several times, even though he's only rumored to be thinking about considering getting in the race. Herman Cain is getting a lot of buzz. People like that he's not a politician, which means both that he didn't hold a Washington job but also that he's not a polished guy who's always trying to pitch you something. In all my conversations, no one brought up Palin--either as the answer to the presidential puzzle or as a question mark worth waiting for, like Perry. If Palin wants to campaign in Iowa her time is running out. Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, says any candidate who wants to get in has to do so this month or next. Branstad wants a long campaign with a lot of candidates--partly to help build the party, but also because it's good for his state economy. Still, he speaks to a truth everyone in Iowa politics believes: Popularity alone won't get voters to the caucuses in January. George W. Bush waited until June 1999 to make his first visit to the state as a candidate, but he also had an organization already built and in place. ""Every Republican candidate will have to run a 99-county campaign,"" says Branstad. ""This isn't like the Democratic race where you can just visit the big cities."" Palin also faces another problem in Iowa. Michele Bachmann, an Iowa native, is challenging her among Tea Party members and movement conservatives. This is Palin's base. And Bachmann's campaign manager, Ed Rollins, says she will ""be so much more substantive"" than Palin. ""People are going to say, 'I gotta make a choice and go with the intelligent woman who's every bit as attractive,' "" he says. This isn't coming from the lamestream media or a member of the GOP establishment like Karl Rove: Rollins worked for Mike Huckabee in 2007 and managed the Reagan re-election campaign in 1984. Palin is going to have to compete hard, and the competition might not be delicate. Sarah Palin has shown a laudable imperviousness to conventional wisdom. Perhaps the grim developments in the face of her latest public bus tour may only spur her interest in running to prove that she can not only show the pundits she's right but that she can defy political gravity.

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/kernel_of_truth.html	"DES MOINES--Iowans think of themselves as particularly discerning voters. They like to tell reporters how they like to meet candidates a few times before coming to an opinion--on this trip I hadn't even gotten to my rental car before someone made this point--and candidates tell this story back to voters at nearly every stop as a way of buttering them up. But Iowa also has another political truth that is supposed to be equally iron-clad: Voters are so wedded to ethanol subsidies that if you oppose them, it won't matter how many times you shake a voter's hand and look him in the eye--he won't support you. The first truth may be overblown, and the second one is wrong, or at least more complicated than portrayed. The politics of ethanol have changed in Iowa from the days when ethanol was regarded as some kind of newfangled invention. Unwavering support for ethanol tax credit is no longer the secret password required for success in Republican politics. You wouldn't know this from the Republican candidates running for president. Two weeks ago, Tim Pawlenty came to Iowa to announce his candidacy and call for the phasing out of ethanol subsidies. He said it was a sign of the hard truths he was willing to tell the voters. Ambassador Jon Huntsman said it wasn't even worth campaigning in Iowa because he opposes the subsidy, and as a result voters won't even consider him. ""I understand how the politics work there,"" he said. Mitt Romney said he supported the subsidies and was quickly denounced by former Sen. John Sununu of New Hampshire for ""pandering"" to voters. Rush Limbaugh said Pawlenty was ""politically gutsy"" for his stance on the corn-based fuel. He stood before the voters of the corn-growing state and told them something they didn't want to hear. But how brave was it? It is the mainstream Republican position in Iowa that ethanol subsidies must be phased out. Chuck Grassley, the state's senior senator, has authored legislation that calls for a gradual decrease in the subsidy. The state's Republican governor and the state's agriculture commissioner support the reduction. Even the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association--also known as the ethanol lobby--supports this position. ""It used to be if you were for ethanol you were for the VEETC,"" said Monte Shaw of IRFA, using the shorthand for the main ethanol subsidy. ""Today you can be for ethanol and want to see VEETC go away."" Candidate Obama regularly claimed he would tell hard truths on the campaign trail but he never much did it. Pawlenty may be following the same model. But he does win some points for bravery, however. ""The truth about federal energy subsidies, including federal subsidies for ethanol, is that they have to be phased out,"" he said. So Pawlenty wasn't just aiming at the $6 billion-a-year ethanol subsidy but all energy subsidies, including those for oil and solar and wind. Depending on what you define as a subsidy that could total anywhere from $17 billion, the conservative government estimate, to $50 billion, the estimate made by Doug Koplow, a specialist in energy subsides at Earthtrack in Cambridge, Mass. That's just fine with the Iowa ethanol lobby. ""Iowans look forward to Gov. Pawlenty further detailing his plans to 'phase out' petroleum subsidies, perhaps in a speech in Houston, Texas,"" said Walt Wendland, president of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, in a press release. To figure out Republican candidates' positions on ethanol subsidies requires a familiarity with the federal budget that most Americans simply don't have. Ethanol production receives different kinds of help. The subsidy with the direct effect on the federal budget (and therefore the most political potency in the era of the deficit-obsessed Tea Party) is the 45-cent blender's tax credit. Known formally as the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC), it costs $6 billion a year and is scheduled to disappear this year. The bravest position would be to allow the tax credit simply to expire on schedule. That's the position of Rep. Ron Paul. That's Sen. Tom Coburn's position. It's not Pawlenty's position. He said the phase-out ""can't be done overnight because companies have invested a lot."" His call for a gradual phase-out is in keeping with the spirit of what Grassley and the state's leadership have proposed. Romney, meanwhile, is being attacked as a panderer for saying he supports ethanol subsidies, but his position on it is almost indistinguishable from Pawlenty's. In his book  No Apology, Romney articulates the Iowa Republican position: Subsidies were necessary for ethanol in its infancy, ""but we should acknowledge that subsidies for one form of energy also discourage investment in alternatives that don't receive subsidies, which may undermine innovation. And because taxpayers ultimately have to pick up the tab for government spending, subsidies are in fact a hidden form of energy tax. Once an industry is up and running, the disadvantages of subsidies outweigh their benefits."" Huntsman doesn't have to bother with the complexity. His campaign doesn't want to compete in Iowa. Its higher share of evangelical voters are suspicious of him, and candidates like Romney and Pawlenty have better organizations here. Ethanol offers him a way to write off the state and limit the political damage for doing so. Republicans in Iowa want him to pay for this. They want every candidate to compete out here; it's good business for the state. They're also insulted. They like to think of themselves as the guardians of democracy, but Huntsman is saying that they're hacks. ""He doesn't know the state of Iowa, he obviously doesn't know about ethanol,"" says Gov. Terry Branstad. ""I think he's making a huge mistake. I think he's been in China too long."" The tax credit for blending ethanol isn't the only help ethanol producers receive. The federal government mandates a certain level of ethanol production. There is also a tariff that promotes domestic production and discourages low-cost ethanol imports. Ethanol critics like Sununu say this hits consumers in their wallets, but these measures have no effect on the federal budget. Other conservatives like Paul argue on philosophical grounds that mandates distort the market. Pawlenty, who aspires to ethanol courage on the subsidy, supports mandating the use of ethanol, however. As governor of Minnesota, he signed legislation that mandated that ethanol be used in 20 percent of all gas in the state. There are other arguments against the production of ethanol that have nothing to do with the subsidy: It won't lead to energy independence, and it makes it harder to deliver gasoline across the country. No one in the Republican field is making those arguments here. A candidate who did that wouldn't get points for being brave--he'd just be dumb.

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/a_whole_new_obama_myth.html	"Dan Warren liked Barack Obama. There was his political philosophy, sure. There was also something about the candidate's voice, something Warren had noticed while listening to his audiobook version of  Dreams From My Father in 2007. ""Obama had this habit of doing very grandiose, epic language, for day-to-day struggles or minor things that happened in his childhood,"" says Warren. ""And I realized: This is the language of an epic story, even though it's not an epic story. There really is enough of that language to tell another story altogether."" Over the next four years, Warren did just that. Obama's soothing, clipped baritone became the basis for a 32-minute audio fable titled  Son of Strelka, Son of God. (Strelka was one of the Soviet dogs sent into space.) It is possibly the strangest-ever use of the Obama brand. (I say this allowing for the Obama Chia Pet, the ""Head of State"" sex toy, and anything will.i.am has attacked with an auto-tune program and a Fergie solo vocal.) Warren, a 39-year old scientist who ""works at the interface of evolution and ecology,"" has out-weirded them all. In it--I will try to limit the spoilers--a demigod is born from a fruit tree, sets about creating the world, and eventually mates with a human woman to produce a son, called Stanley. ""I was different, after all,"" explains the god-child. ""A big yellow dog with a baleful howl, the body of a man, with well-defined thoughts."" Stanley's journey is marked by armies of singing children, talking creatures with beating wings, wise Buddha, and apocalypses of falling buildings and burning skies. It's even weirder than it sounds. Warren, who also sells his own music, developed soundtracks for every chapter.  He and his wife, Teresa Iglesias *, recorded birds and fauna when they traveled to Australia and New Zealand. (Both live in Austin.) His friend Jon Bernstein * rode BART trains in the Bay Area and taped the ambience of the shutting doors and honking horns. ""There's percussion in there that's me banging all the pots and pans from my kitchen,"" says Warren. ""When you hear that loud rooooar of the animal screaming, that's one of my cats caterwauling, like they do."" He needed the horrifying noises, just like he needed the sad plucked banjo notes and creepy minor chords, because he was telling an end-of-days story. This was what Obama's overwrought prose suggested to him--something like  Earth Abides or  Farnham's Freehold or one of the other apocalypse tales he used to like. He could grab phrases from descriptions of Indonesian wildlife and urban bustle and marry them to metaphors from Chicago, and come up things like this description of a terrifying beast whose arrival augers the cataclysm:"	Son of Strelka, Son of God: Obama narrates a new creation myth.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/stimulus_rip.html	"The stimulus bill passed more than two years ago, when Dave Obey still chaired the House appropriations committee. Obey's now retired from Congress, working as a lobbyist, but he talks about the stimulus fight as if it's still going on. Which, in many ways, it is--only now the battle is to convince people that it wasn't failure. ""This is the era of 24-hour news cycles,"" said Obey, who represented Wisconsin's 7th district for 42 years before retiring in 2011. ""You can have 95 percent of what you do make perfect sense, but when networks are starved for news, and politicians are starved for attention, all you need is one example of something going wrong and it's easy for demagogues to discredit what you're doing. It's like what Donald Rumsfeld said about terrorism. In order to be successful, we had to stop 100 percent of terrorist attacks. If you're a terrorist you only need to get it right once."" Veterans of the stimulus wars talk about it that way--as a war. They lost. The implication of the loss is that Keynesian economics are, arguably, as discredited with voters as neoconservative theories were discredited when the invasion of Iraq failed to turn its neighbors into vibrant democracies, highways clogged with female drivers. This week, we got a concrete example of what it meant to lose. The Weekly Standard published a back-of-the-cocktail-napkin analysis of the seventh quarterly report on the stimulus, stipulating that every job created by its spending has cost $278,000. Republicans, who'd previously said the stimulus created no jobs, immediately started repeating the $278,000 figure. They kept doing it even after the magazine followed up, suggesting that the cost-per-job could have been as low as $185,000. $278,000, $185,000. $0.00? It didn't really matter, because the White House and liberal response was perfunctory. As the stimulus winds down, with most of the money spent, everyone knows that it failed. This is a little strange. Yes, the economy is rotten, so voters can be excused when they pan the government's response to unemployment. But there's a lot of data that isn't terribly hard to read suggesting that the stimulus did create jobs. The analysis that the Weekly Standard tore apart found that the stimulus increased employment by about 400,000 jobs in the first quarter after it went into effect, and increased it by about 2.7 million at its peak. If you're deriding the price tag for those jobs, you're acknowledging that the jobs exist. Did the stimulus do less than President Obama said it would? Absolutely. In the first months of 2009, when the president sold the bill, got it passed, and defended it, he tossed off predictions for job growth that got progressively higher and were never matched. At his most optimistic, he said the stimulus would be a success if it ""created or saved"" 4 million jobs. It fell far short of that. But ambitious, expensive bills have fallen short before, and it hasn't discredited their reasons to exist. George W. Bush's tax cuts were supposed to balance the budget by 2010. That hasn't happened, obviously, but tax cuts have not been discredited--in fact, they're central to the discussion about how to dig out of the recession now. Tax cuts are popular. When CNN polled public opinion of the stimulus in January 2010, it found that 56 percent of Americans flat-out opposed it, and 63 percent of them thought most of the funding had been included for ""purely political reasons."" A little while later, a CBS poll found that only 6 percent of people thought the stimulus created any jobs. The people who wrote and defended the stimulus blame bad messaging. ""The president was never able to explain to the public that the debt and deficits being run up were not an accident,"" said Obey. ""It was purposeful, but the administration never took on the core debate of why we had to borrow money in the short term, even though in the long term we had to pay it back. They didn't explain it, which led people to believe we were throwing money at a wall and seeing what stuck. The country needed to be re-educated about the Great Depression and the role deficit spending played in getting out of it. It needed to be told the story of 1937, when FDR prematurely pulled back from stimulating the economy."" This is what people who lose a political argument always say: We didn't get our message out. But in this case it's true. The demand-side spending argument was part of the stimulus sales pitch, but not the biggest part. When House Republicans unanimously voted against it, Democrats attacked them for their crime against ""bipartisanship,"" and for opposing the tax cuts that made up about $280 billion of the package. Those tax cuts allowed Obama to fulfill a campaign pledge to give ""a tax cut to 95 percent of Americans."" The spending was more stimulative than the tax cut. The White House just didn't convince people of that. So Keynesians started the stimulus debate in a hole, and it got deeper as watchdogs and Republicans looked for waste, frivolity, or anything that sounded like waste or frivolity. It didn't really work. When Obey uses the 95-percent-of-what-we-did-was-good line, he's hinting at how the worst-sounding stimulus projects defined the enterprise. ""Our Waterloo on this was the quote-unquote 'non-existent congressional district' problem,"" said Ron Klain, the former chief of staff to Joe Biden, who helped manage the effort to spot dumb-looking spending. A few hundred of the first reports on how money was being spent--a few hundred of about 90,000--misreported the details, showing spending in congressional districts that did not exist. The projects were real, the jobs were real, but there is no 57th district in Minnesota or 22nd in New Mexico. Someone had put the wrong number on a form. Still, those fictitious districts were the story. ""We had a week of stories taking us apart on TheColbert Report and what not,"" sighed Klain. The end result of stories like that has been a virtual collapse in the belief that government spending can spur economic growth. This week, which ended with a jobs report that points in big, flashing arrows to more recession, will change nobody's mind about the need for spending cuts. When I asked Sen. John McCain whether spending cuts should be approached with caution about the impact they'd have on employment, he rejected the premise. ""The people I rely on say that spending cuts are vital to the future of our country,"" he said, ""because we don't want to emulate Greece. If we emulate Greece, then we have huge unemployment."" But was it a problem that the stimulus money was running out? ""We just learned, apparently, that the stimulus package was only $278,000 per job,"" said McCain. ""We certainly can't keep that up."""

When Boehner suggested that Obama's policies were making the business community nervous, the usually cool Obama lost it a little. ""The president didn't like it,"" Boehner recounted in a speech last year. ""He looked at me, he slapped the table, and said, 'Boehner, it's not my policies that are paralyzing the employers. It's you Republicans who are scaring them.' "" Boehner and Obama held another meeting Thursday, along with congressional leaders of both parties. Boehner is now the speaker of the House, and the relationship between the two men has warmed. Like men of a bygone era, Obama and Boehner are now holding secret meetings in the White House. On Sunday the two met as a part of a mini-breakthrough in talks over raising the debt ceiling. In private the president says that Boehner reminds him of the Republicans he worked with in Springfield as a state legislator, the kind of Republicans he played poker with on Wednesday nights. There's a long way to go before a deal on the debt limit. But if it happens, the story of how Obama and Boehner learned to deal with each other will be at the heart of it. In the Saturday-serial narrative of this drama, the stage of gloom and doom has lifted momentarily to suggest that a deal even larger than imagined might be possible. Instead of $2 trillion in spending reductions over 10 years the White House is now suggesting that as much as $3 trillion to $4 trillion in reductions might be possible. Of course, the clouds will come and go a few more times in this story. And as in previous negotiations, what's said outside the negotiating room may have little to do with what's going on inside. Each side is trying to shape the public story in order to put pressure on their opponent at the negotiating table. Each is also playing to its base to establish toughness in advance of a deal that might leave it open to charges of capitulation. Finally, there's the elephant-and-the-blind-man problem: There are so many moving and interconnected parts to this grand bargain that fierce disagreements over the description of one area do not give a clear description of the larger animal. That brings us to tax increases. As previously discussed, in the end if there is a deal it may hinge on the definition of the phrase ""tax increase."" A deal of the size the president is talking about would require significant revenue from an increase in tax rates on those who make more than $250,000. This is not likely to happen. Even if Boehner buckled, it would be hard for Republicans to find 218 votes for it in the House. The president knows this. But by talking about a big deal, he can say he was willing to make big spending cuts even in popular Democratic programs like Social Security and Medicare, but Republicans were just too committed to tax breaks for the rich. This is theater for 2012. The president needs to show independents and moderates that he's serious about spending reductions. Republicans are happy to let him act this out, just as he's happy to let them play to their political needs (in this case, proving to their conservative base how hard they are fighting anything that might plausibly be called a ""tax increase""). It's possible for there to be theater and progress at the same time. The second, and more likely, option would allow the government to raise some revenue from loophole closures as part of a deal that would reduce the deficit by about $2.5 trillion over a decade. The president would be able to say that he reduced spending and spared some programs, while Republicans would be able to say that they prevented any increase in the tax rate. Both sides would agree to disagree on how much was really raised from ""tax increases,"" or even whether to call them that. Adding to the complexity is recent talk from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who has said he would accept closing loopholes if taxes went down somewhere else--so that in the end, there would be no net tax increase. This would require some accounting creativity, both on its own terms and in order to make this deal contribute to the larger goal of deficit reduction. It would work like this: Tax cuts, like the annual reduction in the alternative minimum tax, would be counted toward the total deficit reduction target of between $2.5 trillion and $4 trillion--which is to say, they would add to it. To pay for those tax cuts that add to the deficit, tax ""increases""--which is to say, the closing of some loopholes--would be allowed somewhere else. The net effect would be no new taxes, but deal makers would be able to say that future tax cuts were paid for and thereby reduced the deficit. According to one Republican source, in his meeting Thursday the president polled the room on which option each preferred. (He also included the so-called ""mini-deal"" of smaller spending reductions.) The president said he would not sign a deal that did not cover the 2012 election. Another meeting is scheduled for Sunday. There is a long way to go before a deal gets done. But both sides seem to be cautiously optimistic that it will happen in the next 10 days. Work is actually getting done. Even as they were publicly denouncing the White House for not being serious about deficit reduction, GOP leaders were privately saying that Vice President Joe Biden was working in good faith to come to an agreement. After today's meeting at the White House, it was notable that--for at least one news cycle-- Republicans had even dropped their public charge that the president wasn't being serious. There will be many more meetings between the president and the speaker. And then each man will have to try to sell the deal to his side. Obama has the easier task--Democrats in the end can't undermine their leader. Boehner, according to one Hill source, is faced with a caucus split in thirds. One third won't ever vote for a debt limit increase; another will follow him wherever he leads; and the final third will need to be persuaded. That's the group both Boehner and Obama are working toward pleasing to get to 218 votes necessary in the House. If they can work this one out, they'll deserve their next golf outing together. The chain smoker and the ex-smoker may even deserve to celebrate the achievement with a Rose Garden cigarette.Become a fan of  John Dickerson on Facebook."

Former Sen. Alan Simpson, the co-chairman of the president's bipartisan fiscal reform commission, is standing a few steps away from me. I start to ask him about the debt-ceiling debate, which was just discussed by President Obama in a morning press conference, but Walter Isaacson, the president and CEO of the Aspen Institute, has spotted the senator and walked right over. ""Here's a smooth-talking son of a bitch!"" says Simpson, with admiration. Isaacson rolls with it. ""You've got to start being a smooth son of a bitch about your deficit commission!"" he says. ""We've got to keep selling it!"" This was what Simpson wanted to talk about. ""Bill Clinton works Obama over on this baby about once a week,"" he says. ""He went into there and said, 'God, if I'd appointed a commission, and five Democrats and five Republicans and an independent come out with a recommendation, I'd have taken that in a minute!'"" We spend the next 10 minutes hashing out the politics and listening to Simpson hit his expletives-per-minute quota. Between the expletives he describes a world of bipartisan compromise--of AARP backing down on Social Security, of Grover Norquist backing down on tax hikes. ""Republicans can't be in thrall to him!"" says Simpson. He comes back to the debt debate, the last best hope for compromise, and explains how Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner--""tough little guy""--can broker a deal. He offers a script: If you think I'm shitting ya, I've raided every pirate cove, torn up all the gold crates, and this is it--Aug 2. ""If it wasn't for that,"" says Simpson, ""this would be the same old shit."" This is the mood--call it optimistic desperation, or maybe desperate optimism--that pervades Aspen, where I arrived Monday. Politico has dubbed the event ""D.C.'s summer camp."" Happily, very little of the content, and few of the luminaries, are intimately connected with politics. That said, I see no reason why a political celebrity would want to pass this up. This is the sort of place where people smile and show off blurry cell phone photos that they've captured of Alan Greenspan or Michael Chertoff as they strolled over to the Greenwald Tent or the Koch Building. (The Koch Building--yes, donated by David, who owns a home nearby--has a seemingly endless supply of Pepsi Max.) The people on the Aspen campus this week pay attention to politics, but they have slightly different attitudes. The first is boundless optimism. Think-tankers and sustainability pioneers and representatives talk up the investors they've got and the interest they're generating. Panels on ""green jobs"" and education reform and food policy are packed. There's a good reason for this. If you're interested in making money, the sticky political status of these issues isn't necessarily good. But it's something you can deal with. After one session, I picked up a helpful, glossy brochure from Ernst & Young, titled ""Action Amid Uncertainty: The Business Response to Climate Change"" (PDF). It finds that ""despite regulatory uncertainty, climate change investment is on the rise,"" and that ""the majority of companies surveyed [internationally] say they are committed to investing in climate change initiatives in 2010, and they are interested in adopting innovative approaches to product and service development."" So Congress can't pass a comprehensive cap-and-trade bill? So Republicans are putting their hands on their hearts and pledging that climate change is a hoax? The safe bets are still on regulation and green energy, still. And then there's the second view of politics in Aspen: Despair. The crowd here is not monolithically liberal, but it is monolithically disappointed in Obama. The disappointments change from subject to subject. Phil Beck, a Republican lawyer from Chicago, says Obama ""squandered an opportunity to pass some really effective legislation"" and ""handed it off to Reid and Pelosi."" Martha Jackson, whose husband's company develops oil deals in South America, says Obama has prolonged the war in Afghanistan more than she would have liked. How can he turn things around? ""He can win a second term,"" she says. This was the tenor of a lot of Obama critiques. On Tuesday afternoon, David Axelrod took a friendly shellacking from Time's Joe Klein about all the opportunities Obama had missed. The attendees agreed with Klein--to a point. Their questions, about Obama's economic appointments and about his messaging problems, all began with some variation of ""I'm going to vote for Obama again, and work for him, but ..."" No one expressed that worried ambivalence quite like Feisal Abdul Rauf. I walked with the president of the Cordoba Initiative, the martyr of the ""Ground Zero Mega-Mosque"" tempest, when he was on his way to see Axelrod. Rauf had gotten only the least helpful of assists from Obama, back when the heat was on--a comment that opposed the furor over the project, followed by a walkback about he, Barack Obama, was agnostic on whether it should be built. Was that really so good for the cause, I asked? ""He has to worry about winning an election,"" Rauf said with a shrug. Rauf caught Axelrod, and handed me his empty cup of tea so he could rustle up his business card. He walked up to Obama's strategist and gave him some advice. ""Just win the election in 2012!"" There's desperation where there used to be hope. No one here still believes Obama can engineer great change. He's what we've got; he's offering more than the Republicans. The most realistic ideas about what can be done politically are predicated on what Washington will be forced to do by crisis. Which takes us back to Simpson. The Aspen consensus is that bipartisan fiscal reform needs to happen--it must be willed into existence, and a critical mass of smart people could help. After Isaacson departs, Simpson is buttonholed by someone else, someone who wants to bring him and Erskine Bowles together to speak at the Council of Foreign Relations. Sooner or later, the Washington consensus will be replaced by the Aspen consensus. If Washington is going to keep dealing with political crises, forced upon them by stasis, the city will eventually listen to the bipartisans. It has to, doesn't it? ""We're at 15 percent revenue, and historically it's been closer to 20 percent,"" says Simpson. ""We've never had a war without a tax, and now we've got two,"" he says. ""Absolute bullshit."""

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/pravda_will_set_you_free.html	"Alyona Minkovski is  on a rant. The rants are essential parts of  The Alyona Show,"" the series she's hosted on Russia Today--  RT, if you please--since 2009. They can be about anything, but they are usually about the rest of the media. This particular rant is about the New York Times and the Washington Post, ""two major newspapers who won award after award for their hard-hitting journalism,"" and who, that day, were crowdsourcing an investigation of Sarah Palin's email archives from her time as Alaska's governor. This wins them a spot on Minkovski's regular feature, ""Tool Time."" ""Why do they need help covering a nonstory?"" Minkovski asks. ""Sarah Palin quit her job, sold out for fame and fortune, and has spent the last two years making a living by criticizing others. Who cares about her e-mails? Why does the media continue to force coverage of Sarah Palin on us?"" She rolls a clip, a Daily Show-esque rundown of cable news anchors frothing over the Palin trove, making themselves look like fools. As she talks, stage right, one of RT's other hosts, Adam Kokesh, finishes taping his show and walks through the studio, catching up with reporters. He's just finished talking to viewers about the health risks of sitting all day at a desk, arsenic levels in FDA-approved chicken, and the goings-on at the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group. He has stripped down quickly to jeans and a tank top get-up that reveals his biceps and tattoos. Stage left, the liberal radio host Thom Hartmann, primly dressed and radiating calm, is putting together notes for his own show, which will consist largely of an interview with exited White House economist Jared Bernstein. This is Friday for the strangest prime time news line-up on cable television. It's a block of TV news that's professionally produced, widely distributed--20 million American cable subscribers can watch it if they like--and basically immune to market forces. In 2005 RT was hatched, as the Columbia Journalism Review put it, as ""a soft-power tool to improve Russia's image abroad, to counter the anti-Russian bias the Kremlin saw in the Western media."" Reset button or no, we Americans are not the biggest fans of Russian propaganda. When RT first drew attention here, it was for its coverage of the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, which portrayed the small republic of 4.6 million people as the aggressor. (One fairly typical segment featured an interview with an American in South Ossetia who blamed America for the violence.) Its coverage of American politics was heavy on interviews with fringe experts and third party candidates; frequent on-air experts included radio host Alex Jones and newsletter reporter Wayne Madsen, who'd discuss too-good-to-check stories about the origins of the swine flu and why WTC Building 7 fell on 9/11. A couple of years later, the network has a bureau of 70 people in downtown Washington, including veterans of CNN and NBC News; it gets credible guests from places like Talking Points Memo, Reason, the Cato Institute, and the Washington Examiner. Before he got his own show on MSNBC, Cenk Uygur would go on these shows to riff on the news. Talking out of turn, and not for attribution, these guests have no idea what to make of RT's regular content (""it's always some truther crap""). But the network's most visible, popular presence in Washington is that evening line-up. A watcher of RT always got the impression that America was irrational, oppressive, frivolous and in trouble; a watcher of the prime-time line-up gets the same impression, but it's different somehow. It's somewhere between Jon Stewart's monologue and the world that Rowdy Roddy Piper sees when he puts on those special sunglasses in  They Live. Hartmann's show is the most conventional, and his deal with RT is the most independent. He'd previously appeared on the network as a guest, and they offered him space to film and distribute his series, ""The Big Picture."" ""I can tell ya, we're putting together the same show we've been putting together for years,"" says Hartmann. ""The question of what would Russia want from my show? That was never part of the discussion. I think they liked that it would draw eyeballs, that it was good programming. This is just a guess, because I'm not privy to their inside thinking, but it seems like they're trying to grow and compete in that space occupied by the CBC and Al-Jazeera, into that space of foreign cable channels that can get audiences in the United States."" Minkovski's show is another thing entirely--an in-house attempt at a newsy cult hit. The show was built around Minkovski when she was just 23. Its credit sequence featured the host, toothy and double-take pretty, striking poses and shooting a laser out of her index finger. Its editorial premise was ""bringing you the real  headlines with none of the mercy."" Minkovski would mock the rest of the media for focusing on celebrity news and horse races--content like that on her show would be left to the ""happy hour"" segment, in which pundits riff on the news behind martini glasses. (The vodka is fake; the olives are not.) Her meatiest segments were about government spying, and the Federal Reserve, and America's undeclared wars; it was on her show that Julian Assange got one of his most sympathetic interviews. ""There's a reason we have the largest known incarceration system in the world,"" says Minkovski. ""There's a reason we see an increasing number of violent SWAT raids that go wrong where innocent civilians are killed. There's a reason that Congress, despite being painted as a house divided, has no problem almost unanimously approving increasing defense budgets each year and can join together to extend the Patriot Act with no debate, with the exception of the few Rand Pauls of the world. And nobody on TV talks about that!"" RT is cagey about the media; my questions about the prime-time line-up were received but not answered. At the same time, the network relishes in its reputation as propaganda. One of the house ads that runs between segments quotes angry comments from its many YouTube pages, with sentiments like ""RT clearly is anti-American propaganda."" Sure, these stories about America in steep and hilarious decline are funded by the Kremlin. Why hide it? ""I think people are just so scared of an 'other,' something that might be unknown to them and they can't see past that,"" suggests Minkovski. ""So in their eyes, working for RT de-legitimizes you.  If you want to find a channel with an agenda, go to Fox News. They want to dumb down the masses and scare them so they can't put any pieces of the puzzle together."" Kokesh, whose media career has been nurtured by RT, is even happier to talk about this subject. In 2007, as a leader of Iraq Veterans Against the War, he participated in a mock ""patrol"" of Washington, wearing camo and toting a fake gun. He became one of the most prominent anti-war protesters in the city as the surge built and the rest of the anti-war movement faded, much of its energy moving into the presidential election. Kokesh became a supporter of Ron Paul. He ran for Congress himself in 2010 in New Mexico, and when that sputtered he got a radio show. This year, the Russian network that used to have him on once a week or so decided to give him a nightly series, Adam vs. the Man. When Ron Paul announced his 2012 exploratory committee, Kokesh saluted him on the air. He got an interview with his political hero and asked him stuff no one on TV ever has: ""You've described yourself as a voluntaryist. Can you tell us what that means for the big picture, and what your ideal society would be, as a voluntaryist?"" And the RT model has no prouder defender than Kokesh. ""Truth is the best propaganda,"" says Kokesh, restating the network's pitch in his own terms. ""I love it! I really love the concept of that. It's funny: People say we're hiding shit as a network. No, no--we put the fact that this is propaganda right out front. We're putting out the truth that no one else wants to say. I mean, if you want to put it in the worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit."" Is there a more radical way to say this? Yes, there is. ""In Libya, the rebels call for close air support, and they get close air support,"" he says. ""We call for close air support, and they give us a TV show. It's nice to know that in the United States we still have a chance to call for this peacefully. It's got to come from changing the paradigm--taking what we're able to learn from the Internet and being able to see the underlying patterns of exploitation."" How many Americans would agree with that? Lots of them. They read The Nation, Alex Jones, WorldNetDaily. It can seem like the entire Internet was created to convince the paranoid reader that he's right--you can't trust the bastards. RT goes one step further: You can trust the Russians more than you can trust those bastards. If no one else wants to create a TV channel for the despondent, here it is."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/lights_camera_impasse.html	"In a sign of progress, Republican appointees to Vice President Joe Biden's debt limit talks announced late Wednesday that they were pulling out of negotiations. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl denounced the president and Democrats for wanting to raise taxes. Added House Speaker John Boehner: ""The president is going to have to engage."" It sure doesn't sound like progress. But if you view these negotiations using the Saturday serial movie construct (and all right-thinking Americans should), this is simply the drama necessary to advance the story. When the heroine is tied to the tracks and the train is approaching, the audience's blood starts to race. But in the back of our minds, we know that she's not in real danger.  Whether the brakeman steps in or Captain Marvel swoops down to snatch her, we know the situation will resolve itself. * Given the state of politics in Washington today, and the stakes in this debate, the breakdown in talks was a foregone conclusion. ""We are at the impasse stage,"" said one administration official. It was always expected that Biden and congressional leaders would work as hard as they could, then cede the final round to President Obama and Boehner. That's where we are now, just as we were in the fight over the Bush tax cuts at the end of last year, and just as we were in the negotiations last spring over the continuing resolution to keep funding the government for this year. The leaders of the two key factions (along with their sidekicks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell) will now have to work with the wonks doing the math and figure out which final set of compromises will be palatable to their party. Before the final stage of backroom negotiations, there are always the denunciations, charges of unseriousness, and accusations of ideological rigidity. Why do we always come to this stage? It's a negotiating tactic, an educational exercise, and stage management. Anyone putting together a deal knows the value of seeming inflexible. Maybe you'll win concessions from the other side. Republican leaders must make a show of how difficult they are to impress their members and constituents.  If a deal happened with Biden in a room and there wasn't any public outcry, conservatives would have every right to be suspicious that Republicans got rolled. Democrats need the blow up for similar reasons. The moment allows them to try to paint Republicans as captive of their unpopular Tea Party wing, which might lower the expected level of spending cuts, or at least rearrange them if Republicans feel the heat. Both sides also need the debate to play out in public so that everyone can fully understand why an ultimate deal was the best one leaders could get. Throughout this drama there have always been two games to watch--public and private. While members of both parties were being tough on each other in public, golfing buddies Boehner and Obama held an unscheduled and hush-hush meeting at the White House Wednesday night. At the same time, just because we know the ending doesn't mean there can't be a few plot twists. The big question is what to do about taxes. According to administration officials, the deal being worked out in the room already includes some tax increases. In that case, we're about to engage in a debate about the definition of a tax increase. Closing a tax loophole increases taxes on someone, but by using a different term--eliminating ""tax expenditures""--it doesn't sound as bad. Republicans didn't have to give in on much during the negotiations over extending the Bush tax cuts and keeping the government running. But there's a bigger chance they will have to give in on something this time. To achieve the $2 trillion in spending reductions both sides have been aiming for--while at the same time protecting defense spending, a GOP priority--without raising some kind of taxes would require huge cuts in the rest of the budget. That might just be too hard to defend. ""You can't make the math work without them,"" says one administration official, explaining why some new tax revenue will be required. And there is another important way this story is different from the previous two: The deadline is vague. Before, everyone knew when economic doom would supposedly kick in. The tax cuts would expire on Dec. 31, and the government would not be able to pay its bills starting on April 9. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner earlier cited Aug. 2 as the end-date in this drama, but the economic pain could kick in earlier. All involved agree that the market could get spooked about the failure of a deal before Aug. 2. (Some might even say that the market is already spooked.) A deal is still likely because two key political forces are still in play: Republicans can't risk getting blamed for causing a default on the debt, and the president can't risk getting blamed (or rather, getting any more blame) for the weak economy. Presenting himself as the adult who put together a deal between two political extremes is perhaps the best single thing Obama can do to show that he is doing something to manage the economic mess. For the moment, both Biden and Cantor say the talks are in ""abeyance."" (Apparently, SAT preparation is in full swing, though.) They could resume, say Republicans, if Democrats stop trying to increase revenue by raising taxes. This takes us back to the debate over what constitutes a tax increase. It may be basic math that's driving the negotiations over the debt limit. But selling an agreement will require some fancy vocabulary, too. Become a fan of  John Dickerson on Facebook.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/nobodys_candidate.html	"The media create and the media destroy. Jon Huntsman announced his presidential bid to the kind of hype once reserved for a Pink Floyd reunion or a LeBron James signing--six months of giddy speculation kicked off by one interview in Newsweek. He picked Liberty State Park as the venue for his speech; Politico ran a double-bylined story about the park. Huntsman arrived at the park. The reporters outnumbered the supporters, easily. Then Huntsman started talking. He stopped being the candidate of myth and hype and not-quite-viral videos. He was a ski instructor-handsome former governor of Utah with immaculate hair and very little to say. His fresh hook: ""I don't think you need to run down someone's reputation in order to run for the office of president."" On Tuesday, Fox News gave him three minutes and then cut to analysis. MSNBC found another feed just as quickly. UVA's Larry Sabato consulted the Totem of Conventional wisdom and rendered judgment: ""Bland, uninspiring speech. Must ramp up quickly."" Reporters on-site noticed that Huntsman walked right from the podium to an interview with Sean Hannity, which for Republican candidates is like diving into a pool of throw pillows. They tweeted about the misspelled name on their credentials, about the staged flags that blew the wrong way, about the fact that someone forgot to fill in the real details about his headquarters, unless it's really 123 Main Street, (123) 456-7890. This is trivial, but it means more for Huntsman than it means for any of his 2012 rivals. Huntsman 2012 is a joint production of the political media and the fun wing of the GOP's consultant class. (His chief strategist is McCain veteran John Weaver, who made a hobby of criticizing McCain's negative turn in 2008; his adman is Fred Davis, who made sure you knew Christine O'Donnell was not a witch.) There is no Huntsman groundswell. There was no Draft Huntsman movement. One metric to show this: He has about 5,000 Facebook fans. A reasonably busy senator has that many. The wildly ignored 2012 contender Gary Johnson, former governor of New Mexico, has more than 120,000 fans. True, Huntsman's team cleverly secured a second-place showing in the Southern Republican Leadership Conference. When that result came down, my colleague John Dickerson heard only two hands clapping. So where did Huntsmania, such as it is, even come from? Huntsman's appeal to the national political press grows out of the months between the election of Barack Obama and the announcement, in May 2009, that the president would make him his ambassador to China. Reporters (and Democrats) were taken aback by how quickly, and how deeply, Republicans dug in to oppose Obama. Every House Republican voted against the stimulus; Republican governors jumped up and down to criticize the spending and say which chunks of it they wouldn't take. So the antidotes to Mark Sanford and Sarah Palin were Arnold Schwarznegger, Charlie Crist, and ... Jon Huntsman. He'd just won re-election by a landslide--still a kind of feat for a Utah Republican--and he was happy about taking stimulus cash. He thought the spending bill could have been bigger. He thought congressional Republicans were ""inconsequential."" His party was calling the president a socialist, and Huntsman was calling them nuts. (Weaver prefers ""cranks."") He expanded SCHIP in his state. He supported civil unions. The press saw the GOP's future, and it spoke Mandarin. We can say this for Huntsman: He's in better shape than Schwarzenegger or Crist. Going to China removed him from two years of politics that transferred ownership of the Republican Party from George W. Bush to Jim DeMint. All of that makes him more appealing to the media than ever. And he plays the media brilliantly, which would seem like a better qualification for the presidency if the last guy who did it weren't looking so weak right now. The new Huntsman, so far, is a stem cell. When faced with a question, he adapts and offers precisely what no one else is offering. (No one that the media take seriously, I mean--no disrespect to fans of Ron Paul, who have to watch a candidate with approximately one-tenth as much support in the polls hog all the attention.) Romney and Pawlenty are slow to criticize the war in Afghanistan? Huntsman will go there: ""We must manage the end of these conflicts,"" he said in his announcement speech, which comes right when polls say most Americans want out and when the Obama administration is 24 hours away from announcing some withdrawals. Romney and Pawlenty squirm when the Ryan plan comes up? Huntsman doesn't: He says he'll vote for it. Jim DeMint says he won't back any candidate who doesn't back a Balanced Budget Amendment? Huntsman will back a Balanced Budget Amendment, because ""every governor in this country has a balanced budget amendment."" (Very few states have defense budgets, though.) Twenty percent of Americans won't back a Mormon candidate? Huntsman is merely ""proud of my Mormon roots"" with a relationship to the church that's ""tough to define."" That last Huntsmanism might be the most blase thing a modern candidate has said about his church. In context, it looks like incredible adaptability. That skill can last for a while--again, ask Barack Obama--but in New Jersey Huntsman found himself saying what every other Republican says. All he added was that lede-ready layer of niceness. There was none of the pragmatism or praise for government policy that marked Huntsman's six month career as an Acceptable Republican. The closest we got was something about ""reestablish[ing] what it means to be a teacher in society,"" which could easily be a plug for Michelle Rhee. Instead of the Huntsman who provided cover for Democrats, we heard the philosophy of those people he used to call ""inconsequential."" ""We must make hard decisions that are necessary to avert disaster,"" said Huntsman. ""If we don't, in less than a decade, every dollar of federal revenue will go to covering the costs of Medicare, Social Security and interest payments on our debt."" How to avert it? ""We must make broad and bold changes to our tax code and regulatory policies"" and ""seize the lost opportunity of energy independence"" and remember that ""fiscal responsibility and economic growth"" are two great tastes that go great together. Is that it? The White House needed someone like Huntsman in those first surprisingly stormy months of 2009. The GOP's primary voters aren't so needy."

It was true in 1991, 1995, 2003 and 2007. Republicans have reason to celebrate, though. In at least one way, the field of candidates is exceptional. The current GOP field has more B-movie presidential lookalikes than at any time in modern history. Mitt Romney, John Huntsman, and Rick Perry have movie-star looks--and not just any movie star, but those guys who play the president in the movies that run in endless loops on cable. The B-movie president is a very specific type: He is not the hero. He is the actor in front of whom the hero dives to stop the bullet. He is essentially a stock character, and he must look like the stock photo of a president. In short, he is the guy who comes from central casting when the director sends word he needs someone to play the part of the president. Mitt Romney and Cotter SmithIn this campaign, Romney's movie-star looks have been the subject of late-night humor; four years ago one liberal website collected a half- dozen instances of commentators saying Romney ""looks presidential."" But what does that mean? In Romney's case, maybe it means he looks like Cotter Smith, who was threatened by the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler as  president in the second X-Men movie,  X2. Jon Huntsman and Ronny CoxHuntsman, like Romney, is a Mormon and former governor who faces questions from some Republicans over his associations with President Obama (Romney's health care law in Massachusetts was a model for Obamacare; Hunstman was the administration's ambassador to China). Huntsman also shares with Romney a resemblance to a B-movie president: Ronny Cox, whose secretary is found dead in the White House while he tries to juggle a hostage crisis in North Korea in Murder at 1600. Rick Perry and Bruce GreenwoodPerry, who is not running but is said to be considering it, has long been known for his good looks, especially his resilient hair. The late Molly Ivins called him ""Governor Goodhair""--she also referred to him simply as ""The Coiffure""--and a more sympathetic columnist can't help pointing out that he is ""tall, lean, and good-looking."" He also bears a likeness to Bruce Greenwood, who played the president in the overly-complex National Treasure: Book of Secrets. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

The RV houses the ""Liberty on Tour"" project and often parks in Keene, and today, as it's been for many days, it's parked next to the home of Free Keene co-founder Ian Freeman. ""The city doesn't allow RVs to park like this,"" says Freeman. ""But they require a complaining party, and no one in the neighborhood is complaining. Now, theoretically, anyone from the city could complain. They know what's going to happen if they do. We're going to make a big deal about it. We're going to go to jail."" That's not boasting. That's what Free Keene does. This city is one of the epicenters of the Free State Project, the decade-old effort to build a libertarian beachhead of 20,000 like-minded souls in New Hampshire. So far, 909 people have fulfilled the pledge and moved to the state, and around 50--Freeman thinks--currently live in Keene. (These people are serious about privacy.) That number undersells the impact this city and these activists have on their movement. Freeman's FreeKeene.com is a catalog of arrests, protests, and inspiring interviews, most of them in Keene. This is where one activist, Pete Eyre, spent days in jail for wearing a hat in a public hearing, and another activist, Heika Courser, was arrested for displaying her breasts after an artist painted them. The magician/TV star/libertarian celebrity Penn Jillette has mused wistfully about moving to Keene, and it didn't take long for his endorsement to get printed on Free Keene's fliers, below one of the slogans: ""Is liberty dying where you live? Escape to Keene!"" It'd be asking a lot to get 909 libertarians to agree about something. Before I drove to Keene, I asked a few other Free Staters, closer to Manchester, what they thought of the little city out west. ""If you move to Manchester or Concord you're probably interested in politics,"" said Kirk McNeil, a Free Stater who moved from Michigan in 2009. ""If you move to Keene you probably want to do some civil disobedience."" It took a while for the political press to decide what to make of the Free Staters. In 2007, when they were even smaller in number, they started to be looked at as a source of strength for Ron Paul's presidential campaign. In 2009, as the Tea Party movement got under way, reporters discovered that the FSP and its annual PorcFest (the porcupine is the mascot of the project) offered this stuff in its concentrated form. In 2011, people noticed that Free Staters had been elected to the New Hampshire legislature and were introducing bills to decriminalize marijuana and classify TSA groping as sexual assault. They soon received the ultimate honor--being attacked by progressive groups as a ""radical right"" and Koch-connected plot. In  Keene, the ""Koch-connected""* right-wingers are mostly interested in breaking behavior laws and seeing if anyone raises a fuss about it. Freeman does not pay federal taxes and hasn't for years. He pays local property taxes, and water bills, as does the co-host of his radio show, Mark Edge. ""Those revenues,"" says Edge, ""are a lot less likely to be used to buy weapons to kill brown people."" There's some variety in how far people here are willing to take disobedience. Eyre, for example, doesn't have a phone. ""My phone was among the property stolen by individuals wearing Manchester PD badges the weekend before last,"" he wrote in an e-mail. Was he robbed by a bunch of thugs pretending to be police officers? No. They were cops. He just doesn't recognize their authority. Cops are ""individuals."" Jails are ""cages."" Arrest is ""kidnapping."" Eyre refers to the place around Keene as ""the Shire,"" not New Hampshire. He, and a lot of the people in the movement, are not just libertarians, but ""voluntaryists,"" an ideology with a history of its own. (They point out that Ron Paul called himself one in an interview recently.) The lexicon matters. ""To me,"" explains Ademo Mueller, Eyre's friend and a partner on the Liberty on Tour trips, "" 'jail' is driven into peoples' minds as a place you house bad people. To me, it's a cage."" ""Theft is theft,"" says Eyre. ""Murder is murder. Doesn't matter if you're wearing a uniform."" ""Doesn't matter if people voted for you, either,"" says Mueller. He's telling me this in an RV decked out--on the inside--with bumper stickers and slogans like ""Evil Men Are In Control. Haven't You Noticed?"" and ""Do You Own Yourself?"" and ""1984 Was An Instruction Manual."" There are Ron Paul stickers, and a signature from the man himself. Mueller shows me his contribution to the sticker stash: a promotion for CopBlock, the project and website he started, which encourages people to film police officers. Mueller joined the bus tour from Wisconsin, where he had two felony drug convictions, and had nothing to do. ""I spent three months in jail and 100 hours of community service,"" he says. ""I paid my debt to society, and then I learned that it was a life sentence. I mean, I was living in fear of what would happen, because I was getting harassed by the police, just because I was defying them and they didn't like it. After I moved here, I lost my fear."" ""I lost my anger,"" says Freeman. ""I'm a lot more outgoing than I used to be,"" says J.J. Schlessinger, who manages the Keene Action Center. The conversation moves inside the center, a well-appointed house where Free Keene friends come to cook food. A calendar near a bar says who's cooking and when; on the other side of the room, a bookshelf has homemade jam and copies of novels by Ayn Rand. There are photos everywhere, taken by activists, of the rural beauty of the area, or commemorating times when Free Keene people defied open-carry laws or laws against smoking marijuana. Heika Courser rolls up to the house on a blue Honda motorcycle then walks up to the porch. She's a Keene native who met Eyre and Mueller when they had parked their RV in the parking lot of the Starbucks where she worked. The ""Free Staters"" pissed her employers off, but not her; she struck up a conversation with Eyre and started hanging out with the Free Keene folks. Now she wants to run for city council. ""I don't have almost any of the same friends I used to,"" she shrugs, ""but I get along with the people in the city council. They're getting used to us."" Well, that's complicated. Steven Lindsey, a Democrat who represents Keene in the state legislature, got into politics after years as a reporter and an activist; once, he and some protesters dressed up like ninjas and pulled a stunt to prevent a McDonald's from being built in nearby Peterborough. (It worked, as did some other strategies.) So he understands Free Keene. He likes them. ""They call me Government Steve,"" he says. ""It's somewhat affectionate."" Some of what they do still strikes him as ""callow."" He tried last year to push a medical marijuana bill through the legislature in Concord, and he wanted the city of Keene to endorse it. And then came a Free Keene protest, with marijuana being smoked outdoors, and with cops getting filmed by cameras. There went any chance of a city council endorsement. Bygones. He's optimistic about Courser getting elected to city government some day. He thinks the movement will mellow. ""My theory is that this, too, shall pass, just like the hippies came here, and that passed."" Free Keene's rebellion against the government started under George W. Bush, so it's not just a fractal of the Tea Party. But the Tea Party protester who hates the stimulus and the man who moves here and shreds his tax bill--these guys come out of the same place. They are not just skeptical that the current government can work. They think government can never work. They respond to the pressures of the Great Recession, the drug war, and everything else that bugs them by giving up on the system that made them. They won't be alone. Clarification,  June 27, 2011: This sentence about the connection between the Free Keene movement and the Koch Foundation has been adjusted to make its ironic meaning more clear. There is no formal relationship between the group and the foundation. (Return to the modified sentence.)"	Free State Project: What happens if 20,000 libertarians move to New Hampshire?

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/the_mitt_show.html	"Newt Gingrich likes American Idol. Tim Pawlenty is a Coke fan. And Mitt Romney, demeanor notwithstanding, likes it spicy. These tiny gleanings emerged at the first major Republican debate, when moderator John King asked whimsical this-or-that questions before the commercial breaks. The two-hour forum raised a few of those types of questions itself: Current field or Rick Perry? Obamneycare or Minnesota mumbles? Michele Bachmann or Sarah Who? Is it me or is it hot in here? Scorecard analysis or thoughtful collection of paragraphs? Romney won the debate in that he didn't lose. There was nothing spicy about Romney (despite his answer), but he didn't hurt himself by seeming on all sides of the issue. Indeed, his explanation of the health care law he signed as governor of Massachusetts was one of his best yet. It was not likely to satisfy the National Review but likely to satisfy voters who want to get back to talking about the economy. When Romney's opponents were given a chance to wallop him on his flip-flops on abortion, no one took up the chance. ""Case closed?"" asked John King. ""Case closed,"" said Herman Cain. Reagan's 11th commandment was in effect: These Republicans did not speak ill of each other. Romney didn't take the opportunity to criticize any of his opponents, either. He was in general-election mode, criticizing President Obama and saying he looked forward to debating him. Romney even showed perhaps his most human moment on stage after he announced the Boston Bruins were up 4-0. He laughed to himself at his little bit of subversive mischief. (How did he know? An adviser said before the debate that they'd be watching the debate and the Bruins game on competing televisions.) The entire gang competed to offer their vision of a country where Medicare, Social Security, and government regulations were pared back to unleash the private sector and trim the budget. Twenty-three foster children or national bus tour? If you didn't watch the debate, Michele Bachmann will be by later to tell you she has taken in 23 foster children. She mentioned it three times during the debate. It makes two points: She's generous, and she puts her money where her mouth is. Candidates strive to introduce themselves in these debates, and Bachmann did the best job. She conveyed both a sense of personal conviction while also speaking to the issues Republican voters care about, such as repealing the health care law. She was also smart enough to announce her formal candidacy in her first answer, ensuring that she would be at the top of every story covering the event. Her one-liners about making Obama a one-term president and the repeal of health care will get repeated in Republican circles. She will benefit not necessarily because people think she will be president, but because they want her out there advocating for the ideas they support about limited government. ""I fought behind closed doors,"" she said of her opposition to the unpopular TARP. ""Sometimes that's what you have to do, you have to take principle over party."" She presented herself tonight as a more capable and plausible spokeswoman for Tea Party activists than Herman Cain or Sarah Palin. Bachmann's only devastating moment came when she was asked her this-or-that question--Johnny Cash or Elvis--and she said both. All right-thinking Americans know, of course, that the answer is Johnny Cash. Is this gimmick getting old or should I press on? Pawlenty did not have a great night. In addition to introducing themselves to a wider audience, candidates need to impress the people they're going to be calling to ask for campaign donations. That's the audience he has to worry about, and they matter for the next 16 days--the amount of time left before the reporting period ends for this quarter. Romney will do very well. The other candidates, like Pawlenty, need to show that they did, too. Boasting about a big fundraising number sends a signal that you are a viable candidate. And debates matter, because a common fundraising tactic is to call donors afterward and brag about your candidate's great performance or send around a clip of a pundit praising a big moment. It's ephemeral and sometimes silly, but it gets checks. One of Pawlenty's problems, say strategists in Iowa and New Hampshire, is that he's not a forceful presence--""not tall timber,"" as one GOP veteran in New Hampshire put it. Pawlenty had a chance to show he was tough and capable of beating the GOP field, but he missed it. Before the debate, Pawlenty criticized the health care plan Romney signed as governor of Massachusetts as ""Obamneycare."" He then scheduled a last-minute health care event in Manchester on the day of the debate to highlight the issue. Asked about this characterization at the debate, Pawlenty wouldn't continue the critique. He had to be forced into it by moderator King. ""If you can't criticize Romney with your own words, how can you go toe-to-toe with Obama?"" asked a Republican strategist. ""And how can you not prepare for that answer?"" Later, Pawlenty gave strong answers on a question about labor unions and an answer about the role of religion in public life that he could put in a YouTube clip and send to his evangelical voters. But the buzz coming out of the debate was about how he flinched. Buzz is fortunately meaningless in a lot of cases, but not to the people who write campaign checks. Pawlenty can recover with voters because they're in a shopping mood. In a recent Gallup poll, for example, where Romney was the front-runner with 24 percent of the vote, only three in 10 of those people said they are certain to stick with him. Pawlenty has time, but he'll need money to keep going and to compete. His pitch on the phone for the next two weeks is going to be harder after the debate performance. Newt Gingrich was a pleasant presence on stage. Not his looks, mind you. Someone should tell him to stop scowling--at every cut-away shot, he looked like he was trying to melt an ice sculpture. What was refreshing was Gingrich's ""cut the nonsense"" aspect. While the other candidates were promising to repeal Obama's health care law, Gingrich pointed out that such promises were meaningless without majorities in Congress. He railed against politicians and the media for presenting political debates only in terms of ""two catastrophic alternatives.""When asked about his controversial comments about Paul Ryan's plan for Medicare, Gingrich was honest, though he probably didn't help himself. ""If you're dealing with something as big as Medicare and you can't have a conversation with the country where the country thinks what you're doing is the right thing, you better slow down. Remember, we all got mad at Obama because he ran over us when we said don't do it. Well, the Republicans ought to follow the same ground rule. If you can't convince the American people it's a good idea, maybe it's not a good idea."" This is called common sense. It's also what someone who has thought about how a president actually governs might have to go about things. And, not incidentally, it leads to the conclusion that the approach being followed by House Republicans is the wrong one. Like all early debates, this was not a night for soaring visions of America. There were the usual bromides, of course, but the candidates mostly focused on the nightmare of the Obama presidency. After two hours, it was a little repetitive and dreary. If the next moderator asks sunshine or rain, candidates who aspire to follow in Ronald Reagan's optimistic footsteps have to find a way to do more than bemoan the clouds.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/palins_coming_attractions.html	"""This is a story that's been hiding in plain sight."" This is how Steve Bannon describes his new documentary,  The Undefeated, at a Thursday screening for reporters in the Washington suburbs. The bulk of the movie-stuff he was told to cut down, but didn't-is a biography of Sarah Palin before her BlackBerry rang with John McCain on the line, asking her to be his running mate. If Palin's critics learned this stuff, Bannon just knows they'll change their minds about her. Bannon has shown his movie to friends in the movie business--""Greenwich Village progressives,"" he says. ""And to a man they did not know she took on the Republican Party this hard in Alaska. They did not know she took on Big Oil in Alaska. A lot of them do not like her, do not agree with her politics, but they have a grudging admiration."" There's a much tougher crowd in the room today: reporters from CNN, the Washington Post, and NBC News. Less than 24 hours later, they're going to be analyzing 24,000-plus e-mails released from Palin's gubernatorial records. For now, they're sitting on comfortable chairs and a sofa watching nearly two hours of narrative documentary, peopled by Palin's closest staffers and friends. One by one the people on-screen are informing the world that Palin was a fantastic success as governor who was brought down by--in the words of Palin's former communications director Meg Stapleton--""Saul Alinsky tactics."" Those first 18 months of Palin's term, says Bannon, were a historic success. No wonder they've been papered over. ""Take the best 18 months of your life, and think about what you accomplished,"" says Bannon. ""Think about the best governors we've ever had and match their record to those 18 months. Let's take the last three guys who've had this job [the presidency] and match their records."" The movie, according to the title card, is based on Palin's memoir  Going Rogue. Palin was not interviewed for the movie--Bannon did not want to involve her, wanting to keep total control of the production--but her voice pops up again and again in the movie as clips from the audio version of the memoir. Palin talks about her work on the State Oil and Gas Commission, the negotiations for a natural gas pipeline, and the crafting of Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share, a tax hike on oil companies. Every political news outlet tore through Going Rogue. It was the rare reviewer who mentioned any of this. The dream scenario for Bannon is that The Undefeated restarts the clock on Palin. People who read about her popularity as governor, and wondered how she pulled it off, get some facts and old interviews to bolster their impressions; people who know her only as Tina Fey's best act will hang their heads and reassess this person they dismissed as ""Caribou Barbie."" But it's not that easy for public figures to change how people think about them. If it was, there'd be a run on Deloreans and they'd all be doing it. The Palin in Bannon's file footage is undeniably, admirably brutal on fellow Republicans who line their pockets. She's also a populist who wants oil companies to give more of their profits to Alaskan taxpayers--and succeeds. Palin keeps taxes low as mayor of Wasilla, and the movie shows local news reports on businesses flocking to the town. But we're not convinced that her tax rates had more to do with that than the fact that housing in the city was far cheaper than housing 45 minutes down the highway to Anchorage. Bannon also deploys clip after clip of file footage of Wasilla's infrastructure improvements under Palin: pipe being laid, men in hardhats carrying girders, families playing in parks. Democrats could grab it all and use it in ads for the stimulus bill. Now: Compare that with the rhetoric and goals of the Tea Party movement, or of a wing of the Republican Party for which oil taxes and private-public infrastructure projects--when debated in Washington--are rejected out of hand as European-style socialism. If the movie's going to boost Palin as a national figure (Bannon told reporters that he wants her ""voice"" in the presidential race, at least), how do we extrapolate from the Alaska record? What other state has Alaska's resources? Where else do Republicans tear up their copies of  The Road to Serfdom and cut deals with Democrats to regulate business? It's a rhetorical question, and the 2011 version of Palin doesn't provide any answers. In Bannon's narrative, Palin was pilloried because liberals and Republicans feared what she'd do in Washington. The movie excerpts her 2008 RNC convention speech at length (all of the title cards are quotes from that speech). Palin-haters say it was a performance; Bannon sees it as the culmination of her career thus far. We see vicious attacks on Palin, but only certain kinds of attacks--substance-less, personal, stupid, sexist ones. When Chris Matthews tells his audience that Palin bought new clothes at Nordstrom, Bannon uses file footage of giggly girls jumping up and down with shopping bags. He uses the same footage when Palin's last Wasilla mayoral opponent mocks her as a ""spice girl"" who shops at ""Neiman's."" The message: It's the same playbook, and liberals got nothin'. If the argument is that plenty of Palin-hatred is stupid, sexist, and unfounded, Bannon wins. But that's not all that liberals say about Palin. One line of argument is that she reassigned Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan after he failed to fire her ex-brother-in-law, and while one report absolved Palin, one didn't. Another is that she gets thrown wildly off course by attacks and obsesses over them to the detriment of what she's working on. There's an e-mail record that shows that--a record that might get longer as more e-mails are released. What do we see on-screen? A quick report on how the ethics complaints filed in 2009, before Palin resigned, were baseless, and Palin's former spokeswoman saying the governor got ""Alinsky'd."" The resignation, one of the biggest mysteries about Palin and biggest impediments to her national role, is explained away in the terms that Palin originally explained it away: She just couldn't serve the people of Alaska while answering the frivolous charges. The narrative then leaves Alaska. Palin gets credit for sparking the Tea Party movement. Andrew Breitbart calls conservatives who won't defend Palin ""eunuchs,"" and Mark Levin says conservatives should ignore the advice of any conservative who didn't support Ronald Reagan. The ambitious, winning governor metamorphizes into the Mama Grizzly that liberals hate. Hold on: Is there some way for her to get back the bipartisan mojo she had in Alaska? Is there a better reason why she left office? No answer.

The top leadership in the campaign, at both the national and state levels, quit en masse Thursday. Sources close to the campaign say that it has been a disorganized mess for weeks, with Gingrich offering no direction and not taking the advice of his aides. With no sense that the candidate wanted to do the hard work necessary to win, one source said it was foolish to work long hours, sacrifice time with family, and beg friends for campaign cash if the candidate himself wasn't committed. Sources say that Gingrich intends to stay in the campaign, what's left of it. Indeed, on his Facebook page, Gingrich posted: ""I am committed to running the substantive, solutions-oriented campaign I set out to run earlier this spring. The campaign begins anew Sunday in Los Angeles."" In Iowa this week the talk was of Gingrich's decision to take a vacation while his competitors were working hard campaigning and trying to raise money. When Will Rogers, a longtime Gingrich booster in the state, resigned, local GOP veterans speculated that the campaign might be coming apart. Campaign manager Rob Johnson, spokesman Rick Tyler, and other top officials spoke with Gingrich over the last several days about setting a clear direction for the future-- and that's when everything broke down. ""There was a difference of opinion on what needed to be done going forward,"" says Craig Schoenfeld, Gingrich's Iowa strategist, who also resigned. Johnson ran Texas Gov. Rick Perry's campaign last year, and Dave Carney, one of Gingrich's top strategists, used to work for Perry as well. Carney says his move was ""totally unrelated to Rick Perry,"" but their departure will only serve to increase speculation about the governor's entry into the presidential race. As for Gingrich, Schoenfeld said that he ""needs to be surrounded by those folks who share his vision for the campaign. Those folks--whoever they may be--should be a part [of his campaign] going forward."" Gingrich's former aides, meanwhile, may now get a chance to take a vacation of their own.

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/confirmed_the_nomination_process_is_broken.html	"Dawn Johnsen doesn't want to complain. It's been one year and two months since she withdrew her nomination to lead the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. She'd spent just about as long--actually, a few weeks more--in limbo, awaiting a vote that never came. She's moved on. She's teaching law again at Indiana University. She doesn't complain, but she's fed up. It's been a couple of days since MIT economics professor and Nobel laureate Peter Diamond withdrew his nomination for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and a couple of weeks since Goodwin Liu withdrew his nomination for a seat on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. It's getting sort of ridiculous. ""I'm starting to feel like it would be valuable to have some kind of reform that led to an up-or-down vote in some reasonable period of time,"" she says. Starting to feel like? This is a lawyer who spent much of the Obama presidency being pilloried as an enemy of national security, based on briefs, blogs, and articles for magazines like Slate. She blew a substantial amount of money on a rented house in suburban Washington and travel into the city whenever a senator beckoned her. Her career was put on hold; she was strongly urged not to talk to the press, and she didn't, even though she was reading the commentary about her and had some thoughts about it. She still wants to be evenhanded about this. ""I'm not going to talk about any individual meetings with senators,"" she says, ""but the impression that I got was it wasn't about me, that it wasn't personal. It was political. And there were some senators who were very open about that. It wasn't a difference in substantive views. The things I was attacked for saying about torture, for example--Lindsey Graham and John McCain have talked about that the same way."" (Neither publicly supported her nomination.) ""You definitely need to look at how all the terrorism issues and nominees who dealt with terrorism issues were treated. The attempt was to describe President Obama's approach as not sufficiently tough on terrorism, and make that a political issue."" Confirmations are political. This is not news. The news is that they've never moved slower. Diamond's withdrawal, on the op-ed page of the New York Times, was part of a flurry of news that made this obvious. One week earlier, House Republicans had prevented the Senate from going into recess, meaning that the president couldn't temporarily appoint stalled nominees. And at the same time, Senate Republicans were talking openly about their distinct lack of interest in allowing cloture for members of the new Independent Payment Advisory Board, the new efficiency-hunting commission created by the Affordable Care Act. How big is the problem? According to a Senate study, there are 422 key policy positions that require advise and consent--deputy secretaries of the Treasury, Homeland Security officials, offspring of the never-ending expansion of government. The same study finds that the time between nomination and confirmation votes has nearly doubled since the Reagan era, when the sclerosis really started. It took Reagan 114 days for nominees to get confirmed; it takes Obama closer to 200 days. By the White House's own count, more than 200 nominees are in limbo. Some of them are ambassadors being used as chits; more and more of them are for key jobs that Republicans don't want to fill, or for candidates who've earned the nebulous, unshakeable status of ""controversial."" James Cole, a nominee for deputy attorney general, was filibustered because he'd written (truthfully) that the terrorists behind the first World Trade Center bombing were ""successfully tried and convicted under our criminal justice system""--he might oppose military tribunals. John Bryson, who's up to become the next commerce secretary--the vermiform appendix of Cabinet jobs--is already being threatened with a filibuster or a hold because he co-founded an environmental group and thinks international environmental laws aren't so bad. This happens because the game is so easy. Grinding down a nomination only backfires if the administration has a brilliant strategy for making the nominee famous. That's hard to do. In the 14 months that Diamond floated in the phantom zone, his stalled nomination was discussed a few times on cable business channels but never on network news and only twice on cable news--a short segment on an episode of The Rachel Maddow Show and an interview with Fareed Zakaria. It's tough to make people care about this, although for a while, Republicans were good at it. During the Bush years, a loose alliance of Republican staffers and conservative groups made sure that the judicial nominees held up by Democrats--Miguel Estrada, Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen, to name a few--became famous in TV ads and sob stories. Manny Miranda, a former Senate GOP staffer who worked on this, lost his job over this, and is now happily doing other things, says that Estrada's nomination to the court was the focus of more op-eds and editorials than any other nominee for a job at that level. ""When I was on conference calls back then,"" says Miranda, ""I'd be clear: The only way to communicate this is to personalize it. Miguel Estrada had a story to tell. You need to tell a story."" The problem is so bad that it might actually get solved. (This isn't something you can say about most issues up for debate in the Senate.) Since March, a group of senators led by Joe Lieberman, Chuck Schumer, Susan Collins, and Lamar Alexander have been gathering support for legislation that would cut by one-third the number of jobs that need Senate confirmation. It wouldn't directly affect the affairs of an OLC nominee, or a Fed nominee, but nothing that clears up the schedule could hurt them. (In our interview, Johnsen said the marathon, plot-twisting health care debate continually delayed the date Democrats were thinking about spending some capital and voting on her.) There are very few bills that have the support of both parties' leadership. This is one of them. ""There are so many confirmable jobs that no administration can hope to people all of the positions in any reasonable period of time,"" says Sen. Jon Kyl, the Republican whip. ""And we've got too many lower-level people subject to confirmation for what I would call the proper function of government."" Some of the veterans of the confirmation wars want to do more. Miranda's idea is so bold that it's hard to imagine a Democrat floating it. ""You can draw the line,"" says Miranda, ""and people below a certain line--assistant secretary, people below that--are deemed approved and subject to confirmation. They exercise authority until they're confirmed. That would solve this problem you have now, where the acting career person who takes the job while the nominee's frozen is cautious, hesitant to make decisions. I think the president, as a policy matter, deserves to get the names in right away, and get who he wants, instead of getting bureaucrats."" Miranda is adamant about this. ""People have no idea about how this affects the government at lower levels. The culture of delay is almost as crippling as the corruption we fight across the world. Our corruption is delay. No one's willing to make decisions. That hurts us."""	Peter Diamond, Goodwin Liu, Dawn Johnsen: Why can't Obama get his nominees confirmed?	['Obama', 'McCain', 'Alexander']	[]
27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/the_incredible_shrinking_weiner.html	"If you get elected to Congress, tweet a photo of your erect penis straining at the seams of your underwear, lie about it, then hold a press conference to confess and say you're sorry, you have to face a lot of uncomfortable questions. So it was that Rep. Anthony Weiner concluded 30 minutes of teary and abject apologies by hearing--and ignoring-- this question from Benjy Bronk of Howard Stern's radio show. ""In the gray panty photo, were you fully erect?"" yelled Bronk. ""Were you fully erect or are you capable of more?"" Weiner, who has one of the more cartoonishly expressive faces in Congress--he looks like Jim Carrey if Carrey had a bar mitzvah--bit his lip and walked off camera. His head was turned down at an appropriately ashamed angle. And why not? One Friday-night Twitter  #fail, the sort of mistake that countless Web geeks make every day, and he became the first national politician since Bill Clinton whose penis dimensions are a matter of public record. (Clinton officiated Weiner's 2010 wedding, a fact that was always going to be high up in his biography, and still will be, for entirely different reasons.) Weiner's disclosure went further than anything he'd been accused of so far. Even so, he insisted that this was a sex scandal with no sex. There's no reason to disbelieve him, apart from the fact that he spent 10 days lying. The picture of Weiner that emerged this week was of a publicity hound who was more concerned with celebrity and status than with actual sex. ""I've engaged in several inappropriate communications with women I have met online,"" Weiner said. ""I've exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with these women over the past few years. For the most part, these communications took place before my marriage."" The details of Weiner's online life, as they trickle out, are absolutely pathetic. Based purely on what he's admitted, and what ABC News has confirmed, Weiner spent some real time flirting with female fans, taking photos of his body, and passing them on. We know that Clinton talked on the phone while receiving blow jobs at least three times. Weiner isn't accused of any behavior that interesting, but now everyone who's dealt with him can ruminate: What the hell was he doing as we talked, or after we talked? It's pure humiliation. Anyone would be embarrassed by what Weiner did. Had a blogger not grabbed the photo quickly, it would have disappeared from the Internet and Weiner would have been safe with his lies. But no one forced Weiner to spend a full week claiming someone had committed a crime against him and assuring reporters that the truth would come out. When ABC's Jonathan Karl asked Weiner, politely, if it was appropriate to follow a bunch of young women on Twitter, the congressman blew up at him. ""It's really outrageous,"" he said. ""The implication is outrageous. First of all, if you ask the question, if it's outrageous, I have a right to say it's outrageous."" It was outrageous. It was true. Reporters are lied to all the time, but these lies stick for the same reason that Weiner got thrills from flirting that he couldn't get any other way. Weiner's fate isn't up to him--not for a while. House Democrats have asked for an ethics committee investigation, to determine whether he used public resources to carry out his shenanigans. He says he didn't (""I welcome and will fully cooperate with an investigation""), and if he didn't, he'll be exonerated. If every woman he talked to is in her 20s, that's another bullet dodged. He can survive, but he doesn't matter as he did just a couple of weeks ago, as the made-for-cable Democrat who was dogging Clarence Thomas over why his wife's political work didn't show up in financial disclosure forms. The scandal still matters. And if it ruined the reputation of one man--that would be Weiner--it helped repair another's. Andrew Breitbart, who became a conservative in part because of his respect for Clarence Thomas, saw Weiner drop a stick of dynamite on the ground. He hurled it right back at him. At 4 p.m. on Monday (that's 1 p.m. in Seattle), Breitbart took the podium at the Sheraton where Weiner was about to speak, and fielded 11 minutes of questions about his role in this scandal. The rest of the media, which had showed signs of Breitbart fatigue, has to take him seriously again, after questionable editing and judgment on videos about NPR and Shirley Sherrod. The evidence of Breitbart's return to influence was in the middle of ABC's interview with a 26-year-old woman who communicated with Weiner. ""Breitbart, who first published details of Broussard's story on BigGovernment.com, shared her identity with ABC News."""

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/o_ye_of_little_faith.html	"Near the main hall of the Faith & Freedom Coalition conference, right next to where Ralph Reed was holding court with presidential candidates, House Republicans, and freelance morality consultant Dick Morris, a bespectacled and fast-talking woman from New Jersey stops me and hands me a card. Her name is Nora Craig. Her cause is the eventual abolition of most government health care programs, made possible by a network of nongovernment free clinics. ""People want an end to big government,"" says Craig. ""They want limited government. Before you can end the support that big government is giving, you have to create the support on a community level first."" Craig explains how this would work. Anna Little stands by and nods. Little is a one-term former mayor of Highlands, N.J., who ran for Congress last year and lost by 11 points. She reminds me that the movement's founder has testified in the Senate on Rand Paul's invitation. She's lobbying Gov. Chris Christie to support something like this. If a GOP star entertains the idea, well, then, people may listen. ""It's a replacement for Medicaid,"" says Little. ""It's charity-based. It could, through federalism, be a replacement for Obamacare as well."" Is the goal of the plan to create the sort of health care system that existed before the onset of the New Deal and the Great Society? That's exactly it, Craig says. ""There are no new things in the plan,"" she says. ""There are only things in history that were pushed aside for a new idea. Well, when that new idea is proven not to work, all we need to do is look back in history and see what worked. And what worked in the past was charity care with the church as an anchor."" She pounds her left fist into her right palm. ""You've got to have that anchor!"" Democrats have convinced themselves that Republicans blundered mightily by voting for Rep. Paul Ryan's budget, with its radical reforms of Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans aren't sure yet. The hardest of the GOP's hardcore activists have another take: The GOP did exactly the right thing. Now's the time to tell voters that entitlements have to be cut and reformed and that doing so will not result in a re-enactment of the bad parts of The Grapes of Wrath. ""The electorate is getting smarter,"" suggests John Radell, a Delaware activist who's convinced Republicans can run on the Ryan plan. ""They're getting smarter because they're under a lot more economic pressure."" This is sort of what Republican politicians are saying. One problem: They were saying it louder before the polls started to curdle, and before they lost a safe seat in western New York to a Democrat whose every other spoken word was Medicare. At the Faith & Freedom conference, every leading Republican presidential candidate not named Palin made some sort of showing. Newt Gingrich, who hasn't actually held an event since before Memorial Day, limited his to a video address. He is on a politically convenient vacation after alienating the Republican base by saying Ryan's budget was too ""radical""--Gingrich doesn't use the word pejoratively--to sell with Americans. There would first need to be a long national debate about entitlements. Conservatives would need to win it. Social conservatives didn't get what Gingrich was talking about. The entitlements debate was on; they were ready. They had ideas like Nora Craig's make-Medicaid-irrelevant plan. At this conference, there just weren't many Republicans matching them, boldness for boldness. The pollster Frank Luntz gave a short presentation proving that most voters expected Social Security to go bust and expected their children to be worse off than they are. When I asked Luntz what advice he'd give to Republicans to frame the Medicare debate--something people in the crowd thought would be obvious and easy--he apologized and said his head wasn't in it. The presidential hopefuls didn't have any more answers. Take Tim Pawlenty's speech; in the post-Huckabee campaign, he's the evangelical Christian with the most direct line to these voters. His campaign theme has been ""telling the truth,"" a neat little formulation that digs at President Obama while raising a subliminal question about Mitt Romney. At the conference, Pawlenty was harder on Obama. ""He won't tell the American people the truth about what it will take to really fix these problems!"" he said. He reminded the crowd--twice--that he'd announced his presidential bid in Iowa by promising to end farm subsidies. He just never mentioned entitlements. The candidates' speeches were nothing special. Their stump speeches were shortened for time, and padded with at least one religious story or reference. (Jon Huntsman got the best of this exercise, telling a story about his adopted Chinese daughter--his ""little bean curd""--that generated real, audible Awwwws from the crowd.) And the hundreds of social conservatives in the room appreciated all of that. But, really, since the start of the Tea Party movement, social conservatives have panicked about debt and the welfare state and the threat of American decline. They like people who get specific about how they'll fix it. Those people are not running for president. A panel on ""Teavangelicals"" turned out, disappointingly, to be a forum for the well-bred radio host Jordan Sekulow to warn about Ron Paul's views of Israel. One panelist, a Florida Tea Party activist named Patricia Sullivan, was a little more positive, and praised the state's anti-""Obamacare"" campaigner-turned-governor Rick Scott for cutting the budget. Of course, Scott is one of the least popular governors in America. Democrats are convinced they can drape Scott around the neck of the next GOP presidential candidate and bring home Florida for Obama. Hold on: Why did Williams think this was a good model for Republicans? ""Scott's a new breed of public servant,"" she explained. ""He's doing what he said he'd do. If he doesn't get re-elected, it doesn't matter to him, and that's what we need. We need men and women who've got spines, who're ready to take two-year or four-year tours of duty and not care if they lose."" That's what the Tea Party class of 2010 promised to do. This is why Republicans have been avoiding all manner of smartly placed traps on the entitlement question. Journalists, they can deal with. What's tougher is the army of libertarians who've always wanted to end the welfare state, now joined with social conservatives who are obsessed with the same thing. There are pols who aren't fighting this. On Saturday, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell spent a little time away from the podium to meet activists and talk to reporters. He runs Reed's affiliate in Ohio; he's thinking about running for U.S. Senate. He was the only Republican in that position who said what the social conservatives believe. ""Clean water is important to us,"" said Blackwell. ""Decent housing is important to us. But they're not rights. And we have to begin to say that what's important is that we in a rational way are able to reform these programs in a way to save them. And, yes, if it means that somewhere down the line individuals have to make sacrifices, because the rationalization of the system means we save it, but we are also doing it in a more efficient way. ... I don't think too many Americans will object to that. At the end of the day we're going to get back to making sure we're in a position to finance the wars in which we engage. Does that mean we can do that without sacrificing? No. We have to make sacrifices. But what's more important? Our freedom and security or the gluttony of the federal government?"""
