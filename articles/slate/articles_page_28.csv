""I was offered a full scholarship to West Point,"" Carson wrote, describing a meeting with Gen. William Westmoreland. ""I didn't refuse the scholarship outright, but I let them know that a military career wasn't where I saw myself going. As overjoyed as I felt to be offered such a scholarship, I wasn't really tempted. The scholarship would have obligated me to spend four years in military service after I finished college, precluding my chances to go on to medical school."" There are immediate problems here. There are no scholarships to West Point--all costs are covered for all students. And the only way to get an offer is to apply, but the school has no record of Carson's application. When pressed by Politico, Carson's campaign conceded he never applied. ""He was introduced to folks from West Point by his ROTC Supervisors,"" explained his campaign manager, Barry Bennett. ""They told him they could help him get an appointment based on his grades and performance in ROTC. He considered it but in the end did not seek admission."" This prompted a story--""Ben Carson Admits Fabricating West Point Scholarship"" was the original title--and a flurry of activity on Twitter, as Carson supporters and conservative defenders attacked Politico for smearing the former neurosurgeon. ""It is true, Carson never applied and was never accepted to West Point,"" wrote conservative activist Erick Erickson. ""The Politico's representation of that is demonstrably false and is not something Carson claimed."" The Carson campaign has also responded. ""He was told by the ROTC Commander that he could have an appointment,"" said Doug Watts, a spokesman for the campaign, to the Washington Post. ""Dr. Carson rejected the offer, did not apply or pursue admission. Had he done so, and been accepted, that would have been tantamount to a scholarship, the same that all cadets receive."" So, is Politico right? Did Carson ""fabricate"" his West Point story? If you judge by the text of his book, as well as other statements about the same story, the answer is not exactly. Carson never claimed that he applied to the school. And while West Point doesn't give scholarships, it's not hard to see how encouragement from authority figures--You're a shoo-in--becomes, after years of telling and retelling, the tale of an offer and a scholarship. It's just how memory works. Carson is guilty of run-of-the-mill embellishment. Still, it's tempting to say that this will harm his campaign. Embellishing about entrance to a military academy doesn't look good, especially for someone who has built his campaign on honesty and integrity. Some Republicans might just recoil from the former neurosurgeon, in favor of someone else. But I doubt it. Carson is extraordinarily well-liked among Republican voters--it will take more than an exaggeration to tank his ratings with the grassroots. And indeed, the fact that Politico has had to walk back from its initial claims will work in Carson's favor. Now this is another case of the ""liberal media"" on a witch hunt against a strong, conservative Republican. Far from hurting Ben Carson, this whole flap may strengthen his standing with Republicans, as they rally to defend him. Carson may well stumble in the race for the GOP nomination--I think it's inevitable--but it won't be over old memories of college applications."	Ben Carson's West Point Fib Won't Hurt Him

""The campaigns reached an early consensus on one issue, according to several operatives in the room: the secure standing of Fox News Channel,"" the Washington Post reported. ""Any changes would be applied to debates after next week's Fox Business Network debate. Among the reasons, according to one operative in the room, was that 'people are afraid to make Roger [Ailes] mad,' a reference to the network's chief."" That line about fearing Ailes has been challenged, though it's not hard to believe that Republican campaigns would fear running afoul of perhaps the most powerful figure in conservative media. It's a fear that Republican campaigns don't have of CNBC or NBC or ABC or any other network that's in line to moderate a Republican primary debate. Though the camps may complain about fair treatment, the non-Fox debates give Republican candidates a cheap get-out-of-jail-free card whenever they don't like a question: Just attack the moderator as a liberal stooge determined to get Hillary Clinton elected president. Though it may have seemed like a victory, getting former Bill Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos to recuse himself from moderating a Republican debate came at a cost: The candidates won't be able to reject any of Stephanopoulos' challenging questions out of hand. Then again, they'll just do what they would have done to Stephanopoulos to his replacement. It's easy to get away with it in an auditorium packed with spectators who have been conditioned to believe that all non-Fox media outlets are carrying out an Alinsky-ite agenda to institute full communism. The campaigns' plan to send a joint letter to all upcoming debate hosts demanding certain concessions fell apart as quickly as it came together. Several candidates began to recognize that they were looking like hilarious whiners hostile to the principles of a free press by insisting on, say, final approval over what infographics would air. The most recent version of the letter has been excised of some of its more immediately mockable planks but so far has few signatories beyond the insecure front-runner who first proposed it, Ben Carson. While this may look like an embarrassment on the campaigns' part, the failure of the effort will allow the candidates to keep the ""biased moderators"" excuse in their back pockets. That ensures that candidates who are unable to defend themselves in tight spots will simply call the moderators liberal liars and get away with it. There's only one answer, aside from the candidates themselves getting sudden infusions of dignity. It may not be feasible at this point in the 2016 cycle, but it's something to consider as they draft the 2020 or 2024 rules: Just let Fox host all of the Republican debates. Fox hosted the first and so far best debate. Its moderators, Bret Baier, Chris Wallace, and Megyn Kelly, were able to rattle off plenty of worthwhile questions without suffering too much whiny blowback. Yes, yes, the one big exception being Donald Trump, who may have hypothesized that Kelly was menstruating. The reaction that earned from other campaigns and conservatives voices, though, was neither agreement nor even a more appropriately worded criticism of Kelly's questioning. It was a total defense of Kelly and her journalistic credentials. And she asked  questions that were just as, if not more, pointed than anything the flappy-mouthed stock pickers of CNBC could muster. Fox is the answer to this debate drama in the same way that Rep. Paul Ryan was the answer to the leadership crisis in the House of Representatives. Ryan was the only figure with enough of a conservative pedigree to earn the support of all House factions. Though we'll see how things go [ominous music], Ryan's credibility theoretically gives him more leeway to conduct the nation's business without complaints about how he doesn't have conservatives' interests at heart. Fox could ask the same questions that stealth Marxist-Leninist agents like CNBC's John Harwood would without the criticism about it trying to ruin the election for Republicans. Why, Fox might even have the latitude to press for follow-up questions when candidates are blatantly lying. It's a whole new world of possibilities! Just let Fox do it all. Surely Fox would be fine with this, since they'd make an enormous amount of money selling advertisements. And the candidates themselves, who have been calling for Republicans to moderate the Republican debates, would have no choice but to smile at the arrangement--even as they recognize that their liberal media bogeyman has been taken away.

It's an oft-repeated line that's irksome not just for its condescension but also its fatally flawed logic: Voting is a pretty clear expression of one's self-interest, so it's impossible, really, to vote against one's self-interest. And last night a majority of Kentucky voters weighed the factors and found it in their net self-interest to vote for Bevin. Kentucky is the latest Southern state during the Obama era to shed its decades-long Democratic dominance on the state level. As in Tennessee or Arkansas, voters whose families have been voting Democrat for state-level offices for generations are now aligning their state preferences with their federal ones. These are red states now, and the unpopularity of Barack Obama was enough to outweigh whatever unpopular policies Bevin supported. One of the items that Kentucky voters determined was not as important to them as installing a Republican governor was the state's successful, full implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Aside from the recent collapse of a state health insurance co-op, Kentucky's relatively glitch-free state-run insurance exchange, Kynect, and acceptance of the law's Medicaid expansion have been widely recognized successes. The state's uninsured population dropped 40 percent between 2013 and 2014, according to Census figures released this fall, and the number has continued to plummet. The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Families estimates that by now roughly 400,000 Kentuckians have taken advantage of the ACA's Medicaid expansion, while another 100,000 have signed up for private insurance through Kynect. What Bevin must now decide is the extent to which he's willing to rescind coverage from the newly insured. Republicans on the federal level will be paying close attention. If he claws back insurance from people who vote Republican but also enjoy their health coverage, will he pay a significant political price? Bevin's gradual scale-back of his position to eliminate any and all traces of Obamacare from Kentucky soil suggests that Republican leaders, when faced with the prospect of actually doing what they've been promising to do since Obamacare was enacted, will back off. When Bevin was running to Sen. Mitch McConnell's right, he was for total repeal of the law and hit McConnell for not pushing hard enough on that. Bevin moderated his opposition from full-scale obliteration of the law as he prepared to assume a governor's office that, by nature of the way outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear implemented the ACA, has powerful discretion to dismantle it. As Slate's Jordan Weissmann writes, Bevin has pledged to trash the Kynect exchange and transfer the state's insurance shoppers to a federal one. Several states have sent their customers to federally facilitated exchanges, but many of them did so because the exchanges they tried to set up turned out to be lemons. Kynect worked, so ... what's going on here? In any event, the bottom line is that Kentuckians will still be able to purchase individual coverage on exchanges. The Medicaid expansion, from which the bulk of the ACA's reductions in uninsured populations have come, is under much more risk. Up until recently Bevin was speaking quite clearly (in fundraising letters, at least) about his desire to repeal the state's Medicaid expansion. He has since said that he plans to reject the Medicaid expansion Beshear accepted--in which Medicaid, the public program, is simply made available to more people--and would seek a federal waiver and grant money to implement a more customized, private plan-focused expansion similar to the one Arkansas pioneered. (The future of Arkansas' expansion itself is in question. The state elected a Republican governor in the 2014 election who is still determining how to negotiate his right-wing campaign with the practicalities of governance.) For states that didn't accept the Medicaid expansion at all in the beginning, moving to a more limited agreement is good for the uninsured. For states like Kentucky, though, that accepted the Medicaid expansion wholesale, moving toward a ""customized"" plan will inevitably cost some residents their insurance via stricter eligibility requirements. Much of Kentucky's shift toward Republican control stems from Democrats' losses in the eastern, Appalachian part of the state, where poverty is high but coal is king. ""Bevin pulled some of his best numbers in Kentucky's impoverished eastern counties,"" the Washington Post writes, ""where enrollment had been highest."" The ""tweaks"" to the Medicaid expansion, as Bevin more recently has been terming them, will test Democrats' belief that Republicans won't actually follow through on their rhetoric about taking back coverage that's already been granted because it would turn off beneficiaries who are culturally disposed to voting Republican. If Bevin undoes much of Kentucky's ACA success story and his popularity collapses, those many Republican presidential candidates who've pledged to do away with Obamacare root and branch might take note. If he does so and it has no discernible effect on his support, though, Republicans will feel much more comfortable going after the law if they recover the White House in 2016."

It didn't even remove it for two months. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ""should finally free us from the cycle of shutdown threats and last-minute fixes,"" President Obama said while signing the agreement Monday. All the weight of the world rests on that ""should."" A lot of things should happen. Donald Trump and Ben Carson should drop in presidential polls. Twitter should maintain stars and not replace them with dumb little twee hearts. Tom Brady should be exiled to outer space. The 114th Congress, similarly, should have a smooth appropriations ride now that the budget agreement has resolved the thorniest aspect of the spending process: setting top-line funding numbers. House Republicans, with their flashy new hot-shot speaker, should offer their input and then do whatever the new boss says to avoid embarrassing him this early in his tenure over some ideological fantasy. But things are going to get a little bumpier than they should. Now that the framework for funding the rest of the fiscal year is agreed upon, Congress must pass the actual appropriations by Dec. 11 as agreed to under the short-term continuing resolution passed at the end of September. You'll recall back then that Congress was barreling toward a shutdown over certain demands from the House Freedom Caucus. They wouldn't vote for any funding measure that gave Planned Parenthood access to federal dollars, and they would attempt to oust Speaker John Boehner if he called up and passed with Democratic votes a bill that funded Planned Parenthood. So Boehner offered to topple himself instead and passed the two-and-a-half-month extension as a lame duck. There's no indication that House conservatives will be more receptive to funding Planned Parenthood by Dec. 11 than they were in September, and the appropriations process can get bogged down by riders that are slapped onto the hide of massive spending bills. The Planned Parenthood rider is just one potential escapade that could jam everything up. Can't you already hear the House conservatives, more than a month out, going on about how Congress has the power of the purse and that's why Republicans should be able to get whatever-the-hell ideological demands they want in December? ""This is the legislative branch and the power of the purse rests within the legislative branch,"" says one of them, ""and we fully expect that we are going to exercise that power."" This same fellow then muttered something about how House Republicans must ""go on offense on ideas."" Perhaps ideas such as, say, not allowing Medicaid reimbursements for medical procedures at Planned Parenthood? He wouldn't say one way or another. Those were the words of nine-term Wisconsin Rep. Paul D. Ryan, who's now the speaker of the House. He delivered them in his first weekly press conference Tuesday along with some other rainbow-sparkle happy talk about how he'll allow open amendment on everything, forever, starting with the (also vital and therefore impossible) highway bill that the chamber will take up first. The hope (ha!) is that Ryan either has some understanding with the conservatives in his conference or at least will be given some leeway. Because a package that includes riders to defund Planned Parenthood or whatever else--repeal Obamacare, defund executive actions on immigration, require President Obama's resignation, criminalize association with the Democratic Party--will face a presidential veto, if it even gets that far. During budget negotiations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asked his Democratic counterpart Sen. Harry Reid to ""relax their filibusters on appropriations bills as part of the budget deal,"" according to Politico. Reid said no, and one imagines him laughing while saying so. McConnell then asked for a looser understanding, at least, and got the same response. What will need to happen in the end is that appropriators--Democrat and Republican, House and Senate--sit down and hash out some omnibus agreement that's acceptable to majorities in both houses (and 60 in the Senate) and the White House. That means the sort of backroom deal-cutting that the Freedom Caucus and Ryan himself have vowed to move away from, and it also means all sorts of unpalatable giveaways to K Street that leaders hope no one has the time to read, process, and mobilize against. Appropriations deals mean eating a lot of dirt in exchange for a lot of good. It's also just sort of The Way Things Are. Ryan is going to have to come up with some red-meat shiny object in this process if he wants to avoid instantly depleting his political capital. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, one of the chattier Freedom Caucus members, told reporters last week that Ryan has to win ""at least something better than we would have gotten under Mr. Boehner."" As with all of Boehner's deals, expect the focus to be much more on what Ryan didn't get than on what he did."	Paul Ryan Is Already Facing His First Shutdown Fight as House Speaker
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/marco_rubio_is_lying_about_hillary_clinton_lying.html	"Marco Rubio speaks with confidence. That's a big reason why Republican donors are turning away from Jeb Bush and toward Rubio: They see the Florida senator as a more forceful spokesman for conservatism. Political reporters are dazzled, too. They see Rubio as the emerging ""establishment"" candidate, ready to take on the know-nothings--Donald Trump and Ben Carson--and the scorched-earth ideologue, Sen. Ted Cruz. But is Rubio really a mainstream candidate? Or is he, like Cruz, a man who says with firm conviction things that just aren't true? In last week's Republican debate, Rubio blasted Clinton's Oct. 22 testimony about the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. During the hearing, Clinton addressed criticisms that the Obama administration had blamed an anti-Muslim video for inspiring the attack. Here's how Rubio described her testimony:"	Marco Rubio Has Decided His Best Strategy Is to Lie About Hillary Clinton and Benghazi
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/republican_national_committee_chairman_pulls_out_of_nbc_s_february_debate.html	"There were real problems with the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colorado, hosted by CNBC. Yes, the moderators typically asked sharp, policy-focused questions. They pushed outsider candidates like Ben Carson and Donald Trump to explain ambitious plans to cut taxes and remove unauthorized immigrants, and they questioned plans from more establishment candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Chris Christie. At the same time, the moderators couldn't manage the candidates, who monologued, ignored requests, and largely drove the speed and direction of the debate. Which is to say that Republicans were in control of the night. Still, they were angry. Sen. Ted Cruz won huge applause with a tirade against the moderators. ""This is not a cage match,"" he decried. ""And, you look at the questions: 'Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?' 'Ben Carson, can you do math?' "" Rubio did the same. ""It was the week [Hillary Clinton] got exposed as a liar. ... But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media."" After the debate, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus voiced his frustration with this alleged media bias. ""CNBC should be ashamed of how this debate was handled,"" he said on Twitter. On Friday, acting on this anger, the RNC announced it would end its partnership with NBC (and Univision) and withdraw from an upcoming debate in February. ""While debates are meant to include tough questions and contrast candidates' visions and policies for the future of America, CNBC's moderators engaged in a series of 'gotcha' questions, petty and mean-spirited in tone, and designed to embarrass our candidates,"" Priebus said in a letter to NBC News. NBC has issued a response. ""This is a disappointing development. However, along with our debate broadcast partners at Telemundo we will work in good faith to resolve this matter with the Republican Party,"" it said. But it's honestly hard to see how this is possible. Priebus notwithstanding, CNBC asked tough, fair-minded questions. It's just that the candidates didn't like them. Carl Quintanilla asked Ben Carson about his involvement with a company called Mannatech, which makes nutritional supplements. Carson has appeared in the company's videos and ostensibly endorsed its products, which it claims can cure autism and cancer. It's a real problem for his campaign and his image as a clean, honest figure. Yet Carson called the question ""propaganda."" Later, Quintanilla asked Rubio about his finances, from ""a lack of bookkeeping skills"" to concerns over his use of campaign and Florida Republican Party cash. Rubio's response? ""You just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all."" But this is nonsense. These are serious questions about Rubio's past, and they deserve an answer. The problem, put simply, is that the Florida senator doesn't want to hear them. You saw this again when John Harwood asked Rubio about his tax plan and its benefits for middle-class families. ""The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale,"" he said. ""Since you're the champion of Americans living paycheck-to- paycheck, don't you have that backward?"" This is true, and less favorable analyses find huge benefits for the rich and comparatively small ones for everyone else. Rubio, however, didn't answer the question. Instead, he made a different point entirely--""In fact, the largest after-tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan."" And conservatives--taking Rubio's side--accused Harwood of lying. You can play this game for the entire debate. When Cruz went on his anti-media rant, it was following a substantive question about his rhetoric and approach: ""Congressional Republicans, Democrats, and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown, and calm financial markets that fear of--another Washington-created crisis is on the way. Does your opposition to it show that you're not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?"" Again, this wasn't unfair. Cruz just didn't want to answer it. The entire night, Republicans trafficked in half-truths and falsehoods, from Christie's misleading claim that Social Security was bankrupt (which came directly after he promised to ""be honest with the people watching at home"") to Carly Fiorina's invented ""fact"" that ""92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women."" Which brings us back to Priebus' letter. The problem isn't that CNBC engaged in ""gotcha"" questions meant to ""embarrass"" the Republican candidates. It's that any serious look is a fatal blow to GOP plans and proposals, which don't deliver on promised substance. Trump can't deport millions of immigrants; Carson can't raise enough revenue to fund the federal government; and the ""middle-class"" tax plans of Bush, Rubio, and others shower most of their benefits on the rich. And as long as this is true, GOP candidates will have a hard time with all but the most friendly moderators. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

OK, I'm too short and bespectacled to scare someone, but I am our blood-red website's home page editor during nights and weekends. When the moon glows and pigskins fly, I decide which Slate pieces to promote on our home page, watching traffic and writing headlines to entrap all who enter Slate.com. OoOOoooo! Like many monsters, my powers defy and befuddle: I also copy edit for Slate, excising unsuspecting commas and surgically inserting en-dashes wherever I see fit. I've also written about your number of sex partners, the legend of Hersh and Bin Laden, and the dress. Most recently, I started haunting inboxes everywhere with our Today in Slate newsletter. It's a daily email that aims to share which Slate stories to read, watch, or listen to if you want to understand the world. Which can be tough in our mysterious realm of vampire bats, loose blimps, and Ted Cruz; I'm here to help. If you like Slate Plus newsletters, I promise you'll like it. Please subscribe! This week, Slate offered a terrifying panoply of pieces to feature on the home page and in the newsletter. Monday, both prominently showcased Will Oremus' outstanding story about adaptive learning technologies. In the ancient past, teachers taught students with lessons delivered on paper, blackboards, and in lectures. Today, artificial intelligence is killing the textbook. The old bind-and-ink companies are betting their futures on educational computer programs that respond to students' abilities and weaknesses, developing courses for each kid's needs. This might revolutionize education, but it raises practical, ethical, and philosophical questions, too: How much of learning can really be automated? Do we want companies to collect and potentially sell data about children's learning? What do students want and need from a teacher? Will's piece is a fascinating investigation into a promising tool that will soon be in schools across America. I really appreciated this clear-eyed explanation of the bacon-will-give-you-cancer story; this knowing, skeptical look at the chatter that Luke Skywalker will be evil in the new Star Wars movie; Katy Waldman's ellipsis exegesis; and my copy deskmate Heather Schwedel's polemic against long-sleeved shirts masquerading as shorter-sleeved shirts. All were more delightful than Wednesday's Republican debate, during which candidates feared the truth and rational tax plans, CNBC's moderators lost control and authority, and Jeb bombed. (He also inspired a ""Bush is doomed"" media narrative that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.) And if the debate caused you to wonder about the broader state of political dysfunction, I recommend Lily Hay Newman's conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson about pols who mangle science and Jim Newell's look at the Freedom Caucus's cowardly refusal to level with voters about what's possible in Washington. Ultraconservative congressmen win campaigns by promising voters the end of Obamacare and Planned Parenthood, but since they need the president and Senate to sign off on legislation, that is impossible, full stop. Would be nice and even brave if they'd admit it. The week's scariest story was Dahlia Lithwick's piece about crime lab scandals, most egregiously in Massachusetts, where tens of thousands of people were wrongfully convicted because a chemist and a drug-addicted lab technician tampered with evidence. These injustices created a horrifying problem that has ruined many, many lives and has no simple solution. Speaking of justice, I also recommend Leon Neyfakh's Q&A with one of the authors of a provocative study questioning the myth that ex-cons usually return to prison. The Mets' struggles are mythic in their own right, and as a fan, I still gotta believe Mike Pesca's argument for why they should be the World Series favorites, instead of the Royals, who are proving their case through the first two games. I've been casting spells on the Kansas City players before the series shifts to Queens Friday night, so if the Metropolitans win, you'll know why. Happy Halloween!

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/republican_presidential_candidates_attack_the_truth_in_cnbc_debate_ted_cruz.html	"Half an hour into Wednesday's Republican presidential debate, Sen. Ted Cruz exploded at the CNBC moderators. ""The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media,"" Cruz fumed. ""You look at the questions: 'Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?' 'Ben Carson, can you do math?' 'John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?' 'Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?' 'Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?' How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?"" By the end of the evening, Cruz, Carson, Trump, Rubio, and several other candidates had declared war on the press. They claimed to speak for the Republican Party, the American people, and the truth. These candidates are deluded. Many of their statements were falsified on the spot. Others were exposed as absurd by their opponents. It's true that the debate exposed a division within the country. But the division isn't between the press and the public. It's between people who listen to evidence--reporters, policy analysts, and many Democrats and Republicans--and an impervious, defiant wing of the GOP. Take Cruz's speech. It doesn't even match the debate transcript. To begin with, nobody called Trump a villain. CNBC's John Harwood asked Trump how he would fulfill his promises to ""build a wall and make another country pay for it"" (Mexico), ""send 11 million people out of the country"" (undocumented immigrants), and ""cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit."" Second, nobody asked Carson whether he could do math. CNBC's Becky Quick asked Carson how he would close the $1 trillion gap between current federal spending and the revenue projected from Carson's 15 percent flat tax. Third, nobody asked Kasich to insult his colleagues. Kasich volunteered that Trump's and Carson's promises were impractical and incoherent. All of these questions were substantive. In fact, Cruz's speech was a diversion from the query that had been posed to him--namely, why did he oppose this week's agreement to raise the debt limit? Trump had no answers to the questions about mass deportation, his $10 trillion shortfall, or the magical Mexican wall fund. He cited his own bankruptcies as a model for fixing the national debt. ""I've used [bankruptcy] three times, maybe four times. Came out great,"" said Trump. ""That is what I could do for the country: We owe $19 trillion. Boy, am I good at solving debt problems."" Carson, when confronted with his own tax shortfall, suggested that his tax rate was flexible and claimed that he could make up the difference by cutting unspecified waste. As the evening wore on, it became increasingly obvious that Trump, Carson, and their allies onstage didn't just have a problem with the press. They had problems with fellow Republicans. Harwood brought up Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman who recently declared that the GOP, hijacked by the ""know-nothingism of the far right,"" had forfeited Bernanke's allegiance. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed Bernanke's criticism as ""arrogance"" and said it showed why the Fed should be audited. Paul, one-upping Cruz and Rubio--who had already celebrated the resignation of House Speaker John Boehner--spurned Boehner's likely replacement, Paul Ryan, as ""more of the same."" Despite the efforts of Cruz, Carson, and Rubio to draw a wall of denial around all the candidates, reality leaked in. Kasich debunked his colleagues' tax, budget, and deportation math. Bush backed up Harwood's summary of a nonpartisan critique of Trump's tax plan. When Trump insisted he could balance the budget without changing Medicare or Social Security, Bush corrected him. Two other presidential candidates who spoke during the 6 p.m. undercard debate--Sen. Lindsey Graham, who affirmed the truth of climate change, and former Gov. George Pataki, who criticized Republican foolishness about vaccines and carbon emissions--rounded out the GOP's sanity caucus. The main debate had its share of nonsense. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee said he would cut health care costs by curing Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, tried to blame the collapse of her company's stock on the NASDAQ slide, even though, as Quick pointed out, HP's stock ""was a much worse performer"" than the market as a whole. Bush calculated how many people had fallen into poverty since ""the day that Barack Obama got elected,"" thereby blaming Obama for what happened in the last two and a half months of Bush's brother's administration. The candidate who attacked the media most directly and self-destructively was Trump. He accused Harwood of lying about CNBC's original plan for a two-hour debate. Carson later joined in the accusation. But after the debate, the Washington Post's Erik Wemple quoted an archived press release that vindicated Harwood. Trump also said the military servicemen killed by an attacker in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July died because ""they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.""* But the Post's fact checkers pointed out that the servicemen had weapons, and at least one fired back. Most egregiously, Trump denied that he had called Rubio ""Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator"" for promoting immigrant tech-worker visas, and he suggested that Quick had concocted the allegation. When Quick read aloud the quote from Trump's own website, Trump shrugged it off. But the biggest surprise of the night wasn't Trump. It was Rubio. Having clawed his way above Bush in the electable-candidates bracket, the Florida senator chose to stand not with the sanity caucus, but with the deniers. When Harwood quoted a nonpartisan assessment of how Rubio's tax plan would affect after-tax income--a 28 percent increase for the top 1 percent of earners, and a 15 percent increase for the middle class--Rubio dismissed the gap, falsely, as an artifact of scale, since ""5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand."" When Rubio was asked about his messy finances--a second-home foreclosure, a prematurely liquidated retirement fund, campaign money accidentally mixed with personal money--he pleaded poverty. He ignored Quick's reminder that ""you made over a million dollars on a book deal, and some of these problems came after that."" Then Rubio went ballistic. He exclaimed: ""Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It's called the mainstream media."" As evidence, Rubio said the press had covered up Hillary Clinton's lies about Benghazi. ""She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that [the attack] was because of a video,"" said Rubio. That's completely false. Clinton's first statement on Benghazi, delivered on the night of the attack, didn't specify a motive. It spoke of people who used an anti-Muslim video to justify the attack, not to motivate it. The next day, Clinton said the victims died when ""heavily armed militants assaulted the compound."" A thorough review by Factcheck.org found no evidence Clinton had blamed the video during that time. What happened in this debate wasn't an attack by the press on the candidates. It was an attack by the candidates on the press. Harwood, Quick, and the other CNBC panelists were no harsher to the Republicans on Wednesday than CNN's Anderson Cooper was to Clinton and other Democrats in their debate two weeks ago. What was different this time was the reaction. Presented with facts and figures that didn't fit their story, the leading Republican candidates accused the moderators of malice and deceit. Arguing with the press is a constitutional right, and it's part of a healthy society. But when the topic is economics, and when everyone is watching, you're taking a risk. The risk is that your assertions can be checked against the historical record and the calculator. Your story can be falsified. Yes, reporters sometimes screw up. But they have a troublesome habit of checking things. That's what makes their statements, on the whole, more reliable than yours. It's not true, as Stephen Colbert once joked, that reality has a liberal bias. But it is true that reality has a bias toward journalists. That's because journalists spend a lot of time with reality. They get to know it. Over the course of a campaign, you can learn a lot. Some of what you learn is about truth: which tax plan adds up, which promises are realistic, which view of the world most closely matches what's being reported. But much of what you learn is about people: which candidates adjust to reality, and which don't. In this cohort of Republicans, a bubble seems to be forming. On the outside are Kasich, Bush, Pataki, and Graham. On the inside are Trump, Carson, and Cruz. The candidates inside the bubble are doing well. Rubio is trying to join them. But bubbles don't last.

He had to show donors and voters that he was a fighter, with life in his campaign--that he could stand up to Donald Trump, take on Sen. Marco Rubio, and emerge as a front-runner for the GOP nomination. In other words, it was do or die. And Bush died. The debate clock tells the whole story; next to Sen. Rand Paul, who fell to the bottom, Bush had the least speaking time of any candidate on stage. Worse, he was on the losing end of a tough exchange. Early in the night, the former Florida governor came out swinging against his erstwhile protege, Rubio. ""Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,"" said Bush, hitting Rubio on his absence from the U.S. Senate. ""You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job."" Bush had a hit. Rubio was supposed to stumble. But he didn't. Instead, he accused Bush of playing politics in the most brutal way possible."	Jeb Died on That Stage

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/jeb_bush_must_do_well_in_the_third_gop_debate_if_the_former_governor_falters.html	"Tonight, Jeb Bush sinks or swims. For the past month, since the last Republican presidential debate, the erstwhile front-runner has struggled to capture ground and stake a position. On his flank are Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who draw crowds and dollars with an anti-establishment--and often anti-Bush--message. Close behind is Sen. Marco Rubio, who offers the same message as Bush with a fresh face and the promise of a more diverse, cosmopolitan party. And in front, blocking movement, are Bush's own two feet. Faced with the fraught legacy of his brother George W. Bush, Jeb has floundered, defending an unpopular presidency against tough attacks on both sides of the aisle. All of this has pulled Bush from a second-place spot in the Republican presidential race with double-digit support to somewhere in the vast middle of the pack. And while Bush has cash on hand--overwhelmingly from elite spenders--his donors are impatient with his performance. If the former Florida governor can't deliver, it might be time for a different candidate to claim the establishment mantle. This isn't as straightforward as it looks. Rubio looks like the natural choice: He's a young, gifted communicator with a strong biography and orthodox Republican views. But Rubio the candidate hasn't caught up with Rubio the idea. His fundraising lags behind that of his rivals; in the last quarter, he raised $5.7 million, compared to $20.8 million for Ben Carson, $13.4 million for Bush, and $12.2 million for Cruz. And like Bush, most of this cash comes from the wealthiest contributors--just 22 percent of Rubio's support came from small donors. That said, he also falls short on super PAC support--Carson's super PAC raised $11.3 million, while Cruz's raised $13.8 million. Rubio's modest fundraising translates to a slim operation. Compared to his competitors, he has few offices and staff, focusing on volunteer recruitment. The upside is that--if Rubio can attract substantial volunteer support--he can quickly organize in Iowa and New Hampshire, where he's spent relatively little time. The downside, as one GOP source explained to Politico, is that this is an ""unpredictable and risky bet that traditional campaign organizing doesn't matter."" If it doesn't pay off, the junior senator from Florida is finished. It's also worth noting the degree to which Rubio has escaped serious scrutiny from either opponents or media. On the former, everyone--and especially Bush--is dealing with Trump, who spits insults like a battle rapper but is almost invulnerable to the same. Bush's team has knocked Rubio as a ""GOP Obama,"" but that's a compliment--Barack Obama won a tough primary and two presidential elections with a majority of the vote--as much as an attack on his youth and inexperience. Likewise, in the media, Rubio has been hyped as the de facto front-runner--a Republican savior. The truth, however, is we don't actually know how Rubio performs against strong attacks and intense scrutiny. He wasn't ignored in the last two debates, but he wasn't the focus either--then, the title round was Trump vs. Bush and Trump vs. Fiorina. Tonight, he could stumble as much as he could break out of the pack. And if it's the latter, he'll face the full--and likely hostile--attention of everyone. Rubio is a talented, savvy politician. But that kind of scrutiny is a test, and it's not clear Rubio will pass, especially if it goes beyond theater criticism of his style and into uncomfortable questions about his background in Florida state politics. Bush and Rubio are under the spotlight at tonight's debate, but there's another figure who deserves our attention--Ted Cruz. Like Carson, he's a prodigious fundraiser, but he draws support from grass-roots donors and wealthy contributors. ""The structure of his donor base,"" notes the Washington Post, ""closely resembles that of President Obama, whose vaunted fundraising operation intensely focused on low-dollar givers as well as major bundlers, bringing in a record $783 million for his 2012 reelection."" He sits at the crossroads of the Republican Party--socially conservative, hawkish, anti-tax, and pro-business interests--and has attracted support from mainstream GOP elites as well as right-wing activists. He stands at 6.6 percent in the polls, but with a respectable resume (Harvard Law School, the U.S. Senate), anti-establishment bona fides (the 2013 government shutdown), and real inroads with the religious right (he announced at the evangelical Liberty University in Virginia and is holding a rally at Bob Jones University in South Carolina), he's poised to inherit Trump and Carson voters if either candidate leaves the race. And this is to say nothing of a serious campaign operation in Iowa, New Hampshire, and beyond. For as much as we're focused on Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, and Ben Carson, Wednesday's debate might be the night that Ted Cruz steps on stage as the one to beat in the Republican presidential race."

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/spring_valley_high_school_resource_officer_ben_field_s_violent_arrest_of.html	"The video is shocking. A young woman--a student at Spring Valley High School in Columbia, South Carolina--is sitting at her desk. A police officer stands over her. He asks her to leave, and she refuses. Suddenly, he tosses her back in her desk, picks her up, and drags her to the front of the classroom, where he arrests her. Her classmates are watching, and they give vital context. ""She really hadn't done anything wrong,"" said one student, Tony Robinson Jr., who gave his account to a local news station. The girl was working on her laptop and took out her phone. The teacher asked for the phone, and she refused. ""She said that she had took her phone out, but it was only for a quick second,"" said Robinson. The teacher called in an administrator, who asked the young woman to leave. She wouldn't. In turn, the administrator called the school's ""resource officer,"" Ben Fields. It's at this point that students start recording, and we see what happens next. After arresting the young woman, Fields threatens another student with the same. Fields, a sheriff's deputy, has a troubled history in law enforcement. ""In 2007,"" reports the New York Times, ""Carlos Martin and his wife, Tashiana Martin, sued Officer Fields, Sheriff Lott, and another deputy, Robert Clark, for violating their civil rights during a routine investigation of a noise complaint."" In the encounter, says the complaint, Fields slammed Carlos Martin to the ground, handcuffed him, kicked him, and emptied a can of pepper spray into his face. He also confiscated a cellphone that Tashiana Martin had used to record the event, handcuffed her, and threw her to the ground as well. The lawsuit went forward, but a jury eventually ruled in favor of the deputy. Fields was sued again in 2013 by a former student at Spring Valley who had been expelled for ""unlawful assembly of gang activity and assault and battery."" The lawsuit, notes the Times, says that Fields ""unfairly and recklessly targets African-American students with allegations of gang membership and criminal gang activity."" It's easy to treat all of this as isolated behavior from an overly aggressive police officer and a teacher who couldn't manage his classroom without outside authority. But the fact is that this incident--where police force, normally reserved for criminal offenders, was used to discipline a student--is incredibly common. Since 1995, juvenile incarceration has dropped by more than 40 percent. In the same time frame, however, out-of-school suspensions have increased 10 percent, doubling the total from 1970. As reporters Dara Lind and Libby Nelson explain for Vox, this stems from several trends. The crime waves of the 1980s and early 1990s sparked deep concern in schools across the country. In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed the Gun-Free Schools Act, which mandated specific penalties for carrying weapons in schools. Zero tolerance was national policy, and school districts devised their own codes meant to stop minor incidents before they blossomed into major ones, a public school analogue to the ""broken windows"" policies in places like New York City. What's more, crime fears--as well as the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado--led to more police officers in schools as well: The number of ""school resource officers"" increased 38 percent to more than 13,000 in 2007, up from 9,446 in 1997. In practice, however, zero-tolerance policies became grounds for suspending students over relatively minor offenses, like disrupting and skipping class, or shooting spit balls. And school resource officers became the first option instead of a last resort, as teachers and administrators increasingly used law enforcement to handle routine discipline. In public school districts around the country, arrests have increased with the presence of school resource officers, even as juvenile crime rates have decreased. Even adjusting for poverty--which tends to correlate with safety--the total arrest rate in schools with officers was almost three times the rate for schools without them. ""About 92,000 students were arrested in school during the 2011-2012 school year,"" notes Vox. ""And most of those were low-level violations."" As is often true, from the war on drugs to mass incarceration, the brunt of this punitive policy falls hardest on black and Latino Americans. From 1972 to 2010, the school suspension rate for whites in middle and high school climbed from 6 percent to 7.1 percent. For Latinos it climbed from 6.1 to 12 percent. For blacks it more than doubled from 11.8 percent to 24.3 percent. In 2007, 70 percent of in-school arrests were of black and Latino students. Overall, according to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than white students, 16 percent versus 5 percent. This is true for all ages: ""Black children,"" notes the DOE, ""represent 18 percent of preschool enrollment, but 48 percent of preschool children receiving more than one out-of-school suspension."" White students, by contrast, ""represent 43 percent of preschool enrollment but 26 percent of preschool children receiving more than one out-of-school suspension."" Students of color with disabilities are also more likely to be restrained or suspended: Black students constitute 21 percent of all students with disabilities, but 44 percent of those subject to mechanical restraints. In some states, suspension rates are almost unbelievable. In the 2011-2012 school year, Missouri suspended 14.4 percent of its black elementary students, compared with just 1.8 percent of its white students. Florida suspended 5.1 percent of its elementary students and 19 percent of its middle and high school students. And Wisconsin suspended a mind-blowing 34 percent of all enrolled black students in a single year. It should be said that, echoing the incident at Spring Valley High School, black girls--and dark-skinned black girls in particular--are disproportionately punished in schools. ""Black girls in public elementary and secondary schools nationwide were suspended at a rate of 12 percent, compared with a rate of just 2 percent for white girls, and more than girls of any other race or ethnicity,"" writes the New York Times, adding that ""black girls with the darkest skin tones were three times more likely to be suspended than black girls with the lightest skin."" You might look at this and wonder if it's behavior. Do black and Latino students act worse than white ones? Do black girls behave worse than white ones? The answer is no. ""Despite higher rates of school suspensions for black, latino, and Native American students, there appear to be few racial differences in the offenses most likely to lead to zero tolerance policy violations,"" write researchers at Indiana University. Instead, these students are referred for less serious and more subjective offenses. In general, notes the Kirwan Institute at Ohio State University, ""Research suggests that when given an opportunity to choose among several disciplinary options for a relatively minor offense, teachers and school administrators often choose more severe punishment for black students than for white students for the same offense."" In fact, according to one study of Texas schools, 97 percent of suspensions were the choice of administrators, as only 3 percent of students had broken rules that required such punishment. But the weight of those discretionary suspensions fell on black students--they were 31 percent more likely to be suspended, even controlling for a host of other variables. At all ages, black students are perceived as more dangerous and unruly. And to that point, at least one analysis shows that teachers hold lower expectations of black and Latino children compared with their white peers. When mixed with zero-tolerance discipline and school police officers, you have a recipe for wide disparities in treatment. A 2011 study of North Carolina schools from the National Education Policy Center found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for first-time offense of cellphone use at school, compared with just 15 percent of white students. For a first-time offense of public display of affection, almost 43 percent of accused black students were suspended, compared with about 15 percent of white students. This dovetails with similar research in other states. In schools as in life, black Americans are punished worse for the same offenses as their white peers. And the consequences are terrible: Suspended students are more likely to drop out of school, and suspensions increase the odds of arrest and juvenile detention. Here's the truth: What happened at Spring Valley High wasn't an exception or a scandal. It's how things work for black students. And if you're feeling cynical, it's how they're supposed to work, with segregated or predominantly black schools feeding the maw of our nearly insatiable prison system."	The Most Shocking Thing About a Black Student Being Violently Arrested Is How Common It Is
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/bernie_sanders_attacks_hillary_clinton_at_the_jefferson_jackson_dinner_is.html	"We remember the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Dinner because of the speeches. In 2007, a still-struggling Sen. Barack Obama gave the speech that defined his message--""change we can believe in""--and transformed his campaign. But speeches are just a small part of this event. Overwhelmingly, the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Dinner is a test run for campaign infrastructure. Can you bring supporters to a full day of events? Can you use that to expand your reach in the state? Can you demonstrate enthusiasm by bringing those supporters to the dinner itself, where people holler and cheer for candidates like spectators at a game (or teenagers at a student government conference)? The answer for the two largest campaigns in the state--Hillary Clinton's and Sen. Bernie Sanders'--was a clear yes. Saturday morning, Clinton volunteers manned posts around the convention area, cheering every car that drove into downtown Des Moines or every person who walked by. Referencing Katy Perry's appearance that afternoon, a young man in a shark costume danced for those passing by, while a group of volunteers waved a cardboard cutout of Clinton. That afternoon, both campaigns held large rallies at sites around downtown. (Martin O'Malley also held a ""rally,"" where little more than a hundred people heard a brief speech and listened as he played the guitar.) An estimated 4,000 people gathered outside of the Hy-Vee Hall--where Iowa Democrats held the actual dinner that evening--to see Katy Perry perform for the Clinton campaign. Opening, of course, was Bill Clinton, who made an impassioned pitch for Hillary as the president America needs to protect and defend progressive gains from the Republican Party. ""Stop rewarding the strategy of destruction,"" he said, urging the crowd to oppose GOP antics in Congress. President Clinton wasn't just an advocate; he also showcased his much-heralded political skills to deal with an animal rights protester. ""We got it. Will you please quit now?"" he said to the man, who was moved offstage. Clinton turned then to the crowd and praised the heckler, making him a contrast to the Republican Party. ""At least that guy is for something. He didn't come here to bad-mouth anybody."" (Here, it's worth noting that if she's the nominee, Clinton will have the unusual advantage of campaigning with a popular ex-president, a well-liked sitting vice president, a decently liked outgoing president, and a popular first lady.) Just a few blocks away--across the river that divides downtown Des Moines--Sanders held his event. Smaller than Clinton's gathering--and much smaller than the usual Sanders rally, which draws thousands and thousands of people--it was almost low-key compared to Clinton's quasi-festival atmosphere. Still, it was lively. Outside the main space, volunteers collected signatures and information from attendees--to contact them later--while small vendors set up tables to sell assorted swag, including tracts on socialism. A plane flew over the crowd flying a ""Feel the Bern"" sign. A preacher revved up the crowd, while a drum line and step team of young black Americans practiced in preparation for the march to the dinner itself. When Sanders finally arrived, he gave a shortened and modified version of his stump speech, calling for a country where ""billionaires"" couldn't ""buy elections."" Sanders didn't say much about Clinton, but that wouldn't hold. At the dinner itself--cheered on by a large section of extraordinarily enthusiastic supporters (""Feel the Bern"" was a regular refrain, at times drowning out everything in the vicinity)--Sanders went on the attack for the first time of his campaign. ""[L]et me be clear about the current trade deal that we are debating in Congress,"" he said, referencing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. ""It is not now, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements. I did not support it yesterday. I do not support it today. And I will not support it tomorrow."" This was just the beginning. On same-sex marriage, climate, Wall Street, and the Iraq war, Sanders--following Obama's script of eight years earlier--hit Clinton on principle. ""Today, some are trying to rewrite history by saying they voted for one anti-gay law to stop something worse,"" he said, criticizing Clinton's remarks to Rachel Maddow on the Defense of Marriage Act. ""Let us be clear. That's just not true."" He continued: ""It gives me no joy to say that I was largely right about the war. I am proud to tell you when I came to that fork in the road I took the right road even though it was not the popular road at the time."" The message was simple: Hillary Clinton isn't a real progressive. Not like Sanders, at least. And if elected, there's no guarantee she'll stick with you. Since starting his campaign, Sanders has been single-minded in his focus on issues and ideas. Which makes this a real tonal shift. Bernie is going negative, and it could pull skeptical Democrats--who still aren't sure on Clinton--as much as it could alienate him with the broad Democratic middle he needs to win beyond Iowa and New Hampshire. O'Malley also had words for Clinton (and Sanders, for that matter), selling himself as a leader of ""action, not words,"" who isn't a ""weather vane that shifts its position every time the winds change."" Clinton just gave her stump speech. That's all. No mention of her performance before the Benghazi committee; no new policies or ideas; no mention of her opponents. If you've heard Clinton at any event in the past six months, you heard her at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. She was the only candidate to say ""black lives matter,"" and she pledged to ""fight"" for a country where ""there are no ceilings for anyone"" and ""where a father can tell his daughter, 'You can be anything you want to be, including the president of the United States of America.' "" Then again, if you're Clinton, there's no reason to switch gears. Iowa polls are close, but she--like Sanders--has built a formidable operation, informed by her 2008 loss to Obama. She's behind in New Hampshire, but again, Team Clinton is working at all cylinders. And nationally, Clinton is far ahead of Sanders, with a sturdy electoral firewall in states like South Carolina and Nevada, where she holds large majorities with black and Latino Democrats. The lesson from this Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, in other words, is that Clinton doesn't think she's going to lose and doesn't plan to start a serious fight with her only real opponent. Of course, Clinton tried this front-runner strategy in 2008, and it failed. Miserably. However, 2016 isn't 2008, and at this juncture, there's no sign that Sanders can reach behind his base in the left wing of the Democratic Party. But if he can, then--once again--Clinton might regret this choice to play it safe."	Is Bernie About to Go Negative?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/jon_meacham_s_new_george_h_w_bush_biography_the_former_president_s_revelations.html	"It's the old family story: A vice president turned president criticizes his former secretary of defense who served as vice president to his son, another president, causing his son, the president, to distance himself from his president father, and also causing his other son, who is not yet president but would like to be, to distance himself, too. When Jeb Bush announced that he was running for president, he said he was ""a guy who met his first president on the day he was born, and his second on the day he was brought home from the hospital."" Father and son relationships are tricky when everyone is in the same profession, but in a household that is thick with presidents, the awkward moments are inevitable. A new one has arrived with the publication of Jon Meacham's book about George H.W. Bush in which the former president weighs in on his son George W. Bush's presidency. In the book, Destiny and Power: The America Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st  president says that ""iron-ass"" Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld didn't serve his son, the 43rd  president, well. Cheney, who was secretary of defense under the elder Bush, ""set up his own State Department,"" according to the 41st president, and Rumsfeld was ""arrogant,"" never taking into account the views of those who disagreed with him. This is probably not what Jeb Bush wants anyone to be talking about right now as his campaign struggles: the mistakes associated with the Iraq invasion and the fascinating complexities of his family tree. That dynamic includes the fact that Rumsfeld had once wanted to be president and helped encourage Richard Nixon to send George H.W. Bush to China to remove a possible rival from the scene. Not long after the book's revelations were made public, both President George W. Bush and Jeb Bush praised Cheney. ""As it relates to Dick Cheney, he served my--my brother well as vice president, and he served my dad extraordinarily well as secretary of defense,"" said Jeb, who then went on to reflect on his father's possible motives. ""I think my dad, like a lotta people that love George, wanna try to create--a different narrative perhaps just to--just 'cause that's natural to do, right?"" You don't want to overdo the textual analysis of a son trying to cover for his father, but what Jeb seems to be saying is that people who love W. want to find some way to excuse the mistakes of his administration by blaming them on Cheney and Rumsfeld, which could mean two different things. Either people love W. so much they seek to excuse him even from the small mistakes of his administration by picking on Cheney. Or, the mistakes were so large that they pick on Cheney because they can't imagine beloved W. could have been responsible for them. In any event, there seems to be something about George W. Bush that has people who love him looking for a narrative. The father is getting a new narrative in the Meacham book, and it will be fascinating to engage in the conversation it starts during this campaign year. The question the book raises is whether everything about George H.W. Bush is outdated or whether he is a model the party and its president should return to--a noble kind of restraint in foreign policy based on diplomacy and a prudence in domestic affairs. Jeb Bush argues that the world has changed a lot since Cheney was secretary of defense. ""The context changes--we've gotta get beyond, I think, this feeling that, you know, somehow the 1991 is--is the same as 2001, which is the same as 2017. It isn't. The world has changed. It always changes."" (An aside: This is the argument for Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign, by the way. He makes the case he's got a special insight into today's world that makes Jeb's experience from a decade ago obsolete.) So is everything about George H.W. Bush's presidency outdated? At the moment, the GOP nominating conversation is dominated by efforts to show strength on every foreign front. Though as a candidate H.W. probably would be slinging the same hot rhetoric--he was a tough competitor--as a president he was far more diplomatic. (One of his critiques of his son in the book is over W.'s undiplomatic language.) On domestic issues, he was from a different era. His decision to accept a tax increase to make a budget deal with Democrats doesn't seem likely in today's GOP, where agreeing to tax increases is considered an unforgivable breach of faith. Jeb Bush once said that decision was the most courageous one taken by a president in the modern era. Once the book is published, he'll have a chance to explain if that context has changed, too.

She prevailed after 41/2 years of wrangling, when a judge agreed that chemical exposure on the job at a flooring factory was the reason Gene Cooper--a bright father of two with a quirky sense of humor--had transformed into a nursing-home patient who couldn't speak and sometimes stared into space when his family visited. That was 2012. Sandra Cooper is still trying to get medical bills and lost wages covered today, nearly two years after he died. The trouble Cooper has had isn't unusual for this type of case. What's unusual is that she's gotten anything out of workers' compensation at all. Americans hurt at work have a difficult enough time with the state-by-state system when their injury is so obvious and immediate--such as an amputation--that it can't be blamed on anything but the job. When it comes to chemically induced illnesses and other job-triggered diseases that creep up over time, according to researchers and the federal agency overseeing occupational safety, workers' comp rarely works at all. ""It's not good, and in many ways, it's gotten worse,"" said John F. Burton Jr., a workers' compensation expert who chaired a national commission on the subject during the Nixon administration. The difficulty is partly inherent in the diseases themselves. Most that can be triggered by job exposures--from cancers to lung ailments--have other possible causes, too. Genetics. Smoking. Simple bad luck. Workers have to first suspect their job was to blame and then build a case, gathering exposure information, finding medical experts willing to dig for answers. Most people with occupational diseases never file a claim, researchers say. But state-run workers' compensation programs have built additional barriers, often at the urging of industry groups. In most states, proving that there was a workplace exposure, that it is a known trigger of the illness in question and that, in fact, it was as likely as not the cause of the claimant's problem, isn't sufficient. Claimants must show work was more likely to blame than all possible outside causes their employers suggest. In some states, the burden of proof is even higher. And at least 11 states, including Pennsylvania, Alabama, and Virginia, require most or all sick workers to file claims within several years of their last hazardous exposure, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis--even though symptoms for a variety of occupational illnesses can take far longer to appear. The denial rate for disease claims in Ohio and Oregon, rare states that track the outcome of such cases, is three times higher than for injury claims. The insurance industry points to claimant fraud as a reason for tighter rules, contending that employees and their doctors too often shift costs into workers' compensation that aren't due to work. States, employers, and insurers ""have to be very careful ... in terms of guarding access to the system,"" said Robert P. Hartwig, president of the industry-supported Insurance Information Institute. But J. Paul Leigh, a professor of health economics at the University of California-Davis, found major costing-shifting in the other direction. A study he co-wrote in 2004, partially funded with a federal grant and cited in a 2015 report by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration about how the system fails workers, estimated that more than 95 percent of ultimately fatal occupational diseases are never covered by workers' comp. ""It was remarkable--unfortunate, actually--the huge disparity between what workers' compensation paid for and what epidemiological estimates consider are the true deaths attributed to occupational exposure,"" Leigh said. Taxpayers picked up nearly $27 billion in expenses from work injuries and illnesses in 2007 alone through federal programs such as Medicare, Leigh and a co-author estimated in a separate 2012 study. The biggest share of the burden fell on the workers and their families: an estimated $125 billion, or half the cost. ""What's the Matter With Dad?"" Gene Cooper was 48 the day he struggled home from the flooring plant where he worked in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, coughing and coughing. He told his wife he'd had to help clean up a spill. That was September 2003. The cough was so persistent that Sandra Cooper made him see a doctor, but soon she had other things to worry about. Her husband--a talented investor who was more than halfway done with a master's in financial planning--was suddenly having trouble with simple tasks. ""By late October into November, he was mixing up gender, losing proper nouns when he spoke,"" Sandra said. ""The kids noticed and kept asking, 'What's the matter with Dad? What's going on?' Really, by Christmas, he was very confused, going to work [at] the wrong time, getting dates mixed up."" ""I don't know what's the matter,"" he told her right after Christmas of that year, teary eyed. Seven months after the spill, he could no longer work. By 2006, he was in a nursing home, not speaking, his family unable to tell whether he recognized them or not. As his body deteriorated and Parkinson's symptoms set in, he lost the ability to swallow, and that was how he died in 2014--choking on the aspirated contents of his stomach. It's an image his wife cannot get out of her head. The bills to care for him were so massive--hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth--that they gobbled up his retirement fund, his investments, and his Social Security disability payments. Sandra had to tap their son's college fund, the inheritance her late mother left her, and lines of credit to keep going. Her initial efforts to find out whether work could be the cause of his illness went nowhere. The occupational medicine specialist who saw him in 2005 couldn't help because Sandra had no idea what substances were in the spill. Her lawyer did request her husband's medical and exposure records that year from his employer, Lancaster-based Armstrong World Industries, and came away empty-handed. Armstrong spokeswoman Jennifer Johnson said in an email that the company needed a request in writing and did not get one. Sandra said the company refused to turn over records at all unless she filed a workers' compensation claim. Later, OSHA would cite Armstrong for failing to share exposure information when requested in 2015--a citation the company called minor and said has been resolved. Lawsuits would be filed, alleging that the company intentionally tossed workers' records into a dumpster, a claim the company denies. The coroner, after Gene's autopsy, would rule that complications from chemical exposure at work caused his death. But that was all in the future. At the time, Sandra had nothing to go on to file a claim. Specialists were still struggling to accurately diagnose her husband's condition, let alone what triggered it. All that was clear was he had some form of dementia. Then, a doctor filling out paperwork in late 2007 checked a box indicating that Gene's medical problems were caused by work. Sandra took her first step into the world of workers' compensation, thinking she would finally get some help. The system is supposed to be faster, cheaper, and less adversarial than a lawsuit. That's frequently not how it plays out in state systems across the country, especially for illnesses. Nor was that the case for the Coopers. Armstrong filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2000 after a wave of asbestos lawsuits--it once installed asbestos insulation--but has been out of the bankruptcy courts for nine years now. The publicly traded company, which reported nearly $240 million in operating income last year, contested the Coopers' claim as vigorously as a civil-suit defense. The company first contended the request for workers' compensation came after the statute of limitations had expired. When that didn't quash the claim, Armstrong put more than a dozen witnesses on the stand to make the case that Gene had not helped clean up the spill, would rarely have come into contact with chemicals at work, and was suffering not from solvent-triggered brain damage but simply a nonoccupational instance of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, according to the workers' compensation judge's summary of the case. Sandra had to bring her own medical experts in to testify, racking up tens of thousands of dollars in further costs. The four specialists--two neurologists, a neuropsychologist, and a toxicologist--linked her husband's dementia and Parkinson's symptoms to solvent exposure, in part by using brain scans to identify the type of damage. Other witnesses spoke about conditions at the plant, including an Armstrong worker who testified that he saw Gene coming up from the basement where the spill cleanup was in progress. The judge, detailing all this in a 96-page decision letter, declared the claim compensable. Gene had indeed been exposed to hazardous chemicals as a result of the spill--which occurred while the area was left unattended so workers could go to a safety fair--and over the course of a three-decade career with Armstrong, mostly as an inspector, wrote Judge Tina Maria Rago. Those chemicals included a carcinogenic and neurotoxic solvent called trichloroethylene. Armstrong ""admitted the existence of these chemicals"" in the plant after the Coopers' witnesses testified to it, Rago wrote. But that 2012 decision was far from the end of it. Though largely upheld by the Pennsylvania workers' compensation appeal board, the original decision was narrowed by the board's 2014 finding that the company would not have to pay compensation to Sandra for the three and a half years between her husband's last day of work and the date she was finally able to file the claim. Until notice was provided, ""no compensation was due,"" the board ruled. Meanwhile, a forensic accountant she hired to sift through her records testified in July that $364,000 in out-of-pocket medical expenses for Gene--from before and after the contested 31/2-year period--remained unreimbursed. Large amounts of interest and post-claim lost wages also have not been paid, the accountant testified. Sandra said it was only in August, years after the decision, that she received any reimbursement for medical costs incurred after the claim was filed. Armstrong's Johnson wrote in an email that the company, while unable to speak in detail about a pending case, has ""fully complied with the workers' compensation decision addressing Mr. Cooper's medical bills."" She did not address the issue of wages but said some of the medical expenses are ""under review or in dispute."" ""We recognize and respect that an employee who is hurt or harmed in the workplace is entitled to pursue a worker's compensation claim. However, if the claim is erroneous or unfounded, the employer has the right, and arguably the duty, to contest the claim, which is exactly what we are doing,"" Johnson wrote. ""For example, with respect to Mr. Cooper we do not believe the medical conditions outlined in his case were caused by chemical exposure in the Armstrong workplace. That matter ... is currently under appeal by both parties."" Safety, including proper handling of chemicals, ""informs everything we do and is our number one priority,"" Johnson added. Word of Sandra Cooper's battle with Armstrong slowly spread. One by one, people approached her--other sick former workers from that flooring plant. Some of them had Parkinson's, like her husband. Others had cancer, particularly multiple myeloma, a rare bone-marrow condition some studies link to solvent exposure. Sometimes it wasn't the workers themselves but their survivors who came to her. None had filed a workers' compensation claim for those illnesses. A few had only suspected a work connection; for most, the possibility had never crossed their minds. Now it was too late to file a claim: Pennsylvania's deadline, set in 1972, is a few months shy of six years after the last on-the-job toxic exposure. Appellate court opinions suggested the purpose of the cutoff was to ""prevent stale claims"" and ""prevent speculation over whether a disease is work-related years after the exposure occurred,"" according to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. The former Armstrong workers and their families came to Cooper with the same question: What should they do? ""Grand Bargain"" Workers' compensation developed a century ago in the country, state by state, as an attempt to fix a broken system. Injured employees rarely prevailed in court, because laws at the time immunized companies from liability if the worker contributed to his injury in any way--even by slipping. Employers, meanwhile, had to defend themselves frequently enough--occasionally with big-ticket losses--that they were anxious about costs. Workers' compensation was pitched as a ""grand bargain"": Injured employees would get medical and wage assistance without having to prove negligence while employers would not have to pay for pain, suffering, or punitive damages. This new system wasn't merely an alternative to lawsuits. It was--and remains--a substitute. With rare exceptions, typically in cases involving a clear intent to harm, the only option for people seeking compensation from their employers for on-the-job injuries or illnesses is workers' comp. When workers' compensation systems were first set up in the United States, the major known risk an employee faced was traumatic injury. Mine explosions. Train derailments. Machinery malfunctions. Hazards were ever-present: Some 23,000 people died in U.S. industrial accidents in 1913. Now, though, deaths from occupational diseases outnumber fatal work injuries 9 to 1, according to a 2011 analysis by Leigh, of the University of California-Davis. But workers' compensation still handles injuries better than illnesses, said Burton, the workers' comp expert and a professor emeritus at both Rutgers and Cornell universities. The denial rate is markedly higher for disease claims than for injury claims in the few states that track that statistic. In Oregon, for example, 36 percent of disabling-disease claims were denied in 2014, compared with 11 percent of disabling injury claims. In Ohio, disease claims were denied nearly half the time in 2014, compared with just 14 percent of injury claims. When workers' comp does pay for an occupational disease, it's far more likely to be a condition such as tendinitis or carpal tunnel syndrome than potentially deadly illnesses such as cancer, Leigh found in 2004. Rules written decades ago and never changed are part of the problem. At least 11 states, for instance, set the worker's deadline to file a claim for most or all diseases based on the time elapsed since the last exposure to the hazard--not when the person was actually diagnosed with the illness. In those states, the window generally closes in one to seven years. Silicosis, a lung disease triggered by the silica dust that can shroud a badly run construction site, typically takes 10 years or more to develop. Bladder cancer, which can be set in motion by coal tar, metalworking fluids, and other workplace toxics, usually appears 15 to 40 years later. Mesothelioma, a cancer caused by asbestos, almost always lies latent for decades. Other such examples abound. The National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws said in 1972--43 years ago--that deadlines should be set after employees become aware that they have an occupational disease, given the ""substantial lag"" that can come between exposure and diagnosis. At that point, about half the states didn't meet that test. Iowa is one of the states that still don't. If workers there do not become disabled or die within one year of the last ""injurious"" exposure, or three years if the hazard causes one of the lung diseases categorized as pneumoconiosis, they have no recourse. The only exception is for diseases involving radiation, in which case workers are allowed to actually find out that they have a disabling occupational illness before the clock starts ticking. Paul J. McAndrew Jr., an Iowa lawyer who has represented employees in workers' compensation cases for 25 years, called the state's deadline rule ""a patent injustice"" that requires him to tell very sick people that they have no legal remedy against their former employer. Usually, the people he is able to help file a claim are those still employed at the site that made them ill. He was part of a brief effort just over a decade ago, when Iowa made changes to workers' comp, to get the deadline altered. Workers' advocates proposed to start the clock ticking when the disease is discovered. That idea was immediately batted down, McAndrew said. ""When we negotiated in 2004, the only message coming back from defense side that made any sense at all was, 'This one is too valuable. We won't even consider it,' "" he said. ""It's a well-known cost savings to the insurance industry. That's what it is."" Other barriers are part of a more modern effort by states to lower workers' compensation costs for employers. ""Over the past 25 years, states have made it much harder for both illnesses and injuries to receive workers' comp benefits,"" said Les Boden, an economist and a professor of environmental health at Boston University. Mississippi and Louisiana, for instance, both rewrote their laws in 2012 in an effort to overturn court precedent that rules be interpreted in favor of workers when resolving disputes. Many states have raised the level of proof a worker must meet from essentially 50-50 to a higher standard, usually a preponderance of the evidence, according to Emily A. Spieler, a law professor at Northeastern University who once headed the West Virginia workers' compensation system. With the waning of union power, there's been little organized effort to push back, Spieler said. Preponderance of the evidence is a typical civil-suit standard. Charles Davoli, a Louisiana lawyer who is past president of the Workers' Injury Law and Advocacy Group, argues that the original intent of workers' compensation was to make it easier than suing--since employees gave up their right to the higher payouts civil cases can bring. Changing that, he said, ""is all about cost mitigation."" Lawyers who represent companies or insurers see a 50-50 standard as too low for a properly functioning system. ""Because these things are very easy to allege and very difficult to investigate and disprove, I think at least from my perspective, it's not unfair to have a heighted burden of proof,"" said Bill Scherle, a workers' compensation lawyer in Iowa who largely focuses on defense work. Some states apply a still-higher standard of clear and convincing evidence, either for all occupational diseases or if the claimant's condition can be classified as an ""ordinary disease of life""--conditions the general public could contract, even though certain jobs can increase the risk of developing them. Virginia has that type of rule. And with the exception of hearing loss and carpal tunnel syndrome, the state doesn't define whether a condition is occupational or ordinary, leaving the parties to argue it out in front of the program's judges, according to the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission. Douglas Landau, a workers' compensation lawyer in Virginia, had to prove a client who baked rolls at a middle school--and developed a nondisabling lung ailment after daily exposure to flour dust--had no outside exposure of even a minor nature. He put a witness on the stand to testify that his client did not, in fact, bake the cakes she brought to monthly Elks Lodge meetings. Landau takes workers' compensation cases in other states as well but said a lot of clients, once they learn about the difficulties, opt to seek disability help from Social Security instead. The burden of proof makes it ""extraordinary difficult"" to win an occupational disease claim in workers' compensation, he said, ""even if you've only had one employer your entire career and even if the offending toxin or particle can be identified."" Trey Gillespie, senior workers' compensation director at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, a trade group, agrees that workers face difficulties with proof. He sees lack of medical evidence as the major problem, not the system itself. If you develop cancer and ask your doctor what caused it ""quite often, the doctor will say, 'I don't know--it could be lots of things,' "" he said. ""I think the workers' comp system is prepared to take care of workers that have an illness that scientific research supports ... is occupational in nature, but until the scientific research hits that level, then basically the burden really falls upon other private-payer systems or the public-payer system to help employees that have that illness,"" Gillespie said. Some of the people shut out of workers' compensation by deadlines, rather than medical evidence, have turned to the courts for help--with varying results. Iowa's highest court ruled in 1991 that employees cannot collect workers' compensation for diseases discovered after that state's deadline and then ruled in 1998 that such workers also could not sue their employers. But Pennsylvania's highest court, considering two cases brought by mesothelioma victims, went the other way in 2013. ""It is inconceivable that the legislature, in enacting a statute specifically designed to benefit employees, intended to leave a certain class of employees who have suffered the most serious of work-related injuries without any redress under the Act or at common law,"" the majority of the justices wrote. In Pennsylvania, if the disease manifests after the workers' compensation deadline of 300 weeks from the last exposure, an ill worker has no remedy in that system. Therefore, the justices ruled, he or she can sue. Since July, about a dozen former Armstrong workers--or their survivors--have done just that. The Plaintiffs Don Roberts worked at the Lancaster plant for 27 years, until downsizing hit in 1997, and was employed at a medical-supplies firm when he began to have balance and memory problems. It was Parkinson's, a diagnosis that came as a shock seven years ago. Now 64, Roberts had to take his Armstrong pension early--slicing his payments in half--so he and his wife wouldn't lose their house. Covering his health insurance cost them about $700 a month for the 31/2 years before he qualified for Medicare. And in August, to improve his symptoms, he underwent brain surgery that required him to remain conscious while two holes were drilled into his skull. ""It's just a Band-Aid,"" said his wife, Marilyn Roberts. ""There's not a cure for this, not at this point."" The Robertses are among those suing Armstrong, all of whom are represented by Sandra Cooper's lawyer, George Chada, a toxicologist-turned-attorney. The lawsuits contend that Armstrong triggered diseases by regularly exposing workers to a product called Safety Solvent. A 1989 Armstrong purchase document and a 2008 fax--turned up as part of Cooper's fight against the company--both give the product's components: largely methylene chloride and trichloroethylene with some methyl ethyl ketone thrown in for good measure. Trichloroethylene is a known human carcinogen; methylene chloride is considered a likely cancer-causing agent. Trichloroethylene in particular is associated with a variety of ailments--Parkinson's, liver and other cancers, neurological problems, and kidney damage among them. It's one of the chemicals implicated in illnesses and deaths among people who worked and lived at the contaminated Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base in North Carolina. The former Armstrong employees worked in their street clothes, which they wore home to be laundered, and they now worry about the implications for their families. The Robertses' son, Jason, was born with only one kidney and is a co-plaintiff in their lawsuit. Johnson, the Armstrong spokeswoman, wrote in her email that the company has not seen any evidence supporting ""that any of the medical conditions identified in the plaintiffs' complaints are as a result of their employment at Armstrong."" The company does not use the solvent described in the pending lawsuits, she wrote, ""and if we ever used the particular type of solvent to which you refer, it would have been many years ago."" ""In all of our plants, we follow and often exceed all applicable safety requirements, including those relating to protocols for working with chemicals and the use of proper protective equipment,"" Johnson wrote. The lawsuits also contend that Armstrong purposely destroyed medical and exposure records. One exhibit includes an affidavit from an employee who attests to witnessing this last year and a string of photos showing boxes and file folders tossed in a dumpster. (Cooper filed a lawsuit against Armstrong, too; it focuses on such concealment-of-information allegations.) OSHA, looking into the dumping allegation because companies are required to share such records with employees when asked, couldn't conclusively prove what was thrown away. Johnson said the binders and boxes were empty. But OSHA cited Armstrong in September for failing to give medical and exposure records to a former employee's representative when requested. Johnson said the OSHA citation involved ""a few non-substantive administrative items"" and has been resolved. She said the company has turned over tens of thousands of pages of medical and exposure records to the plaintiffs' lawyer. Several of the lawsuits involve cases of multiple myeloma, linked in some studies to trichloroethylene and methylene chloride. Judy Wendler's husband, George, who worked at the Lancaster plant for 30 years, died of the condition last year at 65 after a nearly six-year struggle. Wendler, a registered nurse, had to keep working while caring for him in order to stay insured--she's still not sure how she managed. Despite the insurance, and Medicare eventually kicking in, she amassed thousands of dollars in credit-card debt to cover his health care expenses. ""It just really took a toll on the whole family,"" Wendler said. ""His bones became brittle from the multiple myeloma; they more or less were eaten away, is what we were told. ... But he made himself do things, in great pain."" Sherry Riley is another plaintiff. Her husband, Jeffrey, who worked at the Armstrong plant from 1986 to 2000, was just 47 when he died five years ago from leukemia. His loss was a devastating emotional and financial hit she is still trying to recover from. She had to borrow money recently to keep her house out of tax sale. ""I'm getting my electric shut off, I'm on food stamps, I'm selling things ... I'm trying everything I can,"" Riley, 54, said this summer. Then there's Michael Moeller, who worked at the Lancaster plant for more than two decades before transferring to other Armstrong facilities. His 2010 death at age 50 was so mysterious that it took the coroner's office almost 31/2 years to determine the cause: acute severe hemolysis triggered by trichloroethylene exposure. The chemical set off an autoimmune reaction in which his body attacked his own red blood cells. ""He essentially suffocated to death,"" said Stephanie Bernstein, his sister. At his parents' house in Lancaster, a photo collage his family made for his funeral shows him as a baby, a child, an adult, always with the same sunny smile. ""It was the worst shock when that coroner called,"" his mother, Marie Moeller, 77, said in October. A few months earlier, just up the street, former workers and spouses filled up the seats in Sandra Cooper's living room. They talked about conditions in the 106-year-old plant, particularly in the '80s and '90s. The stench of chemicals, they said, was ever-present. Marilyn Roberts turned to her husband and asked, ""Don, did you ever have any protection at all?"" ""We had gloves on,"" he said, pressing one of his hands to the other to try to control the tremors. ""That's all we basically had."" What's the Fix? In 1972, President Richard Nixon's National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws declared that the states' programs were, ""in general, inadequate and inequitable."" Burton, who chaired that commission, said the states did better for a while--trying to stave off the possibility of federal intervention--but have backslid since. He doesn't hold out much hope of reforms to help ill workers in the current environment. ""Politics in many states are pretty conservative,"" he said. ""I think the problem you've got right now is the problem the national commission wrestled with, which is, left to their own devices the states are in a race to the bottom."" The Insurance Information Institute defends the current workers' compensation setup. The rules in place, the group says, are necessary. ""Unfortunately, there's a long history of fraudulent behavior and efforts to shift costs into the workers' compensation system,"" said Hartwig, the group's president. ""In order to keep workers' comp costs manageable for everyone, it's important that the system have a very prescribed manner in which eligibility is determined and compensation is made."" The institute pointed to statistics from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit that helps fight insurance fraud. Insurers referred about 3,500 questionable claims involving workers' compensation to the NICB in 2011 and about 4,500 in 2012, according to the group's most recently released figures. But both figures amounted to about 0.1 percent of total workers' compensation claims and include potential fraud by companies--such as undercounting employees to reduce premiums--as well as workers or doctors. Texas Mutual Insurance Co., which has 40 percent of the workers' compensation market in that state and aggressively investigates fraud, found $5.3 million in employer fraud last year, six times the amount of claimant fraud it discovered. Some health advocates see a nationally run system--or at least active oversight from the federal government--as part of the solution to workers' compensation woes. Indeed, after taking responsibility for administering benefits to coal miners for black lung, the federal government did once contemplate handling other occupational disease claims. In 1980, the Department of Labor issued an interim report suggesting such a move as one of several options to improve a situation in which, the agency noted, people with job-related illnesses rarely received help from workers' compensation. Social Security and welfare programs were left to pick up costs amounting to $2.2 billion annually, the agency said. Glenn Shor was one of the analysts working on that report in the agency's Office of Health and Disability. Nothing ever came of it, he said. After Ronald Reagan was elected, Shor said, the study group was disbanded. But the interim report outlined ways to make the challenge represented by occupational disease somewhat less daunting, whether in a state or federal system, including better data collection and presumption standards to reduce the difficulty workers have proving the cause of their disease. The report also discussed how to ensure that companies rather than taxpayers footed the bill--for instance, by levying a tax on disease-prone industries. That's important not only to make sure ill workers get treatment, said Shor, a member of the occupational health and safety section of the American Public Health Association. It's about incentivizing companies to reduce health hazards so the illnesses don't happen in the first place. ""If you don't have to pay for it,"" Shor said, ""you're not going to do much to prevent it."" A Workers' Comp Case Drags On Sandra Cooper sat quietly as her lawyer's voice filled a small Lancaster hearing room in July. George Chada did not hide his frustration. Robert J. Goduto, the workers' compensation judge who took over the case after the 2012 decision finding it compensable, had not allowed one of Cooper's financial experts to testify. When Chada asked that Armstrong be made to disclose more information about its payments related to the claim, the judge's response was to calmly ask him to sit down. And now, Armstrong's lawyer was arguing that the appeals board decision from the previous November--the one that said the company would not have to pay ""compensation"" for the 31/2 years before the claim was filed--should extend not only to lost wages but also to medical expenses. Goduto expressed interest in the case law on that point, but he did not entertain Chada's request to present evidence that the company did not turn over information that could have helped Cooper file the claim years earlier. Chada jumped up again, outraged: ""So you're going to allow the employer to conceal its notice, and then get a credit for concealing its notice? That would reward a fraud!"" ""Please have a seat,"" Goduto said. Two months later, three workers' compensation judges--Goduto among them--gave a seminar for the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The talk was billed as an opportunity to hear the judges ""discuss pointers on how employers can be successful in workers' compensation litigation."" Cooper couldn't believe it when she saw an announcement for the event. Armstrong is a member of the chamber. She filed a pending motion citing this and asking for the case to be reassigned back to the original judge. Goduto, who represented companies in workers' compensation matters before becoming a judge, declined to comment. Sara Goulet, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Industry, said by email that she could not speak about specific complaints but added that judges' discussion at such seminars focuses on the process, ""not how to win a case."" Cooper can appeal the issue of the unpaid 31/2 years to Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court. But she has to exhaust all her appeals within workers' comp first. She thinks her case shows how, even when a claim is approved, the system benefits employers and insurers because delays primarily harm cash-strapped claimants. ""The longer they drag it out, the longer it takes to get paid,"" she wrote in an email, ""and the more legal costs I incur."" It has eaten up her life, this conflict, and forever altered it. She was a high school art teacher, and now she navigates the complex world of chemical exposures and disease causation, helping others just starting down the same road. Sitting in her living room this summer, she recalled how her husband--back when they were in their 30s or early 40s--would turn to the obituary section of the local newspaper and exclaim that some guy or other he'd worked with had died. Usually the man had just retired, she said. Only later did the possible connection to work hit her. She's sobered by the thought that this is a national problem, not just a Lancaster one. ""People, they don't connect the dots. I mean, people do get cancer. If you don't know anything about toxicology, and who does, how would you possibly know that [work could be the cause]? You just don't,"" Cooper said. Workers in that situation can't hold companies to account, she added, ""and that's what they bet on--that people don't know.""

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/hillary_clinton_keeps_smearing_bernie_sanders_as_a_sexist_now_she_is_reaching.html	"On Oct. 23, Hillary Clinton opened a new front against Sen. Bernie Sanders: She framed him as a sexist. Clinton took a phrase Sanders had routinely used in talking about gun violence--that ""shouting"" wouldn't solve the problem--and suggested that he had aimed it at her because ""when women talk, some people think we're shouting."" Several journalists called out Clinton for this smear. But she refuses to withdraw it. Instead, her campaign officials and supporters have escalated the attack. And now, Clinton is adding a new dimension to the controversy: race. Some feminists applauded Clinton's initial zinger. ""Hillary Baits Bernie Beautifully,"" said a headline in Salon. Melissa McEwan accused Sanders of ""old-fashioned tone policing and dogwhistling about women's shrillness.""* On Oct. 27, Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, conceded that Sanders hadn't singled out Clinton. But Schriock insisted that Sanders ""was referring to a lot of folks who have been very adamant about [guns] and a lot of women who have been leading the fight on gun violence across the country. And I do think that is disrespectful."" The next day, Clinton sat down for an interview in New Hampshire. Josh McElveen of WMUR asked her about Sanders: ""Do you believe that he's attacking you based solely on your gender?"" Clinton replied: ""When I heard him say that people should stop shouting about guns, I didn't think I was shouting. I thought I was making a very strong case. ... And I'm not going to be silenced."" McElveen followed up: ""But as far as the implication that Bernie Sanders is sexist--you wouldn't go that far?"" Clinton shrugged, smiled, and sidestepped the question. ""I said what I had to say about it,"" she concluded. That day, Bloomberg Politics published an article in which Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, joked that Clinton would ""make a great vice president"" for Sanders. Weaver offered to interview her for the job. As Jonathan Chait has pointed out, that's a standard put-down among candidates: Clinton said the same thing about Barack Obama in 2008. But when Weaver tried it on Clinton, her supporters erupted. Christine Quinn, a Clinton backer, accused the Sanders campaign of sexism. Quinn pointed at Sanders himself: ""I'm stunned that a man like Bernie Sanders, who has clearly committed his life to making the country a better place, would get sucked into this very dangerous rhetoric, which perpetuates sexist and misogynistic stereotypes."" Clinton used her initial sound bite--""when women talk, some people think we're shouting""--in at least six places. She posted it on Twitter, Facebook, and her campaign website. She also delivered it in three speeches: in Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Virginia, on Oct. 23, and in Des Moines, Iowa, on Oct. 24. After that, I didn't hear it, except in her interview in New Hampshire. I thought she might be done with it. But then, on Friday, she raised a new issue. Clinton was in Charleston, South Carolina, addressing the local NAACP. She spoke against a tragic background: the massacre of nine black people in a Charleston church by a white racist. Naturally, she talked about guns. But she added a new line: ""There are some who say that this [gun violence] is an urban problem. Sometimes what they mean by that is: It's a black problem. But it's not. It's not black, it's not urban. It's a deep, profound challenge to who we are."" The idea that urban is code for black has been around a long time. It's often true. And it's not necessarily derogatory: In 1920, the National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes shortened its name to the National Urban League. But why would Clinton suddenly bring up, in a damning tone, people who call guns an urban problem? Who was she talking about? It can't be the Republican presidential candidates: They haven't disagreed enough to debate the issue at that level of granularity. The only recent forum in which guns have been discussed as an urban concern is the forum that inspired Clinton's initial accusation of sexism: the Oct. 13 Democratic debate in Las Vegas. Pull up the transcript of that debate, search for ""urban,"" and you'll see whom Clinton is talking about: Sanders. In fact, it's from the same moments of the debate that Clinton had already seized on. In the debate, Sanders began by saying, ""As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton [is] that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want."" A couple of minutes later, Sanders told former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley: ""We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not."" O'Malley insisted that the issue was ""not about rural and urban."" Sanders replied: ""It's exactly about rural."" Only one other candidate used the word ""urban"" during the debate: former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. A week later, on Oct. 20, Webb quit the campaign. So when Clinton, on Friday, spoke scathingly of people who call guns an ""urban problem"" but mean it's a ""black problem,"" it's obvious to whom she was referring. This line of attack is rich in irony. When Clinton ran for president in 2008, she explicitly used race against Obama. She told USA Today that she should be the Democratic nominee because ""I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on."" Clinton cited an article that, in her words, showed ""how Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in [Indiana and Pennsylvania] who had not completed college were supporting me."" A reporter asked Clinton whether this argument was racially divisive. ""These are the people you have to win if you're a Democrat,"" Clinton replied dismissively. ""Everybody knows that."" Now Clinton accuses others of playing the race card. In Charleston, she told the NAACP, ""Some candidates talk in coded racial language about 'free stuff,' about 'takers' and 'losers.' And boy, are they quick to demonize President Obama. This kind of talk has no place in our politics."" Clinton, too, speaks in code. But in this election, her coded phrases--""some people think we're shouting,"" ""some who say that this is an urban problem""--aren't designed to veil racism. They're designed to veil her meritless insinuations that her Democratic opponent is sexist and racist. You can argue, based on power or privilege, that playing the race card or sex card from the left isn't as bad as playing it from the right. But even if you believe that, Clinton's smears bring discredit on the whole idea of bigotry. If accusations of misogyny and racism are casually thrown at Sanders, voters will conclude that these terms are just rhetoric. Seven years ago, when Clinton's own campaign was accused of prejudice, her husband was outraged. ""She did not play the race card, but they did,"" Bill Clinton said of the Obama campaign. The former president went on: ""This is almost like, once you accuse somebody of racism or bigotry or something, the facts become irrelevant."" Three months later, Mr. Clinton was still fuming. ""They played the race card on me, and we now know from memos from the campaign and everything that they planned to do it all along,"" he protested. ""This was used out of context and twisted for political purposes by the Obama campaign to try to breed resentment elsewhere. ... You really got to go some to try to portray me as a racist."" Now Hillary Clinton is doing to Sanders what her husband said was done to her. She's taking Sanders' remarks out of context and twisting them to breed resentment. You've got to twist the facts pretty hard to portray Sanders as a racist or sexist. But politically, it's easy, because once you start throwing around charges of bigotry, the facts become irrelevant. You're just another beautiful baiter. And you won't be silenced. *Update, Nov. 6, 2015: McEwan asked to be named as the author who accused Sanders of ""old-fashioned tone policing and dogwhistling about women's shrillness."" Her name has been added accordingly. (Return.)"	Hillary Clinton Is Stepping Up Her Smear Campaign Against Bernie
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/republicans_are_destroying_their_chances_with_latino_voters_the_gop_and.html	"With its deference toward Donald Trump and opposition to immigration reform, the Republican Party has failed to prioritize Latino voters. But until now Latino outreach has been a goal--an item on the GOP agenda. Republicans might have passed on immigration action, but they still wanted dialogue with Latino communities and other groups with large immigrant populations. Or at least they did. In the fallout from the CNBC Republican presidential debate, which GOP leaders attacked as ""petty and mean-spirited,"" the Republican Party has rejected NBC Universal as a partner for hosting the forums. In particular, the Republican National Committee has canceled the planned debate with Telemundo. And while the Bush campaign wants to find another arrangement, other Republicans--including Trump--are happy to avoid an event with the Spanish-language news station. In other words, as of now none of the 12 Republican debates will go to Spanish-speaking audiences or deal mainly with issues important to the Latino community. The GOP has cut itself off from the fastest growing part of the electorate in a significant way. And it's not just the debates. On Sunday, in an interview with CBS's Face the Nation, newly minted House Speaker Paul Ryan told host John Dickerson that immigration reform was off the table under his speakership. ""Look, I think it would be a ridiculous notion to try and work on an issue like this with a president we simply cannot trust on this issue,"" said Ryan. ""He tried to go it alone, circumventing the legislative process with his executive orders, so that is not in the cards."" Whether or not the GOP intends to show indifference to Latino concerns is less important than the fact that this is what these actions demonstrate. And it doesn't help that Democrats have moved in the opposite direction. Not only does the party have a debate with Univision in March, but--as Greg Sargent reports for the Washington Post--it's in talks with Telemundo to hold a candidate forum in place of the Republican presidential debate. One party shows that it wants to communicate with Latino voters--directly--and wants to pursue their interests in the form of immigration reform and efforts to integrate immigrants into mainstream institutions, while the other--at best--shows disinterest and occasional hostility. And it's going to get worse. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is on the upswing, but he has a large, glaring weakness--immigration. In his four years in the Senate, Rubio has flipped from a restrictionist position, to crafting a comprehensive bill with Democrats (including President Obama), to rejecting his bill and staking ground as an immigration reform opponent. Republican donors can tolerate this opportunism. Conservative activists are less forgiving. ""As so often regarding immigration, Rubio was either clueless or lying,"" writes Mark Krikorian of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. ""His immigration comments are, yet again, a useful caution for those excited by his genuine rhetorical gifts."" Soon, as candidates like Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz work to consolidate support and attack opponents in the ""establishment lane""--including Rubio--immigration will come to the fore. Four years after Mitt Romney ran on ""self-deportation,"" another batch of Republican candidates will fight to get on the right on immigration. And in all likelihood, especially with Trump in the race, that will bring offensive, hostile rhetoric. It's been said before, but it bears repeating: The Republican Party has moved backward in its relationship with Latino Americans. And worse for its electoral future, it has done this ahead of a close election year, where both sides are well-matched against each other. To win, Republicans will need every vote they can get. But so far, they're throwing away their shot at just that. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Republicans Are Destroying Their Chances With Latino Voters
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/republican_presidential_candidates_issue_debate_demands_to_networks_reince.html	"In a Godfather-esque gathering of rival political concerns, representatives of the Republican presidential campaigns gathered in an Alexandria, Virginia Hilton on Sunday evening to draw up a list of conditions for their participation in future presidential debates. The campaigns still are all het up about the completely unfair questioning that business-Republican network CNBC subjected them to last week, such as, Marco Rubio, your tax plan is really good for the wealthy, no? or, Ben Carson, why were you in bed with this snake-oil company for so many years? If the moderators had asked fair questions, see, the candidates wouldn't have been forced to lie. What's so complicated about that? The view of the campaigns is that the Republican National Committee has failed in its mission to prevent moderators from asking them uncomfortable questions to which they may not have truthful answers. The candidates have thus decided to cut out the middleman, since it's their smiling, sweaty faces that have all the leverage. The RNC was not represented at the Sunday night meeting--code-named ""family dinner,"" no joke--even after it tried to mollify campaigns' outrage by suspending NBC News and Telemundo's sponsorship of a February debate. The campaigns and their consiglieres put together a list of demands to which future debate hosts must agree to ensure the candidates' participation. The finalized version, as obtained by the Washington Post, is hilarious in its granularity. Not once but twice does the document inveigh against ""lightening [sic] rounds,"" which must be banned ""because of their frivolousness or 'gotcha' nature, or in some cases both."" The letter also implores networks to agree not to ""ask the candidates to raise their hands to answer a question,"" ""allow candidate-to-candidate questioning,"" ""allow props or pledges by the candidates,"" ""show an empty podium after a break (describe how far away the bathrooms are),"" or ""leaves microphones on after breaks."" What about allowing hot mics in the distant bathrooms? There's no clear rule on that, though it would certainly violate the spirit of the letter. ""Can you pledge that the temperature in the hall be kept below 67 degrees?"" the very funny letter asks of television network executives. The campaigns also demand final approval over any graphics that will appear onscreen with their candidates--something the Bush campaign pushed after CNBC, a financial news network, displayed Jeb's investment bank consulting background rather than his two terms as governor of Florida. These are still rival campaigns, though. While they will band collectively to prevent such things as reporters asking them questions about the chasmic gaps in their tax plans, each campaign still has its own interests to push. Consider this NBC News/Telemundo business. The Bush camp wants them reinstated, since Jeb's whole message is about broadening the appeal of the party and he speaks Spanish. But Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, ""threatened to boycott a debate if the Spanish-language network that Trump has clashed with was granted one."" Trump's rhetoric on Hispanics might not go over well with Telemundo's moderators and audience. And since Trump deserves credit for the large audiences GOP debates are commanding, he would seem to hold more leverage than Bush. It's not a good sign for the RNC, or the eventual Republican nominee's chances next November, if Trump is effectively calling the shots. (Indeed, Trump is now talking about breaking from the collective entirely and negotiating debate details on his own.) If Trump gets his way NBC News and Telemundo will not be reinstated, and the Republican Party will finish its presidential primary schedule without a single debate on Spanish-speaking media. Telemundo, meanwhile, is reportedly in discussions with the Democratic National Committee about setting up a forum for its candidates instead. This means that Democrats, who already have a Univision-hosted debate scheduled, are poised to host two events on Hispanic media networks to the Republicans' zero. This is not what Chairman Reince Priebus hoped for when his RNC drafted its ""autopsy"" of the 2012 election. ""The RNC must put significant effort and resources into reaching out to Hispanic media and news outlets,"" the 2013 report concluded. ""This needs to be a high-level presence on all Latino media."" Well, now the candidates have bullied the RNC into cancelling the party's one big night on Hispanic media because its partner, NBC News, operates under the same parent company of CNBC, a channel that worships money but also asked a few mean questions. And Trump, whose ""racially divisive"" platform and rhetoric has commanded great audiences and catapulted him to the top of primary polls, appears to have little interest in renegotiating. Really, really not how things were supposed to go. What's next? A debate moderated by Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Mark Levin? That's what Sen. Ted Cruz wants. If he and the other campaigns that have now taken control of the process get this, that's not going to show the party's best face for a general election audience that's weighing whether to vote Republican or Democrat in 2016. What was the point of having the RNC serve as middleman in the first place? To navigate the party through the primary process in a way that didn't damage the eventual nominee too much before the general election. Priebus was able to cut the number of debates roughly in half, and he ensured that no mischievous entity like MSNBC was granted hosting duties. The candidates have found his efforts lacking, though, and are using the leverage that's available to them as a group to run the show themselves. So far, it looks like they'll use that power to ensure that they don't, for even a hot second, have to factor general-election considerations into their primary strategies."	The Republican Party Has Lost Control of the Republican Primary
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/the_gop_may_protect_marco_rubio_from_jeb_bush_s_worst_attacks_the_party.html	"Jeb Bush's campaign has been pronounced dead about 100 different ways by almost every media outlet. This is great and funny. Is it true? So far only Bush seems to think he's in excellent shape. ""It's not on life support,"" Bush said Thursday of his campaign following his poor debate performance on Wednesday night. ""We have the most money, we have the greatest organization. We're doing fine."" The first two claims may check out. The last one is dubious. Hounding Jeb Bush is America's most enjoyable hobby, but OK, OK: He's not dead. There's still plenty of time until voting begins, and if he can catch some sort of break--like Hillary Clinton's campaign did with the first Democratic debate and the week that followed--all of those advantages he has in endorsements, organization, and outside money will be there waiting for him. He doesn't need to drop out anytime soon. Though, again, we hope everyone keeps asking him when he'll drop out, because it's amusing to see Jeb! get all worked up. The rise of Marco Rubio is a real head-scratcher for Team Bush. The gathering consensus that Rubio is the candidate to beat officially congealed into the prevailing conventional wisdom following's Rubio's latest sharp debate performance. This seems like one of those rare, smart conventional wisdoms, in that Rubio also has plenty of outside money, is ideologically similar to Bush but perhaps a touch more conservative, and most importantly, good at politics. Unless things change fairly soon, Bush and his advisers will have to make a difficult decision: How hard do they want to go after Rubio? Do they want to do everything in their power to destroy the figure who's viewed by more and more of the Republican intelligentsia as the party's best hope against Clinton? Or will they bow out relatively early if Rubio is in position to become the nominee? The choice may not be Bush's in the end: The party may make that decision for him. The signals coming from Bush's organization now point largely to the ""destroy Rubio at all costs"" option, in grand Bush family tradition. What a coincidence on Thursday that just as the media was tucking itself in with Rubio, a 112-slide Bush strategy PowerPoint mysteriously ""leaked"" to the presses. Near the front of the presentation are several slides devoted to Rubio, ""A Risky Bet."" Among the bulletin points: Rubio has ""no accomplishments, negating hit against Hillary Clinton,"" nor, ""outside of lobbying and legal consulting,"" does he have any ""credible experience beyond government."" Rubio has ""never been in charge of anything larger than two dozen people."" The slide also pounces on certain ethical lapses, such as his ""misuse of state party credit cards, taxpayer funds, and ties to scandal-tarred former Congressman David Rivera."" And most luridly: ""Those who have looked into Marco's background in the past have been concerned with what they have found."" The criticisms are kept at the sort of cowardly remove typical of party primary attacks. Rubio's total lack of accomplishments doesn't bother Bush at all--never think that!--it's just that they would ""[negate a] hit against Hillary Clinton."" That's why it's a problem. Similarly, Rubio's ""misuse of state party credit cards, taxpayer funds, and ties to scandal-tarred former Congressman David Rivera"" doesn't bother Bush's team, personally, in the least. But they do ""[take] away [a] line of attack on Hillary Clinton."" Marco Rubio is an inexperienced, accomplishment-free, corrupt, incompetent, lazy, useless garbage human being ... is what the lousy Democrats will say, we mean! It's much like how Newt Gingrich's operation in 2012 ran a bunch of ads about how Mitt Romney was a rapacious job-slashing capitalist death machine who feasted on the brains of laid-off workers ... is what the Democrats would say. Indeed, the Democrats did, following Gingrich's lead. Gingrich didn't decide to lay off the attacks because he wanted to or because they were ineffective. He did so because the entire Republican establishment and media complex saw their presumed nominee getting thrashed in a way that offered bipartisan validation to looming Democratic attacks. They instructed Gingrich to cut the crap lest he squander away the reservoir of goodwill he retained among Republicans. Rubio is far from being the presumed nominee, and Bush isn't quite in a Gingrich's long-shot position. But already we have a sign that the establishment won't just let the Bush campaign do to Rubio whatever it wishes. Mitt Romney's ex-adviser Beth Myers wasted no time pushing back against the claim that ""those who have looked into Marco's background in the past""--as in, those who vetted Rubio for the vice presidential nomination in 2012--""have been concerned with what they have found."" Not true, according to Myers. ""As the senior Romney advisor who handled VP vetting and had access to all the vetting documents, I can say that Senator Rubio 'passed' our vetting and we found nothing that disqualified him from serving as VP,"" she wrote. ""The Bush aide referred to in this article is simply wrong."" Romney and his crew have taken it upon themselves to ensure that the eventual Republican nominee escapes from the primary process without too much baggage. If that PowerPoint presentation is a taste of what's to come from the Bush campaign, then consider Myers' response a taste of how party leaders will respond. It's not imperative for Bush to retake his advantage over Rubio by the time Iowa votes. Both of these campaigns will have the resources to go the distance if necessary. What Bush does need to do, though, is remain roughly in the same ballpark as Rubio. If Bush stays flat while Rubio ascends, the powers that be will do everything they can to put a freeze on the Right to Rise super PAC's bank account."

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/marco_rubio_won_the_cnbc_debate_the_florida_senator_s_third_gop_debate_was.html	"There's a theory in presidential politics that if you're a young senator facing questions about your inexperience and ability to lead, you can create an aura of leadership through successful campaign moments that can substitute for actual experience. John Kennedy did it by winning the Wisconsin and West Virginia primaries, and Barack Obama did it in 2008 by defeating Hillary Clinton. Sen. Marco Rubio did some of this in his third GOP debate. So far Rubio has had strong but careful debates, but at the Boulder, Colorado venue sponsored by CNBC he upped his game. There were plenty of strong moments for almost all the candidates not named Jeb Bush, but what made Rubio's moments so useful for him was that they combined three things: They were well-timed, they shored up his weaknesses, and they came as his rising poll numbers and the vulnerabilities in his rivals' polling are creating a moment for him. Rubio can credit Jeb Bush with the first moment. When Rubio was asked about skipping out on so many Senate votes, he parried the question by attacking the newspaper that wrote an editorial asking him to resign. Standard stuff and pretty predictable. But then Bush jumped in and said that as a constituent he thought Rubio should work for all six years, and compared Rubio's lack of industry in the Senate to a French workweek. You could feel the clamshell packaging come off the attack it felt so store-bought and ready-made. Rubio responded with his own riposte. ""I don't ever remember you complaining about John McCain's vote record,"" he said, noting that Bush had recently compared his campaign to McCain's 2008 comeback effort. ""The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you."" That response showed he could go toe-to-toe. Rubio is in a direct competition with Bush and he won that round. Missing Senate votes in a campaign where non-politicians are at the top is not a problem. A bigger challenge for Rubio is the lack of leadership and callow youth problem, and being able to best Bush in a moment that will be passed around on social media helps with that. Toughness is hard to show when you can't point to a job where you've had to make tough calls, but while Bush's resume has prepared him for the kinds of leadership challenges a president will face, to voters, that exchange makes it look like Rubio is the more commanding one. It was the kind of flourish Bush needed to show in this debate. Instead, Rubio showed it. (It was that kind of night for Bush, and he's now going to have to endure days of suggestions that he should replace the exclamation point with a period and end his campaign.) Rubio also took on the moderators, turning a question about his personal finances into a paean to his humble roots. Later he said the press was a super PAC for Hillary Clinton's campaign, complaining that the conclusions from pundits about her Benghazi testimony were too favorable. It was a great line and well received by the audience. He seemed to have those kinds of lines at every turn. ""My mother's on Medicare and Social Security; I'm against anything that's bad for my Mom."" This is theater review, but that's what these debates are as political events. Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and Ben Carson are all going to fight for the same voters. They all had good nights. Carson and Cruz won big applause for attacking the moderators. When the audience reacted to a moderator's question by groaning, Carson said, ""they know,"" which should be his new campaign slogan. But there were no fireworks between those candidates, which also helped Rubio. He wasn't overshadowed by the Trump show or the expected Trump-on-Carson action. Those three candidates are going to duke it out for the die-hard voters in the grassroots. Whoever wins in that portion of the race will face a candidate from the crop of remaining ones. Rubio was already leading that group, but just barely. Even though Gov. John Kasich made an impassioned plea for sanity, calling on his party to reject the fantasy plans of Carson and Trump, and Gov. Chris Christie gave several strong answers, it was Rubio whose answers, coupled with the lift he was already feeling, did the most for his candidacy. Now he can expect the other candidates to love him accordingly. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	Why Rubio Won

Rand Paul in his otherwise unmemorable third GOP debate performance: Sen. Ted Cruz was complimenting him and his family. That's an omen. When Cruz starts going out of his way to be kind to you, that means he's expecting you to falter or drop out soon. He is positioning himself to take your resources--your volunteers, your donors, your votes. He is a vulture who arrives with a smile. Cruz for months now has been playing footsie with Donald Trump: forgiving, even championing, the hilarious clown's most ludicrous statements, expecting those statements to eventually undo him and send Trump's ex-supporters to ... Ted Cruz, perhaps? Now Cruz is doing the same to Rand. Though Paul's numbers have been unimpressive, he still represents the libertarian wing of the party--one that Cruz hopes to annex to his far-right coalition, which might come soon if Paul runs out of money. Rand's father, Ron, was more of a heroic figure to the libertarian movement than the son will ever be. So Cruz wisely mentioned Ron Paul's name Wednesday afternoon in his pitch for a tight-money policy at the Federal Reserve: ""I am an original co-sponsor of Ron Paul's audit the Fed legislation."" He even threw in a call for the gold standard for good measure. And after Rand Paul discussed his tax plan, which cuts the payroll tax, Cruz interjected before the moderators were able to cut to an anxious Gov. John Kasich. ""[Rand's] plan is a good plan,"" Cruz said, before noting that his plan, too, ""eliminates"" the payroll tax--and much more. The compliments should increase in frequency the nearer Paul's 2016 bank account gets to zero. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	Why Ted Cruz Was Sucking Up to Rand Paul
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/marco_rubio_crushed_jeb_bush_in_debate_fight_the_former_florida_governor.html	"Jeb Bush had the opportunity to take the attack that he and his super PAC have been running against Sen. Marco Rubio to his ex-mentee's face Wednesday night. As with most things for Jeb, it didn't go well. Specifically: Rubio stuffed it in his face. The two alleged longtime friends had not gone directly after each other in the first two debates. But Bush is under incredible pressure to show his backers something. So he looked Rubio in the eye and told him to start showing up for work. ""When you signed up for this, this is a six-year term,"" Bush said, before referring to the Senate schedule as a ""French workweek."" (France is the worst!) He continued: ""Just resign and let somebody else take the job. There are a lot of people who are living paycheck to paycheck in Florida."" Rubio was ready. ""Over the last few weeks I listened to Jeb, he said you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, and will launch a serious comeback like he did by fighting hard in places like New Hampshire. You know how many votes John McCain missed? Jeb, let me tell you, I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record."" And then he put in the dagger: ""The only reason you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position. Someone convinced you attacking me is going to help you."" What made Rubio's retort so effective was that it was exactly correct. Bush doesn't care about how many votes Rubio misses. Bush is smart enough to understand that Rubio has not missed any roll calls where he would have cast a tie-breaking vote. This is the sort of thing that overpaid political consultants come up with when they can't think of anything else, and when their candidate is bad at politics.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/ben_carson_is_beating_the_republican_field_the_gop_s_presidential_contenders.html	"Dear GOP presidential candidates who are not named Ben Carson: Do you notice that you are all losing to Ben Carson? The doctor fellow who has never run for office and is constantly saying insane things? Perhaps it is time to do something about that? In case you were not aware that you are all literally losing to Ben Carson, let's show you some polls in which Ben Carson's numbers are higher than yours. The most recent national poll, conducted by CBS and the New York Times, shows Ben Carson earning 26 percent of the vote. This is higher than your 22 percent, Donald Trump. It is significantly higher than your 8 percent, Sen. Marco Rubio, and you're the guy who's supposed to win the Republican presidential nomination. Jeb Bush: You have 7 percent in this poll. Seven. That is 19 fewer percentage points of political support than Ben Carson has. Ben Carson is a political novice who quit campaigning for two weeks to sell his stupid book! Oh, and don't you laugh, Ted ""Running the Best Campaign of Any Candidate"" Cruz. You have four dumb percentage points. You, like every other candidate, are literally losing the presidency to Ben Carson. Let's not even get started about Iowa. Nevermind, let's get started: You all are losing to a somnolent retiree who very recently was spending entire days babbling nonsense about the Holocaust to anyone who'd listen, in Iowa, the state that holds the first delegate contest in the nation. The two most recent polls of Iowa Republicans show Carson leading the field by double digits. And that's not even the bad news. The bad news is that Carson's ceiling for support is head-and-shoulders above that of you losers. According to this week's Monmouth poll of Iowa, Carson is viewed favorably by 84 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers and unfavorably by a modest 7 percent. The second most favorably viewed candidate is Rubio at 65 percent to 16 percent. Interesting factoid about Rubio: He is losing in Iowa and most everywhere else to Ben Carson, an inadvertent comedian who believes that prison makes people gay, in a contest for one of the two major party's presidential nominations. It's difficult to do this without hand gestures, but try to follow along: All the way up ~here~ is Ben Carson's number. Then waaaaaay down ~there~ is your number. What you will want to do is make his number go down, to where yours is. If you check out the calendar, you'll see that there is a televised presidential debate Wednesday night. What a splendiferous opportunity to point out to voters, many of whom watch television, that Ben Carson obviously should not be president. None of you even bothered with this guy in the first couple of debates. He would say something weird or barely funny, and you would smile and laugh. Like, Ha ha ha, what a delight to be in the company of this fellow whom I do not take seriously. Well guess what? Now this fellow is whooping all of you, and everyone likes him and isn't particularly fond of you. The good news--if it ever gets through your thick skulls that Ben Carson needs to be taken seriously as a competitor--is that driving up his negatives shouldn't be all that hard. The guy's a kook. So are a lot of you, but hoo-boy, Carson's something else. The tricky element here is that much of the reason Carson is soaring, especially in Iowa, is that Republican voters there like much of that kookiness. It's not going to play well in a Republican debate if you go after him for saying that a Muslim shouldn't be president, that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery, that he would never raise the debt ceiling, or that gun control caused the Holocaust. Those are what we call ""winners"" to a certain subset of the American population: specifically, the one that decides which of you gets the Republican presidential nomination. It also may not be worth the risk to point out that Carson is a Seventh-day Adventist. At the end of the day, aren't we all members of some nutty sect or another? Leave that for the fingerprint-free super PAC ads is what we're getting at. But there's still plenty in Carson's long list of questionable stances that will hurt him among hardcore Republican voters. Mention as often as possible that, until about three seconds ago, Carson wanted to eliminate Medicare and replace it with a form of health savings accounts. ""Eliminate Medicare"" is the consistent conservative theoretical position on Medicare. But it's not one that many Republican voters care for, because Medicare is fantastic. Also point out that Carson loves legalized abortion. Say it just like that. It's close enough to being almost, maybe, slightly true, at one point long ago, perhaps. In other words, it's grounded enough by presidential debate standards. It is also worth pointing to the strong evidence that Carson is a grifter, and his presidential campaign one long--and thus far highly successful--grift. Look, you've been through this already. There was a period when you all ignored Trump and expected his ludicrous candidacy to collapse under its own fraudulence. That didn't happen, and so you started hitting him. His recent slide indicates that it's finally working. But now it is Ben Carson, an equally ludicrous candidate, to whom you are all losing. You are losing to Ben Carson. You are losing to Ben Carson. Good grief: stop losing to Ben Carson. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	Stop Losing to Ben Carson!
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/what_the_gop_s_top_candidates_must_do_in_tonight_s_debate_can_donald_trump.html	"Donald Trump says he's a counter-puncher. Ben Carson isn't a puncher of any sort. In most cases, rather than attack Trump or respond to any of his attacks, Carson drives around the block and waits under the sycamore tree until the moment passes. Carson would rather stick to the issues, he says, and present himself as a calm, methodical contrast to the entertaining front-runner from Queens. It is a placidity that is central to Carson's character. This is going to make the third Republican debate fascinating to watch, because it presents Trump with two unfamiliar challenges. So far in this campaign he's faced traditional obstacles that he's shown are not challenges at all--his gaffes only make him more popular, his bombastic style isn't too brash for voters, and his huge policy claims aren't judged implausible. He has bested old-style challenges because he is in tune with a hungry grassroots electorate and he has his own special skills. But Carson represents a challenge fueled by that same electorate. Does Trump have the skills to match that? The first test is that unlike other fights Trump has been in, here he needs to attack Carson head on. He's taken on other candidates when they have attacked him as a display of domination--almost for sport. But his unprovoked attacks on Carson suggest that he sees his rise in the polls as a real threat--despite his claims that the polls showing Carson ahead are aberrations. He's seen this threat for a while and has been begging Carson to hit him since September. Now he's sick of waiting. The second challenge Trump faces from Carson is that he doesn't respond to Trump the way the other candidates do. When Trump attacks Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor runs right on to Trump's turf and tries to beat him at his game. Trump wins the Twitter wars. Carson isn't playing that game--at least not yet. Trump will hope to draw him offside in Wednesday night's debate. (And analysts will hope not to be drawn into too many mixed metaphors.) Carson also presents Trump with perhaps the first real fact check of the campaign. Trump says he is a winner. The poll numbers have shown that. And he's blown through at least half a dozen near-death experiences. He's minting the validation for his own campaign as he runs it. But if Carson starts winning, especially in the face of Trump's attacks and stratagems, it will undermine the heart of the Trump pitch. Trump may have explanations for why he might be losing, but that's not going to sound right coming from the fellow who prizes winning above all and banishes all losers with their loser explanations. So how does Trump handle this asymmetric threat? He could easily ignore it. He's down in Iowa and one national poll, but he's leading Carson everywhere else by a lot. If Ron Brownstein is right and Trump's support among non-college educated voters is solid, then he's got a strong floor of support. Let Carson wear the front-runner hat for a while and see if it stays on; Trump's base isn't going anywhere. But Trump doesn't look to be taking this wait-and-see approach. He has been acting recently like Carson is an existential threat. He's not only raised questions about his religion out of the blue, but he's charged that Carson's super PAC in Iowa is operating illegally. (Trump's charge is not that Carson is controlled by his big donors, which is what he charges about other candidates and their PACs; his charge is that the PAC effectively runs Carson's campaign in Iowa, doing more than the campaign finance laws allow.) He's also said Carson is even more low energy than Jeb and that he can't create jobs. He's also questioned his position on abortion. It's unclear how these attacks will play because Carson is a fellow outsider. When Trump attacks Bush, the merits of his case don't matter to an electorate who doesn't like politicians--and doesn't like Bush particularly. But the GOP electorate likes Carson. In the most recent CBS Battleground Tracker poll, more voters in the key primary states said they would be OK with a Carson presidency than any other candidate. Almost 60 percent said they would not be OK with a Trump presidency. And Carson isn't fighting back, which means Trump will not only be hitting a guy voters seem to genuinely like, but he's also risking the appearance that he's doing it for no reason, which could backfire even worse. The contest is a wonderful test of candidates' ability to adapt their skills for the presidency. Carson is quiet, methodical, and padding along very successfully in his lane. He has promised as president he will be able to quickly take on the skills required for the office. Can he do that with a campaign? His new quasi front-runner status requires he take on new skills quickly. Can he show command of his answers in the debate? Can he deftly deflect or manage Trump's needling and prodding? For Trump the question is whether he can take on a challenger who won't take the bait. He often talks about the ""killers"" he's clobbered at the negotiating table. What has he done to the strong silent types? Carson is reviving standards in a way that has't worked for other candidates. He's presenting himself as having the temperament and judgment to be president. We used to prize these things in our presidents. Carson isn't criticizing Trump out loud yet (though his advisers are). He's simply presenting himself as the adult alternative to the brash one. That was Bush's strategy in the first debate. It didn't work. Ultimately Jeb had to try to engage and it has not gone well for him. His recent comments betray a certain frustration with the combat. ""I've got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around, being miserable, listening to people demonize me, and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a joke. Elect Trump if you want that,"" he said recently. That does not sound joyful. Of all the candidates appearing Wednesday, Bush has the most on the line. If he has another translucent performance there will be more anonymous quotes like the brutal one in the Washington Post from a supporter saying his campaign was in a ""death spiral."" A bad performance will again undermine the fundamental argument of his campaign, that he has the skills to win in a general election, attracting new voters to the GOP that none of the other candidates can. If you can't communicate when it counts (in three debates), then you're not likely to be able to communicate when it counts against the Democratic nominee. The pressure has got to be immense. Bush has to seize a theatrical moment (something he's not a fan of doing) in a venue that he isn't naturally suited for. If he can pull it off, however, all the greater glory will come his way. Sen. Marco Rubio has the most to gain. He's been slowly rising, staying out of the Trump briar patch and watching his rivals get stuck there. Rubio could simply stick with that strategy and emerge one day as the Trump/Carson alternative who is palatable to some Tea Party voters but also non Tea Party voters as well. Or, he could seize the moment in the debate and present himself as a powerful force. It's not clear what this means in practice exactly, but it feels like he's ready to have his moment and a strong debate performance could launch it. As Barack Obama learned, you gain stature--something Rubio could use--by seizing moments in a campaign. By showing leadership you graft that quality on to yourself when you have no experience doing so. Of course, rising too fast also makes you a bigger target. But Rubio is a pretty cautious guy. Gov. John Kasich seems like the fellow most likely to engage in a righteous act of ""I can't take it any more."" He's already given the off-Broadway version of this, railing Tuesday at the zany ideas from various rivals. Will it work in the debate if he takes the show to a bigger audience? Or will he simply raise questions about Trump and Carson that allow Rubio to rise? (The Gephardt-attacks-Dean-and-helps-Kerry scenario of 2004.) Gov. Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina are also likely to come to the debate with some pepper in their pocket. Fiorina has boosted her chances through previous debates but has not shown staying power. Time for her to get another charge. Christie is presenting himself as the only candidate who can prosecute Hillary Clinton, so he has an interest in showing just what that would look like. Plus, of all the candidates other than Trump, he is the one whose message is most contained in his behavior. After each debate there has been one Republican candidate who has succumbed to the reality of low poll numbers and empty bank accounts. With fewer than 100 days before the Iowa caucus, for some of the candidates taking the stage, this may be the last chance."	What the GOP's Top Candidates Must Do on Fight Night
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/presidential_hopefuls_reimagined_as_music_stars.html	"The 2016 presidential campaign has already inspired a lot of records, from the amount of cash raised (almost $300 million to date each in unlimited and limited donations) to the number of fact-free speculations and outright falsehoods presented as talking points (just shy of incalculable). With the election still a year away, why not add nine more records--or album covers, at least. Matthew Newell, of satirical firm Newell Capital Venture Partners, remixes the presidential hopefuls by taking them off the campaign trail and into iconic music genres. ""There's the 'brand' that the candidate is trying to portray,"" Newell says, ""and the one the voters and media are assigning to them. The album covers attempt to pair the two."" Ahead of Wednesday night's GOP primary debate, let's take them for a spin. Jeb Bush, Meditations on Expectations ""I have never thought that Jeb gets enough credit for his introspection. In fact, he's been branded as 'low energy' because of it. Positing him as a folk singer, thoughtful and introverted, really made sense. And there's also a little bit of Garfunkel to his family situation."" Dr. Ben Carson, An Odyssey of Other Worldly Science and Understandings ""I couldn't believe it when I found that photo of Ben Carson--which is not altered, by the way! It so perfectly lent itself to a '50s-era sci-fi record. And what is a theremin brigade?"" Hillary Clinton, Watch the Oval ""This is based on the Jay Z and Kanye West album Watch the Throne, which I thought was fitting for Hillary Clinton. In both cases, there's a ton of talent and swagger there, but half your energy is spent just maintaining your power and control."" Ted Cruz, Sing the Good Word of God as He Intended Through the Bible ""A gospel album, of course. I just wanted the title to be super-super-long and sermon-y because, boy, can that guy talk when he's got a mic."" Carly Fiorina, Countdwn 2 Global Leadrshp ""I love her in the vein of Pink or Lady Gaga: I am a strong, independent woman, I'm going to tell you who I am and no one is going to alter that."" Bobby Jindal, My Blood Runs Red White and USA ""It's almost like he's upset with himself for not being more John Wayne. He's often the butt of jokes, but I think he personally would actually really love this country/western album cover interpretation."" Marco Rubio, Beats Laws & Life ""He's the perfect electronic dance music (EDM) candidate. Young, taking on authority, from a unique cultural heritage. Someone pointed out to me after we released this collection that Rubio also has constant dry mouth, which is a side affect of some common EDM drugs."" Bernie Sanders, Dig Us Out ""It's based on a pretty well-known Sleater-Kinney album cover, and the title Dig Us Out came from Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out, which is fitting, given that both of them have high-indie status. I had that photo of Bernie on election night (maybe for mayor?) colorized since it was black-and-white in its original form."" Donald Trump, Manhattan Nights, Queens Soul ""Of course, it would have been easy to have some fun with the clown angle, but I loved going with an old-school R&B theme. And the song title 'Drop the Bigly Important Funk' still makes me laugh every time."""	These Strange and Wonderful Vinyl Album Covers Imagine the Candidates as Music Stars
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/the_budget_deal_won_t_save_us_the_freedom_caucus_will_be_waiting_to_provoke.html	"Rejoice, America: With the new budget and debt deal struck by congressional leaders and the White House late Monday, the Obama-Boehner Era of Constant Arbitrary Crises is over. Enjoy the next 18 months of relative solitude while it lasts. We don't know who the president will be the next time the debt ceiling needs a lift. We can't even be sure who the speaker or Senate majority leader will be. All we know for certain is that in early 2017, the source of the problem--the members of the House Freedom Caucus, or at least most of them--will still be there, and they will still be subject to the same political pressures that have made their band the toxic force against governance that it is today. The only way the federal government is able to function properly right now is for a sitting speaker to blow himself up. John Boehner has been exhausting all the capital he accrued within his conference, over some 20 years of service, from the day he assumed the gavel. After the exhausting spending and debt ceiling battles of 2011 and the 2013 government shutdown, Boehner spent the last two years relying on Democratic votes to fund the government and lift the debt limit. The Tea Party members whose numbers propelled Boehner to the third-highest position in American government five years ago--now voting en bloc under the recently certified House Freedom Caucus--were preparing to oust him if he did it again. So he took himself out and pledged to ""clean the barn"" for his successor ahead of time. The deal that was reported Monday night resolves the two stickiest lingering questions for the 114th Congress. It raises the debt ceiling through early 2017 and modestly lifts the spending sequestration caps over the course of two fiscal years. Republicans will sell the debt ceiling hike through a somewhat clever spin: that they were able to extract concessions from the White House after all. Eh, not really. The deal over spending is a deal that would have been necessary anyway, while a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase is simply thrown into the same legislative vehicle. As for that budget deal, it gives Democrats increases in discretionary spending and Republicans (and plenty of Democrats!) increases in defense spending. The White House also will allow Republicans a kick in the ribs to recipients of Social Security disability benefits, along with provider-side Medicare cuts. Those entitlement cuts will cost significant Democratic votes, and obviously the House Freedom Caucus is losing its mind. But the deal should still have enough votes to pass the House on Wednesday and the Senate sometime early next week. The deal eliminates the source of the budget impasse--spending levels--though it does not completely eliminate the threat of a government shutdown. The budget offers a funding skeleton that will have to be filled in through appropriations bills in mid-December. Rep. Paul Ryan's first test as speaker will be to usher those appropriations through without his members throwing in too many poisonous riders. He should have some room to navigate before being cast asunder, since it's only his first test. But if he can't achieve perfection, he, too, will already be on the Boehneresque path of capital depletion. Speaking of Paul Ryan: What does he think about this deal? ""Paul Ryan Silent as Permanent Political Class Cooks Up Giant Backroom Big Government Budget, Debt Ceiling Deal"" is how the always-understated Breitbart news team puts it. Indeed, Ryan reportedly had zero contribution to Monday evening's closed-door House Republican discussion of the deal. As a procedural realist and the lead Republican negotiator of the previous two-year budget agreement, Ryan surely gets it. These sorts of deals are never pretty, and it's best if responsible people are the ones negotiating them away from television cameras. But as the incoming speaker whom the party's conservative wing views skeptically, Ryan is forced to say that the way the deal was crafted ""stinks."" That would appear to be Ryan ""blasting"" Boehner--that's the point!--but Boehner probably encouraged Ryan to ""blast"" him. What's one more arrow to a dead body? Boehner's reign, and the era of brinksmanship between his House and the Obama administration that has defined the last five years of dysfunction, ends with him falling on a grenade for Ryan. Not that there was much risk of it, but to be clear: Don't feel bad for Boehner. Few people get the opportunity to serve so highly in their political careers, and now he gets to spend his golden years playing golf and smoking cigarettes and ""consulting on the side"" at a going rate of something like $10 million an hour. Boehner now becomes just another outside-observing schlub who fears what will happen when the provisions of this deal expire in 2017. The Senate and the White House are up for grabs in next year's elections, but the House will almost certainly remain in Republican control. And within that majority conference, there will be a few dozen hardline members who demand more than what's mathematically possible."	Why This Budget Deal Won't Save Us
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/freedom_caucus_frightened_by_criticism_for_allowing_paul_ryan_s_house_speaker.html	"Members of the House Freedom Caucus, the ultra-conservative band of roughly 40 lawmakers who unfortunately hold veto power over the country's business, are now on the receiving end of the same treatment that they're usually dishing out. Conservative media and hard-right constituents are calling them sell-out scumbags for offering a ""supermajority"" of support--though not an official endorsement!--to Rep. Paul Ryan's bid to be the next House speaker. Doesn't it just put a tear to your eye? Much of the conservative media industry has been bearing down on Freedom Caucus members for not using their veto power to nix Ryan, the elite, RINO monster who only a couple of years ago was considered a leading spokesman for hardline conservatives. Rush Limbaugh has dubbed Ryan ""the new [Eric] Cantor, in terms of moving the donor agenda."" (We're so old that we can remember when Cantor, too, was the Tea Party's man in the leadership.) Radio host Laura Ingraham, who played a central role in orchestrating Cantor's 2014 primary ouster, has been blitzing Ryan relentlessly. Ditto Mark Levin, Erick Erickson, Ann Coulter, and juggernaut Web properties like Breitbart News and the Drudge Report. Conservatives constituents are parlaying the talk-radio hosts' message into angry phone calls and Facebook comments. ""The groundswell of support from hard-core conservative voters that emboldened the group as it battled Boehner and the GOP establishment,"" the Washington Post reports, ""seemed to subside for the first time in months. That has put its members in the unfamiliar position of defending their right flank."" The members, in response, are begging their constituents and media hosts for a chance to explain. They have material to work with. They can argue that they were able to get Ryan to cave on some of his conditions for serving as speaker, because they did. Ryan backed off his demand that the Freedom Caucus officially endorse him, and he didn't require any of the rule changes he was seeking before accepting their acquiescence and plowing ahead with his bid. The members can also argue that they got a pledge out of Ryan not to call up a 2013-style comprehensive immigration reform bill--not that there was ever much chance of him doing that, but his prior support for donor-friendly immigration reform (aka a package including ""amnesty"") was a major concern among the talk-radio crowd. Ryan has also agreed to follow the ""Hastert Rule,"" in which he will only take up bills that have the support of a majority of the majority conference. Most likely, Freedom Caucus members will make all of these persuasive arguments about how they bended Ryan to their will before signing off, and it will not matter. At no moment in this process will Freedom Caucus members be deserving of sympathy. It is their fault that the constituents who empower their crusades are unresponsive to reason. When it comes to confronting their constituents with facts, they have been cowards, choosing to fan the prevailing rage rather than challenge it. The far right has not been honest with its constituents about the limits to Republican power in the current configuration of government. Control of Congress gives Republicans leverage in making compromise legislation with the Democrats. But without the White House--and some reform to the modern, lethal filibuster--it is nearly impossible to pass pure ideological wins like a repeal or defunding of the Affordable Care Act or a ban on federal dollars for Planned Parenthood. Instead of explaining these limits to their constituents, these conservatives promise to ""fight."" Their battle goes nowhere; Republican leaders are mathematically forced to cave to Democrats, and conservatives blame their leaders instead of themselves for building up false expectations. And they get away with it. The conservative flank has also not been honest with its constituents about the debt ceiling. It does not explain that this is a law that doesn't make sense. It's phony leverage, since no leader is likely to allow the country to breach the debt ceiling. And increasing the debt ceiling doesn't authorize new spending; it merely allows the Treasury Department to finance the spending that Congress and the White House have already passed into law. If these lawmakers ever bothered offering an honest explanation of this stupid statutory limit to their constituents, instead of feasting off of their misunderstanding, perhaps their lives and the state of the country would run more smoothly. It can be done. Until recently, the majority party has taken care of raising the debt ceiling while the minority has voted against it. But when it became clear that the House Republican majority wouldn't supply all the votes when it took power in 2011, Democrats began explaining the necessity of raising it. Now it's something that Democratic constituents support. Being honest instead of pandering can work, sometimes. You first have to try. The Freedom Caucus' irresponsible antics have quite obviously earned them enmity among party leaders, donors, and moderates. In the most comical example of their cowardice, these members are trying to use the speaker's election process to ensure that they are never put through the same test that Tea Partiers delight in subjecting ""establishment"" candidates to: primaries. The Chamber of Commerce, which successfully propped up many ""establishment"" Republican Senate candidates against Tea Party challengers in 2014, is talking about going after more obnoxious House Tea Party members in 2016. The Freedom Caucus wants the next speaker and his leadership team to ""step in to make sure that [doesn't] happen,"" according to Rep. Mick Mulvaney. They're throwing a fit. And, God help him, Paul Ryan is treating this seriously instead of laughing it off. The good news for Freedom Caucus members is that it appears that Speaker Boehner will try to push through a bipartisan, two-year debt ceiling and budget deal package as his last act before Ryan is elected speaker. It's not good news because Freedom Caucus members will like the sweeping package--early outlines of the deal suggest that conservatives will complain about this like it's Christmas morning and their parents bought them the wrong color pony. But at least it will be Boehner who brings it to the floor instead of Ryan, the sellout RINO whom the sellout RINO Freedom Caucus allowed to become speaker."	The Freedom Caucus Is Nothing but Cowards
