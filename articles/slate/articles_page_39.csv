By the time lawmakers return, it will have been more than five months since President Obama officially tapped Lynch for the job, and more than one month since the Judiciary Committee finally got around to giving her nomination its stamp of approval. In that time, the rationale Republicans have given for the delay has steadily devolved from highly questionable to flat-out nonsensical. Lynch's wait, meanwhile, has gone from unusually long to historically so. Through it all, the question inside the Beltway has remained when--not if--the GOP would finally relent and allow the Senate to confirm Lynch, and for good reason. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised in January to give Lynch the ""courtesy of a vote,"" and there was little reason to doubt she'd ultimately be approved if given the chance. The upper chamber, after all, had voted unanimously in 1999 and in 2010 to confirm her as a U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, New York, the position she currently holds. Even those Republicans who now oppose her attorney general nomination haven't found a legitimate reason to actually stop it. Most informal whip counts predict Lynch would be confirmed in a historic, if largely drama-free, squeaker, with the four Republicans who have already publicly supported her crossing the aisle and Vice President Joe Biden casting the tie-breaking vote. But with no actual vote on the horizon, it's now reasonable to wonder: Will the GOP ever bring Lynch's nomination to the floor? And, if it does, will she still get through? McConnell has made it clear that he is unwilling to take up the nomination until the chamber settles an unrelated, and potentially unending, fight over abortion funding in a human-trafficking bill--a head-scratching prerequisite that wasn't on anyone's radar until after the fight broke out earlier this month. ""The only thing holding up that vote is the Democrats' filibuster of a bill that would help prevent kids from being sold into sex slavery,"" McConnell spokesman Don Stewart told Slate in an email on Friday after being asked when or if a confirmation vote would happen. ""The sooner they allow the Senate to pass that bipartisan bill, the sooner the Senate can move to the Lynch nomination."" That explanation conveniently ignores the fact that Republicans had ample opportunity to give Lynch a vote before or after taking up the human-trafficking bill, and they will again once they return to work in mid-April. Regardless, if McConnell sticks to his guns as he has promised, and Democrats continue to filibuster the human-trafficking bill as they've promised, both the legislation and Lynch's nomination will remain stuck in procedural limbo for the foreseeable future. So where does that leave Lynch's chances of confirmation? It's difficult to say, in no small part because McConnell has steered the Senate into uncharted territory. When the Senate returns from its break, Lynch will have officially waited longer than any Cabinet nominee in the past three administrations. The last attorney general to have waited longer was Reagan nominee Edwin Meese III, whose confirmation dragged on for more than a year while the Justice Department investigated his professional and personal affairs. Still, the Senate has almost always eventually signed off on a president's Cabinet-level pick. Lawmakers have only formally rejected such a nomination nine times, and only once since 1980. And in that case, George H.W. Bush's nomination of John Tower to be defense secretary was doomed by allegations of his alcohol abuse and womanizing. (Tower still came within three votes of confirmation.) On those rare occasions that Cabinet-level nominations do fail, they're typically withdrawn before they get to a vote. That's happened during formal Senate consideration a total of seven times since World War II--but each and every time it was a result of questions about the actual nominee, be it about his performance in a previous federal job (Anthony Lake) or an issue with back taxes (Tom Daschle). No such issue has surfaced for Lynch in the past five months, and it would be a shock if it did in the next five. She emerged from her latest vetting in arguably even better shape than she entered, and try as they might, conservatives have been unable to uncover anything scandalous. Even the GOP witnesses who testified at her confirmation hearings didn't have a bad word to say about her as a person or an attorney. Rudy Giuliani has declared her ""overqualified"" for the AG position. But Republican opposition to Lynch has never been about Lynch--it's been about Obama and his immigration reforms. McConnell has suggested Republican anger over those reforms--and Lynch's refusal to break with her current and future boss over them--won't preclude her from getting a vote, but it's clearly a major reason he's in no hurry to give her one. Ironically, that opposition means that Lynch, who played no role in those executive actions, remains sidelined while Eric Holder, who approved the legal justification for them, remains on the job. Still, time remains Lynch's enemy. Generally speaking, the longer confirmation proceedings drag on, the greater the chance that they end in failure. Aye votes can change to nays when questions go unanswered or problems arise, but the reverse hardly ever happens--particularly when the majority party is looking for reasons to vote against a president's nominee, as the GOP clearly is in Lynch's case. Gun-rights groups recently launched their own anti-Lynch push, warning senators that she was nothing more than ""Eric Holder in a skirt."" (Such an argument relies on lawmakers being more afraid of Holder in a skirt than of him in pants.) This particular effort doesn't appear to have cost her any votes, but it also suggests she'll continue to be battered by the conservative storm indefinitely. She might not escape unscathed next time. The biggest danger for Lynch might actually come from the Democratic side of the aisle. It's long been assumed that all 46 members of the Democratic caucus would vote in favor of Lynch. But that is no longer a given. The big question mark comes in the form of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat currently at the center of a long-running corruption investigation by the Department of Justice who reportedly could be indicted any day. Assuming he is, Menendez's current conflict of interest in regard to Lynch would only grow: Vote for confirmation, and be accused of trying to curry favor with a woman who would lead the agency prosecuting him; vote against her, and risk being accused of seeking political revenge against the Obama administration, which Menendez's allies have suggested is pushing the DOJ investigation as a retribution for the senator's outspoken criticism of the president's foreign policies. According to federal officials who spoke with the New York Times, Menendez is considering a third option: abstaining. That might be the reasonable and fair thing to do--but it probably wouldn't be seen that way by Democrats on the Hill, given that an abstention, like a no vote, would likely leave Lynch one vote shy of the 50 she needs. Asked on Wednesday what he plans to do, Menendez refused to put anyone's mind at ease. ""I'll decide that when she gets to the floor,"" he told Politico. Assuming McConnell ultimately gives Menendez that chance, Lynch appears destined to become either the first black woman to lead the Department of Justice, or the first modern-day Cabinet nominee to be rejected for reasons that have nothing to do with her."

The idea is that politics are contingent and that it's foolish to assume outcomes and make predictions. Anything could happen, goes the argument, so we should be modest in our prophecies. But this isn't true. While there's a lot we can't predict in politics, we have enough data to make strong estimates about the future and to rule out certain outcomes. We can't say if Hillary Clinton will win the presidency, but we can confidently predict that former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley won't be the Democratic nominee. Which brings us to Sen. Ted Cruz. On Monday, I made a definitive prediction that Cruz would lose the Republican nomination fight and thus the race for the Oval Office. Writing for National Review, Kevin Williamson sneers at this (and similar) arguments, asserting three points: that Cruz could win the White House if he were the nominee; that the field is fluid, and anyone could be the nominee (""In football, any team can win on any given Sunday; in politics, any candidate can win on any given Tuesday""); and that history gives us a precedent for a Cruz victory--Ronald Reagan. Williamson is right to say Cruz could win if he were the nominee, but that's a truism. By definition, anyone who wins a major party nomination has a great chance of becoming president. The question that matters is whether the Republican Party would ever agree on Cruz for the nomination. And the answer is almost certainly no. Reagan is instructive. Williamson cites him as an example of how predictions like mine can fail:"	Ted Cruz Is No Ronald Reagan

Unfortunately for the planet, it's not looking pretty. Here's what the leading 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls have to say about climate change: Jeb Bush: ""I'm a skeptic."" Scott Walker: Masterfully evaded a second-grader's questions on his climate position last month, saying, ""I was a Boy Scout ... campsites should be cleaner when we leave than when we found it."" He's signed a pledge to oppose any climate change legislation that includes a ""net increase in government revenue."" Ben Carson: ""You can ask it several different ways, but my answer is going to be the same,"" he told a Bloomberg reporter last year. ""We may be warming. We may be cooling."" Rand Paul: Recently voted in support of a Senate amendment that said climate change is real and humans are contributing to it. But just last year, he said the science on climate change was ""not conclusive."" Marco Rubio: ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate,"" he said last year on ABC's This Week. Ted Cruz: Denies a human influence on climate, recently telling CNN ""there's never been a day in the history of the world in which the climate is not changing."" For years now, the GOP has looked the other way on climate change. Even as voters' preferences evolve, Republican politicians have demonstrated an unwavering, shortsighted commitment to denying that humans have anything to do with the Earth's rising temperature. A recent poll of self-identified Republicans and Republican-leaning independents found only one-third of respondents agreed with their party's position on climate change, with a large majority saying their elected representatives are unresponsive to their views on the issue. Global action on climate change is in large part contingent on what America, as the leading historical emitter of carbon dioxide, decides to do. It's not a stretch to say the world depends on near-term leadership from the Republican Party, and the only way to get the country's climate policies in line with popular demand, not to mention working toward decoupling economic growth from the use of fossil fuels, is a pro-climate Republican president. Thankfully, there exists just the candidate for the job: Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. On Monday, in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Graham lambasted his fellow Republicans for their lack of progress on climate change, saying some ""soul-searching"" was needed within the party on this critical issue.* ""When it comes to climate change being real, people of my party are all over the board,"" he said. ""Before we can be bipartisan, we gotta figure out where we are as a party. What is the environmental platform of the Republican Party?"" Graham asked. ""I'd like to come up with one. I'd like to have a debate within the party. Can you say that climate change is a scientifically sound phenomenon, but can you reject the idea you have to destroy the economy to solve the problem is sort of where I'll be taking this debate."" Those words couldn't be more welcome. As a senator, Graham has been a consistent centrist voice on climate, a stark contrast to the other, more extreme 2016 Republican contenders. He co-authored climate legislation that narrowly failed the Senate in 2009 and 2010 (the closest the U.S. has ever come to comprehensive climate policy). He's supported an expanded role for nuclear power and stressed the importance of limiting air pollution to improve public health. His voting record reflects his philosophy that the way forward on climate isn't through regulation, but through incentives to support American leadership in the clean energy economy, like tax breaks for innovative companies. The Environmental Defense Fund, a major nonprofit advocacy organization, has even held fundraisers for Graham. This statement from his 2010 Senate floor speech pretty much sums up his approach: ""Carbon is bad. Let's do something about it in a common sense way."" For years, Graham has been a staunch critic of global warming extremism, on both the right and the left. On Monday, his practical talk on climate again struck that sane chord: ""The problem is Al Gore's turned this thing into religion. You know, climate change is not a religious problem for me. It's an economic--it is an environmental problem."" In addition to Al Gore's mixed messages on climate, right-wing politicization of science has helped make climate change the single most polarizing issue of our time. It doesn't have to be this way. Given that the world's carbon budget is quickly depleting, an end to talking past one another on this issue can't come soon enough. Now, for center-left voters, Graham brings a lot of baggage: He's a definite hawk when it comes to American military involvement in the Middle East, and he voted against Obama's health care reform. He's also said he's never sent an email before, which is just weird. But if you believe, as I do (and President Obama says he does), that climate change is an issue of unique import and poses a threat to our national security, then Graham is uniquely qualified to lead our country to a brighter, cleaner future. Yes, there are Democrats who are more progressive on climate, but Graham has the ability to bridge the divide between the right and the left by motivating the GOP to consider practical solutions to climate change that can improve the welfare of the entire world. The business-as-usual climate change scenarios are truly frightening: If we don't change our path in the next few years--within the term of the next American president--we'll greatly jeopardize our chances of maintaining a planet that closely resembles the one that gave rise to human civilization. That alone merits single-issue voting on climate, and it's why Lindsey Graham needs to run for president. Correction, March 26, 2015: This article originally misstated the location of Lindsey Graham's Council on Foreign Relations speech. It was in New York, not Washington. (Return.)"

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/why_ted_cruz_chose_liberty_university_the_texas_senator_chose_a_socially.html	"With degrees from Princeton University and Harvard Law, Sen. Ted Cruz may have the most sterling academic resume of any Republican presidential contender. But to officially announce his 2016 bid on Monday, he headed to a non-elite Christian school in central Virginia: Liberty University, the socially conservative school pastor Jerry Falwell founded in 1971. Much has been said about how Cruz's choice of venue reflects his need to court the conservative evangelical Christian voters that propelled George W. Bush to two presidential victories, but Liberty's importance isn't just symbolism and optics. Since overcoming significant financial problems in the 1990s, the school has transformed itself into a conservative force in a state with a bitterly divided Republican Party. If the only people who heard Cruz's speech today were the students sitting in the auditorium, it still would have been strategically valuable. Falwell, whom Sen. John McCain once dubbed an ""agent of intolerance,"" died in 2007, but his legacy is alive and kicking at Liberty. That wasn't always assured. In 1990, as Christianity Today reported, the school was $110 million in debt and on probation by accreditors. Things looked bleak. But major benefactors materialized, including the controversial Rev. Sun Myung Moon, and after Falwell's death, the school used the millions he left in life insurance money to get debt-free. Since then, it's seen its admission numbers swell, its endowment grow, and its clout in Old Dominion political circles expand. ""Falwell Jr. has made no secret of his branding strategy,"" said Ken Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund and former Virginia attorney general, referring to the late pastor's son who now serves as the university's president. ""He wants to be the Protestant Notre Dame."" It's slowly getting there. The school reports that it has more than 13,500 students on campus and 95,000 or so taking classes online. And in the world of Virginia Republican politics, it has substantial sway. ""If you look at that university 20 years ago, they were struggling financially, they were still working hard to get their feet under them,"" Cuccinelli said. ""By the mid-2000s, they had some real momentum going. They're now in an extremely strong position, and part of that trajectory has been just getting bigger."" It's become a powerful organizing center for conservative activists, according to Cuccinelli. More than perhaps any other single institution, Liberty produces thousands of graduates--many of whom remain in Virginia--who volunteer and vote for conservative causes. Though national evangelical Christians have shown less interest in conservative politicking during the Obama years, Liberty University has remained a stronghold for the religious Republican right. So Cruz's speech Monday wasn't just about courting the prominent and well-connected evangelical leaders who run and admire Liberty; it was also a chance for him to talk to a room full of potential future campaign workers. ""Every campaign is trying to find those 18-to-22-year-old, young, energetic, hardworking conservatives who will walk in neighborhoods in 100 degrees in August and knock on doors,"" said one plugged-in Virginia Republican operative. ""At Liberty University, you have thousands of those people."" He added that speaking at Liberty will likely be a rite of passage for Republican presidential contenders courting social conservatives. Sen. Rand Paul and Cuccinelli spoke there in October 2013, and former Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann stopped by during her bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. More interestingly, McCain spoke at the school in the run-up to his 2008 presidential bid, in an effort to make nice with social conservatives. Future presidential contenders are guaranteed to follow, though it may not be a universal draw. ""You're probably not going to see a Chris Christie at Liberty,"" said Cuccinelli. ""You're probably not going to see that. The odds are very low."" More than anything else, the school is socially conservative, and numerous sources said its graduates and volunteers have helped push the Virginia Republican Party to the right. While the state's moderate Republicans have sought to find candidates who focus more on regulatory policy and tax reform than on marriage and abortion, Falwell's heirs have been part of a countervailing--and now dominant--force. The Virginia Republican world is essentially divided into two factions: moderate, business-oriented Republicans who prefer that candidates be nominated in primaries, and grassroots, Tea Party-friendly, socially conservative activists who prefer using conventions to pick nominees. The acrimonious fighting between those two groups has often left the party's eventual nominees hobbled and bruised, and it's part of the reason Democrats control both Senate seats in Virginia as well as the governorship. Liberty students and alumni aren't a monolith, but they tend to follow in the socially conservative, grassroots-friendly category. And their organizing and activism have played a powerful role in pushing Virginia Republican politics rightward; after then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his primary in a shocking upset to Tea Party-friendly candidate Dave Brat, some moderate Virginia Republicans told me that their sway in the state had largely vanished. Liberty alumni and allies have fortified the conservative ranks that took down Cantor and his compatriots. There are schools that are more conservative than Liberty, and there are schools that are bigger, but no school is both. The fact that Liberty is in a state that you have to win if you want to be president means that scheduling a campus visit may now be mandatory for Republican presidential hopefuls."

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/america_s_hospitals_our_system_lets_big_hospitals_charge_exorbitant_prices.html	"Five years ago this week, Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, and we've been debating it ever since. Like many Americans, I oppose Obamacare, and I think we ought to repeal it and replace it. Over the past few months, however, I've come to the conclusion that the fight over Obamacare is a distraction from a much deeper problem, which is that America's hospitals are robbing us blind. I realize that this is an impolitic thing to say. What kind of lousy ingrate doesn't love hospitals? Go to any big American city, including cities like Cleveland and Pittsburgh that have been devastated by deindustrialization and joblessness, and you'll find a mammoth hospital complex in the center of town, buzzing with activity. Forget about big cities--there is a hospital in every congressional district in America, and local hospitals are often among the largest employers in the district. One of the reasons President Clinton's 1993 health reform effort failed is that he never won over the hospital lobby. President Obama learned from the Clinton debacle; hospitals were among his most important allies. Republicans get in on the act too. Right now, for example, a number of GOP lawmakers are pushing a Medicare ""reform"" that guarantees higher payments to doctors and hospitals today in exchange for the promise of spending reductions a decade or two from now. Good luck with that. You can hardly blame them though. The health sector employs more than a tenth of all U.S. workers, most of whom are working- and middle-class people who serve as human shields for those who profit most from America's obscenely high medical prices and an epidemic of overtreatment. If you aim for the crooks responsible for bleeding us dry, you risk hitting the nurses, technicians, and orderlies they employ. This is why politicians are so quick to bash insurers while catering to the powerful hospital systems, which dictate terms to insurers and have mastered the art of gaming Medicare and Medicaid to their advantage. Whether you're for Obamacare or against it, you can't afford to ignore the fact that America's hospitals have become predatory monopolies. We have to break them before they break us. What do I mean by that? Last fall, Mark Warshawsky and Andrew Biggs made a striking observation: From 1999 to 2013, the cost to employers of an average family health policy increased from $4,200 to $12,000 per year. In an alternative universe in which employer premiums had remained flat, salaries would have been $7,800 higher, a life-changing difference for most low- and middle-income families. To protect these families, many people want the government to pick up a bigger share of our hospital bills. But this just shifts the burden from employers to taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office expects federal health spending to almost double as a share of GDP between now and 2039. With the exception of interest on the debt, all other federal spending will shrink. What this means in practice is that high medical prices charged by hospitals will gobble up taxpayer dollars that might otherwise have gone to giving poor people more cash assistance, welfare-to-work programs, and Pell grants; fixing potholes; sending missions to Mars; and who knows what else. When you survey the health systems of other rich countries, you'll find some that rely a bit more on private insurance markets than ours (like Switzerland) and others that rely a bit more on centralized bureaucracies (like Britain), but what you won't find is a country where hospitals dare to charge such obscenely high prices. Avik Roy, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a conservative health reform guru, has observed that although the average hospital stay in the world's rich countries is $6,222, it costs $18,142 in the U.S. Guess what? Spending three times as much doesn't appear to yield three times the benefit. As for why hospitals charge such high prices, it's fairly simple: They do it because they can. In a competitive market, a provider who jacks up prices risks losing customers to competitors who charge less. But what if incumbent providers have the political muscle to keep competitors out of the market? What if regulators look the other way when incumbent providers buy up the competition, or even help the process along? That, in a nutshell, is the situation with America's hospitals, as Chris Pope outlines in a recent Heritage Foundation paper on consolidation in the health care market. Because most medical care is purchased not by consumers but by third parties, like Medicare and Medicaid or your insurance company, and because consumers rarely get access to reliable data on quality, they place an extremely high value on convenience. If you're not saving money by shopping around for a better deal, and if you have no idea if you're getting better care, you might as well go to the hospital closest to you. Hospitals that don't face competition from other nearby hospitals thus have a huge amount of power in their local markets. If a private insurer refuses to pay a hospital's exorbitant prices, a hospital can just walk and wait for the insurer's customers to scream bloody murder over the fact that they can't use their local hospital. You'd think this would be a strong argument against allowing hospitals to merge, so that we could at least avoid reducing competition. Yet from 1998 to 2012, the 5,000 or so hospitals in the United States saw 1,133 mergers and acquisitions. The bigger, more dominant you are in a local market, the more you can extract from private insurers and taxpayers. There are differences between how private insurers and Medicare deal with the power of hospitals. When insurers have tried to play hardball with the hospitals that gouge them, as in the 1990s, when managed-care organizations kept rising health care costs in check for a few short years, hospitals pressured state legislatures to enact ""selective contracting"" and ""any willing provider"" laws that impeded MCOs from steering patients to facilities where they could negotiate good rates. Moreover, MCOs can't do much if a local hospital buys up all of the nearby medical providers. But wait a second. How is it that hospitals are also gouging Medicare? Medicare alone accounts for 20 percent of all national health expenditures, a number that, if anything, understates the extent of its influence. Shouldn't Medicare be able to use its pricing power to get hospitals to play ball? Medicare offers standardized reimbursement rates for different services, which hospitals always insist are far too low. Yet for some routine medical procedures, the reimbursement rate is higher than the cost of performing the procedure (which, once you already have the equipment and the personnel, can be pretty low), meaning the hospital makes money off of the procedures. For other services, like giving a patient personal attention, the reimbursement rate is lower than the cost of providing the service, so this is where hospitals skimp. The unsurprising result is that we have a health system that is increasingly devoid of personal attention while at the same time generating an ever-higher volume of the medical procedures for which Medicare is willing to overcompensate. To make things even more maddening, Medicare pays hospitals more than other sites of service for the same medical procedures, on the grounds that hospitals perform several unique and valuable functions, like providing uncompensated care for people who turn up at emergency rooms. This has led to a number of hilariously perverse outcomes. For example, as Margot Sanger-Katz has reported in the New York Times, hospitals have been buying up doctors' offices, because doing so allows the exact same offices to charge Medicare higher prices for performing the exact same services, because the government has decided that hospital-based care is intrinsically more expensive than office care. While we can all agree that emergency care is important and that hospitals should be paid for providing it, it's not at all obvious that we should compensate hospitals more generously for all procedures, including elective procedures for run-of-the-mill insured patients. These higher reimbursement rates make it hard for independent providers of medical services--those that aren't part of existing hospitals--to compete with hospitals, even when they're capable of performing procedures for less. In short, higher reimbursement rates for hospitals entrench the monopoly power of hospitals. It's funny how that works out. There are steps we can take to curb the power of our monopolistic hospitals. The Obama administration, to its great credit, is seeking to rein in the practice of paying hospitals more for the same medical services. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Barak Richman, a law professor at Duke, a leading expert on concentration in health care markets, and, for the record, a fan of Obamacare, has identified two paths forward. Our government can simply accept that the market power of hospitals will continue to increase while making more of an effort to force them to accept low reimbursement rates. This approach is certainly worth trying, yet it ignores the fact that because hospitals are big employers, they wield a great deal of political influence. Whenever bureaucrats try to tame hospitals, lawmakers ride to the rescue of the big medical providers. The second path is to rely on antitrust enforcement to crack down on hospital mergers and acquisitions and, more importantly in the long run, to make it easier for new medical providers to enter the business and to compete with hospitals. Naturally, hospitals hate this kind of competition, particularly from specialized providers that focus exclusively on providing one or two medical services inexpensively. To the hospitals, these providers ""cherry-pick"" and ""cannibalize"" their most profitable business lines without ever having to take on the larger burdens of running hospitals. There's some truth to these complaints, which is why governments should compensate hospitals directly for care that it wishes to subsidize. But we need smaller, more efficient competitors to keep the big hospitals in check and to drive down medical costs for society as a whole. Curbing the power of the big hospitals isn't a left-wing or a right-wing issue. Getting this right will make solving all of our health care woes much easier, regardless of where you fall on the wisdom of Obamacare. Let's get to it."

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/protests_over_martese_johnson_s_arrest_you_must_understand_uva_to_understand.html	"On almost any night in Charlottesville, Virginia, you'll find throngs of students on ""The Corner,"" the commercial strip of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and boutiques that serves the University of Virginia community. Most of those students will be drinking, and some of them will be underage. About 12:45 a.m. on Wednesday, one of those students--Martese Johnson, a third-year in the College of Arts and Sciences--was arrested while trying to enter Trinity Irish Pub. According to eyewitnesses, he was grabbed and flung to the ground after a bouncer for the bar turned him away. ""The uniformed ABC Agents observed and approached the individual after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment,"" reads the statement from the Virginia Department of Alcohol and Beverage Control, whose officers made the arrest. ""A determination was made by the agents to further detain the individual based on their observations and further questioning."" Initial reports said he had attempted to use a fake ID, but in a press conference on Thursday, his lawyer denied this. ""Martese presented a valid Illinois state identification card, issued in 2011,"" said attorney Daniel Watkins. Likewise, Johnson's roommate says that ""Martese does not own a fake ID."" Aside from Johnson's account and the official ABC report, the best look at what happened is a cellphone video, which shows a bloodied Johnson--injured by the fall--on the pavement, surrounded by ABC enforcement officers. Johnson is angry--yelling ""I go to UVA"" and that the officers are ""fucking racists""--but he isn't struggling. Johnson was detained and taken to a nearby medical center, where he was treated for his injuries. It's true we don't know what happened before the video was shot, and that ABC officers described Johnson as ""agitated and belligerent."" And it's possible that the charges--""resisting arrest, obstructing justice without threats of force, and profane swearing or intoxication in public""--are appropriate. But so far there's no evidence Johnson was violent with the agents, and there's an unconfirmed claim he wasn't drunk. ""[Johnson] apparently was not intoxicated by way of a breathalyzer test,"" said Marcus Martin, UVA's vice president for diversity and a professor of emergency medicine at the medical school, who spoke to Johnson after the incident. And if he was intoxicated? The Virginia criminal code treats ""profane swearing and intoxication in public"" as low-level misdemeanors that don't require arrest. This isn't the first time ABC enforcement agents have used excessive force or been overzealous in their methods. In 2013, half a dozen plainclothes ABC officers swarmed a UVA student as she left a grocery store in her car. Guns drawn, they tried to detain the young woman, mistaking her bottled water for alcohol. She was arrested and charged with three felonies, all of which were dropped. Later, the student--Elizabeth Daly--sued the Virginia ABC, winning a settlement of more than $200,000. Put simply, Virginia's unusual liquor laws, which give wide police power to the enforcement arm of the state's alcohol board, play an important part in understanding this story. At the same time, we shouldn't reduce this to the familiar ground of policy. The protests that Johnson's arrest has provoked at UVA are connected to larger national currents as well as the school's unique history. Johnson is black, and for himself as well as other students, this linked his experience to other incidents of police violence against black men, part of a larger narrative of race and policing, and reflected in the rhetoric of the protests. Students, black and white, chanted ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot,"" the slogan derived from early--and false--reports of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No, Johnson wasn't killed, but his experience resonated with black students at UVA. ""It's still hard for me,"" said one law school student at a Wednesday rally for Johnson. ""I can't believe I'm even up here right now, I have no words--because I'm sick and tired of this,"" he said. ""What I'm going to do is to continue to say that black lives matter until it's true."" Likewise, said one of the organizers, second-year student Aryn Frazier, ""We're here for Martese. We are here to love the countless other victims of police brutality. We are here for them. We are here because we could be them."" What's more, there's the particular racial atmosphere of the university. It would be inaccurate and unfair to say that all black students at UVA share a common experience of the school and its institutions. Some find community in the student mainstream, others in the rich collection of black organizations and clubs, and others still in their particular networks of friends and classmates. But while experiences vary, many black students can speak to moments of racial tension and outright racist aggression. ""People call you the N-word and say that you don't belong here. They don't realize what that does to the psyche. Then you have to go to class,"" explained one protester in an interview with ThinkProgress. To that point, I spoke with one alumnus who was once taunted with racial slurs while walking through campus, and another who could point to multiple incidents across his college career. Indeed, my first month at UVA was marked by a rash of racial disturbances, including one in which a black student living in a prestigious ""Lawn"" room--adjacent to the Rotunda, at the center of the university--was greeted with racist epithets (including ""Nigger"") on his door. And beyond these individual experiences is the broad context of black life at the UVA. For most of the last decade, first-year black enrollment held steady at 9 percent. As of 2012, it had dipped to 6 percent, which school officials attribute to the recession, weak economy, and a lack of outreach to younger students and their families. It says something of the present university environment that, out of the 47 Lawn room assignments for the 2015 school year, not a single one of the honors went to a black student. At a school as large as UVA, shrinking black enrollment--and the persistence of racial microaggressions--can create the feeling of isolation, even as the school keeps its commitment to programs and services for black students and other students of color, from a strong mentoring program and dedicated Office of African-American Affairs to merit scholarships for minority students and a dedicated team of minority college recruiters. It all adds up to a fraught environment of unresolved problems, where police violence against a black student sparks mass protests of dissatisfied students--black and white--and the school administration joins the criticism. UVA President Teresa Sullivan declared her ""commitment to seeking the truth about this incident,"" while Marcus Martin, joined with the school's dean of African-American affairs, Maurice Apprey, to condemn the entire incident. ""We are outraged by the brutality against a University of Virginia undergraduate student that occurred in the early hours Wednesday, March 18, 2015,"" reads their statement. ""This was wrong and should not have occurred. In the many years of our medical, professional and leadership roles at the University, we view the nature of this assault as highly unusual and appalling based on the information we have received."" Martin and Apprey are right. The assault of Martese Johnson is unusual--the kind of extreme event that rarely happens at a place as genteel and comfortable as Charlottesville. But that also makes it fitting. UVA is a school with a painful racial past. Designed by a slaveholder and built by slaves, it was one of the only educational institutions to own and use slaves. Its remembrance of that injustice is haphazard, and it's only in recent years that it's begun to talk openly about and commemorate the lives of enslaved people at the university, to say nothing of its founder, Thomas Jefferson, and his life of great brilliance and terrible depravity. The school lacked serious black enrollment until the 1970s, and there are still spaces in the university--like the predominantly white Greek system--that feel hostile to many black students. For all the pain this has caused Johnson, it's also an opportunity for UVA to renew its efforts at self-reflection and bolster its forward action. And the better my alma mater can understand its difficult past, the better it can confront and address the questions of its unsettled present."

According to a remarkable, almost surreal front-page story in Wednesday's Washington Post, the Democratic chieftains and activists in the early primary states are deeply aggrieved that Hillary Clinton has not yet graced them with her presence at coffee klatches and union halls, given that it is a mere 10 months until voting begins:	Hillary Clinton Doesn't Need to Start Campaigning Just to Please a Bunch of Democratic Party Chieftains
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/paul_ryan_releases_his_documentary_comeback_now_he_should_host_a_poverty.html	On Tuesday the conservative news site OpportunityLives.com released Comeback, a seven-part documentary about stories of redemption, inspired by Rep. Paul Ryan's travels to poverty-stricken communities since the 2012 campaign.* When he was running as Mitt Romney's second, Ryan realized that he didn't know enough about what was causing poverty and what could be done to help. So he traveled from city to city talking to civil society groups under the guidance and direction of Robert Woodson, founder and president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise. The stories he found of people rebounding from poverty, substance abuse, and homelessness are captured in the new documentary. The idea was to figure out what works and shine a light on it. Ryan is not the central figure in the stories, but the series itself is part of his theory about repairing troubled communities--leaders need to hold up and celebrate what's working. It's not the kind of thing Ryan could talk about or do when he was on a national ticket. In fact, Mitt Romney's campaign discouraged him from doing so. Presidential campaigns don't focus much on the poor. Of course, candidates mention the downtrodden in speeches, but the time and attention they pay to the kinds of programs and places Ryan visited are scant compared with those paid to taxes, education, or foreign policy. On the eve of the Agriculture Summit held two weeks ago in Iowa, I asked Catholic Charities in Des Moines to show me around. GOP hopefuls had made a great effort to get to Iowa that weekend, where they would talk about the Renewable Fuel Standard a much-discussed topic. I wanted to reverse that formula and see how little you would have to do to come into contact with those issues that aren't much discussed. I spent my afternoon on the east side of Des Moines, a place candidates pass through on their way to the state fair grounds but not a place where candidates stop. I picked Catholic Charities because their mandate is so broad. They help the hungry, homeless families, and refugees--many from countries in the Middle East whose identity the agency strives to protect for security reasons. The first stop was a family center in a converted gas station that sits at the intersection of two bus lines. Five hundred households a day are served rice packets, dry beans, and whatever the donation of the day may be--onions, bananas, or tomatoes. There's also a clothing pantry for those with job interviews or a child who needs a new winter coat. The stories echo Ryan's core message that it's hard to design a blanket policy when circumstances of need are so different. Grandparents come in for an emergency box because they can't afford to care for the grandchildren they are now unexpectedly raising on a fixed income. It's where those who receive Social Security go after cost-of-living adjustments take effect--because when landlords hear about the extra bit of cash, they raise the rent. At the family shelter, where families can stay for a month, you see exactly how the high cost of housing eats up so much of a family's budget, making it hard for them to get back on their feet. These are voices and struggles that often get overlooked. Almost every Republican candidate was in town to talk about the Renewable Fuel Standard, trade policy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Some had studied hard, anxious to show Iowa conservatives and Bruce Rastetter, the agricultural entrepreneur hosting the summit, that they understood the issues. Iowa is home to a large share of America's 2 million farmers. If farms aren't working, John Deere is laying people off. So it makes sense for candidates visiting the state to put effort into talking about the issues farmers face. But there are also close to 50 million poor people in America. No candidate is renting a private plane to spend a day at a summit discussing the kinds of issues Ryan is highlighting in Comeback. At least not yet. Ryan could change that by hosting a summit on the topics explored in his film. If his goal is to lift up what's working for all to see, injecting poverty into the presidential conversation would do that. Ryan is a conservative true believer, not a squish, so it wouldn't be a trap for Republicans. He knows the complexities of presidential politics, so he wouldn't make the venue difficult for potential candidates (unless they arrived with empty platitudes and nothing to say). The calendar is already filling up with cattle calls in various states, so he'll have to move fast to get a poverty summit on the schedule. Perhaps, if candidates are booked, he could host it on the east side of Des Moines this summer when every candidate from both parties will be driving through on their way to the state fair. *Correction, March 17, 2015: This post originally misstated that Paul Ryan released the miniseries Comeback. It was released by OpportunityLives.com. (Return.)	Paul Ryan Should Host a Poverty Summit

There is the jump-to-the-front-of-the-line privileges at Amtrak and airline ticket counters. There is federal legislation to incentivize employers to hire veterans and White House pressure on federal agencies to do so. And now comes another, increasingly prevalent way to show appreciation for those who've served in the military: exempting them from taxes. A growing number of states have moved to, or are considering, exempting military pensions from state income taxes. As the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, no fewer than 19 states are now considering legislation to create or expand tax breaks for veterans, with 65 bills toward that end pending in state houses. Last year, Iowa passed a full exemption and Nebraska enacted a partial one. Already, nearly half of all states don't tax military pensions at all (this includes the seven states that don't tax personal income, period), and 20 more states partially exempt them; there are only seven states left with no exemption for veterans. And with nearly 2 million Americans collecting military pensions, the exemptions come at a substantial cost to state coffers: In Maryland, a proposal by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan to exempt the 50,000 military pensions in the state from income taxes would cost the state $34 million in revenue and local governments $22 million, at a time when both are already facing a fiscal crunch. Proponents of the exemptions cite two different arguments on their behalf--without reckoning with the fact that the two arguments are contradictory. The first is the emotional argument made on behalf of other preferential policies for veterans, like hiring incentives for employers: We owe special treatment to those who have served the country in uniform and put themselves in harm's way, especially because so many veterans have difficulty adjusting to civilian life. ""This tax cut is the first step, among many to come, to ensuring that the people who spend their lives in service to others are given the support and tax relief they deserve,"" said Hogan in announcing his proposal for Maryland. The second is the economic argument made for other state tax breaks: Veterans are job-creators and productivity engines who will boost the business climate and bottom line of whatever state they live in. Indeed, many military retirees are not grizzled vets telling war stories on the porch, but relatively young men and women with thriving second careers. One can retire and collect a military pension after 20 years of service, so there are plenty of 42-year-old ""retirees"" who are collecting pensions of, say, $50,000 per year while making a good living as military contractors or management consultants, two common second-career destinations. States would like to attract these high earners, if not to tax their income than to have them spending their earnings--both military and private sector, plus their government benefits for health care and higher education--within their borders. ""When these folks come in from another state, they're going to buy homes and ... and some are going to be entrepreneurs,"" says Minnesota state Sen. Paul Gazelka, a Republican who is pushing a full exemption. ""It's about recruiting, just like we recruit businesses ... There are going to be states that are winners and losers, and I'd rather have more retiring veterans in Minnesota than less."" In effect, the case for pension exemptions takes two big drivers of government policy--the ""help veterans"" motivator and the ""attract job-creators"" one--and fuses them together. But proponents can't have it both ways. Either military retirees are a group that needs an extra boost, or they are a privileged class that, by virtue of the skills they've acquired in their military careers, are economic winners that a state wants to have for itself just as it wants the next Google server farm. Not to mention that the arguments each fail on their own, as well. If we are genuinely trying to help needy veterans, we shouldn't focus on the retired officers of advanced rank who put in the full 20 years to collect a pension, but rather the men and women of lower rank who left the military before earning this generous retirement benefit. By the military brass's own admission, its current pension system is skewed sharply in favor of those who retire after more than 20 years, leaving little for those who put themselves in harm's way but left earlier. And if a state is trying to attract military retirees for economic reasons, there is little evidence that exempting pensions from taxes serves as a major lure. The Journal cited a finding by legislative researchers in Minnesota showing that the state's military retiree population hadn't changed much, proportionally, compared with Wisconsin, which has fully exempted military pensions since 2001. After all, younger military retirees who are looking for a second career will likely base their decision on where to live more on where they can find a good job than on whether they save a couple thousand dollars in taxes. (For retirees who are truly retired, the tax math may matter more.) Chasing second-career military retirees with tax breaks may be just another version of the costly race-to-the-bottom that tax incentives for big employers have become. But then again, this is one area of public policy where lawmakers' thinking is especially muddled and prone to rash action. ""All politicians want to be seen as veteran friendly,"" says Peter Gudmundsson, a former Marine artillery officer who is now head of RecruitMilitary, a national veteran recruiting company, and who has spoken out against incentives for hiring veterans. ""I often joke that veteran support is one of the few things that right and left can agree on. The right wing likes the military and the left wing likes victim groups. As a basic rule, I have such confidence in veterans as a group, I don't think they need as much special treatment as politicians think they need."""	Veterans Should Pay Taxes Like Everyone Else
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/hillary_clinton_s_email_scandal_is_a_problem_for_trey_gowdy_the_republican.html	"It's painfully obvious that Hillary Clinton's email scandal has not been good news for her political ambitions. What is more unexpected is how Clinton's troubles are causing collateral damage for one of her chief Republican pursuers: Rep. Trey Gowdy. Gowdy sits atop the committee investigating the 2012 attacks on the Benghazi consulate in Libya that left four Americans dead--and his perch has become a politically precarious one. Instead of turning the congressman into a grassroots demigod adored by the conservative base, it's made him almost as much a target for the right as for the left. He'd already drawn criticism from hardline proponents of the Benghazi investigations for the pacing of the committee's search and the content of its hearings, but the new Clinton email revelations have some of Gowdy's biggest would-be allies turning on him. Andrew McCarthy, a policy fellow at the National Review Institute, has become Gowdy's conservative agitator in chief. Shortly after Clinton's email story broke, he wrote a column for National Review savaging Gowdy for failing to break the story earlier. McCarthy notes that Gowdy told Politico that his committee had emails as early as last summer showing Clinton using her private address for State Department business. ""Gowdy, by his own account, did not issue a subpoena to address a scandal he has long known about until the scandal became public,"" wrote McCarthy. ""That in itself is a scandal."" He continued, ruing that Gowdy and his investigators ""never made a peep"" about the emails, didn't reach out to telecommunication companies to preserve records, and didn't subpoena any related material. Then comes the kicker: ""There is abundant reason to fear that Republicans do not want to get to the bottom of Benghazi,"" he contends, charging that the truth could implicate Republican leadership in a theorized gun-running scheme between Syria and Libya. In other words, one of the most vocal supporters of the Benghazi investigation has charged that Gowdy could be part of a cover-up that helps House Republican Leadership and Hillary Clinton. The fact that these charges ran on the website of the flagship publication of the conservative movement--and the story was then picked up by Glenn Beck's heavily trafficked news site, The Blaze--is not good for Gowdy. (Disclosure: I formerly worked at National Review.) The Benghazi Accountability Coalition (which McCarthy chairs) has also criticized Gowdy's committee for its lack of alacrity and milquetoast hearings. That group includes a number of prominent far-right conservatives, including Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies; former Rep. Allen West; former congressional candidate Dan Bongino; and the conspiratorial Frank Gaffney. The group's site republished a piece McCarthy wrote for PJ Media saying the first committee hearing was ""a disappointment for those of us hoping the select committee would focus on real accountability"" and criticizing it for not being ""a more enlightening public session."" The Benghazi committee's Republican staff hasn't been silent on these accusations. ""Gowdy has been very clear that this committee is not going to leak,"" said Republican committee spokesman Jamal Ware. ""As we build all the facts in a comprehensive way, in appropriate time information will be made available."" Ware responded to another criticism in our conversation, as well. Democrats have charged that the committee has a ""secretive unlimited budget."" Ware said that's inaccurate, and that committee staff is operating under the assumption that they have $4.6 million to spend this year. Ware added that Gowdy emphasizes that the committee be as cost-effective as possible, and noted that it spent significantly less last year than was budgeted. Regardless, this all puts Gowdy in politically dicey waters. The congressman has expressed little (if any) ambition to run for higher office. But his national name recognition and adoration in conservative circles means he could be a contender for a number of projects. Running the Benghazi committee could jeopardize that loyalty."	Why Hillary Clinton's Email Scandal Could Damage Her Fiercest Republican Critic
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/martin_o_malley_could_have_challenged_hillary_clinton_the_maryland_governor.html	"Martin O'Malley is having himself a bit of a moment--not really through any of his own doing, but because the swirl of anxiety about Hillary Clinton's readiness for a presidential campaign has Democrats looking around for alternatives, and the only person standing there right now is, well, Martin O'Malley. The former Maryland governor and Baltimore mayor just passed up a run for his state's open Senate seat, making it even clearer that he's serious about a presidential run; he got national coverage for a wonky speech Wednesday at the Brookings Institution; and he turned up Thursday morning on Morning Joe. But let's not affix the rising-insurgent pin to O'Malley's muscle-gripping black tank top just yet. As I argued two years ago, back when he was first making 2016 rumblings, it's awfully hard to imagine O'Malley playing the liberal challenger, a role that has been occupied in Democratic presidential primaries by, among others, Gene McCarthy, George McGovern, Gary Hart, Bill Bradley, and Howard Dean. While O'Malley carried out a staunchly liberal agenda in Maryland--legalizing same-sex marriage, ending the death penalty, and much more--and while he has proven feisty at partisan sparring with Republicans, it is hard to envision him stirring liberal hearts and minds the way previous insurgents did. It's not just that he's a notoriously leaden public speaker; it's that, as progressive as his governing record is, he's oddly reluctant to champion liberal values in the terms many on the left crave. During the Obamacare debate, he chided Democrats who ""immediately run to the values of caring and fairness"" instead of focusing on the economic case for health care reform. His idea of visionary language is calling for America to be an ""opportunity-expanding entity."" He's more likely to quote Thomas Friedman than Thomas Frank. He is, by his own account, not a tribune but a technocrat, not an orator but a doer. And that's where O'Malley's other, more recent, challenge comes in. He has a real record of accomplishment to point to as a governing executive--he played a key role in the ever-so-gradual turnaround of Baltimore, and, on any number of fronts, he made Maryland, already one of the more prosperous and well-educated states in the nation, a better place to live. But his legacy is now at distinct risk of being at least partially dismantled. His chosen successor and lieutenant governor, Anthony Brown, succumbed in what was surely the biggest Republican upset last November. In a state that Barack Obama won by 26 percentage points in both 2012 and 2008, Brown managed to lose by four points to Larry Hogan, a conservative businessman who'd never held elected office. The responsibility for this debacle lies above all with Brown, but O'Malley bears some responsibility as well--he chose the underwhelming Brown as his successor, and then made himself scarce during the race, spending more time in Iowa and New Hampshire than Arbutus and Aspen Hill. Hogan is now hard at work seeking to undermine O'Malley's legacy on any number of fronts--reversing his cleanup policies for the Chesapeake Bay, steering transportation money into highways instead of public transit, and, most of all, proposing deep cuts to the state's K-12 schools, whose high performance O'Malley invoked in the very first line of his lackluster speech at the 2012 Democratic convention. O'Malley's legacy is also at risk in Baltimore in a more particular way. His proudest accomplishment there was the implementation of ""CitiStat,"" an attempt to bring to all municipal services the kind of data-heavy accountability that transformed policing in New York City and other cities, including Baltimore.  It was CitiStat--and the ""StateStat"" counterpart he later introduced in Annapolis--that O'Malley was touting at his Brookings speech this week: In the city, he said, the program featured ""the 48-hour pothole guarantee. And our crews actually hit that guarantee, and they hit it 97 percent of the time, and each of the members of those crews got a thank-you note from the mayor when we did it."" At the state level, ""We took measurable actions to reduce storm-water runoff and to expand the number of acres planted with winter cover crops, to upgrade clean technology at all of our sewer treatment plants. We reduced nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment levels by 14, 15, and 18 percent, respectively."" Not the most scintillating stuff, but that's not the problem. As the Baltimore Sun reported last weekend, CitiStat has seriously atrophied under the city's current mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. She has had her own successes as mayor, and Baltimore is by many measures doing even better than it was under O'Malley, but CitiStat has not been a priority for her as it was under him--while he may have raised expectations for city services in a lasting way, his institutional transformation has been less durable. Matt Gallagher, who ran CitiStat and served as O'Malley's chief of staff in Annapolis, downplayed the devolution of the program when I asked him about it on Thursday. It was up to each administration to decide how to govern, he said, and that the fact remained that the CitiStat model was now being adopted in many other cities around the country. ""Whether he'll be in a position in the future to point back to Baltimore [CitiStat], he will be able to point to things he accomplished, and as for the model, there's plenty of places to point to that have gotten success in this approach,"" Gallagher said. At both the state and city level, Gallagher said, one could distinguish between what O'Malley had achieved and what his successors had done with it. ""It's going to be up to successive mayors and governors to explain why there's using [CitiStat and StateStat] the way they do,"" he said. ""If you're transparent about the results you get, it's going to be up to them to explain the results they got and why the approach they're using is changing."" That's true, up to a point--O'Malley is hardly the first person to run for president when the state or city he once led is under a regime that is leading it in a different direction (Gov. Deval Patrick was running Massachusetts when Mitt Romney was on the ballot in 2012; Gov. Rick Scott, while of the same party as Jeb Bush, is challenging his legacy in Florida.) But the cost of the dismantled legacy is potentially greater for O'Malley, precisely because he is planning to run almost exclusively as a manager-who-gets-results. He won't be pointing national campaign reporters to his dazzling speeches, his vision for the country, or his inspiring life story (he comes from a solidly middle-class background in the Washington suburbs); rather, he'll be pointing them to his managerial legacy in the city and state that he led. And if those legacies take a hit--if, say, there is no bona fide CitiStat meeting for the national media to attend in Baltimore--that is a problem. If we shall know Martin O'Malley by his deeds and not his words, his deeds must remain visible."	Martin O'Malley's Incredible Shrinking Legacy
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/hillary_clinton_campaign_deval_patrick_ron_wyden_amy_klobuchar_and_other.html	"Hillary Clinton is not doomed. One terrible press conference won't mean the end of a long, storied political career. As of now, it is far more likely that she will win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, then win the White House, than it is that she will fade quietly from the political scene. One nevertheless wonders whether the latest Clinton miniscandal will lead at least some Democrats to think, Hey, why not run for president? What exactly do I have to lose? If nothing else, a 2016 presidential campaign would lay the groundwork for a future run, when there will be no Clintons blocking the way. With Clinton as the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination, only a handful of no-hopers are willing to make a go of it. Vice President Biden seems eager to make a third attempt at winning the top job, with an eye toward forever cementing his role as America's Mortifying Uncle. Bernie Sanders, the beloved cranky socialist from Vermont who caucuses with Senate Democrats, has expressed interest in running in a Democratic primary or two, presumably to ensure that his brand of left-wingery is adequately represented. Ex-Republican Jim Webb, a loner polymath and decorated veteran who served briefly and unhappily as a Democratic senator from Virginia, has also made noises about running as an economic populist. Sadly, no one seems to care. Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, is similarly trying to carve out a place to Clinton's left. Unfortunately for O'Malley, he is perhaps best-known as the inspiration for one of the more oleaginous characters on The Wire. It's widely believed that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo would like to run for president, but he now finds himself under a cloud of suspicion as federal prosecutors investigate corruption in the Empire State. So you can scratch him off the list. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is the most formidable of the potential primary challengers we hear about from time to time. Yet Warren insists that she's not running, and there's good reason to believe that she means it. For one thing, Warren might actually be better off as the Democratic Party's chief ideological enforcer than as an also-ran presidential candidate. So who should get in the mix? To run a successful primary campaign, you have to either have or be able to raise money. Before you even get to that point, however, you have to have something to say. That's the really tough part. Ideally, you have something to say that is distinctive and that resonates with a decent-sized swath of the primary electorate. The Democratic Party has changed since the Bill Clinton years: It is less white than it was then, for one thing, and as conservative Democrats have left for the GOP, it's also become more consistently liberal on social and economic issues. With all of this in mind, I give you my wish list of Democratic presidential contenders: Any contest for the Democratic presidential nomination needs an earnest, nerdy liberal technocrat who appeals to the intelligentsia. Bill Bradley played this role in 2000. Howard Dean put a brilliant spin on earnest, nerdy liberalism in 2004 by also being full of rage. There have been rumors that Russ Feingold, the former Wisconsin senator known for his civil libertarian streak and his devotion to stringent campaign finance regulations, might enter the fray, and he's certainly an interesting possibility. My pick for this role is Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden. His steadfast opposition to dragnet surveillance has won him many friends among civil libertarians, and that's no small thing in a Democratic primary, particularly in dovish, independent-minded states like New Hampshire. A Pew survey from January found that 31 percent of Democrats hold an unfavorable view of the National Security Agency, which is not a bad little foundation for a Wyden campaign. Moreover, Wyden has proposed a universal health care plan more ambitious than Obamacare, and he's championed the idea of allowing states like Vermont and Oregon to build their own single-payer health systems. While Wyden woos the nerds, Sherrod Brown, the gravelly-voiced, tousle-haired senator from Ohio, could step in as the red-meat populist, who'd bash China for its unfair trade practices, offer a blueprint for revitalizing organized labor, and demand that the big banks be brought to heel. He'd back Medicare for all and big increases in the minimum wage, all while ferociously attacking Beltway Democrats like Hillary Clinton for their coziness with Wall Street. Though Brown is a solid social liberal, he's managed to win over Ohio voters by appealing to their nationalism. In Rust Belt primaries, Brown could rail against ""Benedict Arnold CEOs"" for outsourcing jobs to great effect. Building on the American left's recent bout of Pikettymania, he could make the case for a progressive wealth tax, a measure that Clinton, who's grown quite wealthy since leaving the White House, would find awkward to oppose. Though it's hard to see him defeating Hillary Clinton, he could certainly push her to the left, which should be motivation enough for a true believer like Brown. Alas, Brown has sworn off any interest in higher office. But he has an avenue should he choose to pursue it. One of the more notable political subplots of last summer concerned how national Democrats would react to the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the protests that followed. At a speech in San Francisco, Hillary Clinton spoke of ""the inequities that persist in our justice system,"" and she asked whites to empathize with blacks who feel targeted by the police. Though Clinton took some time to respond to the events in Ferguson, her remarks were generally well-received on the left. It's also true, however, that Ferguson galvanized many black progressives, and it's easy to imagine that black Democrats will welcome a nonwhite candidate willing to speak directly to issues of racial justice. The awful news in Ferguson on Wednesday night serves as a reminder that the Kulturkampf over racial bias in policing is not about to go away, and Democrats who'd prefer to avoid the issue are out of luck. More than one-fifth of self-identified Democrats are black, and black voters play a large role in Democratic primaries in the Deep South. Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton in 2008 in part because he was able to unite college-educated white liberals with black voters, a coalition that could re-emerge. But who could match Obama's appeal? New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is arguably as charismatic as Obama, but his star has dimmed. His friendliness with Wall Street conservatives marks him as an unreliable friend to the hard left, and his devotion to school choice has earned him the enmity of the teachers unions, which are an extremely important Democratic constituency. Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, is a better bet. Though Patrick failed to prevent a Republican, Charlie Baker, from succeeding him, and though he has denied any interest in running for president in 2016, he has a sterling liberal resume, having worked as a civil rights lawyer for much of his career. While Obama spoke cautiously about race during his 2008 presidential campaign, the conversation has changed. Patrick would, in theory, have the freedom to press harder on the theme of racial justice. Like Obama in 2008, Patrick has been dismissed as an empty suit. During his first run for governor in 2006, however, Patrick turned these attacks against his critics. When his Republican opponent accused him of being better at making speeches than offering specifics, Patrick replied with the following: ""Just words. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.' Just words. 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself.' Just words. 'Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.' Just words. 'I have a dream.' Just words."" Barack Obama himself seems to have been inspired by the rhetoric. To be sure, not everyone is a Patrick fan. Having served two terms as governor, he's had to make compromises, and some critics to his left see him as more of a cautious, corporate type than an inspiring liberal firebrand. Yet his time in office also means that he could go toe to toe with anyone, Clinton included, on executive experience. I can see why Patrick might want to wait to run for president, but he has an excellent opportunity to make a mark. So far, most of Clinton's would-be challengers have been coming from the left of the party. There might, however, be some room to her right. Bill Clinton ran as a moderate New Democrat who could appeal to middle-class white suburbanites. For a brief period, former Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh tried to occupy this role in 2008, and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner flirted with doing the same. Warner, still quite popular in his home state despite a near-defeat at the hands of GOP lobbyist Ed Gillespie, could fill this role tolerably well. Andrew Cuomo could as well, the threat of corruption charges notwithstanding. But I like the idea of Mike Bloomberg running as the sober centrist. Yes, Bloomberg ran for mayor of New York as a Republican, and he now identifies as an independent. Even so, it's fairly clear that Bloomberg is a moderate liberal, albeit of the Wall Street variety, and that his decision to run in New York as a Republican was first and foremost a matter of convenience. Bloomberg's brand of centrism would be quite different from Bill Clinton's '90s version, not least because Bloomberg is, if anything, less culturally conservative. He would present himself as the turnaround artist America needs--kind of a pro-choice, anti-gun Mitt Romney. It's easy to imagine Bloomberg, like Ross Perot, saturating the airwaves with detailed discussions of how he'd fix America's roads and bridges, and how he'd put our entitlement programs on a sounder footing. If this idea doesn't thrill you, you are dead inside. And then there is Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who, despite having served eight years in the Senate, still counts as a fresh face. Klobuchar is one of America's most popular senators, and she's cultivated a reputation as an indefatigable, impeccably bipartisan problem solver on issues ranging from combating drug abuse to fighting sex trafficking. She also worked closely with moderate Republicans to put an end to the 2013 government shutdown. On most issues, she fits neatly in the Democratic Party's liberal mainstream. Yet as a product of the politically competitive Upper Midwest, she makes a point of appealing to more conservative voters at every opportunity. Klobuchar's nonconfrontational vibe makes her the mirror image of Wisconsin's Scott Walker, something many Democratic voters might appreciate. Just as Barack Obama promised to move America toward a less divisive politics, perhaps Klobuchar could do the same. And to state the obvious, Klobuchar can speak to the struggles of working mothers, a crucially important part of the Democratic coalition, from experience. Who better to make the case for the liberal dream of universal child care than a temperamentally moderate Minnesotan? It's unlikely that a candidate with Klobuchar's profile would gain much traction in a race against Hillary Clinton. But in a race without her, Klobuchar could go very far. Consider this list my sincere plea that Democrats (and quasi-Democrats) with a national profile not allow next year's Democratic presidential contest to become a coronation. Hillary Clinton is more vulnerable than many Democrats seem to think, and it would be a shame if other Democrats who represent the party's future rather than its past failed to make a go of it."	Five Democrats Who Should Run for President, None of Them Named Hillary (or Elizabeth)

Not only has the school severed ties with the fraternity, it has closed its house, removed its Greek letters from public display, and expelled two of its members. It's a harsh sanction for an offense that riled the entire university community. During a bus ride, members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon sang a cheer from its halcyon days as an explicitly segregated fraternity, ""There will never be a nigger SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me."" Someone shot and uploaded a video of the chant, which made its way to the broader public. Since then, at least one other incident has come to light--a video of the frat's ""mom"" singing the word ""nigger."" What's striking (and a little comic) about this incident is that it isn't new. Across the country, colleges and universities have sanctioned Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapters for racism and explicit prejudice. In 1984, the University of Cincinnati suspended its chapter for two years after throwing a Martin Luther King ""trash"" party where members encouraged revelers to bring things such as a canceled welfare check, ""your father if you know who he is,"" and ""a radio bigger than your head."" What's more, the flier for the party was illustrated with a Ku Klux Klan hood and a portrait of James Earl Ray, King's convicted assassin. In 2000, Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, Georgia, sanctioned its chapter after an incident where it and three other fraternities harassed and assaulted a group of visiting black students. Representatives for the visiting students complained that ""Oglethorpe students in fraternity houses threw bottles at athletes and screamed racial epithets."" Six years later, a chapter at Baylor University was under fire for hosting an ""E-Dawg""-themed party where members dressed in gangster stereotypes. Pictures from the party captured ""students wearing bandanas and holding 40-ounce bottles in brown paper during the party. One of the pictures depicted a student who covered herself in bronzer in imitation of a black person."" In 2013, officials at Washington University in St. Louis suspended a chapter after pledges sang racial slurs at black students as part of a rush event, and last November, the University of Arizona suspended its chapter after members attacked Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish fraternity. According to the local news report, one of the members--who got a black eye in the fight--""rounded up dozens of his fraternity brothers and went to an apartment where several AEPi members live, banged on the door and yelled racial slurs."" The next month, a chapter at Clemson University in South Carolina suspended its activities after members hosted a ""Cripmas"" party where they dressed in gang costumes and mimicked black stereotypes. In fairness, these acts aren't unique to Sigma Alpha Epsilon or schools in the South. ""This behavior is endemic throughout the country,"" says Nolan Cabrera, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of Arizona, in an interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education. ""This is something that occurs on a very, very regular basis. They just happened to have the bad foresight to have it recorded and then uploaded on the Internet."" Among young white male college students, he explains, this behavior isn't unusual. ""I have interviewed dozens and dozens and dozens of white men and have talked with them openly about issues of race,"" he said, ""Frequently the number one area that they talk about where they see race on campus is through racial joking patterns that occur in their primarily white friendship groups."" The ""joke"" framing is important: It allows participants to use racial language or express certain attitudes without acknowledging any personal prejudice. But let's not pick on young white guys. As a whole, white millennials are far less racially tolerant than they think. ""White millennials appear to be no less prejudiced than the rest of the white population,"" explained political scientist Spencer Piston regarding an analysis of the 2012 American National Election Study. Likewise, while white millennials are more optimistic about race relations than their parents, they don't score appreciably better on tests of implicit racial bias. White millennials aren't less prejudiced. They just believe they are. And it gives psychic cover to the kind of behavior we saw at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. As far as the University of Oklahoma is concerned, I should say I'm not thrilled with the punishment. Disbanding the fraternity might be justified, but expelling students for hate speech is an extreme response that runs afoul of free-speech norms, if not the First Amendment. Education would be better. The University of Oklahoma is two hours away from Tulsa, which in 1921 was the site of one of the worst anti-black race riots in American history. More than a thousand whites stormed the black district of Tulsa and razed it to the ground, killing hundreds and leaving thousands homeless and destitute. Black Tulsa never recovered, but memories of the attack live on among descendants of the victims. Don't expel the boys. Bring them to Tulsa. Have them see the memorials and talk to the children of survivors. Give them a chance to see what their words actually mean, and whether they want to be the kinds of people who sing about lynching for fun."	Don't Expel Members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon for Racism
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/barack_obama_s_selma_speech_the_president_responded_to_republican_critics.html	"After Rudy Giuliani challenged President Obama's patriotism and love of country, I wrote that the former New York mayor--while wrong--touched on ""a real difference between Obama's brand of national exceptionalism and the kind we tend to see from America's presidents."" Like his predecessors, Obama holds the United States as a place of exceptional ideals and aspirations, but he tempers his vision with civic humility and an awareness of American injustice. For those unaccustomed to this approach, it sounds like an attack on American greatness. But Obama isn't critiquing America as much as he's trying--in fits and starts--to construct a usable history, an inclusive account that illuminates and inspires. On Saturday, speaking to a crowd of thousands in Selma, Alabama, President Obama gave his best version of that account, building an American exceptionalism that neither ignores our history nor casts it as irredeemable. As is appropriate for a commemoration of the ""Bloody Sunday"" march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Obama rooted his narrative in the civil rights movement and the particular actions of the men and women who faced the brutal enforcers of Jim Crow on March 7, 1965. ""There are places and moments in America where this nation's destiny has been decided,"" said Obama. ""Selma is such a place."" The struggle on the bridge, he continued, ""was a contest to determine the meaning of America,"" where ""the idea of a just America, a fair America, an inclusive America, a generous America ... ultimately triumphed."" The events at Selma, he declared, were a ""manifestation"" of the words of the Declaration of Independence and a prime example of democratic self-governance. In marching against Jim Crow on a monument to white supremacy, the activists of Selma were working in the tradition of the Founding Fathers and of generations of Americans who believed that ""America is a constant work in progress; who believed that loving this country requires more than singing its praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths. It requires the occasional disruption, the willingness to speak out for what's right and shake up the status quo,"" Obama said. In this narrative of American history, the black struggle for freedom is at the center of our national story, an emblematic example of America's actual exceptionalism. Not its people per se, but their belief in the capacity for change and their conviction that they can stand as the agents of their own destiny. ""What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this ... that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals,"" Obama said. Obama isn't an a la carte patriot, and he doesn't diminish our flaws. Racism exists. Oppression and disadvantage are real. But he ""rejects the notion that nothing has changed"" and refuses to ""deny progress,"" calling the competing impulse an error that ""robs us of our responsibility to do what we can to make America better."" What's key for Obama is that everyone has a part to play in achieving our country's ideals. In ruminating on America's exceptionalism, he goes beyond the usual touchstones to include abolitionists and suffragettes, Native Americans and slaves, Holocaust survivors and Soviet defectors, interned Japanese and undocumented immigrants, LGBTQ activists and volunteers for war. Obama's America isn't a perfect place. But it is a place where collective action can make radical change and push us toward a more authentic version of our national self. In this American dialectic, the struggle for freedom against tyranny--of white supremacy, of economic exploitation, of gender discrimination--yields a more perfect union that nonetheless needs more struggle, more work. Obama's Selma speech is a clear response to years of Republican criticism, from outlandish accusations of Marxism to Giuliani's crude attacks on his patriotism. But it's also encouragement to those who look at our problems--our terrible inequality and immense disadvantage--and see a future of futility. ""Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished,"" he said. ""But we are getting closer. Two hundred and thirty-nine years after this nation's founding, our union is not yet perfect. But we are getting closer."" For Obama, America is neither faultless nor broken. It is a work in progress, and what it needs are the clear eyes and full hearts it takes to get it right."	Obama's Selma Speech Was a Clear Rebuttal to His Republican Critics
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/hillary_clinton_s_private_email_defense_the_former_secretary_of_state_hasn.html	"It's been nearly four days since the world learned that, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton did all of her government emailing on a private account--a decision that skirted the law and thwarted public records requests in the process. Since the story broke, Clinton remarkably has made no effort to explain herself. Instead, she's relied on an army of spokesmen, surrogates, and other allies to deflect the criticism or simply distract from it with a variety of political explanations that don't add up to a convincing real-world defense. The reason for that is simple: There isn't actually much of a defense to be made. Proof of that can be found in the sprawling explanations and rationalizations offered on Clinton's behalf by members of her political network and in the single tweet that represents her only public comment on the matter to date. ""I want the public to see my email,"" she wrote on Twitter late Wednesday, referring to the 55,000 pages of messages from her private account that she turned over to the government late last year, only after it requested them. ""I asked [the] State [Department] to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."" If that is her answer, then she is willfully misreading the question. The emails to which she was referring are not the issue. Those were the messages that her own team--the only people with access to her private account--had already decided were safe to be archived by the government and, eventually, made public. Releasing those emails ahead of schedule would do nothing to refute the idea that Clinton intentionally sought out a legal gray area from which to do her business, an act that privileged her own privacy (and likely political aspirations) above the public record and, potentially, the nation's security. Such sleight of hand has been at the center of Team Clinton's quest to spin the issue off the front pages. Parse the countless words offered on her behalf--either with a smile on camera, or with a sneer off of it--and you're left with a three-pronged explanation that boils down to some combination of: 1) other politicians have acted similarly while in office; 2) this is a manufactured scandal that has no real impact outside of politics; and, finally, 3) just trust us. All three may make (some) sense inside the permanent campaign, but none amount to a believable defense outside of it. Let's take all three in order. 1) The double standard. Clinton's allies have repeatedly pointed to other public officials who have used private email to conduct government business. They trumpet the fact that former Secretary of State Colin Powell used both a government account and a private one while leading the State Department during George W. Bush's first term. They similarly note that a host of GOP presidential hopefuls, a group that includes Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have been plagued by their own email controversies. The Powell example is undermined by the fact that his tenure at the State Department began nearly a decade before Clinton's did, at a time when email played a significantly smaller role. But Clinton's they-did-it-too defense really unravels when you consider the other GOP counterpoints. Her compatriots in email controversy serve as exhibits A, B, and C for why we should be skeptical of how public officials go about their business when they believe no one is watching. A 2013 investigation into Walker's tenure as Milwaukee County executive alleged that his staff used a private network to send emails to do political business on the taxpayer's dime. In Christie's case, texts and emails between his aides was the smoking gun in the Bridgegate scandal. Bush, meanwhile, reportedly set up his own private email server while governor of Florida, likely for the same reasons Clinton did. Pointing to these examples proves Clinton isn't alone in bending rules that get in her way, but they are hardly justification for doing so. 2) A manufactured controversy. Clinton's team has attempted to dismiss the story by claiming that her private account had no impact on official record-keeping because any email she sent or received to anyone else in the government would have been preserved on his or her end. That argument, however, relies on her colleagues using the same type of .gov address that she herself avoided--something we have every reason to suspect is untrue. At least one of her top aides, Huma Abedin, is known to have had her own clintonemail.com address, making it difficult to believe that all of Clinton's government business was logged on government servers. That defense also conveniently ignores any emails Clinton may have exchanged with foreign leaders or private parties outside the U.S. government, as well as the fact that it greatly reduced the chances that any Freedom of Information Act requests filed during her tenure would turn up what they were looking for. Republicans are certainly looking to fan the flames, but just because they're creating their own smoke doesn't mean there isn't fire. Decrying the politics of the controversy also doesn't explain why Clinton would have gone through the trouble to set up her own server and account in the first place--which she appears to have done on the same day of her first confirmation hearing. The closest thing to an explanation on that front comes by way of two unnamed former State Department employees who--after being put in touch with Business Insider by a pro-Hillary group--claimed that the private email account was set up partly for the sake of efficiency. ""At the time, State Department policy would not have allowed her to have multiple email addresses on her Blackberry,"" reports Business Insider. ""Because of this, the officials said, she opted to have one address for both personal and governmental communications."" Let's suspend our disbelief for a second and ignore the fact that someone driven by efficiency would opt for the less-than-obvious hdr22@clintonemail.com handle.* (Was hillary@clintonemail.com already taken?) If we take that explanation in good faith, then the nation's top diplomat was willing to ignore White House instructions and potentially open her account up to cyberattacks just so she didn't have to carry--or have a staff member carry--a second device around with her. If that was her overriding motivation, then it's no surprise that her supporters have resisted making it the center of her defense. 3) Just trust us. The argument underpinning Clinton's entire defense rests with the fact that her office did indeed turn over those aforementioned 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department. ""When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,"" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said. ""Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved. As a result of State's request for our help to make sure they in fact were, that is what happened here."" Clinton's office has declined to explain how her aides selected which emails to turn over to the State Department and which ones to hold back. They also haven't said when they would have turned over those same records if the State Department hadn't specifically requested them--given it's been six years since her run as secretary began and two years since it ended, it's safe to question whether they would have at all. The Clinton camp also points to the number of pages that were turned over as though the total alone should reassure us. The flaw there, of course, is that the page count tells us next to nothing--not how many emails were actually archived, let alone whether Clinton did, in fact, turn over all the appropriate records. Clinton's team, then, is asking the American public to take her at her word. The problem, though, is that the once-and-future White House hopeful simply doesn't have the right words to offer. Correction, March 9: This piece originally misidentified the handle of Hillary Clinton's private email address. It was hdr22@clintonemail.com, not hrc22@clintonemail.com. (Return.)"

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/patty_murray_should_be_the_next_senate_minority_leader_she_is_a_better_choice.html	"In Washington, there is a cottage industry of progressives who want Elizabeth Warren to do something besides represent Massachusetts in the Senate. For the past year, that something has been a presidential run. Every few months, she's asked if she's running for president, and each time, she says no. Now, pro-Warren progressives have a new option. On Friday morning, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced his retirement. Almost immediately, progressive groups pushed Warren for the job. ""If Elizabeth Warren doesn't run for president, she should definitely run for leader of the Senate,"" said a spokesman for Howard Dean's Democracy for America in an interview with Greg Sargent of the Washington Post. ""The election for Senate leader is not going to be a slam dunk for any early front-runner, especially someone like Sen. Schumer. He's closer to Wall Street while the Wall Street wing of the party is dying and the Elizabeth Warren wing is rising."" Likewise, said the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in a statement, ""There will likely not be a coronation to replace Harry Reid, and Elizabeth Warren is right up there with others as someone who would be taken very seriously. ... He's the definition of a leader, and that's why her colleagues and millions of Americans respect her and are inspired by her rise."" The thinking is that Warren could bring her populism to the top of the Senate, where she could challenge Republicans and help position the party away from Wall Street. It's not a bad theory of change. But it's wrong. Yes, a Senate leadership position comes with important influence and visibility. But it also comes with constraints. As minority leader, Warren would represent all Senate Democrats, from conservatives such as Sens. Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp to moderates such as Sen. Mark Warner and liberals like herself. By definition, this means she'd have to moderate her rhetoric to build coalitions, protect relationships, and guide her caucus into byzantine fights over procedure and legislation. Minority leader, in other words, is a place for consensus, not conflict. It's not a place for ideological leaders who try to pressure the party away from its mainstream. A Warren who leads the Democrats in the Senate isn't a Warren who, for example, could derail a White House pick for the Treasury on the basis of his Wall Street ties. As soon as she took the position, she would lose her voice as a vocal and influential liberal, lest she alienate her colleagues and fracture her caucus. Reid's trajectory is instructive: He entered office as a pro-life Democrat and will leave it as operationally pro-choice, a result of his place in leadership. Warren is best where she is: a valuable and influential senator who pressures the party from the left. No, it doesn't come with a title, but it isn't a small thing. In his eight years in the Senate, South Carolina's former Sen. Jim DeMint was hugely powerful as an ideological leader, using his base in the conservative movement--and later, the Tea Party--to pull Republicans to the right during the 2012 presidential election. He enforced ideological discipline, and it worked. Warren doesn't have to lead the Democrats--or run for president--to make the party more liberal. She can build power from the outside. If liberals want someone to lead Senate Democrats, they should look to longtime Washington Sen. Patty Murray, who is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the caucus. She's the dark horse in the race--behind New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who has been endorsed by Reid as well his potential competitor, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin--and has a solid record of progressive lawmaking, strong fundraising, and legislative savvy; in the last year, she's negotiated a budget agreement with Rep. Paul Ryan and won a filibuster-proof majority for paid sick leave. She's not perfect--some liberals will look askance at her tight connections to defense contractors and other big businesses--but compared with Schumer and his tight ties to Wall Street, she's a vast improvement."	Patty Murray Should Be the Next Senate Minority Leader
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/why_ted_cruz_isn_t_a_hypocrite_for_signing_up_for_obamacare_by_jbouie.html	"Twenty minutes into his address announcing his run for the White House, Sen. Ted Cruz made the first concrete promise of his campaign. ""[I]magine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,"" he said. The next day the Texas senator announced he'd be signing up for Obamacare. ""We'll be getting new health insurance and we'll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we'll be on the federal exchange with millions of others on the federal exchange,"" Cruz said. As you'd expect, this gave the political Internet a good laugh. On Twitter, National Journal's Ron Fournier had a few jokes--""Breaking: @BarackObama nominates @tedcruz to head the #IRS. Cruz accepts. 'Guy's gotta work.' ""--while liberal websites like Daily Kos crowed over the irony. ""Ted Cruz becomes the newest Obamacare customer,"" read one headline. Conservatives aren't happy with the schadenfreude, but you can't blame the reaction. Cruz built his career around hating the Affordable Care Act. It's funny that just hours after making Obamacare repeal the centerpiece of his campaign, the presidential hopeful is now on the federal exchange with millions of other Americans who need health insurance. But despite his most vocal critics, Cruz slipping on a political banana peel doesn't make him a hypocrite. For starters, this is a function of circumstances. After Heidi Nelson Cruz, his wife, took leave from her job at Goldman Sachs, the Cruz family lost its health insurance. And under an amendment sponsored by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, Cruz has to use the federal exchange to obtain his health insurance, even though the government will pay the majority of his premiums. The other options are to pay for health services a la carte, or cover the full cost of COBRA coverage, which--if you've ever been in this situation--are expensive options, even for families as wealthy as the Cruzes. Among all the choices, Obamacare is the best one. And then there's the general principle: ""I believe we should follow the text of every law, even laws I disagree with,"" Cruz told CNN, following up with a pro forma dig at the president. ""It's one of the real differences--if you look at President Obama and the lawlessness, if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change."" The senator is correct. For the most part, individual behavior is distinct from political belief and institutional preference. A billionaire taking tax breaks isn't a hypocrite for wanting higher rates and more social services; neither is a climate activist who flies around the world, or a rich liberal who sends his kids to private schools but wants more money for public education. There are limits to this idea. It is hypocritical to oppose drugs but indulge for yourself, or, a little differently, to value labor but exploit unpaid work. But for most ideological concerns, the political and the personal are separate spheres that only occasionally overlap. To think otherwise is to fall into the dangerous--if widespread--belief that you can make political change through personal consumption or other atomized actions. That's not to say you shouldn't try to live your political ideals or that your personal beliefs (secular, religious, or otherwise) shouldn't reflect on your politics. But it's unreasonable and unfair to expect a one-to-one correspondence, especially on something like health care reform. Cruz can take advantage of Obamacare to get health insurance, and also--as he said--believe that ""it is killing millions of jobs in this country and ... has caused millions of people to lose their insurance, to lose their doctors and to face skyrocketing insurance premiums."" He's wrong, but that's a separate story. If there's a problem with Cruz and Obamacare, it's not hypocrisy, it's empathy. Insurance under the ACA is far from perfect. It's pricey even with subsidies, and less comprehensive than many employer plans. But the actual comparison isn't with an ideal, it's with the pre-reform status quo, in which millions of Americans had either no insurance or junk plans that were worse than useless in an emergency. Against that alternative, Obamacare is a huge improvement. Even now, as health reporter Sarah Kliff writes for Vox, ""[I]f Cruz surveyed the market for individual insurance, he'd probably learn pretty quickly that the exchange is almost certainly his best option."" Having found himself in the same bad situation as millions of less fortunate Americans, one would hope that Cruz would now see the value of something like Obamacare, which puts a higher floor on material deprivation. Instead, the best odds are for Cruz to take a page from Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner. ""In his successful 2014 campaign for Senate,"" writes Bloomberg's David Weigel, ""Gardner repeatedly talked about the family plan he'd held onto until it was scrapped for not meeting the ACA's standards."" Indeed, he turned it into a TV spot. ""I got a letter saying that my family's plan was canceled,"" said Gardner in the ad. ""Three hundred and thirty-five thousand Coloradans had their plans canceled, too."" Cruz still wants to end the law, and if he's as theatrical as he seems, expect his Obamacare problems--real, imagined, or exaggerated--to make their way to a stump speech near you."	Why Ted Cruz Isn't a Hypocrite for Signing Up for Obamacare
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/what_scott_walker_can_teach_hillary_clinton_she_must_forget_bipartisanship.html	"Hillary Clinton has been polarizing her entire political career. But now, ahead of a second presidential run, she wants to be a uniter, not a divider. People should ""get out of the kind of very unproductive discussion that we've had for too long, where people are just in their ideological bunkers, having arguments instead of trying to reach across those divides and have some solutions,"" she said, speaking to labor leaders and policy wonks during a Monday event at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank that doubles as the Clinton administration-in-waiting. Elsewhere in Washington, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--another left-leaning think tank--released its analysis of the new Republican budgets. ""Each budget plan,"" notes the CBPP, ""derives more than two-thirds of its [approximately $5 trillion] budget cuts from programs for people with low or modest incomes even though these programs constitute less than one-quarter of federal program costs."" This includes billions in cuts to tax credits for working families as well as trillions in cuts to health care for low-income people. At the same time, House Republicans are mulling huge tax relief for the wealthiest Americans; later this week the House Ways and Means Committee will consider a bill to repeal the federal estate tax. Clinton hasn't announced a full agenda for 2016, much less a campaign for president. But when she does, it will stand on the opposite bank of anything offered by Republicans, with a vast distance between the two. She will give a plan for growing the welfare state. They will offer a plan for gutting it. Put differently, she has to know that there's no way to bring the two sides together. Democrats and Republicans aren't just polarized; they've adopted distinct ideologies, and they've prioritized a maximalist approach to using power and influence. The first two years of the Obama administration weren't modest. Part of this was a massive economic crisis that demanded a proportional response, but part of it was policy ambition. From the stimulus to the auto bailouts, Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and a host of other, smaller policies, Obama and the Democrats steered the country in a much more liberal direction than any president and Congress since Lyndon Johnson. Likewise, if elected president in 2012, Mitt Romney had promised a full repudiation of the Obama administration. His White House would have slashed social spending, repealed the Affordable Care Act, and pushed a sweeping agenda of broad tax cuts and deregulation. It would have been a complete ideological victory, scored without any input from liberals. It's not that the ""togetherness"" talk is unreasonable. The public craves political comity and wants its leaders to affirm values like cooperation and bipartisanship. And even if they've built their appeal on the opposite, most politicians will oblige. ""The answer will not come from Washington,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz--of all people--in his presidential announcement speech. ""It will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country, when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great."" But even if they try--and candidates tend to pursue their promises once in office--there's no way anyone can keep this pledge. If elected president, Hillary Clinton won't bring anyone together, just like Barack Obama didn't overcome bitter partisanship and George W. Bush couldn't sustain the national unity of his first two years in office (not that it was a huge priority). Not only are presidents pressured by party elites and activists with distinct visions, but the public is more polarized, and less willing to give approval or support to presidents from the other side. It's why Clinton polarized more than Bush, why the second Bush polarized more than Clinton, and why Obama stands as the most polarizing president we have known--until we elect the next one. Indeed, the only person in the present presidential field who seems to understand that political comity is a fool's errand is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, which, given his record for sowing ideological rancor, isn't a surprise. In 2013--just after the government shutdown--he spoke at a breakfast for reporters in Washington, D.C. And when asked about polarization, he refused to say he could bridge the divide:"	What Scott Walker Can Teach Hillary Clinton

Ted Cruz was a presidential hopeful from the moment he stepped on the Senate floor two years ago. But on Monday, at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, he finally dropped the pretense and made it official: Cruzapalooza begins now. Because Cruz is the first to announce his candidacy, he'll get a serious hearing in national media. He'll attract a lot of news and win a bump in the polls. But we shouldn't pretend that his is a serious campaign with a shot at success. It isn't. At best, Cruz will win a Fox News contract. He won't win the Republican nomination, and he'll never be president of the United States. In fairness to Cruz, there's a logic to his campaign that makes sense. In the last two Republican nomination fights, a right-wing base of social conservatives has vied against a more moderate (or at least more pragmatic) collection of fiscal conservatives, small-business owners, foreign policy experts, and financial elites. And while the two sides overlap--and the differences are often more affect than substance--the divide is real. The former group, social conservatives, tends to want religious candidates who prioritize public morality (see: abortion), support traditional ideas of marriage and family structure, and oppose mass immigration as an attack on the fabric of American life. By contrast, the latter group--reflecting its business concerns--tends to downplay social conservatism and is often more open to immigration, free-trade deals, and certain kinds of government intervention (see: Medicare Part D). As the foot soldiers, social cons have the numbers in the Republican Party: They knock on doors, make phone calls, and give hundreds of thousands of small donations that fuel a whole galaxy of campaigns and organizations. But in the last two election cycles, this strength in numbers hasn't overcome the strength of influence possessed by the ""moderates."" Part of this is resources. Even when he stumbled, Mitt Romney had the cash and staff he needed to survive into the next contest. He could withstand the blows in the Southeast and the Midwest and power through to favorable terrain. By contrast, the social conservative candidate of 2008, Mike Huckabee, just didn't have the money to run a national race. Even with momentum, he was still doomed. But the other obstacle was the sheer number of base-driven candidates. For social conservatives, the 2012 primary was a clown car. Six candidates--Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, and briefly, Herman Cain--vied for the same votes. Against them, on the other side, were Romney and Jon Huntsman. By the time the field had narrowed, following the initial primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Florida, there was one ""establishment"" candidate against a handful of social conservatives. In that environment, Romney didn't have to win a majority--he just had to keep a sizable plurality. If you were an ambitious Tea Party Senate candidate looking at the fallout, you might conclude that the right approach for an ""outsider"" campaign is to ignore the establishment and try to bring base voters under one standard. If you can lead social conservatives in an undivided charge against the establishment candidate, then you could win. And if the ""establishment"" is actually a series of divided establishments with multiple candidates--Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, and Marco Rubio--then you might even have the advantage. That is the Cruz plan--to rally social conservatives behind one banner. It's why he announced first, and it's why he announced his campaign for small government and traditional values--""Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage""--at Liberty University, the brainchild and legacy of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, one of the most influential evangelical leaders of the past 40 years. (It's a bit ironic for the anti-government Cruz that Liberty is among the top recipients of federal student aid in Virginia.) Not only is Cruz trying to pre-empt his immediate competitors--Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Santorum--he's trying to lay his stake as the candidate for social conservatives. As gambits go, it's not bad. But it's not going to work. Yes, the Texas senator has a few good cards in his hand. He's a strong rhetorician, with the virtual adoration of the Tea Party and other parts of the conservative base. He has a national profile and he's comfortable with the spotlight of the national stage. But then there are the problems, the Kaiju-sized, career-crushing problems. On high-profile issues like health care and immigration, it's tough to say that Cruz is more extreme than other Republicans. The distance between him and someone like Bush is fairly small. But if we look at his donors, his public statements, and his voting record, it's clear that Cruz is among the most extreme candidates to ever run for the Republican nomination, a far cry from the kinds of people the GOP tends to nominate. Just as important is his persona. Cruz is an uncompromising politician who disdains his opponents and abhors pragmatism. He antagonizes his colleagues--Republican and Democrat--and would rather lose a quixotic fight against an established law than claim a small victory, even when the crusade is a disaster. For much of the Republican base, all of this makes him the hero America needs and the one it deserves. To the vast constellation of Republican lawmakers, activists, intellectuals, and party operatives, it makes him a pariah. He's isolated in the Senate and loathed in influential parts of conservative media. The party's machinery isn't on his side, and if party support is the best guide to who wins, then Cruz is dead on arrival. Many liberals see the Republican Party as gripped by the passions of religious extremists and right-wing lunatics. And if that's true, then Cruz is a favorite for the nomination. But it's not. For as much as the GOP is ideologically conservative, it's also--like every iteration of America's core political parties--a diverse collection of interests and factions with competing concerns. Some of them fit the liberal bill. Others don't. But they're united by a common aim: the White House. And unless the Republican Party wants another four (or eight) years outside of the Oval Office, it's not going to nominate someone like Ted Cruz."	Let's Not Even Pretend That Ted Cruz Has a Chance of Becoming President
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/jeb_bush_uses_meerkat_the_2016_candidates_should_be_careful_about_embracing.html	On Thursday, Jeb Bush used the video broadcast app Meerkat to live stream his visit to Atlanta to his Twitter followers. Every candidate wants to find a way around the press to speak to voters, and this was immediately heralded as a new way to do just that. It's not just the mainstream media that Bush is avoiding--it's also the conservative fire his campaign will draw. The former Florida governor needs a way to mainline information to his supporters to keep them from getting jittery. For Bush the bigger upside of a performance only viewed by 400 people (many of whom were reporters) was that he looked new and modern. You knew that was the goal when his all-but-declared campaign's chief strategist Mike Murphy tweeted: (I don't think you mean that about Tinder, Mike, regardless of what it did for JFK). Murphy knows that the press loves to write stories about itself, and in those stories Bush's use of the new medium reached a wider audience than the one he broadcast to on Meerkat. What it told that more traditional audience was that Bush was not a man of the past from a family of the past. He's a candidate of the future. That's why he launched his Right to Rise PAC on Instagram. He's already in the future right now! Come join him. The truth is that the candidates are too much with us. Whatever the motivation, whether it's channeling the message directly to your core fans or making the wider world think you're a modern whiz, candidates are taking to every outlet to weigh in on this and that. Hillary Clinton fired up the Twitter account the other night to opine about the GOP budget. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker sent a selfie and tweaked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over the Green Bay Packers. Sen. Rand Paul regularly trolls Hillary Clinton on Twitter while inhabiting the id of a 17-year-old. This pace is only going to quicken as we get closer to voting time. Now that candidates are trying to be content providers on so many different channels, the question is whether they will face the same problem with overload those of us in traditional media face. People don't want to hear from us as often as we arrive in their email inboxes or Instagram feeds with something we find really charming. We all know people who we follow because every second thing they say is interesting or clever, but we are also irritated by those same people because the other half of what they say is either an irritation or an interruption. (Some of those people may very well be the author of this article.) The challenge is not just the irritation from overload, but that when you talk too much, fewer people listen. As Mat Honan wrote in Wired, this has become an increasing worry for services that want to push new information to people who sign up for their apps. Just because you asked to be pinged by this service doesn't mean you'll want to be when the email arrives. This happened long ago to President Obama. Structures put in place during campaigns stay in place during the presidency, which means presidential speech becomes threadbare even before the candidate takes office. That is why candidate Newt Gingrich said as president he wouldn't talk much as president. (It's also possible this was a prophylaxis meant to assuage those fearful of a voluble Gingrich presidency.) There are other challenges. The more channels, the more opportunity for the campaigns to occasionally get wound up into madness. The Obama campaign once argued that Clinton's embellishments about a trip to Bosnia disqualified her for higher office. The Clinton campaign once suggested that because Obama said he wanted to be president in elementary school, it showed how unyieldingly ambitious he was. These are not the gotcha moments created by the press or a waiter with a hidden phone camera. They're home-cooked, and they get amplified when you have more ways to sound off. You can also become a meme when you're producing constant content, handing your opponents a chance to mock you with your own product. Finally there is the problem of weak content. Candidates want to convey that they are innovative and savvy, but there is nothing disruptive about broadcasting a political speech. It's just a fancy press release that can quickly feel like spam. What would truly be disruptive is if a candidate used his ability to broadcast from anywhere in a meaningful way. Let's see a candidate use Meerkat from the day he spent with unemployed job applicants learning about what it's like to find work in this economy or the day he spent at the supermarket trying to feed a family of four on a median income. Or maybe someone could use a new medium to explain a policy issue in a way that makes the challenges clearer to voters. Surely there are more clever ways to use the new mediums? If not, we can just wait around for Naked Mole Rat app, the next new digital innovation in the Meerkat mammal group.	Why Political Candidates Should Think Carefully About Embracing Meerkat (or the Next Social Media Tool)
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/liz_mair_shouldn_t_have_lost_her_job_timid_campaigns_will_destroy_politics.html	"Will frivolity or timidity destroy politics faster? We all know about the frivolity problem. Candidates and the media are distracted by one shiny non-news event after another until Election Day. No one running for office has to give a serious answer, and voters never get a chance to see how candidates fare under a barrage of serious questions. Timidity is a slightly less obvious problem. It's the condition where candidates assume a risk-free crouch and parties insist on maximum orthodoxy early in the cycle. By the time voters are paying attention, candidates and their staff are in a state of roar or ignore: They issue loud hyperbole about the opposition party (which allows for the appearance of strong position-taking, but is essentially a free shot) but ignore any issues that might be challenging enough to get them in trouble. At most, they will utter short, safe peeps encased in bromides. Timidity is enforced by exorcising people from politics who stray. We saw this recently when Liz Mair came and went through Gov. Scott Walker's campaign about as fast as it takes a souffle to rise. Mair had signed on to advise Walker on his digital strategy. It was then revealed that she had said some unflattering things about Iowans, and that was it for her. She resigned after one day on the campaign. Her comments were pretty mild--particularly by the standards of politics. Last January, on the eve of Rep. Steve King's Iowa event that attracted a slew of Republican presidential contenders, she wrote on Twitter: ""In other news, I see Iowa is once again embarrassing itself, and the GOP, this morning. Thanks, guys."" She was referring to the race to embrace King who is an ardent opponent of immigration reform. In a second tweet, Mair wrote, ""The sooner we remove Iowa's front-running status, the better off American politics and policy will be."" (After this most recent episode, Mair explained herself in a voluminous series of tweets.) Mair also criticized the government assistance that supports the production of ethanol that most Republicans are OK with, but which represents the kind of market interference conservatives usually don't like at all. ""Morons across America are astounded to learn that people from *IOWA* grow up rather government-dependent. #agsubsidies #ethanol #brainless,"" she wrote. This tweet was obviously not calling Iowans ""morons,"" but umbrage was taken anyway, and Mair had to resign. It's understandable when people are tossed from campaigns for saying sexist or racist things, but this wasn't in that category. Mair wasn't working for Walker at the time, but the Wisconsin governor wants to do well in Iowa, and he's not going to risk having someone on his staff who insults Iowans. It also could be that Mair was pushed out because she supports same-sex marriage, and Walker didn't want to upset a constituency that doesn't. Political campaigns are growing more timid, and ideological purists are growing more precise with their purity tests. At the same time, social media is making us more reckless and honest in public. These two things cannot continue. Or they can continue, and campaigns will simply make the screen through which any comment or staffer must pass full of the tiniest holes. Unless you were fed on a constant diet of pablum from birth and promise to dispense the same, you won't make the cut. This is a problem. No one who is any good at politics or even very interesting can get through the screen. Politics and public debate requires passion and risk-taking. It's the way you win, and it's the way you reach solutions that might actually change people's lives for the better. Also, creating a cocoon of the most boring atrophies the skills required to talk to people who don't agree with you 100 percent of the time. That can only lead to greater polarization. No one can say anything peppery about anything, or they'll never get a job. Walker is proving to be a very careful campaigner, which is fascinating since he has been such a bold governor. This is also the great test of the Clinton campaign, which in the past has been risk-free in everything but its IT strategy. Clinton's advisers are promising something different this time. Not every candidate is padding timid little feet down the campaign trail. Gov. Bush is the boldest of the plausible candidates, since he's making a campaign out of challenging party orthodoxy. Sen. Rand Paul also gets points for taking risks. Politics is supposed to be about building big tents. Right now both parties are going through debates about who belongs in the tent. Each has a faction that wants to eliminate heretics. This is not a sustainable strategy when you're engaged in a contest where the team that can build a majority wins. But it's really not a sustainable strategy if you only build that team out of quiet drones."	Why Our Political Campaigns Are Getting Too Timid
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/kate_brown_and_automatic_voter_registration_oregon_s_new_governor_has_gone.html	"For more than a decade, voting rights advocates have been on the defensive. They've resisted one effort after another to restrict access to the polls, efforts that got new life following the Florida election fiasco of 2000, when a large black turnout almost (or maybe did) put Al Gore over the top in the Sunshine State, and that reached full force following Barack Obama's election in 2008. Between the 2010 and 2012 elections alone, governors signed into law 23 bills that imposed constraints on voting, including requiring photo ID at the polls and curtailing same-day registration and early voting. While there have been defensive victories here and there, the resistance has been futile in many states and not helped by the Supreme Court, which in 2008 ruled in favor of voter ID laws and in 2013 gutted key elements of the Voting Rights Act. But now, at least in one state, the voting rights camp is on the offensive, and it's hard to overstate what a pivotal turn that represents in the nation's long-running voting wars. Oregon's new governor, Kate Brown, the former secretary of state who took over following the resignation of her fellow Democrat John Kitzhaber, has made headlines for being the nation's first openly bisexual governor, but the bill she signed Monday is far more significant. The new law radically modernizes the voter registration process in the state, such that Oregonians will be automatically registered to vote based on information the Department of Motor Vehicles has in its electronic files (which crucially includes whether someone is a citizen or just a permanent resident and thus ineligible to vote). Under the ""Motor Voter"" law of 1993, Americans gained the ability to register to vote at DMVs and other government offices, but the burden was still on them to fill out paperwork and update registration statuses with name and address changes. The Oregon law puts the burden on the state, not the individual (who may still ask to be removed from the rolls if he or she prefers), and in so doing operates on the same logic as automatically enrolling workers in a 401(k) with the option to opt out, rather than waiting for them to sign up: The default approach gets more sign-ups. Other states have improved their registration processes so that information passes electronically from DMVs to voting registrars rather than being sent over in paper forms to be transcribed (or mistranscribed, as often is the case). But only Oregon is taking the default approach and looking through its existing records for those who are eligible but unregistered, which is expected to net at least 300,000 more people on the voting rolls right away. ""Lots of people capture who comes in tomorrow--but they capture who's in the database already,"" says Myrna Perez of New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, which advocates for voting rights. ""It strikes a good balance--the government should take responsibility for registration, take advantage of available and reliable lists, and use those lists to improve our democracy."" If Oregon's approach takes hold in other states--several have legislation already in the works--the impact would be considerable, given that there are an estimated 50 million Americans who are eligible to vote but unregistered and another 23 million who are estimated to have registrations that need updating with correct information. Equally as important, though, is that the state's move represents a real shift in the debate. For years now, the voting rights side has been forced to fight on the terms of those seeking to limit access at the polls, parrying the (unsubstantiated) claims of widespread voter fraud that have been used to justify the wave of new voter ID laws. The Oregon law turns the tables: It implicitly asserts that voting is an inherent right of citizenship, not a privilege for which one must jump through hoops to obtain (see, for instance, Alabama's application for a voter ID card, required by a law passed nearly a half-century after the Selma protests) and that the more people who are exercising that right, the better. In so doing, the law clarifies what the voting wars have been about all along, even before Florida 2000 and the election of Barack Obama: two starkly different conceptions of the franchise. Those adhering to the notion of the United States as a ""republic"" have long preferred that the voting (and governing) be done by the most informed, propertied, and invested of citizens; those viewing the nation as a ""democracy"" have long favored mass participation by all who are eligible. Ed Kilgore, a liberal blogger and former Democratic aide, put it very well last year:"	Oregon's New Governor Is Going on the Offensive in the Voting Wars
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/the_new_law_had_bipartisan_support_but_its_reforms_appear_to_be_failing.html	"In a Washington that fetishizes bipartisanship as an emblem of a lost golden age, the farm bill that passed last year with 68 votes in the Senate was a true marvel. Imagine, in these polarized times, a bill that won the support of Democratic senators like Barbara Boxer, Al Franken, and Tammy Baldwin and their Republican colleagues Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, and David Vitter, while being opposed by a motley group that included Democrats Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand and Republicans Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio. But just because a bill has bipartisan support and scrambles the usual red-blue lines on the Hill doesn't necessarily make it good legislation. It's too soon to render final judgment on the nearly 1,000-page bill representing nearly $1 trillion in spending over the next decade, but results so far are calling into question the claims by the bill's proponents that it would rein in costly agricultural subsidies. As noted by the Washington Post editorial page, a new report from the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri finds that far from tamping down farm subsidies, the new law is boosting them, by a lot. The law replaced direct payments to farmers, which were unquestionably in need of reform, with new subsidized crop insurance programs that proponents argued would be more efficient and rationalized, saving taxpayers $23 billion over the long term. But an analysis of the Missouri report by the Environmental Working Group projects that those insurance programs will pay out more than $24 billion between 2014 and 2018, $2.4 billion more than the tab for direct payments in the five years before the law took effect. It also found that the total payout for crop insurance subsidies over the next decade will be $85 billion, a 27 percent increase over the $67 billion paid out over the previous decade for the more limited insurance programs in place then. For 2014 alone, corn growers in much of Ohio, Iowa, Minnesota, and Kansas are to receive payouts of $60 to $200 per acre under the crop insurance program, many multiples of the average $24 per acre they received under the direct payment program, according to a separate report from the University of Illinois. ""We thought all along that what they were doing--eliminating direct payments, replacing them with insurance subsidies and saying it was going to save $23 billion--was always a shell game,"" says Traci Bruckner, a policy analyst with the Center for Rural Affairs in Nebraska. ""We agree a farm safety net is important to help farmers weather tough situations. But what we're seeing is the way it's been put on the ground and actually exists makes a mockery of the policy. People say it's helping family farms, but what it's doing is propping up really large operations."" The Farm Bureau (the main lobby for Big Ag) did not return a call seeking comment.* But the office of Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan Democrat who shepherded the bill to passage as the then-chairwoman of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, defended the law against the new reports. A Stabenow aide noted that the estimate of $23 billion in savings had come from the Congressional Budget Office, not just from the law's sponsors, and said that even with the higher payouts now underway, the law would still reduce the deficit over the long term. ""The senator has been very consistent: The law helps farmers when they need it,"" the aide said. ""This is a cost-saving farm bill and it continues to meet those criteria."" Indeed, the law is working much as intended: Payments are way up to many growers because commodity prices have fallen the past couple of years after they were driven up in drought-stricken 2012, and because corn yields were down in the aforementioned states, while they were up in Missouri, Indiana, and central and southern Illinois. The fact is, the law was designed to boost growers via crop insurance subsidies not just through bona fide disasters and price collapses but through relatively moderate fluctuations as well. The level of payouts so far under the new law ""is about what you would have expected them to be given what the prices and yields have been,"" said Gary Schnitkey at the University of Illinois, who wrote the report on the payouts to corn growers in the four low-yielding states. This has the law's critics issuing I-told-you-so's about the failure of lawmakers to consider other approaches to reforming farm supports. Bruckner, with the Center for Rural Affairs, notes that her group and others had urged legislators to strengthen language in the law determining eligibility for subsidies, to make sure support went only to those actively engaged in farming, not just those named in paper entities used to disguise the scale of some large operators. Such language was stripped out ""in the dark of night,"" she said, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has been reluctant to use his department's rulemaking powers to strengthen the law. Bruckner's organization also wishes the law had provided more rewards for conservation so farmers who were doing risk mitigation and investing in the health of their soils would get more support than those who did not. And the group argues that the law made it only easier for large growers to squeeze smaller competitors by using their scale to game the new subsidy system. Others, like the National Family Farm Coalition, wish lawmakers had considered supporting farmers via price stabilization programs, such as so-called commodity loan rates, rather than giving them taxpayer subsidies when their incomes fall--the agricultural equivalent of setting a minimum wage for low-wage workers instead of having the government supplement their pay. Price stabilization costs the government much less than subsidies, but is opposed by those that depend on low commodity prices--big agribusinesses like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland and factory-farm consumers of cheap feed like Smithfield and Tyson, all of whom benefit as much if not more from the new law than actual growers. Reformers will have another crack soon enough--the House Agriculture Committee chairman is already gearing up to pass a new farm bill in 2019. But the structural impediments are sure to be no smaller then. The Senate will still be slanted heavily toward the Big Ag lobby, thanks to a constitutional system that accords as many senators to Wyoming and South Dakota (total population: under 1.5 million) as to New York and New Jersey (total population: 28 million), not to mention that wannabe presidents in Congress have good reason to be kind to agricultural interests. Defenders of the status quo will still be able to rope in support from some blue-state Democrats simply by virtue of the fact that the farm bill includes funding for food stamps (although the 2014 bill cut food stamps to such a degree that it lost the support of some Democrats.) And pundits in Washington will likely still be so eager to see Congress pass major legislation with bipartisan support that some will join the bill's proponents in scolding the holdouts for their recalcitrance rather than taking full stock of their criticisms, as happened last year. But the farm bill faces a more immediate threat right now as a result of the high crop insurance payouts. Congressional Republicans are crafting their budget proposal, and will be looking for a way to balance out the increased subsidy costs with cuts elsewhere in the law, whether from food stamps or from what spending on conservation still remains after the big reduction that line item suffered in the law. If Republicans are able to come to agreement, they will be able to make such cuts under ""reconciliation,"" with only 50 votes in the Senate. Of course, the other alternative would be to try to cut from the insurance subsidies themselves since they're what's coming in over estimate, but that never happens, says Craig Cox of the Environmental Working Group. ""The subsidy programs can spend way more than anticipated and no one blinks an eye,"" he said. That's unfortunate, he added. ""There can be a safety net in agriculture, but it should be a very basic safety net that steps in when farmers suffer crippling losses,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be programs that simply boost incomes, that actually are income transfers to businesses in the guise of a safety net."" *Correction, March 20, 2015: This article originally misstated that the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not return a call seeking comment.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/senate_medical_marijuana_bill_rand_paul_cory_booker_and_kirsten_gillibrand.html	"A trio of high-profile senators this week unveiled a package of drug reforms that would effectively end the federal war on medical marijuana once and for all. The bill, from Republican Rand Paul and Democrats Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, wouldn't legalize medical weed across the country, but it would remove the threat of federal prosecution for patients who use it in states where it is legal. It would also represent a federal acknowledgment of weed's medicinal potential--something the U.S. government has repeatedly refused to concede since Richard Nixon launched the war on drugs in the 1970s. The legislation is bipartisan, sound, and long overdue. Frustratingly albeit unsurprisingly, then, it is unlikely to make it very far in the current Congress, a reality even the nation's chief weed advocates have readily admitted. Its short-term fate notwithstanding, though, the bill is a clear sign of just how quickly the drug debate is evolving in Washington--and may just foretell how nationwide legalization will eventually come to pass. That Paul, Booker, and Gillibrand have teamed up on the bill is telling, and the good news for the pro-pot crowd comes in both the chicken-and-egg variety. On the one hand, as rising stars on the national stage, all three will have ample opportunity to further their cause--particularly Paul, who is expected to officially jump into the race for the GOP presidential nomination later this year. On the other, it's unlikely that the trio would have made this a priority if they were the least bit nervous that their efforts would come back to bite them. And they have good reason to be confident in that regard: A majority of Americans back full-scale marijuana legalization, and even those who don't tend to believe that it's simply a matter of when, not if, the nation's eight-decade-long prohibition of pot comes to an end. Still, believing legalization is inevitable doesn't make it so. The question, then, is how we get from the present--with Congress bullying Washington, D.C., officials in a bid to stop them from following the will of voters and making weed legal--to full, nationwide legalization? The Senate legislation offers just such a road map. The bill's most important provision would change how pot is classified under the Controlled Substances Act, the 1970 law that is the backbone of federal drug policy. Currently, the government labels marijuana a Schedule I drug, a classification that puts it in the same category as heroin, LSD, ecstasy, and a handful of other heavyweights. Those drugs, according to the federal definition, have ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" The Senate bill would drop weed to Schedule II, a classification for drugs that still have a significant potential for abuse, although less than their more restricted brethren. More importantly, the Schedule II classification is reserved for drugs with some medical benefits--things like methadone and Adderall--meaning placing pot in that category would be a de facto admission that weed does indeed have a role to play for some patients. It's hard to overstate just how much that would change the way the federal government deals with pot. It would open the door wider for universities to research medical uses for marijuana without fear that Drug Enforcement Administration agents are seconds away from kicking down their doors, while also giving the green light to doctors at Veterans Affairs hospitals to prescribe medical marijuana to veterans. In many ways, the reclassification would represent the biggest change in the government's attitude toward pot since Nixon decided that weed was what was fueling his counterculture critics. (Or, as he famously put it, ""They're all on drugs."") To date, 23 states, along with the District of Columbia, have legalized medical marijuana, siding with the medical consensus that cancer patients and others can benefit from marijuana use and against the federal ban that has always been more about politics than science. (Another 12 states, meanwhile, have legalized the limited use of low-THC, high-CBD pot for those with prescriptions.) A change in classification would be the first major domino to fall in the fight to end federal prohibition. Not only would it allow medical marijuana to more easily flourish in those states where it is already legal, it would also make other states where medical weed is not yet legal more likely to follow suit. The path from legal medical weed to the recreational stuff isn't as straight of a line, although the two are clearly connected. Already Colorado, Washington state, Oregon, and Alaska have proved that voters are game to open the door for widespread recreational use. Similar full-scale legalization efforts are at varying stages in more than a half-dozen other states--Nevada, Arizona, and California among them--where advocates are looking toward 2016, when they hope the presidential election will turn out enough liberals to push those efforts across the finish line. As I explained last summer, more than 1 in 5 Americans live in states where smoking pot has a legitimate chance to become legal between now and when Obama leaves office. The biggest potential roadblock to such state-level efforts would be if Washington decides to step in and flex its federal muscles. But its D.C. bullying aside, Congress has actually quietly become increasingly pot-friendly, particularly when it comes to medical weed. While no one expects Congress to vote to legalize pot outright anytime soon--or even to back the type of major reforms that would make it easier for states to legalize medical or recreational weed on their own--a growing number of lawmakers have made it clear they have no desire to stand in the way of those state efforts. Tucked in the same bill that targeted the D.C. legalization effort was a provision that was actually much more important in the larger fight for legalization. Lawmakers voted to block the Justice Department from spending a dime to prosecute patients or medical marijuana dispensaries that are acting in accordance with state law but running afoul of federal ones--a roundabout way of achieving one of the main goals of the Paul-Booker-Gillibrand bill. Still, that policy change isn't permanent--it will last through this coming September--making it only a symbolic victory unless Congress acts again. The Obama administration, meanwhile, has sent mixed messages when it comes to weed. The president has given a qualified green light to states to experiment with both retail and medical weed. But at the same time that hasn't stopped the DEA and several U.S. attorneys in recent years from raiding hundreds of medical dispensaries that were in compliance with state laws--nor would it prevent the next president from taking a more aggressive posture. Still, the slow march toward legalization appears to be underway, and the Paul-Booker-Gillibrand bill provides a clear path--not just in policy but also in politics. Booker and Gillibrand represent the traditional liberal support for ending the war on drugs, while Paul provides the states-rights and libertarian logic that appeals to many conservatives. Already, Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush--both of whom Paul can expect to cross paths with during the GOP primary--have suggested they support states' rights to legalize pot, even if they don't personally want to see that happen. That rationale has been echoed by a number of congressional Republicans as well and was a key driver in the cromnibus' medical pot provision. The Senate bill is unlikely to get the consideration it deserves in this Congress. But fortunately for the legalization effort, it doesn't have to complete the journey to be a success--it only needs to point the way."	This Is How Weed Will Eventually Become Legal in the United States

He would throw himself into campaigning or his work. Let the press and his partisan pursuers bleat, he was going to return to important issues. By engaging in a flurry of activity, he showed voters that no matter what the odds, he would work for them. ""I'll never forget who gave me a second chance,"" he famously said during the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when he came back from what seemed like an impossible deficit, ""and I'll be there for you until the last dog dies."" That is what Hillary Clinton should do in Iowa, say some Democratic strategists. In order to turn the page on the questions swirling around her use of a private email account, she should throw her back into an Iowa campaign in April, when the last translucent veil is dropped from the pretense that she's not running. (Were she not running, she wouldn't have bothered with the U.N. press conference). Clinton's allies and advisers believe one of the bedrock attributes that voters appreciate about the former secretary of state is her tenacity. Beaten, she is never defeated. That was the story of her New Hampshire primary victory over Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. He'd beaten her in Iowa, but she didn't give up. She can show that again by returning to Iowa now. She doesn't face a real challenge there in the caucuses, but working hard would show that she wasn't waiting for a coronation. Furthermore, amid the email flap, the image of her working the crowd would make a nice foil. Under siege, her response should be to charge ahead. That would be a direct contrast to her ambivalence about the state in 2008. ""In every way, they want this time around to look and feel different,"" said one Washington-based adviser. ""There's no better place to do that than in Iowa."" Campaigning from Davenport to Council Bluffs to Cedar Falls would remind people of her work ethic. Clinton talks about all the air miles she logged as secretary of state--something likely Republican candidate Carly Fiorina scoffs at--but that mileage is an easily quantifiable way to convey to voters a sense of her determination. Racking up miles on Highways 35 and 80 would do her similar good. It's easy for voters to imagine that you'll work on their wages, health care, jobs, and the high costs of college if they see you working hard right in front of them. Strategists also argue that Iowa is ready-made for one-on-one, close-quarters campaigning, which would allow Clinton to engage voters in real conversations. Instead of looking magisterial in front of a U.N. banner, she would be captured talking to real people about their real world. Iowa is also inexpensive; a campaign can go all out without having to spend a great deal of money. Sources in the state believe Clinton is moving this way. She has hired Matt Paul to run her operation there. He's a longtime aide to former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Clinton friend who cares about the state of the Democratic Party in Iowa. On the day the Washington Post broke the news about Paul, I was in Iowa interviewing Republican operatives. They all knew Paul's reputation in the state and agreed the hire was proof Clinton is taking the state seriously. Democrats think so, too. Paul will be aided by several other top campaign picks, including Lily Adams from the Democratic National Committee's communications operation and longtime Iowa Democratic strategist Brenda Kole. Iowa is a swing state, which means it's smart to do the work now. A strategist working with the Clinton campaign explained that since Iowa is the first contest and the caucus process requires a lot of organization, the campaign wants to work hard here as a way to use the state as a laboratory for organizing tactics they'll use elsewhere during the general election. ""What [President Obama] was great about was building a system that could be taken across the country and replicated across the country,"" says one Democrat close to Clinton's nascent campaign. Iowa also offers a chance for the Clinton campaign to go on the early offensive against the GOP candidates already rolling through the state. Heaven knows they're already going on the offensive against her."	Why Iowa Is the Best Antidote to Hillary Clinton's Present Troubles
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/two_ferguson_police_officers_shot_will_the_violence_end_the_movement_to.html	"On early Thursday morning, outside of the Ferguson, Missouri, police station, unknown assailants shot two police officers: one in the shoulder, one in the face. They were part of a group of officers standing side by side forming a blockade between protesters and the station. Both are in serious condition, but neither injury is life threatening. Thankfully, they will live. But it's not clear if we can say the same for the Ferguson protest movement, which was also harmed by the shooting. Just hours earlier, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson had resigned from his post. His departure followed on the heals of four others, all fallout from the Justice Department's scathing report on the city's kleptocratic police practices and racist language. Last week, it was two police officers (who resigned) and the city's top court clerk (who was fired). And on Tuesday, it was City Manager John Shaw, who the Justice Department named as key to the entire scheme of spurious arrests and draconian fines. Chief Jackson announced his resignation with a press conference at the police station, and when protesters gathered to meet him, it was a celebration as much as  a demonstration. And for good reason: Despite major setbacks, activists--with a strong assist from the federal government--had begun to bring accountability to the city of Ferguson and had started the hard and painful process of institutional change. Because the shooting happened during the protests--albeit hours after Jackson's resignation, when they were waning--there's a strong chance they'll be associated with the protesters, even if the shooter wasn't involved in the demonstrations or the movement writ large. Already, area police officials are calling it deliberate. ""This is really an ambush,"" said St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar during a Thursday morning news conference, later clarifying to say that he didn't ""know who did the shooting. ... But somehow they were embedded in that group of folks."" And while he didn't want to condemn the full range of people protesting--""That's not an indictment on everybody that's out there certainly expressing their First Amendment rights""--he also thought something like this was inevitable, given the anger of the protests and some of the participants. ""When you look at the tenor of at least some of the people involved in the protest or civil unrest, it can be troubling,"" he said. ""I think it's a miracle that we haven't had any instances similar to this over the summer and fall."" Police are investigating, but at present we have no idea who shot the officers, or why. And it's that lack of information that makes this a dangerous moment for Ferguson reform. Fixing the city, or even just ameliorating its problems, requires good faith and buy-in from all stakeholders, from Ferguson police and city officials to community leaders and the persuadable white Ferguson residents who are neither involved in the movement nor actively opposed to it. Indeed, both Department of Justice reports were valuable because they laid neutral ground for action. Almost everyone could acknowledge that former Officer Darren Wilson was innocent of legal wrongdoing and most everyone could agree that the city was corrupt and unfair. The shootings shatter this nascent detente. As Attorney General Eric Holder said in a Thursday morning press conference, ""Such senseless acts of violence threaten the very reforms that nonviolent protesters in Ferguson and around the country have been working towards for the past several months."" As with the killings in New York City in December, there's a chance these shootings could completely derail any attempt to repair the relationship between the police and the policed. With that said, the reform effort is still viable. But it will take even more work than before to establish trust and build a common basis for change. For activists, part of that will be loudly repudiating the shooter, which they've already done. On Twitter, one of the early Ferguson organizers, Deray McKesson, expressed his sympathies for the officers while reiterating the concerns of the protesters. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to all victims of violence,"" he wrote, ""The movement is bigger than any one moment. What was true yesterday is true today--we fight for justice because police brutality is real. What was true yesterday is true today--we have never advocated the shooting of police as a means of justice."" If activists have to take a definitive stand against the shooter, then city officials have to understand this isn't a reason to stop working with protesters. And on that count, there are some signs for optimism. ""We want peace in our community,"" said Ferguson Councilwoman Kim Tihen in an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The former city police officer isn't sure ""what more"" the protesters want, but she ""would like to ask them to come to us"" to ""tell us what we can do to continue to heal the community."" ""We are willing to work with them, the protesters in general,"" she said."	The Senseless Shooting of Two Police Officers Threatens the Movement to Reform Ferguson
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/hillary_clinton_s_press_conference_on_her_private_email_account_the_former.html	Hillary Clinton's press conference could not have felt more Clinton. Those hoping this well-known accomplished woman would emerge as a new kind of candidate were disappointed on Tuesday. Instead, this was vintage Clinton from the 1990s: late, grudging, and incomplete. Do you trust Hillary Clinton? That's the political question at the heart of this entire episode about her choice to use a private email account while secretary of state. The question isn't just whether voters trust her on the particulars of this incident, but whether she can convince the public that she is a trustworthy person. Voters are unlikely to elect a president they don't trust, but they're also likely to grade on a curve. Some are willing to give Clinton their trust because other things they care about are much more important. Clinton will fight for their issues. Her Tuesday press conference was held at the United Nations because she was there to receive recognition for the work she has done in the last 20 years elevating women's rights across the globe. They'll trust her enough to give her power to do those things. For others, she will never be able to win back their trust. Are there any voters left who don't fall into those camps? If there are, Clinton has a message for them: Trust me. After more than a week of unanswered questions about her emailing habits as America's chief diplomat, that was the message she was able to muster at a press conference intended to put those questions to bed. This was not a let-it-all-hang-out press conference like the two-hour one New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie held the day after revelations surfaced that one of his staffers shut down lanes on the George Washington Bridge to punish a political enemy. In that press conference, Christie tried to show through his speech, demeanor, and mannerisms that he had nothing to hide. He tried to employ his apparent candor as a way to retake command of the moment. Clinton chose a different route. Her press conference ran about 20 minutes, and she chose not to answer questions that were directly posed to her. She relied on a stiff reading of the laws governing the treatment of private email and made unverifiable assertions. Clinton explained that she didn't follow the State Department rules because she didn't want to carry around two phones. She said she deleted more than half of the emails on her server (roughly 31,000) because they were all personal (messages about Chelsea's wedding and yoga and whatnot). She said that whenever there was a matter regarding official business, she emailed it to someone with a .gov address so that it was captured by archivists. How do we know all of this is true? The emails have been deleted, and she's not going to allow anyone to look at the server. She asks people to trust her. Clinton's central appeal was to common reason: She didn't want to lug around two phones. So she claims she limited herself to one and put in place her own procedures to collect the emails that were official. That's fine, if that turns out to be true. Other Cabinet officials had two addresses on a single phone. Why didn't she? Also, Clinton didn't just use a single phone--she set up her own server. That suggests a more considered effort than simply acting out of convenience. (Is it really easier to set up your own server and email protocols than to carry two phones?) She said it was her existing system, but records suggest the account was set up the day of her State Department confirmation hearing. Plus, two weeks ago, the former secretary of state said that she carries around two phones now. There's footage of her doing so, and in a social media age, the apparent contradiction about convenience can be passed around rather quickly. Adversity can give candidates a chance to forge new connections with voters, or it can redouble existing doubts. Some voters will make those judgments now, while others will wait. Between now and Election Day, there will be other moments where the same instincts Clinton showed today will be tested again. She's going to need to seem less like the person we expect next time.	Hillary Clinton Doesn't Appear to Have Learned Anything Since the Last Time
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/bob_menendez_s_federal_criminal_corruption_charges_the_new_jersey_senator.html	"No sooner had news surfaced on Friday that federal prosecutors were on the verge of bringing criminal charges against New Jersey's Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez than the jokes about the Soprano State's culture of corruption began. Heck, even I couldn't resist. On further reflection, though, we're being unfair to ascribe the Menendez mess entirely to the state from whence he came--and in so doing are missing lessons about how to safeguard our political system from further such occurrences. The precise nature of the charges against Menendez aren't yet known, but for two years the feds have been scrutinizing his dealings with a wealthy South Florida ophthalmologist named Salomon Melgen. Menendez, the child of poor Cuban immigrants, got to know the Dominican-born Melgen two decades ago, back when Menendez was a new arrival in the House of Representatives, and has, by his own account, become close friends with him. In recent years, Menendez repeatedly interceded on Melgen's behalf in a dispute with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over allegations that Melgen had overbilled Medicare for millions of dollars for injections he was performing on patients with macular degeneration. Menendez has also been pressing on Melgen's behalf to help him see through a deal he has to sell port-screening equipment to the Dominican government. Meanwhile, Melgen has been a highly generous supporter of Menendez's. He and his family gave $33,700 to Menendez's 2012 re-election campaign, as well as $60,400 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee while Menendez served as its chairman during the 2010 election cycle. But the biggest contribution by far was a series of three payments totaling $700,000 that Melgen's business gave in 2012 to Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC that in turn shoveled nearly $600,000 toward Menendez's re-election that year. Melgen also paid for two free trips that Menendez took in 2010 to Melgen's seaside mansion in the Dominican Republic, a gift that Menendez did not initially disclose and for which he later paid $58,500 in reimbursement. The feds' case will likely not be easy to prove, given how ill-defined the gray area is between lawmaking and constituent service on the one hand and outright favor-peddling on the other. Menendez flatly denies any wrongdoing. ""As to Dr. Melgen, everyone knows he and his family, and me and my family, have been real friends for more than two decades,"" he said Friday. ""We celebrate holidays together, have been there for family weddings and funerals, and have given each other birthday, holiday, and wedding presents--just as friends do."" Regardless, the case represents a major comedown for Menendez, who--after being raised by a seamstress and a carpenter with a gambling problem who killed himself when Menendez was in his 20s--made his name as a rising young politician by standing against New Jersey corruption. At age 27, he took the stand to testify against his mentor, Union City Mayor William Musto, who was convicted of racketeering for steering school money to mobsters. (Given the players involved, Menendez had to wear a bulletproof vest for the occasion.) He went on become Union City mayor himself, then state assemblyman and finally a congressman in 1992 before ascending to the Senate in 2006, all the while transforming the Hudson County Democratic machine from its white-ethnic roots to reflect the county's increasingly Hispanic face. Menendez is hardly the first New Jersey politician to find himself blemished after having initially made his name as Mr. Clean. There's Gov. Chris Christie, who rose to stardom by taking down corrupt politicians as a federal prosecutor--and occasionally overreaching, as he did in trying to hang insinuations of wrongdoing around Menendez in 2006--only for the world to later learn how many deals Christie himself was cutting with some of the biggest bosses on the block. And Menendez is also not the first New Jersey senator to get in trouble as the conduit of big checks to Senate Democrats--his case recalls the investigation early last decade into Bob Torricelli's acceptance of large donations from a Korean-American businessman seeking political favors. There undoubtedly is something in the state's political culture that gives rise to unethical behavior--a culture that has been attributed to everything from the state's profusion of municipalities (so many pots of money to target) to its fractured media landscape to, yes, the presence of the mob. ""It's the culture,"" one veteran New Jersey political hand told me this week in discussing the Menendez matter. ""It's all the same crap. It's the culture of how these guys think they can get away with this stuff."" But that doesn't mean there aren't lessons for the rest of us. Consider, for one thing, the exact nature of Menendez's biggest intervention on behalf of Melgen (who, let's not forget, was himself a resident of Soprano State): Medicare billing. One of the most glaring idiosyncrasies of the U.S. health care system is that it leaves a significant role to play for members of Congress when it comes to determining payment levels for Medicare and Medicaid--either in the form of legislation or ad-hoc interventions like this one. The whole arrangement is great for health industry lobbyists and campaign accounts but not so great for the rational operation of our health care system. As it happens, the Affordable Care Act addresses this weakness by leaving more of the payment decisions in the hands of an independent board of technocrats, but many in Congress have been resistant to ceding their authority. Or consider one of the likely motivations for Menendez to accept the trips to Melgen's Dominican mansion. It's not hard to imagine why a son of the tenements would want to hobnob in luxury--and it's even easier to imagine when one considers that Menendez is surrounded in the Senate by multimillionaires who live at a level he can only dream of. The median net worth for all senators last year was $2.7 million. Whereas Menendez, one of the chamber's poorest members, gave up a goodly portion of his net worth when he cut the $58,500 check to reimburse Melgen for the free flights. Our absurdly unrepresentative Congress does not excuse the acceptance of freebies by the regular Joes left in the mix, but it helps explain how they come to accept them. Finally, it's hardly difficult to guess why Menendez might have pushed boundaries to get Melgen's checks for himself and his fellow Senate Democrats. The cost of Senate campaigns has surged with the rise of outside groups that don't have to abide by contribution limits, and Democrats have been at a distinct disadvantage in this new landscape, given how many more deep-pocketed donors are writing big checks for Republicans. (Ironically, the only reason we know about Melgen's $700,000 to Majority PAC is that that group discloses its donors, unlike the groups that have been drawing the largest conservative donations.) Granted, all the above circumstances have not kept plenty of our elected officials from hewing to the straight and narrow. But no, this isn't just a Jersey thing. Take, for a final counter-example, the ambitious politico-in-the-making who, like Menendez, intervened on behalf of a major political donor who was in his own dispute with federal health regulators, in this case over the ratio of Medicare patients that the donor's medical centers could handle. In that case, the businessman in question even wrote a $75,000 check to the rising politico's real-estate firm--and ended up fleeing the country and being sought for years on charges of defrauding Medicare for hundreds of millions of dollars. That case wasn't in New Jersey--it was in Florida. And the person who made the calls to regulators on behalf of the donor? A current leading candidate for president: Jeb Bush."	Sen. Bob Menendez's Corruption Case Isn't a Jersey Thing
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/hillary_clinton_s_slow_response_to_private_email_questions_the_former_secretary.html	"Do we want a president who deals with the world as it should be or a president who operates in the world as it is? That is the question raised by the revelations of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account during her time as America's top diplomat--and her response to it. How she responds will tell us something about what her presidency would look like. Instead of the Clinton email story, there are a number of other stories we should be talking about regarding the former secretary of state. What does she think about 47 Republican senators writing a letter to Iran saying that they could scuttle whatever nuclear deal Obama negotiates? It's an extraordinary act by members of the body in which she once served. Or, she could weigh in on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress, wage stagnation, Selma and race in America, or the collapse of Libya. Or Clinton could talk about how automation has changed the workforce or how families balance the demands of work and home--some of the issues she touched on in her very substantive speech last week in Silicon Valley. But Clinton can't really weigh in effectively on any of these issues right now. She's got to get past her email problem. She's got to explain why she did it, how she's going to deal with the fallout, and why her campaign's first response about her homebrew practices was wrong. Her spokesman claims her six-year email regimen was within the letter and spirit of the law. It was neither. The press can be blamed for going overboard on the story; no one will ever get in trouble making that safe claim. (Puppies too are mostly cute.) But candidates are responsible for managing the world as it is, because that's what being president will be like. Most of the shiny objects at the center of nonbreaking, nonvital campaign coverage are not a test of anything except perhaps how fast we can zoom toward the bottom. One of a president's greatest skills is ignoring the trivia and hyperventilating. President Obama's chief of staff Denis McDonough has a 10 percent rule that seems about right: spend 10 percent of your energy keeping an eye on the feeding frenzy and spend the rest of your time focused on important issues. But this isn't trivia. While Clinton and her team leave the stage empty, all kinds of performers rush to fill it. At the moment it's old news clips of former Sen. Al D'Amato requesting Whitewater documents or clips of Clinton expressing wonder at how Rose Law Firm records could mysteriously show up at the White House after having been missing for so long. On Sunday Rep. Trey Gowdy, the GOP investigator looking into every corner of the Benghazi attack, said on Face the Nation that lots of emails are missing. And over on Meet the Press, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that Clinton needs to come forward and explain herself. The newspapers are tiring their political reporters with demands that they write yet another Democrats-are-worried-about-Hillary piece. I was out in Iowa last week and Democrats who have been anxious for Clinton to start her campaign are now even more irritated. They were already wondering how Clinton could be different and engaging this time around, and this isn't proof that things are going to be different--unless of course the strategy is to have one last big show of how not to do things in order to make the campaign look that much better in the months to come. Operating in the world as it exists is what Clinton was presumably doing by setting up a private email account in the first place. Dogged for years by the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" and a prying press, she set up a protocol to protect herself. (That's the most benign interpretation obviously.) Forget the niceties of the way things should be--transparency, what other Cabinet officials were doing, and all that tosh--she understands the way things really are. Good, then we can deal with the reality at hand: The former secretary's office has given incorrect information, she's leaving her allies scratching their heads over how to defend her, and she's not in control of this moment. That is a problem for her inevitable presidential campaign, but it's also a test of how she'll handle this kind of thing if she's president. When you're president, all kinds of irritating things happen and a president must learn to deal with them. It's also worth watching what residue this leaves. If the campaign starts in a defensive crouch, will it just stay there? During the campaign, Clinton will argue that her experience makes her especially adept at dealing with the challenges of the world. She's got a strong foundation from which she can build that case. But when you've experienced a lot it means you've been in the fight long enough to take on barnacles. Experience can make you reflexively insular and walled-off. That's a legitimate question to ask of anyone, whether they have Clinton's history or not. Former Pentagon chief Bob Gates said that he didn't support the Bin Laden raid because he had perhaps become too risk-averse from his long service in government. The instinct to create your own way, despite the rules, is a possible asset--or it's a dangerous warning. We'll have to figure out which it is. The future candidate has a chance to show how experience counts in handling the madness surrounding her email. How she responds will probably tell us more about her ability to manage than anything she said in those 600 pages about her State Department years."	Where Is All That Real-World Experience Hillary Clinton Promised?
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/wisconsin_assembly_passes_right_to_work_legislation_unions_dealt_a_severe.html	"MADISON, Wisconsin--When the Wisconsin State Assembly dropped the hammer on the state's labor movement, the State Capitol was as quiet as a library. Maybe half a dozen ragged protesters stood outside the chamber hollering weakly, but the rest of the building and the grounds were serene. After two short post-vote press conferences, Madison sailed calmly on. This wasn't for lack of opposition. Legislators stayed up the whole night before the vote as Democrats tried to--well, it's hard to say what exactly they were trying to do, since right-to-work's passage was basically a done deal as soon as Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald announced in December that the statehouse would move on it. For all practical purposes, the Legislature's all-nighter was a vigil for the Badger State's organized labor movement. Unions won't vaporize overnight, of course: The right-to-work legislation that passed 62-35 on Friday morning just means private-sector employers can no longer make payment of union dues a condition for hiring. Democrats charge that this will hamstring unions, since employees will freeload without paying the dues that let them maintain their clout. Republicans say the legislation will create jobs and make the state more attractive for businesses. Imagine I told you that North Dakota was going to ban fracking in six years. That's how incredulous you'd be if you'd heard back in 2009 that Wisconsin was going to crack down on collective bargaining in the most right-wing way possible. But here we are: The legislation sailed through statehouse with zero suspense, and Gov. Scott Walker says he plans to sign it on Monday. Four years ago, Walker was just another Pawlenty-esque Midwesterner, and collective bargaining reforms were just a twinkle in his eye. Since then, he's constrained public-sector unions, faced down more than 100,000 angry protesters, survived a recall election, won a re-election bid, defunded Planned Parenthood, and rocketed to the top of the 2016 Republican primary polls. In the meantime, state Republicans have enjoyed full power over the state's government and--as of a few hours ago--have easily made Wisconsin the 25th state to join the right-to-work column. The Democrats watching this unfold Thursday night and Friday morning still seemed stunned. ""I've been asking over and over and over again, who asked for this bill? Who asked for this bill?"" said Rep. Christine Sinicki, toward the end of the all-night talkathon. ""I still have not gotten the answer."" ""We have spent the last four years trampling on the graves of those who have fought for these freedoms,"" she continued. ""I hope to God, I pray to God this is the overreach we've been looking for."" Other Democrats came off as comparably frantic. ""Right-to-work will make it harder for families to live,"" said Rep. Leon Young simply. And Rep. JoCasta Zamarripa said the legislation ""was serving merely as a distraction"" from Walker's budget. In a press conference after the vote, Democratic Rep. Peter Barca also took a slightly apocalyptic tone. ""What we saw today is just one more example of right-wing fanaticism on steroids,"" he said. Regardless of whether you'd characterize the right-to-work law as fanatical or not, it's remarkable the extent to which Madison kept mum about its passage. Besides a few dozen Democratic legislators and a few hundred labor protesters the day before, the famously liberal city was placid as the conservative legislation rolled along. The liberals who have faced Walker have lost, and lost, and lost again, and progressive Wisconsinites' stores of outrage seem, at least for the moment, to be exhausted. That's not to suggest the left has given up. But Walker and the Republicans in the Legislature have more ideas they plan to advance, including cutting funding for the state's universities. ""I think that this is purposeful on the part of Walker,"" said Rep. Terese Berceau after the vote. ""It's not just about running for president. It's just flooding us, flooding us so that it's difficult for us to really focus in on one thing, because the next day it's something else."" ""One day it's workers' rights,"" she continued. ""The next day it's the university and cutting that, and the day after that it's abortion restrictions, and the day after that it'll be the environmental regulations that they are destroying."" And if there's one lesson from Thursday night's calm, it's that there's little Democrats can do right now to come between Walker and his agenda. Walker talks often about his success in fighting for change. But Republicans' overwhelming victories in the last few election cycles have let them dominate the state government, so they don't really face much of a fight anymore. That's why the state that birthed the organized labor movement in the United States is now right-to-work. In Madison, it's clear that Walker and his allies have learned how to take charge, get things done, and render their ideological foes irrelevant. First Wisconsin, then the country? The governor's presidential prospects hinge on the possibility that that idea isn't too far-fetched."	Wisconsin's Unions Just Died With a Whimper
