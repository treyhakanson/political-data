Bernie Sanders speak in person. Hundreds of thousands have seen him from screens of some sort. But Tuesday night, at the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas, will be the first time America--or at least a substantial fraction of Americans--will witness the Vermont senator and ""democratic socalist"" in action. And for Sanders, it's a test of what he wants to do with his candidacy. We know what Hillary Clinton wants to do. She wants to be president. To that end--as the front-runner for the nomination--she'll take a cautious (but confident) approach to the debate. Yes, she's vulnerable to old criticisms: that she's opportunistic and unprincipled (expect questions and jabs on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for instance), that she's too hawkish for a war-weary Democratic base, and that she has too much ""baggage"" as a long-player in national politics. But Clinton is also experienced enough to address those arguments--she did in the 2008 debates--without getting bogged down in needless conflict. And to that point, there's a good chance she avoids her 2007 and 2008 strategy of directly going after her opponents. Then, it made sense--Sen. Barack Obama was obviously a legitimate threat. Now, however, she stands against three marginal candidates--Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee--and one insurgent, Sanders, who remains significantly behind in national polling. For Clinton, there's no need to be aggressive and potentially alienate Sanders' supporters. And there's the fact that, if she did, she risks losing control of the media narrative. A Clinton who attacks Sanders is a Clinton who risks a new label for her campaign-- ""desperate""--even if it doesn't fit. Sanders doesn't have this problem. We expect him as a challenger to go hard against Clinton. But this doesn't fit his stated aims or approach. ""I've never run a negative political ad in my life,"" said Sanders in an interview with CNN earlier this year. ""I believe in serious debates on serious issues. I've known Hillary Clinton for 25 years ... I like Hillary Clinton ... I respect Hillary Clinton."" At the same time, if Sanders is serious about winning the nomination, he has to do more than talk about the issues; he must show that Clinton isn't liberal enough or trustworthy enough to lead the Democratic Party beyond the Obama era. And that requires a harder edge. Sanders can go that route--Mother Jones describes a fierce and occasionally ill-tempered debater who can put his opponents on the defensive--but it comes at the risk of hurting his appeal as a basically friendly warrior whose anger is for oligarchs and corporations, not putative allies. The Sanders who flared at protesters at Netroots Nation this summer--""Shall I continue or leave? It's OK with me.""--is one who could alienate Democrats who like him but don't dislike Clinton. Which brings us back to the aforementioned test. It's hard to escape negative campaigns. Not because politicians are bad or unprincipled, but because campaigns are about contrast, and attacking a failure is often better than highlighting an advantage. If you want to win the election, you inevitably go negative. But if your priority is ideas--if you want to pressure a front-runner into using your message--then you might stay away from attacks and keep things cordial. If Sanders is running to raise awareness--and to introduce his politics to the broad public--then we might get something more interesting than spats and conflict; we might get a bona fide debate over policy, where the two most popular candidates spar over their liberal visions for the United States. The wild card in Tuesday night's debate isn't Sanders or Clinton--it's everyone else. Neither O'Malley nor Webb nor Chafee have anything to lose by going on the offensive, and they have a lot to gain from winning attention. Sanders and Clinton might be able to stay away from each other, but don't be surprised if one--or both--tries to swat one of the gadflies in the race.

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/cnn_s_democratic_primary_debate_broadcast_live_in_virtual_reality_the_candidates.html	"The Democratic presidential candidates set to face off Tuesday night on CNN in their first debate have taken great pains to script their answers and pick the perfect poll-tested wardrobe. And yet, without knowing it, they have opened themselves up to a technology that they don't understand and that could make them vulnerable to untold gaffes and blunders. For the first time, a major news event will be broadcast live in virtual reality. CNN is partnering with a virtual reality company to enable viewers at home to feel like they are actually at the Las Vegas debate. Granted, only a few hundred thousand people in the United States have virtual reality headsets at home, and of those who do, it could be a far smaller number who will actually watch Hillary Clinton square off against her main challengers Sen. Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. But there is a risk that one or more of the candidates could look less than flattering, and that the image could go viral, creating an awkward storyline the candidates would typically want to avoid. The fascinating question for me is why did the candidates agree to this when there is nothing to gain by participating in a debate broadcast in virtual reality? New technologies bring new risks. In the first televised presidential debate in 1960, Richard Nixon's ashen and sweaty appearance and frumpy ill-fitting suit made him look like he'd been ""embalmed ... before he even died,"" then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley said while the dapper, bronze-complexioned John F. Kennedy appeared the clear winner, even though most viewers agreed that Nixon performed better on the issues. It may be a stretch to call this a potential Nixon moment, especially this early in the Democratic primary. But virtual reality presents a separate set of challenges that the candidates likely haven't considered. First, if Clinton or Sanders wants to win in the virtual reality version of this debate, they'd better negotiate for the middle podium. In live-streamed, stereoscopic video--a cutting-edge technology that will be used Tuesday night--typically there is a sweet spot. Toward the edges, a viewer will see less depth, something like seeing out of one eye. Close one eye and look down at your hands on the keyboard for 20 seconds. Then open your eyes and, ""pop,"" you will see the benefits of stereoscopic vision. Candidates closer to the center of the camera's field of view will literally stand out more than those on the edges. A reach toward the camera by a candidate on the periphery may make his or her arm look stubby. On the flipside, candidates can't hide. The viewers will get to choose where they look, unlike the regular television viewing audience which relies on the CNN producer to decide on the camera angles. In virtual reality, those who want to spend two hours scrutinizing Sanders' every facial tic and micro-movement can do so. The probability of YouTube-viral gaffes just went through the roof. Then there is the issue of time. Candidates shouldn't just lobby to stand in the center of the stage--they must speak first. Virtual reality displays can cause simulator sickness. Over time, a person's visual system gets fatigued triggering nausea, dizziness, and disorientation. I have researched the psychological impact of virtual reality for almost two decades, and to date I haven't worn a head-mounted display for more than 30 minutes. Tolerance for simulator sickness varies across people, but watching a two-hour debate in virtual reality will make many people feel ill. CNN is trying to be a pioneer in a technology that is about to go mainstream. That is admirable. But this is the wrong experiment. Live-streamed virtual reality is a brand new technology, and there are bound to be some hiccups. Perhaps a pointing gesture will get distorted into a plastic man-like stretch, or a lean toward the camera will get exaggerated in depth and cause a horror-show flinch response by the audience. Remember, the volume of a scream--""Yaaahhh!!""-- was enough to end Howard Dean's campaign. Virtual reality's great promise is its ability to take you to places you can't go in the real world. In my lab at Stanford University, you put on a head-mounted display and are at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea seeing what climate change's impact on the coral reef and fish looks like. We make you feel like you are seeing the world's greatest art up close. We let you see your future, older self to help you plan for retirement. Used properly, virtual reality is poised to transform the way we engage with our world and with each other. A political debate is not one of those scenarios. The bottom line is that just because an event can be experienced in virtual reality, doesn't mean it should be. At best, Tuesday night's virtual reality broadcast will simply produce boredom. At worst, it will produce an unscripted moment that will make a candidate wish the debate had only been broadcast the old-fashioned way."

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/the_planned_parenthood_hearings_aren_t_about_those_videos_here_s_the_truth.html	"On Thursday afternoon, the House of Representatives held yet another hearing on Planned Parenthood, its fourth in the past few weeks. The previous hearings, based on undercover videos of conversations with Planned Parenthood officials, were supposed to show criminal misconduct. They failed. But this hearing, held before the House Judiciary Committee, promised to do better. It was titled, ""Planned Parenthood Exposed: Examining Abortion Procedures and Medical Ethics at the Nation's Largest Abortion Provider."" The undercover videos that sparked the hearings show pro-lifers, disguised as medical research suppliers, trying to lure Planned Parenthood officers into financial negotiations over fetal tissue. The committee's chairman, Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, promised Thursday's hearing would focus on the content of these videos. Presumably, that would mean late-term abortion and the sale of baby parts. But Goodlatte's opening words signaled a broader attack on abortion at any stage. He began: ""A child's heart begins to form three weeks after conception."" From there, it was all downhill. The more the Republicans and their hand-picked witnesses talked, the more obvious it became that their agenda went way beyond Planned Parenthood or late-term abortion. What was on trial was abortion itself. The pretense that we would see ""Planned Parenthood Exposed"" collapsed early in the hearing. Democratic members of the committee noted that six states, responding to the videos, had investigated Planned Parenthood and had found no convincing evidence that it broke any laws. Seven other states had deemed the evidence insufficient to warrant investigation. One Democrat, Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, played a series of clips that pro-lifers had edited out of their promoted versions of the videos. In the clips, a Planned Parenthood officer repeatedly explained that the organization doesn't sell tissue and doesn't want to profit from it. Four witnesses, three of them pro-life, had been summoned to testify. The first, Anthony Levatino, was an OB-GYN who used to terminate pregnancies. He described his methods in grisly detail and showed the committee a video in which clinic staffers offered women very late abortions. Under questioning, however, Levatino admitted that these weren't Planned Parenthood clinics, that he had never worked with Planned Parenthood during his practice, and that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by anyone affiliated with the organization. The next witness, Susan Thayer, used to run a Planned Parenthood clinic in Iowa. She had filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the organization for firing her. Democrats on the committee challenged her motives, noting that she stood to collect a lot of money if she wins the case. Her testimony seemed sincere. But the only abortion-related complaint she offered against Planned Parenthood was that it provided ""webcam"" abortions, in which a doctor talks with a woman by remote video and authorizes her to take pills that end her pregnancy. Thayer protested that once a woman takes the pills, she can't change her mind. She ignored the simpler perspective: If you don't let the woman take the pills, you're thwarting her will. The last pro-life witness, Luana Stoltenberg, was a puddle of anguish. She had had three abortions and testified that they had wrecked her life. She blamed clinic employees for downplaying the gravity of the procedure. But when questioned by the Democrats, she admitted that only one of the three abortions occurred at a Planned Parenthood clinic. Hers was a familiar story: I regret my abortion, so nobody else should be allowed to have one. The witnesses couldn't hide their broader agenda. ""Every abortion results in a dead son or daughter,"" said Levatino. ""It's never OK to have an abortion,"" said Thayer. Stoltenberg agreed: ""Abortion is not health care. It is the taking of an innocent life."" Stoltenberg's testimony was painful to watch. She was distraught. She had brought notebooks full of stories from other women who regretted their abortions. She said many had tried to drown their sorrows in alcohol. She sought to help them as a post-abortion counselor. She begged the committee to spare other women her fate. And she wasn't alone in her suffering. As one lawmaker after another erupted in outrage at the very existence of abortion, it became clear that the hearing itself was group therapy. The Planned Parenthood videos and hearings had revealed nothing with which to indict the organization. What was being exposed wasn't criminal conduct. It was impotence and rage. The committee's Democrats called Thursday's proceedings a show hearing, and the Republicans did their best to validate the charge. When the Democrats proposed to strike Levatino's video presentation from the record, on the grounds that it had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood, the presiding Republican, Rep. Trent Franks, barked: ""I wonder if we're going to be able to strike that video from your memory."" The purpose of the video, as Franks implicitly conceded, was just to make everyone uncomfortable. A few minutes later, Franks drove the point home: ""The central question is: Does abortion kill a little baby?"" Democrats on the committee repeatedly accused Republicans of treating Planned Parenthood like Benghazi: an open-ended political show trial disguised as an investigation. The Republicans bristled. But by the end, the committee seemed to have forgotten the subject at hand. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas exploded in a two-minute tirade that literally turned the hearing into a rehash of Benghazi:"	The Planned Parenthood Hearings Were Actually Just Pro-Life Group Therapy	['Franks', 'Goodlatte', 'Cohen', 'Gohmert']	['abortion']
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/who_will_replace_john_boehner_here_are_the_candidates.html	"Now that Kevin McCarthy has abandoned his bid, the state of the race for speaker of the House is ... not really a race, yet. Everyone is waiting for Rep. Paul Ryan to stop whining about wanting to spend time with his family and just take the gig already. If the full apparatus of the Grand Old Party continues to be unable to persuade Ryan, though, other members--and nonmembers--have shown interest in America's Worst Job. Let's run through some of the potential candidates, their qualifications, and what might keep them from getting the position second nearest to the presidency. Darrell Issa The showy former chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has acknowledged that he's considering a run, assuming Ryan stays out. (Issa told reporters that he ""did everything but carry [Paul Ryan's] gym bag this morning"" in an effort to persuade him.) Issa, a member since 2001, has had an interesting life. A Lebanese-American, Issa was the proprietor (and voice!) of that annoying car alarm that every jerk in the '90s had instructing would-be thieves to ""STEP BACK FROM THE CAR."" As a result, he is the wealthiest member of Congress. How did he come up with the idea? Well, he is alleged to know a little bit about stealing cars. (In his youth, Issa was accused of stealing cars not once, not twice, but thrice. He denies all three accusations.) The problem with Issa's candidacy is that few seem to be rallying around him, and there are a few dozen conservatives who won't accept anyone as speaker who doesn't agree to their unrealistic demands. Jason Chaffetz Chaffetz is the similarly showy successor to Issa atop the oversight committee. Notice something in common about the figures that rise to head that committee? A penchant for self-promoting theatrics is favored, which can get you attention but also annoy your colleagues. Issa trashed Chaffetz just Friday morning for not publishing any staff reports since becoming chairman, as if his own tenure was anything more than a four-year show trial. Chaffetz had intended to compete against McCarthy as a figure who could ""bridge the divide"" between warring Republican sects. No one seemed much interested in the premise of his candidacy at first, but now Chaffetz feels like it's his time to strike. The problem with Chaffetz's effort is that few seem to be rallying around him, and there are a few dozen conservatives who won't accept anyone as speaker who doesn't agree to their unrealistic demands. Newt Gingrich As every annoying D.C. pundit will tell you over and over again: Actually, the speaker doesn't have to be a member of the House. So why not a former speaker who led House Republicans to their first majority in 40 years? This is a half-joke, and it's only worth bringing up because Gingrich, with his supremely comical ego, is almost certainly thinking about it in the back--or front--of his mind. The McCarthy stunner produced any number of juicy quotes Thursday. None, however, topped this one from Gingrich: ""This is why George Washington came out of retirement--because there are moments you can't avoid."" The problem with Gingrich's candidacy is that ... there are no problems with this. Newt Gingrich should be the next speaker, just as a lesser historical figure--George Washington--would've wanted him to be. The moment chooses the man. Come to think of it, though, there are a few dozen conservatives who won't accept anyone as speaker who doesn't agree to their unrealistic demands. Lynn Westmoreland The former Republican leader of the House in Georgia, who's served in Congress since 2005, told the Daily Caller on Thursday that he would run for speaker. Leadership experience! Positions on several high-ranking committees! But would he pledge to default on the national debt unless President Obama agreed to repeal Obamacare or ban abortion or impeach himself? Probably not! So why are we even considering him! Trey Gowdy Republicans of all stripes admire the third-termer's work as chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi. Gowdy, however, has expressed zero interest in being speaker, majority leader, whip, or perhaps even a member of Congress. Daniel Webster No, not that Daniel Webster, who's been dead for more than 150 years. (Though death might not be a disqualifier, at this point.) That other Daniel Webster guy, the one from Florida. Webster was both speaker of the Florida House and majority leader of the Florida Senate, so he has the requisite legislative leadership credentials on the state level. But this is only his third term in Congress. Some would argue that's an asset--we need fresh faces to take on the fat cats in Washington, blah blah blah argle-bargle--but running the House of Representatives is an extremely hard job that requires an encyclopedic knowledge of procedure. The other problem with Webster's candidacy is that the few dozen conservative troublemakers actually do support him for speaker, which means that no barely sane person in the Congress or on planet Earth could support him, even if he ends up being the only acceptable option to the veto-holding minority of Republicans. Jeb Hensarling Conservatives love the Texas head of the House Financial Services Committee. Funny story, though: Hensarling would have to ask conservatives to vote for a debt ceiling increase, and then conservatives would not love him. They would hate him! You Are you a warm-bodied human? Or a cold-bodied lizard? Or anything? (It really doesn't matter at this point.) You might be the perfect candidate! It comes with a six-figure salary and quality health care/retirement benefits. They can probably even throw in a chauffeur and per diem for meals, booze, and cigarettes. Honestly, you have all the bargaining leverage, so take 'em to the cleaners. The only real job requirement at this point is that you have to pledge to immediately default on the national debt. Come on, how hard is that, Paul Ryan?"

""I had this terrible nightmare last night that I was trying to get out and I couldn't get out,"" Boehner recently told his ally, Rep. Tom Cole, according to the Hill. ""And a hand came reaching, pulling me."" Boehner, who scheduled his retirement for the end of October, had pledged to stay on until his successor was put in place. But after Rep. Kevin McCarthy's stunning decision to drop out of the speaker contest, Boehner may have to renew his D.C. lease indefinitely. McCarthy likely would have won the House Republican ""nomination"" for speaker in the conference's closed-door meeting Thursday. But that vote also would have meant nothing. He was reportedly concerned that he could not cobble together a 218-vote majority of the full House in the real election on the floor later this month. ""It's pretty obvious he didn't have 218 votes,"" Rep. Charlie Dent told reporters after the announcement. ""And had this gone to the floor, I think there was great concern that maybe he couldn't get 218 votes and it would have been obviously embarrassing to not be elected speaker."" As if the spectacle he put himself through Thursday wasn't embarrassing enough. Who now? The most obvious name at first was Rep. Paul Ryan: chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, 2012 vice presidential candidate, and author of the Obama-era conservative budget blueprints. So obvious was Ryan as a candidate for Great Unifier that he immediately had to put out a statement saying, Oh God, no, no, no, never, ever, ever. Boehner is reportedly still working desperately to get him to change his mind. But why would he want to leave his powerful committee chairmanship to take America's Worst Job? Since Democrats have decided to let Republicans resolve this leadership dispute by themselves--and are enjoying what they see--it's apparently going to take 218 out of 247 Republican votes to elect a speaker. That candidate, whoever he or she is, will need the support of the House Freedom Caucus and its few dozen members who vote as a bloc. Heading into Thursday's canceled vote, Freedom Caucus members had endorsed Rep. Daniel Webster--as a means of leverage. They claimed to be willing to vote for McCarthy on the floor if he would meet their demands, which included just about everything up to and including weekly foot rubs. Rep. Dave Brat, who defeated then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary and apparently feels it's his place to rule the country as a freshman backbencher, said the Freedom Caucus wants changes in ""rules, policy, process"" and wants that ""on paper ahead of time,"" the Washington Post reported Wednesday night. Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp ""said he asked McCarthy to make a public statement opposing efforts by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other establishment-oriented groups to oppose conservative Republican incumbents who have broken with GOP leadership,"" according to the Post. It takes some chutzpah for Tea Partiers--who live to bring down ""establishment"" candidates in primaries--to demand that they be shielded from counter-challenges themselves. And, perhaps most frightening of all for the global economy and those who rely on its continued functioning to ""live,"" they insist that the next speaker demand concessions in exchange for a hike in the debt ceiling. Credit McCarthy, at least, for stepping aside instead of making promises he couldn't keep. Jason Chaffetz, who had tried to position himself as the compromise candidate without generating much interest and is still in the race, would be in a similar bind. In fact, whoever wants to be speaker will have to make these same unacceptable promises. Unless Freedom Caucus members have a sudden change of heart and decide to become responsible adult legislators in the near future, there is no other way to 218 Republican votes. Either meet all of their demands--including a pledge to play chicken with the country's credit rating and the frail global economy--or don't bother running. A speaker candidate could try to cut a deal with House Democrats. But once word of that got out, it would be hard to imagine any Republican voting for the candidate who might work hand in hand with the nefarious Nancy Pelosi. In short: It's a super crappy situation in the House of Representatives right now. The only silver lining of McCarthy's collapse, and all the potential horror that goes with it, is that Boehner has proven himself to be literally irreplaceable as speaker. Boehner himself, who likely has dozens of tee times in the Bahamas reserved for November, can't be too thrilled with that. But if his service in Washington is extended through the early November debt-ceiling deadline, then he should call up a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase that takes the country through the 2016 election. What can the House Freedom Caucus do about that? It's not like they can replace him."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/is_donald_trump_going_to_run_out_of_money.html	"All signs point to the nation numbing to Donald Trump's shtick. His poll numbers are in a holding pattern and his favorability among Republicans is slipping. His pranks aren't as good as they used to be. He isn't tossing out entertainingly insane Trumpisms at the pace he used to--or if he is, fewer people are paying attention. ""Mr. Trump's ability to command both voter and news media attention simply by being his outlandish, bombastic self is starting to wane,"" the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The Times points to ebbing social media chatter about Trump's hijinks as well as a dip in mentions and appearances on conservative talk radio shows. Trump's campaign has lived off a strategy of constant free media exposure--something he earned, we should note, by expressing many ""newsworthy"" opinions that a not-insignificant number of human beings found oddly compelling in a presidential candidate. That's how he has been able to dominate the race after only spending a couple million dollars of his own money. The problem with Trump's strategy, though, is he's created exceedingly high expectations for himself: Unless he keeps upping the ante of bombast, he's going to see a cratering or even collapse in his media coverage. Few other humans on the planet understand how to manipulate the media better than Trump, and even he seems to be getting tired of himself. It's time for Trump 2.0: the stage in which he defines himself on his own terms, instead of performing whatever garish acts are necessary to maintain his outsized share of free media coverage. That means spending much more of his own money. And how much, really, is he good for? The Washington Post visited Trump Tower to listen to him outline the long-awaited ""second chapter"" of his bid, in which he moves ""toward a somewhat more traditional campaign."" That means spending money on advertisements and building an organization to get him on the ballot in all 50 states (""an arduous and time-consuming task that has caused some first-time candidates to stumble,"" the Post writes. Indeed.) He will also be releasing a book titled Crippled America, which he claims to be editing closely: ""I don't want to have a stupid statement in the book that people are going to say, 'Hey, why did he say that?'  "" Can you even imagine? Trump explains his allegedly ""more traditional"" second act in very first-act fashion. He has contracted a media firm that is ""new to politics"" to produce his television ads. The first warning sign about what to expect from such a firm is that it is ""Florida-based."" The second is that Trump himself ""has proposed several concepts for ads in the works."" He'd tell us all about them but that would spoil the surprise. All he would tell the Post is that they're going to be very classy, very beautiful ads: ""I have such a great concept--in fact, so good."" (Funnily, he's used this ""don't worry about it, I've got a plan"" message before, though usually for things slightly less frivolous.) Though Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, says that the campaign is willing to spend ""whatever it takes"" of Trump's personal fortune on campaign ads through the year--""considerably more than $20 million,"" per the Post--Trump himself has signaled unease with his pledge for costs to come entirely out of his yooge personal resources. That pledge, however, has been a yooge part of his appeal. He said that he would spend $100 million to capture the nomination but backed off of his plan to spend $1 billion to win the presidency. Instead, according to a Times interview in September, he would ""count on the national Republican Party for financial help if he became the nominee."" The RNC has pledged $23 million in hard cash to the nominee. That's not going to cut it in a modern presidential race. It's expected that the campaign and groups supporting the nominee will spend billions--for each nominee. (Besides, does he think that the national Republican Party's money doesn't come from nefarious special interests that expect favors in return?) That would leave Trump with a difficult choice should he make it into the general election: Does he back off of his politically potent message not to accept large, corrupting contributions, or does he eat away at--and through--his liquid assets? Depending on whom you ask, Trump's liquid assets range from about $70 million to about $350 million. That presents enough trouble to meet even the $100 million figure he's willing to commit for the primary (which he fantastically claims he will take to a convention floor fight). Whether the figure exceeds his available cash or is ""only"" one-third of it, that's a serious amount of money with which to part ways. And it's nowhere near what he'd need, either for his campaign or in terms of outside commitments, for a general election. Setting up a campaign infrastructure and a media strategy on your own terms, in which you, the candidate, are allowed to dictate how you present yourself to the public, is expensive. This is why few politicians, even wealthy ones, say outright that they'll never accept large contributions. Donald Trump did. As with most things Trump, this was an extension of his central message: that he is an extraordinarily rich person. He wouldn't take donations because he wouldn't need to. According to him, the ""conservative"" estimate of his wealth is more than $10 BILLION. The more realistic estimate of Trump's wealth, in Trump's mind, is infinity dollars. At his rallies, Trump has regaled crowds with stories about how he is turning down million-dollar donations from his rich friends. Late in the summer, he began asking crowds if he was stupid for doing so. Would they really be upset with him if he just took the money? If he wants to run his ""more traditional"" second act without eating deep into his own assets, he will need to start accepting large donations. And then what's the point?"

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/joe_biden_needs_to_answer_this_question_if_he_s_going_to_run_for_president.html	"Joe Biden is expected to announce whether he is running for president any day now. If he does decide to jump in the race, there will be one critical question for which he doesn't quite have an answer: Why are you running? Right now, there are many reasons and no reason at all: He has always wanted to run (and has run unsuccessfully twice). His son Beau, as he was dying, encouraged him to run. Hillary Clinton is not doing well, and some in the Democratic Party think he is a better general election alternative. He's not yet ready to see the end of a long career. He connects well with middle-class voters. He has experience. All true, but none of that really answers the big ""why are you running"" question--at least in the way that question has been framed so far in this Democratic contest. In all of the speculation about the vice president's campaign, that basic question hasn't been talked about much. While it might seem premature to require a reason for a Biden candidacy that doesn't yet exist, Clinton's lack of a reason was cited again and again in early 2015 coverage of her not yet announced campaign before she entered the race in April. Sure, she had lots of advantages--the historical nature of running to be the first female president, organization, huge affection from grassroots voters--but what was her message? It continues to be Clinton's problem, say some Democratic strategists, like David Axelrod, that she is not communicating a central rationale for her campaign. But if this is her problem, why is Joe Biden the answer? By the standard used to judge Clinton's ""why"" answer, Biden would seem to be just as vulnerable. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders, the candidate with the energy and passion of the party base, actually has an easily discernible message--he's running against the moneyed interests who always seem to come out on top in politics and the economy. So if the Clinton critics are looking for a candidate who can answer the ""why"" question quickly, that candidate is already in the race. Still, it's not that there aren't arguments for a Biden candidacy. He's experienced. He's cautious about using military force in a time when that's seen as wisdom rather than weakness. He's authentic. He's suggested that running essentially for a third Obama term would be a smart idea. But do any of these reasons immediately explain why he should run? If he does run, he'll quickly have to explain to Democrats his position on President Obama's Pacific trade deal, which will get sticky very fast. He'll also be challenged on his record on crime and police reform, an area that has become more important to his party in recent years. One of the reasons Biden hasn't had to face the hard ""why"" question the same way Clinton did is that she was only really running against herself when she got into the race. Sanders was in the race, but many of us didn't take him seriously as a threat to a Clinton candidacy at the time. Biden, meanwhile, is being compared with an alternative: Hillary Clinton. (He has often said, ""Don't compare me to the almighty; compare me to the alternative."") To the extent that there is support for Biden's candidacy, it's because right now he's being judged against a candidate who has spent her summer on the defensive answering questions about her email. Yet, there is one unmistakable theme at the heart of the Draft Biden movement. In an ad released on Wednesday, the Draft Joe forces play excerpts of his emotional commencement speech at Yale earlier this year in which he talks about the redemption he found after the death of his wife and daughter. It is a powerful speech and sends a historically powerful message: Biden has character. According to this argument, his life story testifies that he is made of strong stuff, and that is reason enough to trust him with the presidency. This has been a good enough reason to elect presidents for much of American history. The people ""have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge--I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers,"" said our second president, John Adams. Character has been such an important element of presidential elections historically that a PBS series on the presidency was called Character Above All. This idea of character has gotten muddied over the years. Democrats in the 1970s and '80s wanted character tests because they thought it would help avoid presidents like Richard Nixon. That was the message of the Carter campaign. ""I will never lie to you,"" Jimmy Carter boasted on the stump. But then character came to mean the kinds of personal inquiries that undid Gary Hart in 1988, along with the attacks George H.W. Bush made against Bill Clinton in 1992 and his son George W. Bush made against Al Gore in 2000, linking him to Clinton. Democrats have since turned against using the fuzzy concept of character as a test for candidate fitness. But if Joe Biden runs, it will be a character campaign against Hillary Clinton. That doesn't mean there won't be specifics discussed about wages and health care and the U.S. role overseas. But at its heart what will have gotten Biden in the race and what will animate it will be character--both his own and the perception that Clinton's isn't strong. This is not an unalloyed good for Biden. The message of his Yale speech--that even under the worst circumstances, you can do good things--is powerful enough to change a person's life when it's heard in one context. But as a campaign ad, it flirts with appearing to exploit for political opportunity all that is sacred and powerful in Biden's life example. A political campaign should not be a public catharsis for loss. That's the last thing Biden would want, but such an ad or even well-meaning supporters' use of your life story might send such a message. It's what can happen when there's no clear reason for why a candidate is running. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/marco_rubio_and_jeb_are_both_george_w_bush_republicans.html	"The leading establishment candidates for the Republican presidential nomination--Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush--are eager to break from the GOP of the past. Rubio bills himself as a candidate of the future who applies ""free enterprise and limited government"" to the ""unique challenges of the 21st century."" Bush is eager to tell you he's his ""own man,"" with his own ideas about the country's future. Rubio is young and Bush is distinct from his family, but those are truisms; individuals are, well, individuals. In terms of politics, however, neither Bush nor Rubio is unique. In fact, they come from a specific GOP tradition--they are both George W. Bush Republicans. What this means is straightforward: They primarily represent the affluent donor base of the GOP, but bundle those interests--broad tax cuts and privatization in particular--with a few policies that benefit more modest families. You see this with their economic plans. In the 2000 election, George W. Bush bridged the divide between the Republican donor class and ordinary voters with a massive upper-income tax cut, sold as middle-class tax relief. The Bush plan also had a large child tax credit and gave a break to married couples. It was, his campaign argued, a tax plan for everyone. ""High-income people would pay a bigger proportion of the tax bill after the Bush tax cuts than before them,"" said his head economic advisor. This was only true in the axiomatic sense that wealthy people pay more taxes than poorer ones. In terms of value, however, the vast bulk of the worth of Bush's tax cuts would eventually go to the highest earners. This is the Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush tax approach, full stop. On the more populist side, Rubio would create a new child tax credit, Bush would ""nearly double"" the standard deduction, and both would expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. Both would reduce deductions and other tax subsidies for high-income families, and both would reduce rates for low- and middle-income Americans. But most of the Bush and Rubio tax cuts would go to the wealthiest Americans, from the huge rate cuts for high-income earners and an end to the estate tax, to slashing corporate tax rates and--in the Rubio plan--ending taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest. You also see George W. Bush's influence on immigration, a key priority for business conservatives. Going against a part of his base, the older Bush brother made a failed push for comprehensive immigration reform in his second term in office. Before that, he used a friendly message, sustained outreach, and visible diversity in his administration to build ground with Latino voters. Contrary to exit polls, Bush probably didn't win 44 percent of Latino voters in the 2004 election. But he certainly broke the 30 percent mark in 2000 and 2004, outperforming every Republican in recent memory. Indeed, Bush--who also made modest inroads with black and Asian American voters--is the only Republican since his dad did it in 1988 to capture 50 percent or more of the national vote. Both Rubio and Jeb Bush have learned the lesson. Grassroots backlash to previous legislation means neither candidate supports comprehensive immigration reform. And Rubio, in particular, has been vague about his immigration plans, given his role in trying to pass the 2013 ""Gang of Eight"" bill, which was maligned by conservatives as ""amnesty."" But they've balanced this with compassionate rhetoric and cultural affinity. Both Rubio and Bush speak fluent Spanish, deal directly with Spanish-language media, and defend immigrants in the face of attacks from restrictionist candidates like Donald Trump. Compared to Hillary Clinton, neither Bush nor Rubio is especially liked among Hispanic voters. But compared to other Republicans, they're incredibly popular: Bush has a net 11 point favorable score, while Rubio has a net 5 point score. (Clinton has a net 40 point score.) There are other areas where George W. Bush looms large in the campaigns of Jeb and Rubio. Both embrace the Bush legacy in foreign policy. Jeb wants to return to his brother's second-term strategy for Iraq and the Middle East, ignoring actual facts around the ""surge"" and the rise of ISIS. Rubio, meanwhile, has embraced the bellicose neoconservatism of George W. Bush's first term, announcing with his campaign launch that ""nothing matters if we aren't safe."" Both men reject international deal-making and oppose Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran, adopting W's aggressive (and ineffective) stance toward the Iranian regime. There's an obvious problem with George W's influence on Jeb and Rubio: He's unpopular. President Bush left office maligned for two failed wars and a massive recession. His disasters gave Democrats control of Congress, and helped elect Barack Obama to the presidency. Arguably, Bush--and the Democratic waves that marked his final years in office--is the reason we have the Affordable Care Act, the most consequential piece of liberal social legislation since the Great Society. But the GOP's most viable establishment candidates have no choice but to adopt the legacy of George W. Bush. He is the most successful Republican politician since his father and he built a conservative model for winning national elections in a diverse electorate. And he's still popular with GOP voters; it's why he might come to campaign for his brother in South Carolina and other vital states in the Republican contest. But President Bush doesn't have to wade into campaigning to play a part in the primary. If either Jeb or Rubio wins the nomination, he'll be there, a silent reference point for any Republican administration in 2017. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/were_the_oregon_shooting_victims_christian_martyrs.html	"One of the most shocking details from last week's shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon was that gunman Chris Harper-Mercer reportedly singled out people who said they were Christian. If his victims were killed because of their religious identities that would make them martyrs, and some are already eagerly claiming them as such. On Friday, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson posted a photo online of himself holding a sign reading ""I am a Christian"" and urged supporters to use the slogan in their Twitter profile pictures ""to honor the victims and their families."" Commentator Todd Starnes, the inventor of the War on Christmas, concluded that the ""martyred"" victims' ""families can take comfort in knowing that after they took their last breath on Earth, they took their first breath in Heaven."" Tennessee's lieutenant governor even called on ""Christians who are serious about their faith"" to acquire handgun carry permits in response to the shooting: ""Our enemies are armed. We must do likewise."" While we don't yet know what happened, those seizing onto this as a story of true-life American heroism would do well to remember a previous account from a mass shooting: a martyrdom story that was inspiring, wildly popular, and false. That myth, born out of the initial frenzied reports in the aftermath of the Columbine shooting, has persisted to this day, which is a good enough reason to urge cautious skepticism in this case. There are other good reasons to take things a bit more slowly too. Critically, the most alarming claims about the shooter targeting Christians were made by people who were not at the scene. Stacy Boylan, whose daughter was wounded, told CNN: ""[Harper-Mercer started] asking people one by one what their religion was. 'Are you a Christian?' he would ask them, and if you're a Christian stand up. And they would stand up and he said, 'Good, because you're a Christian, you are going to see God in just about one second.' And then he shot and killed them."" Someone gave a similar account to NBC, saying that she was relaying a sibling's eyewitness statement. A Twitter user who said her grandmother had been in the room shared a similar story online: These dramatic preliminary secondhand accounts are reminiscent of the early reporting around a similar incident said to happen during the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in Colorado. The initial account then was this: In the Columbine library, one of the killers held a gun to the head of a 17-year-old girl named Cassie Bernall and asked if she believed in God. She said yes, and he shot and killed her. Bernall became an instant martyr, and an icon to many American Christians. She inspired sermons, prayer services, and songs, including the Christian pop star Michael W. Smith's ""This Is Your Time."" At her funeral, which attracted strangers from all across the country, her pastor proclaimed she was ""in the martyrs' hall of fame."" Bernall's mother wrote a best-selling book, She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall. But Bernall's martyrdom turned out to be untrue. The story originated with a boy who had misinterpreted an exchange between shooter Dylan Klebold and another girl, Valeen Schnurr. That student professed her belief in God after being shot, and she survived. But she also found that her story was often doubted by Bernall's acolytes. ""People thought I was a copycat,"" she told Hanna Rosin in the Washington Post that fall. ""They thought I was just following the bandwagon. A lot of people just didn't believe my story. And you know, it gets frustrating. Because you know in your heart where you were and what you said, and then people doubt you. And that's what bothers me the most."" Sixteen years later, however, the Bernall myth has proven persistent. Writer Dave Cullen, who debunked it just months after the Columbine shooting, revisited it a few weeks ago when Rick Santorum referenced it (incorrectly) in a Republican debate. Cullen wrote that ""too many people had found too much value--spiritually or financially--in the myth to simply let it die."" It has been days now since the stories suggesting martyrdom in Roseburg, Oregon, were shared with the media, and there still have been no eyewitness anecdotes backing up the most dramatic detail: that Harper-Mercer not only asked victims if they were Christians but responded differently to people who said they were. It's true that an online profile listed him belonging to a group called ""Doesn't Like Organized Religion"" and that there are firsthand eyewitness accounts that he did ask about religion. But common sense alone is enough to raise an eyebrow at the narrative as it's been described. It would take a truly extraordinary person to say ""yes"" after seeing a shooter respond like this once, and the implication that multiple martyrs gave their lives in this way seems unlikely to say the least. More importantly, the eyewitnesses who have spoken to the press tell a more subtle and plausible story of a gunman who spoke with general hostility about Christianity but did not use it as a litmus test. Kortney Moore, an 18-year-old student who was at the school and said she saw her writing teacher get shot in the head, told the local newspaper that Harper-Mercer told people to get down on the ground and then to stand up and state their religion. But she didn't say he was choosing victims based on their answers. Another account from a witness specifically denies that Harper-Mercer was targeting Christians. ""Obviously he was asking what religion, but he wasn't really just targeting. He was kind of just saying, 'Oh, since you have a God, you'll be joining him in a little bit,' "" student Rand McGowan told the New York Daily News. ""It wasn't really like, 'I'm targeting you and I'm going to kill you.' "" It's easy to be cynical about the eagerness of some members of a majority culture to latch onto rare stories of persecution within their own country. And it's proper to be cynical about politicians and columnists who do so, sometimes without the evidence to back up their assertions (see Santorum's description of the racially motivated Charleston, South Carolina, church attack as an ""assault on our religious liberty""). But a more generous interpretation is that reading Christian martyrdom into mass shootings is a way of making sense out of the senseless, transforming the tragic into something purposeful and inspiring. ""I just thank God she died that way,"" one of Cassie Bernall's friends from Bible study said soon after her death. Turning victims into heroic players in a larger drama about good versus evil gives meaning to their deaths. The larger truth, no matter what happened last week in Oregon, is much bleaker: They were victims of yet another in a long string of pointless and needless American massacres.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/jason_chaffetz_runs_for_house_speaker_is_already_over_promising.html	"Rep. Kevin McCarthy's ascent to speaker of the House is no longer the cinch that it was supposed to be just one week ago. His admission that the Select Committee on Benghazi has been a successful political enterprise against Hillary Clinton was viewed as an amateurish red flag. He remains the favorite, but his display of public-relations weakness has at least opened the door for a relatively legitimate challenger. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah representative elected in 2008 who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, formally announced his bid to replace Speaker John Boehner on Sunday. Chaffetz is a character, as you might have guessed by his seemingly spontaneous decision to launch a late-stage campaign for the third most senior position in American government. He embodies an unorthodox blend of the hard right and ""establishment"" elements of the House GOP--a biography, he argues, that would make him a strong choice to ""bridge the divide"" between warring intraconference factions. A proto-Tea Partier, Chaffetz won the Republican nomination for his House seat in 2008 by running to the right of an entrenched incumbent. He came to Washington pledging to sleep on a cot in his office, a stunt that numerous freshmen would emulate following the 2010 Tea Party wave election. He loves talking to the media (though, as of publication, his office did not respond to Slate's request for an interview) and hauling enemies of the conservative movement before his committee for confrontational theatrics. (See last week's Planned Parenthood hearing for just one dramatic, recent example.) But the very fact that Chaffetz was handed the chair of such a powerful committee after a modest six years in the House tells you something about his other, more careerist side. Chaffetz, a converted Mormon and consistent supporter of Mitt Romney's real and imagined presidential campaigns, has some leanings that could be considered not hard-line enough for true Tea Partiers. He is viewed on the right as dangerously amnesty-curious, and he never participated in previous failed efforts to oust Boehner. His greatest heresy in the eyes of conservatives was when he stripped Rep. Mark Meadows of a subcommittee chairmanship earlier this year in a leadership crackdown on caucus rebels that clearly did not work. Though the House leadership returned Meadows his chairmanship several days later, the punitive move was enough for Meadows to start plotting Boehner's ouster from the chair. Boehner ended up ousting himself before allowing the insurgents the satisfaction. Chaffetz is the House Republican mullet: establishment in the front, Tea Party in the back. But how would he resolve the basic vote-counting problems over essential funding bills that have plagued Boehner's term and, according to Chaffetz, would plague McCarthy's as well? Host Chris Wallace asked him about this on this week's Fox News Sunday. Chaffetz--like McCarthy, like Boehner, like any human put in the job of House speaker right now--had no reasonable response, and thus could only speak in repetitive vagaries. Consider the following exchange:"	This Surprise Candidate for Speaker Says He Can Unite the GOP Caucus. Fat Chance.	['Chaffetz', 'Clinton', 'Meadows']	[]
10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/jeb_bush_sinks_to_4_percent_thanks_to_donald_trump.html	"It's a funny story. It was just Wednesday when Jeb Bush began needling his prized mentee and current rival, Sen. Marco Rubio, as an inexperienced and untested wild card in the vein of Barack Obama. Bush argued that he, by contrast, was a ""proven leader"" given his record as governor of Florida. Twenty-four hours later and one of the nation's most esteemed pollsters has released an exhausting survey showing that such a message means precisely bupkis to Republican primary voters. A Pew Research Center poll finds that ""by more than two-to-one (65% to 29%), Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say it is more important that a candidate have new ideas than 'experience and a proven record.' "" It was not always this way. When Pew asked the question in March, the figures were nearly reversed, with GOP voters preferring ""experience and a proven record over new ideas, 57% to 36%."" It looks an awful lot like these opinions about what voters ""want"" in a candidate are secondary indicators of the specific candidates to whom voters have taken a fancy. Back in March, when Republican voters were allegedly all interested in experience and proven records, a certain enigmatic New York real estate/reality TV celebrity was not expected to run for president. Donald Trump announced in June, started spewing all sorts of tragicomical demagoguery (""new ideas""), and suddenly a great mass of voters determined that perhaps they like ""new ideas"" from a first-time politician more than experience. Trump leads Pew's candidate preference poll with 25 percent. Ben Carson, who also lacks political experience or a governing track record, is second in the poll with 16 percent. Trump's margin is further evidence that the dip he saw following the second Republican debate was no free fall, as the people who run the Republican Party were hoping and praying it would be. He's settled into a comfortable groove in the low-to-mid-20s. And, yes, Trump captures the support of one-third of that 65 percent of Republican voters who prefer ""new ideas"" to experience. Among that group, Carson is second with 18 percent and Rubio is third with 9 percent. Bush has 2 percent, putting him even with also-ran Rand Paul. As you'll almost certainly read on Trump's Twitter feed or hear in Trump's constant cable news hits over the next week, Bush's top-line poll number is a horrific 4 percent in the Pew survey. This appears to be an all-time low for him and--as Trump would say--frankly, it's just terrible news. His donors are already hollering at him to step it up or risk mass defections among the party elite. Dropping to 4 percent in a Pew poll is not a step up. Rubio clocks in at a modest 8 percent, but at least he's moving in the right direction. And Rubio doesn't put his foot in his mouth every other minute, offering tin-eared responses to horrific gun violence or insulting an entire demographic of voters, unlike a certain mentor of his. It's hard to conceive of ""Donald Trump"" at this point as anything other than a 69-year con created by God for the strict purpose of stopping a third Bush from becoming president. Trump doesn't have to win the nomination to execute this trick; he's done enough already by changing the contours of what Republicans want on a fundamental level. The Bush campaign came into the election knowing that it would have to address concerns about dynasty and being considered a member of the establishment. It likely didn't expect a bombastic (to put it generously) figure like Trump to come along and seize polling front-runner status by amplifying these weaknesses through gaudy but attention-grabbing performance art. Once people get it in their heads that they'd prefer something new and fresh over something older and experienced, it's difficult to change their minds back. Trump has essentially grabbed the primary electorate by the shoulders, shaken it, and said, Really? You want to consider Jeb Bush? Come to think of it, they really don't."

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/conservatives_are_blaming_gun_free_zones_for_the_roseberg_massacre_seriously.html	"President Obama's speech following Thursday's mass shooting at an Oregon community college was the most dumbfounded of his presidency. Over 12 minutes, he surveyed America's absurd gun politics--in which an outspoken minority always gets its way over a numbed majority--and asked, exasperated: What the hell? The president seemed grimly fascinated by how rote the process has become. He talked about how, ""Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, 'The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws--even in the face of repeated mass killings.' "" He added--almost with a touch of dark humor--that ""later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day!"" He continued: ""Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this."" Also routine, he acknowledged, was how rapidly the response from gun control critics would be. ""Right now,"" he noted, ""I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they'll argue. Fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?"" Indeed, many do. The press releases Obama predicted required a bit more time, but the tweets did not. Here was Rep. Jeff Duncan, a Tea Partier from South Carolina, feeling comfortable enough not just to make the argument, but to do so with sarcasm and emojis. Conservative personalities and gun activists echoed Duncan's sentiments. It did not take long for them to pin the blame on ""gun-free zones""--the worst of liberal do-gooders' awful deeds--regardless of whether the Umpqua Community College campus was one such zone (it wasn't). Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee quickly jumped on board that narrative: The polling on gun laws is more mixed than either side of the debate would care to admit. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in July and reported in the Hill found that 88 percent of Americans ""favor expanding background checks, up slightly from the 81 percent of Americans who supported the measure in May 2013."" The poll also found, though, that the public is largely polarized--and talking past one another, really--on the more fundamental views of gun ownership. ""Currently, 50% say it is more important to control gun ownership, while 47% say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns,"" Pew wrote. A 2014 Pew survey showed that more and more people are buying into the argument that more gun ownership is necessary to protect safety, too. ""Nearly six-in-ten Americans (57%) say gun ownership does more to protect people from becoming victims of crime,"" Pew found, ""while 38% say it does more to endanger personal safety. In the days after Newtown, 48% said guns do more to protect people and 37% said they placed people at risk."" The percentage of Republicans who said ""gun ownership does more to protect people from becoming victims of crime"" jumped from 63 to 80 percent between December 2012 and December 2014. These views aren't necessarily in conflict. One might believe that more stringent federal background checks and other precautionary measures should be enacted to prevent the mentally ill from obtaining firearms while, at the same time, the rights of ""everyone else"" should remain unfettered. That may constitute a majority position that President Obama could work to push incremental change. But it's a passive majority relative to the very vocal minority of gun rights activists who see any new gun control legislation as a slippery slope toward confiscation. In our system of government, with its many veto points, a vocal minority will always beat a passive majority. Only a very small percentage of Americans consider gun control a major priority when considering how they'll vote. The people who do strongly factor guns into their calculations are those who fear the government taking their guns away. When gun-control legislation is introduced on the federal level, gun rights activists, and organizations like the National Rifle Association, successfully mobilize to pressure lawmakers into stopping it. President Obama acknowledged the vocal minority's upper-hand advantage during his speech. He explained that a ""change of politics"" is needed on this issue: ""It will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision."" In other words: The passive majority needs to become the vocal majority. Those who support modest, ""common-sense"" gun control need to make that position top priority, right up there with jobs and the economy. Obama would be among the first to acknowledge that this won't be easy. But with our clunky system of government, where enacting even the most modest of changes on anything is a Herculean effort, it's the only way. See more of Slate's coverage of the Oregon shooting.

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/the_gop_s_argument_for_defunding_planned_parenthood_makes_no_sense.html	"On Tuesday, Republican members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee lambasted Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, for five hours. From watching the hearing, I learned three things. One, Richards makes more than $500,000 a year. Two, it's not enough. For taking that kind of abuse, she should be paid more. Three, the GOP's arguments for defunding Planned Parenthood are incoherent. They cancel each other out. Pick them apart, and you'll see what the party really thinks: that no organization involved in abortions should get public funds for anything it does. Republicans are mounting a boycott, using your tax money and the threat of a government shutdown, to force medical providers to stop offering abortions. To understand what's fishy about the GOP's arguments, you have to understand two things about Planned Parenthood. First, most of what it does isn't abortion. Its affiliates provide about 10 million services a year: 4.4 million tests and treatments related to sexually transmitted diseases, 3.5 million birth-control services, 1 million pregnancy tests, 500,000 breast exams, 378,000 pap tests, and 327,000 abortions. That makes abortions about 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's work (though a bigger share of its revenue, since abortions are relatively expensive). Second, more than 80 percent of the money Planned Parenthood gets from the federal government is Medicaid reimbursement. It isn't assigned to Planned Parenthood up front. It's paid as compensation to clinics for services they've delivered to people covered by Medicaid. If those people choose other doctors or clinics, Planned Parenthood doesn't get paid. Throughout the hearing, Republicans complained that Planned Parenthood gets too much of its revenue from the federal government. Several members of the committee--Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, and John Mica of Florida--protested that taxpayers were supplying more than 40 percent of Planned Parenthood's income. Duncan fumed that the Boys and Girls Club gets only a fraction of what Planned Parenthood receives. Mica explained the GOP's underlying beef: Many Americans, including some who are pro-choice, don't want their tax money used for abortions. As an argument for defunding Planned Parenthood, this complaint makes no sense. Richards explained to the committee that under U.S. law, federal funds can't be used for abortions unless the pregnancy threatens the woman's life or was caused by rape or incest. So if Planned Parenthood is getting a high percentage of its income from the government, that means much of the work it's being paid for isn't abortion. Even after hours of interrogation and explanation, the Republicans couldn't get this through their heads. While railing against federal ""subsidies"" for Planned Parenthood (which pay for non-abortion services), they simultaneously protested that the organization drew too much of its income from abortion. Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina used a projector slide to show that at one Planned Parenthood affiliate, abortions brought in 28 percent of revenue. Rep. Steve Russell of Oklahoma, using wildly inflated numbers (he calculated each abortion at $1,500), suggested that abortion might represent 42 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenue. Several members of the committee, including the chairman, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, noted with disapproval that Planned Parenthood's non-abortion services--pap tests, breast exams, prenatal care--had declined in recent years. Richards tried to explain the declines. Pap tests, she said, were down because new federal guidelines say they're not necessary every year. At some clinics, birth control visits declined because women can now get six-month prescriptions or long-acting reversible contraceptives. Several members of the committee chastised Planned Parenthood for not offering mammograms. Richards replied that her clinics, like general practitioners, do preliminary breast exams but refer women to specialists for mammograms. At no point did the Republicans recognize that excluding Planned Parenthood from Medicaid eligibility, as they've proposed in a bill that just passed the House, would exacerbate these trends. If Medicaid doesn't reimburse Planned Parenthood for Pap tests and breast exams, Planned Parenthood is that much less likely to offer them. At the hearing, Lummis challenged Richards to explain why abortions comprised ""over 86 percent of your nongovernment revenue."" Richards patiently explained that the statistic was a truism: If Medicaid covers almost every health service except abortion, then almost all of Planned Parenthood's ""nongovernment revenue"" will come from abortions. And if you cut off all the government revenue, as Republicans are proposing, you leave Planned Parenthood with only one procedure that can pay the bills. One of the day's angriest speeches came from Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, who recently boycotted Pope Francis' speech to Congress on the grounds that the pope is too liberal. Gosar, a former dentist, agreed with Richards that as a health care provider, ""you're lucky if you get reimbursed your costs"" under Medicaid. He criticized the declines in Planned Parenthood's preventive services, described abortion as the organization's ""profit center,"" and accused Richards of ""narrowing"" Planned Parenthood's work ""so that you're profiting off death."" But if you really believe that's what Richards has done, how would excluding Planned Parenthood from Medicaid make things better? Wouldn't the more logical response be to raise the reimbursement level for non-abortion services? The committee's Republicans repeated this fallacy as they made their case for federally approved ""community health centers."" They said CHCs are better than Planned Parenthood clinics because these centers are more numerous and offer more services. Rep. Diane Black of Tennessee, the sponsor of House-passed legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, proudly told Richards that her bill ""redirects those federal dollars to clinics that offer more preventative health care than Planned Parenthood."" But if CHCs really are better than Planned Parenthood, you don't need Big Brother to redirect federal money. Women will choose the best providers, and Medicaid reimbursements will follow. Why don't Republicans recognize the tradeoff between Planned Parenthood's reliance on federal funding, which pays for non-abortion services, and Planned Parenthood's reliance on abortion income? To some extent, it's because they don't believe the restrictions on federal money will be honored. They worry that, as Lummis put it to Richards, ""taxpayer dollars are being used to free up services that you provide that are abhorrent."" The more money Planned Parenthood receives from the government for non-abortion services, the more money it can allot from its private fundraising to abortions. Another committee member, Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas, expressed the same worry about federal funds: ""Even though not directly spent, they help facilitate [abortion], and that's one of the reasons I support defunding."" That's a legitimate concern. But if you defund Planned Parenthood on this basis, then what you're really saying is that no organization that performs abortions can receive public funds. In theory, every dollar is fungible. No matter how carefully you separate the accounting, aid to Israel can help it build settlements in the West Bank, and tax breaks for churches can free up their other funds to support antigay conversion therapy. To prevent that kind of shuffling, you'd have to bar the government from paying for anything. But that's where the GOP is taking us. At the hearing, Russell said Planned Parenthood should be defunded because every abortion kills a child. Black, the sponsor of the House defunding bill, declared that ""abortion is not health care"" and urged Richards to ""temporarily discontinue your abortion services""--all abortions, not just late-term abortions or fetal tissue donations--in order to appease Congress. If Republicans win, the new federal policy will be that you can offer abortions, or you can do business with the government, but you can't do both."

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/elizabeth_warren_s_black_lives_matter_speech_was_the_best_one_yet_it_s_still.html	"Elizabeth Warren isn't running for president, but she can still make a splash. On Sunday, it was with a full-throated speech on racial inequality and police violence, seemingly aimed at Black Lives Matter and its supporters. Structured around three kinds of discrimination--economic, policing, and voting--Warren gave a capsule history of black American civil rights struggles and emphasized the degree to which they're unfinished. ""We must be honest,"" she said. ""Fifty years after John Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. spoke out, violence against African Americans has not disappeared."" In doing so, Warren used the language of the movement (""hands up, don't shoot""), praised it as a ""new generation of civil rights leaders,"" and staked herself to its policy goals. ""Policing must become a truly community endeavor,"" said Warren, echoing the Campaign Zero proposal pushed by one group of Black Lives Matter activists that would seek to reform police practices. ""Police forces should look like, and come from, the neighborhoods they serve,"" she said. ""All police forces--not just some--must be trained to de-escalate and to avoid the likelihood of violence. Body cameras can help us know what happens when someone is hurt."" Later in the speech, Warren called for a ""restoration"" of the Voting Rights Act and updated rules around voting, including automatic registration, a national voting holiday, and an end to felon disenfranchisement. She ended the speech on a familiar note. ""We need less talk and more action about reducing unemployment, ending wage stagnation, and closing the income gap between white and nonwhite workers,"" she said. ""And one more issue, dear to my heart: It's time to come down hard on predatory practices that allow financial institutions to systematically strip wealth out of communities of color."" For all the clarity and force of Warren's speech, one thing stands out: the extent to which her ideas and emphasis are now mainstream, at least for Democrats. We're accustomed to seeing Warren as a left-wing leader in the Democratic Party, but here, she's echoing the consensus. Since the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri--after the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown following a confrontation with police officer Darren Wilson--prominent Democrats have voiced sympathy and support for the movement of young black activists that emerged out of the protests. ""We cannot ignore the inequities that persist in our justice system,"" said Hillary Clinton in the weeks after Ferguson. ""Imagine what we would feel and what we would do if white drivers were three times as likely to be searched by police during a traffic stop as black drivers instead of the other way around."" Clinton returned to this territory again this year, as an official presidential candidate, with speeches on criminal justice and voting rights. ""We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America,"" she said in an April address on prison reform. ""There is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes."" Likewise, in a speech at Texas Southern University in Houston, she called for expanding voting rights. ""I believe every citizen has the right to vote. And I believe we should do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to vote."" But Clinton, the front-runner in the Democratic primary, wasn't alone in aligning herself on the side of activists. After protesters confronted presidential candidates Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders on criminal justice this summer, they responded with ambitious plans on reforming the prison system and improving policing. Sanders went further, releasing a broad blueprint for ""racial justice"" that tries to address ""physical violence"" against black Americans as well as political disenfranchisement and ""economic violence."" ""Communities of color also face the violence of economic deprivation,"" Sanders says in a post on his website. ""Let's be frank: neighborhoods like those in west Baltimore, where Freddie Gray resided, suffer the most."" For many Americans, this rhetoric might be seen as divisive. For Democrats, however, it makes sense. Without the support of black voters, the party can't hold the White House and loses its shot at reclaiming the Senate. By embracing criminal justice reform--which, thanks to public apathy, is newly ""safe"" for all politicians to touch--Democrats can build concrete ties with black communities and leaders who want clear commitments from the party. What's more, with violent crime on the decline, this rhetoric doesn't fracture bonds with Democratic voters who tend to support ""tough-on-crime"" stances, from suburban whites to many black Americans. What does it mean for Democrats to have a consensus? The short answer is that, if elected president, a Democrat will pursue appointments, policies, and regulations to achieve criminal justice reform. President Bernie Sanders won't just nominate anyone for attorney general--he'll find someone with an interest and expertise in civil rights. Likewise, he'll likely strengthen--or at least maintain--the civil rights division of the Justice Department and put racial justice on the agenda for relevant federal agencies. With that said, Democrats and Black Lives Matter still aren't fully simpatico on racial inequality. In her speech, Warren went beyond criminal justice and voting rights--places of broad agreement among liberals and the public--to attack the racist housing policies that sustained segregation through the 20th century, and continue to shape present patterns and outcomes: The 2008 housing collapse destroyed trillions in family wealth across the country, but the crash hit African Americans like a punch in the gut. Because middle-class black families' wealth was disproportionately tied up in homeownership and not other forms of savings, these families were hit harder by the housing collapse. But they also got hit harder because of discriminatory lending practices--yes, discriminatory lending practices in the 21st century. ""Entire legal structures were created to prevent African Americans from building economic security through home ownership,"" continued Warren. ""Legally enforced segregation. Restrictive deeds. Redlining. Land contracts. Coming out of the Great Depression, America built a middle class, but systematic discrimination kept most African American families from being part of it."" All of this is true, and in sketching this history, Warren goes far further than most politicians. Her solutions, however, fall short. ""We need less talk and more action about reducing unemployment, ending wage stagnation, and closing the income gap between white and nonwhite workers,"" she says. For Democrats, these are valuable policies. But they're not enough to reduce segregation or help black Americans build wealth--not just increase income. That needs more work at all levels of government, and modest efforts aside, it's not clear the Democratic Party is up to the task. Most Americans want equality under the law. But not everyone wants integration, or even a world where segregation is discouraged. Even liberal Americans--like these affluent Brooklyn residents who oppose new school zoning--can take a sharp reactionary turn when it's time to integrate their schools and neighborhoods. Democrats want to reduce racial inequality, but they also want to win elections. Despite real progress, those goals are still in conflict."

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/martin_o_malley_jim_webb_and_lincoln_chaffee_s_first_democratic_debate_how.html	"LAS VEGAS--Donald Trump has changed a great many things about the way presidential primaries are supposed to work. Most obviously, he isn't supposed to still be around right now. He's also skewed people's expectations of what's supposed to happen in a first presidential debate. Typically we'd get a bit further into the season before candidates start directly insulting each other about their looks. If we recall any election before this one, we would remember that the first debates are supposed to be the ones in which candidates ""introduce themselves to the country."" And Democrats are hoping that, after two feature-length rumbles among the umpteen Republican presidential contenders, their five presidential candidates who meet at the Wynn Las Vegas resort on Tuesday night will restore some dignity to the country's nominating process--a ""more civil, substantive debate,"" as Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter put it at a pre-debate event Monday night. ""They will probably challenge each other,"" Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange said, ""but it will be collegial."" If Democrats can succeed in doing so--in focusing on issues, and avoiding the intercandidate venom that makes for sensational television--the party might be pleased with itself. But CNN executives surely won't. They've already resigned themselves to more modest ratings. On Monday, Trump himself predicted a snoozefest: ""I think people are going to turn it on for a couple of minutes and then fall asleep."" It will be up to the non-Hillary Clinton candidates to determine what degree of combat they'll treat the American viewing public to Tuesday night. Is it more important to knock Clinton down by going after her, even if that risks a backlash among Democratic rank and file? Or should they keep it to a humble, smiling discussion of policy details and introductory remarks, even if that risks coming across as totally flat? There must be a balance. ""I don't see that as really being their style,"" Rep. Dina Titus, a Clinton supporter, said about whether she expected Clinton's lesser-polling rivals to go after her for a jolt in support. Titus was appearing at a mock caucus in the Nevada Democratic Party's Las Vegas offices to train volunteers who, for practice, were choosing between characters from The Muppets. (Miss Piggy captured the most delegates.) ""I think people are more wanting to identify themselves and let people know who they are at this stage. Because a lot of people don't know a Martin O'Malley, don't know Mr. Chafee,"" Titus continued. ""They're going to want to put their own stamp on their own campaigns as opposed to attacking her."" Titus is one of the people who does know O'Malley. She credited him for visiting the state ""often"" and explained--perhaps with a friendly warning--that she ""always thought he might be a good vice presidential candidate."" The O'Malley campaign doesn't divulge much interest in the vice presidency, but his presidential campaign needs something. Unlike former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb's and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee's campaigns, which sparked seemingly out of nowhere as pet projects for unorthodox members of the Democratic coalition, the O'Malley campaign is conventional. He is an accomplished former mayor and governor who's been plotting a presidential campaign, obviously, for some time. He has staff across the country, he's released policy papers left and right, and he holds events at a relentless pace. This has gotten O'Malley nowhere. He has zero traction in polls, and he's still unknown in much of the country. The most press he's gotten in recent memory is over his spat with the Democratic National Committee about increasing the number of debates. That hasn't happened, but he has one chance on Tuesday. And, as the foremost Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston bluntly stated, ""O'Malley has to justify his existence"" in this debate. So ... feeling any pressure? ""No,"" O'Malley campaign spokeswoman Haley Morris says. ""This is a great opportunity for the governor to introduce himself fully to the Democratic Party. And it's an opportunity for him to put his record of delivering progressive results next to everybody else."" The debate, in his campaign's view, is an ""enhanced introduction."" While Morris may not have meant ""enhanced"" in the post-9/11, CIA ""interrogation"" kind of way, you can't help but hear the similarity in terms. ""Enhanced introduction"" is an apt term for the sweet spot that underdog candidates will strive to meet. They want to ""introduce"" themselves in a positive light while infusing said introductions with critiques of Hillary Clinton. O'Malley, for example, can be expected to highlight his long-held opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to make the obvious contrast with Clinton. Sen. Bernie Sanders will do the same thing. And then us goons in the media will write about it. Much as it will disappoint the C-suite at CNN and casual viewers everywhere, that's the most likely case. Ho-hum: a first, get-to-know-you debate the way they're meant to be done, until Trump strolled along. It will be the second debate, after the seeds have been planted in the first, where the pleasantries will be cast aside. See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 Democratic primary."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/the_house_benghazi_investigation_is_partisan_sham_the_gop_committee_investigating.html	"Democrats have never trusted the House investigation of Benghazi. ""It's a tremendous red herring and a waste of taxpayer resources,"" said House Intelligence Committee member Adam Schiff, after Speaker John Boehner announced he would establish a special committee to investigate the attack. They believed it was a farce--a glorified venue for opposition research against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. To that point, earlier this summer, Rep. Elijah Cummings--the ranking Democrat on the committee--accused Republicans of leaking ""doctored information to the press in order to make unsubstantiated allegations against Secretary Clinton."" Republicans have consistently denied that this is a partisan fishing expedition. ""My interest is in the past, not the future. I'm trying to figure out what happened to four Americans in Benghazi,"" said South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who leads the committee, in reply to further criticism from Cummings. But it's not hard to understand Democratic frustration. Three separate investigations--from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, from the House Select Committee on Intelligence, and from the Senate Select Committee--cleared Clinton and the State Department of particular wrongdoing. There were no warnings and there was no cover-up. At most, the agency and its leaders were negligent in the face of danger. Despite this, Republicans pressed ahead. In the 17 months since the committee was formed, investigators haven't found anything to contradict earlier assessments. Then, as now, there's no evidence of a cover-up from Clinton or the administration. Still, in pursuing leads--and asking the State Department for Clinton's correspondence--they brought Clinton's private email server to light, plunging the Democratic presidential candidate into an ongoing controversy over transparency and security. It was a perfect victory. On one hand, Republicans could deny--plausibly, if not believably--that the committee wasn't about Clinton at all, and that this was an unintended consequence of the investigation. On the other, Clinton's email scandal had all but dwarfed her campaign and its message. But that was before Boehner announced his retirement, and before his assumed successor--House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy--said too much about the actual purpose of the committee. ""Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable,"" McCarthy said to Fox News' Sean Hannity. ""But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping."" This connection--between the committee, the email scandal, and Clinton's declining numbers--was debatable. But the words were there: The committee wasn't about finding the truth behind the attack in Benghazi; it was about tanking Clinton ahead of the election. McCarthy's comments helped kill his bid for House speaker and prompted new attacks from the Clinton campaign, which released a national ad slamming House Republicans. ""Republicans finally admit it,"" said the ad, ""Republicans have spent millions attacking Hillary because she's fighting for everything they oppose."" This weekend, another shoe dropped for the Benghazi committee. ""A former investigator for the House Select Committee on Benghazi says he was unlawfully fired in part because he sought to conduct a comprehensive probe into deadly attacks on the U.S. compound instead of focusing on Hillary Rodham Clinton and the State Department,"" reported the Associated Press. The New York Times followed with a major story that detailed the degree to which ""the focus of the committee's work has shifted from the circumstances surrounding the Benghazi attack to the politically charged issue of Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state."" What's more, according to the Times, this was a particular preoccupation for Boehner, who pushed the committee to focus on Clinton's emails."

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/house_speaker_fight_the_real_reason_the_republican_caucus_is_in_chaos.html	First of all, let's not shed any tears over the fall of Kevin McCarthy. Though the Republican majority leader is well-liked by his colleagues, he seems to have even less of a vision for where the GOP should go than the famously visionless John Boehner. If McCarthy has ever had a deep thought on how Republicans ought to position themselves in the post-Obama era, or the public policy goals the party should champion, he's done an impressive job of concealing it from the public. McCarthy's lack of vision could be forgiven if he were a masterful legislative strategist capable of implementing someone else's vision, but again, there is no evidence that this is in fact the case. Can you imagine McCarthy rallying Republicans around strengthening Congress, an institution that has grown dangerously weak as executive power has grown under Presidents Bush and Obama? Does he know enough about the basics of the federal budget process to get Republicans to try to fix it? Don't make me laugh. Nevertheless, McCarthy's departure from the race for speaker hasn't led to a collective sigh of relief among Republicans. That's because everyone is wondering if any Republican can get elected speaker on the strength of Republican votes alone, given the obstreperousness of the House Freedom Caucus, the very same rebels who drove Speaker Boehner to resign. The GOP smart set is hoping that Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and Mitt Romney's erstwhile running mate, will ride to the rescue. Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in Bloomberg View, makes a strong case that Ryan is the most logical choice for speaker, as he is one of relatively few Republicans in the House with a strong command of policy detail, long experience of legislative deal-making, and a rock-solid reputation for conservative ideological commitment. But even Ryan has his vulnerabilities. Some conservatives, like the influential Erick Erickson, insist that Ryan is not as conservative as you might think, in light of his support for TARP, No Child Left Behind, and other bipartisan measures that are loathed on the right. There are no doubt members of the House Freedom Caucus who agree with Erickson and who will put up a fight should Ryan enter the race. But there is more to the behavior of the House Freedom Caucus than ideological zeal. Today's GOP rebels aren't the first lawmakers who've wanted to rock the boat. What separates them from the rebels of earlier years is that there is almost nothing that party leaders can do to keep them in check. Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has argued that in the bad old days, when pork-barrel spending and earmarks reigned, leadership could bring rebellious backbenchers to heel by threatening to withhold sweet, sweet taxpayer dollars from this or that public project in a member's district. Such tactics are now frowned upon, and Republicans have gone so far as to impose an outright ban on earmarks--one that at least some Republicans would like to reverse. There's another factor, which Rauch also references. Successive waves of campaign finance regulation have been designed to limit the influence of money in politics. What these regulations have actually done is quite different. In Better Parties, Better Government, Joel Gora and Peter Wallison observe that today's campaign finance regulations limit the extent to which candidates can coordinate their fundraising and campaigning efforts with central party organizations, so candidates have to build their own fundraising networks. Building such a network is fairly easy for those who've spent their lives around the very wealthy or who are very wealthy themselves. But it is much harder for less wealthy individuals who have dedicated their lives to public service or who for whatever reason aren't skilled in the art of wheedling money out of strangers. What does any of this have to do with the House Freedom Caucus? Because central party organizations can't freely coordinate with candidates, and because candidates have to raise the bulk of their campaign cash independently, the parties have very little leverage over candidates. Members are far less afraid of alienating their leaders and far more afraid of alienating their donors. Who cares if John Boehner is mad at me? What counts is that by declaring war on the GOP leadership, and by declaring that all those who want to avoid a government shutdown are sellouts, I can raise money off of apocalyptic Boehner-bashing emails and Facebook posts. Imagine a world in which virtually all fundraising for House races was done by an official organ of the GOP, like the National Republican Congressional Committee, as Gora and Wallison recommend. Promising candidates would receive money directly from GOP HQ, so they wouldn't have to devote all of their time, or indeed any of their time, to fundraising. This would free up candidates to spend more time in their districts or on doing the nitty-gritty work of legislating. Candidates could still raise their own money or spend their own money. The First Amendment protects their right to do so. But candidates backed by the party would have an advantage over those who don't enjoy official party support, as building one national fundraising machine is so much more efficient than building hundreds of fundraising machines for individual candidates. The appeal of this party-provided campaign cash would be such that candidates would be very reluctant to lose it--so they'd be far more inclined to play ball with the party leaders who control the purse strings. There'd be another advantage to this system: If the parties had a freer hand in raising funds and the ability to dispatch those funds to the strongest candidates, including candidates who struggle to raise money on their own, we'd have a far more competitive political system. To be sure, party organizations in this scenario would have to raise funds from wealthy individuals and interest groups. Yet the sheer size and scope of these fundraising machines would ensure that they'd have little choice but to raise funds from a far broader collection of interests than an individual candidate, and in aggregating these disparate interests, they'd be in a better position to limit the influence of any one donor or group of donors. Now, if you think that allowing a mutinous minority of Republicans to constantly hold the GOP leadership hostage is a good thing, by all means, let's celebrate the campaign finance status quo. If you instead think that the party must be more united and disciplined to achieve its goals, whether those goals are those of the Tea Party or the squishy moderates, your first priority should be to strengthen the GOP as a fundraising machine.

I'm Jacob Weisberg, chairman of the Slate Group. I started here in 1996 as Slate's first political writer, which involved convincing Bob Dole's handlers to let me on their campaign plane because this Internet thing was going to big. After six years of that, I took over from my guru Michael Kinsley as Slate's editor. After six years of that, I handed the reins to David Plotz and took charge of Slate's business side. My job these days is figuring out how to pay for the work we do as journalists. I read Slate's political coverage before anything else. This week, John Dickerson frames the big question you're going to be hearing next week: If Joe Biden runs, what's his rationale? Really wanting to be president isn't a good enough answer. Jim Newell, Slate's newest addition on the politics beat, writes that there's only one constituency that actually wants Biden to run. It's the media, desperate for a Democratic bloodbath to match the Republican melee. Meanwhile, Jamelle Bouie argues that Bernie Sanders can make it a genuinely competitive contest even without Biden. Beyond politics, you shouldn't miss two deep dives that I haven't stopped thinking about. One is an excerpt from Timothy Snyder's new investigation of the Holocaust, Black Earth. Snyder's piece, ""The Banality of Good,"" explores the motivations of those who rescued Jews during the Holocaust, and their surprising inability to explain their actions. And Leon Neyfakh, our criminal justice reporter, took advantage of funding from Slate Plus members to explore the police killing of an unarmed black man in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2013. In this case, something unusual happened: the white cop went on trial for manslaughter. Over in culture land, I loved Dana Stevens' film lover's tour of Japan, her effort to relate to the country through places connected with Hayao Miyazaki, Akira Kurosawa, Godzilla, and Sofia Coppola. I also had a good time reading Forest Wickman explain that typing noise that doesn't sound like real-life typing that always accompanies words appearing on a computer screen in action movies. And as a veteran, it's exciting to read the wave of new talent that we've recently welcomed to Slate. One of my favorite books writers, Laura Miller, gives the quasi-repentant journalist-turned-pick-up-artist Neil Strauss surprising credit. Michelle Goldberg digs into the dodgy background of the Planned Parenthood ""defector"" Susan Thayer. Christina Cauterucci explains why American Apparel is in trouble--and why she still shops there. That brings us to Friday morning, which means that it's time for the Slate News Quiz.

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/ted_cruz_is_in_a_really_good_spot_right_now.html	"When Ted Cruz announced his campaign for president, I said he didn't have a chance. The Texas senator isn't just extreme--an ideological outlier with hard-right positions on virtually everything under the sun--but he's unpopular with other Republican lawmakers. He stepped on the stage as a critic of national GOP leadership and has used his influence with grassroots conservatives to force confrontations like the 2013 government shutdown. Cruz has burned his bridges with powerful party figures like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell--on one occasion, Cruz called McConnell a ""liar"" on the Senate floor--and is toxic to many of his Senate Republican colleagues. This isn't new. Cruz has always been antagonistic toward his party. It's why I was an immediate skeptic of his campaign. When choosing a nominee for president, political parties want consensus. They nominate people who satisfy all the party's interests and constituencies. They don't nominate gadflies like Cruz. Cruz is still an unlikely choice for nominee. But I was wrong to discount him. Not because he can win, but because--alone among the insurgent Republican candidates for president--he might survive Iowa and New Hampshire to face the establishment, one on one (or one on two). Here's why. First, the polls. Every national Republican primary poll has three tiers. At the bottom are niche and vanity candidates who barely make a blip, like Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former New York Gov. George Pataki. At the top, right now, are outsider candidates like Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, who will fade as we get closer to actual voting. And in the middle, there are the most viable candidates, who will rise as others shrink away or drop out. That final tier now holds three candidates who touch or approach double-digit support: Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz. This isn't in stone; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker dropped from the middle tier to the bottom and eventually left the race, while Rubio is inching toward the top of the pack as the most popular establishment candidate. Bush and Rubio are competing for the same pool of moderate and stalwart Republican voters--the same people who buoyed Mitt Romney until he could break away from the field in the 2012 primary race. Cruz is not. He's fighting to be a Reverse Romney of sorts (Bizarro Romney is also an acceptable analogy). Instead of unifying mainstream Republicans into a bloc, he'll rise as the most popular candidate of social conservatives, whose large numbers belie their modest influence on choosing the nominee but still hold some important sway. Working in his favor is the Bush/Rubio rivalry, as well as the Chris Christie and John Kasich candidacies, which split any runoff in the mainstream field. Working against him is the gaggle of conservative and outsider candidates, including Trump and Carson, who have sucked the oxygen from anyone fighting for the conservative base. But unlike the other anti-insider candidates, Cruz is positioning himself for future success--planning for when those outsider challengers leave the race. The most obvious example is his relationship with Donald Trump. The Texas senator has cozied up to Trump, defending him from other Republicans and standing with him onstage to criticize the White House. If and when Trump exits the primary, Cruz hopes to grab his support. Likewise, Cruz has been friendly with Ben Carson, who draws his support from the same conservative evangelicals that Cruz needs to succeed. Cruz has also poured his energy into building a campaign presence. ""For every county in the first four voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada,"" reports the New York Times, ""the Cruz campaign has locked down county chairs in charge of not just lending their names to the campaign, but of spearheading outreach and organizing efforts."" To that point, notes Eliana Johnson for National Review, Cruz has invested time, money, and effort into building support in Southern states. ""Cruz also has a plan beyond Iowa. He has referred to the March 1 'SEC primary,' in which eight Southern states go to the polls, as his 'firewall': that is, a backstop against whatever losses he might sustain beforehand,"" writes Johnson. The reason, she continues, is straightforward: ""Most of those contests, unlike the ones that precede them, are not winner-take-all, and Cruz's goal is to win the most delegates rather than to take entire states."" These elections are before Super Tuesday; if Cruz can amass enough delegates, he can enter that contest with an advantage over his competitors. What's more, the core challenge of Super Tuesday is money. For insurgent candidates, cash is the chief limit to future success. But on that score, Cruz may not have to worry. In the first half of this year, billionaires and other supporters put more than $37 million into his super PACs, while Cruz raised $14 million through small donations to his campaign. The Texas senator hasn't released his numbers for the third quarter, but there's a good chance they're just as strong. This tells us two things: First, that Cruz has real and serious grassroots support. And second, he should be able to sustain his campaign through the early and mid-primary seasons. We also shouldn't discount Cruz's qualitative abilities. He is a strong, disciplined presence on the stump. To liberals, his style--a kind of polished preaching--grates. But it's popular to conservatives and wears well with large audiences. And with fights over funding the government and raising the debt ceiling--more likely in the wake of chaos surrounding the House speakership--Cruz (who led the last shutdown) has a chance to bolster his national profile with conservatives, attract new volunteers and donors to his campaign, and make himself the most visible face of right-wing discontent in the Republican Party. The fundamentals of the Cruz campaign are strong. This doesn't mean he will win, but he may face off against Bush or Rubio or Kasich as the last insurgent standing. Yes, parties avoid gadflies. But not always. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/does_bernie_sanders_love_guns.html	"Bernie Sanders, the 74-year-old senator from Vermont, is lighting up the 2016 presidential race. He's denouncing the rich, raising money hand over fist, and soaring in the polls. His rivals for the Democratic nomination need an issue that can break Sanders' grip on the party's liberal base. And now they've found it: gun control. Supporters of former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Sanders opponent, recently produced an ad that called Sanders soft on guns. Hillary Clinton's campaign sent Dan Malloy, the Connecticut governor whose state endured the 2012 Newtown massacre, to New Hampshire to criticize Sanders' 22-year-old vote against the Brady gun control bill. In the wake of last week's mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, Clinton and O'Malley are turning up the heat. Guns are an odd issue for Sanders. He's a self-described socialist. He advocates redistributive taxation, trade restrictions, single-payer health care, an expansion of Social Security, and free college for everyone. But on guns, he becomes a bit of a libertarian. In fact, he becomes a contrarian. Sanders has surged to the front of the Democratic pack by telling the left what it wants to hear: that we'll all get more goodies from the government for free, that we won't have to fight any wars, and that business can have its leash jerked without killing economic growth. Guns are the one issue on which Sanders says liberals are wrong. Is he right? Let's look at his arguments. 1. Gun laws are overrated. Sanders, like other liberals, peddles cure-alls for capital flight, wage stagnation, and inequities in campaign finance. But on guns, he's a policy skeptic. After Newtown, he cautioned: ""If you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don't think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen."" This year, after the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, he said of gun control, ""Some people think it's going to solve all of our problems, and it's not."" Unlike the National Rifle Association, Sanders believes gun laws can make a difference. But he agrees with the NRA that mental health and ""gratuitous violence in the media"" are part of the problem. 2. Don't be a bigot. Sanders represents a state with lots of hunting and little crime. He sees gun owners as a law-abiding cultural minority despised by liberal elites. He talks about hunters the way other lefties might talk about Muslims, saying gun ownership shouldn't be ""stereotyped"" or ""stigmatized."" He preaches against ""cultural warfare"" and ""demagoguing against folks just because they go out and hunt and they own guns."" Sanders' message to urban college-educated liberals is that we're not as open-minded as we think we are. We have our prejudices, and disdain for gun culture is one of them. 3. Draw the line at hunting. For the most part, Sanders' allegiance to hunters determines which gun laws he favors and which he opposes. Critics say his support for banning assault weapons in 2013 was a shift from his previous position. That's not true. He has repeatedly voted to ban such weapons, along with high-capacity magazines. In interviews, Sanders consistently distinguishes between ""hunting"" weapons, which should be legal, and ""military-type weapons,"" which shouldn't. When he thinks the rights of hunters are unfairly threatened--for example, by laws against firearm possession in national parks--he votes for the hunters, not for the gun restrictions. 4. Leave it to the states. Sanders believes that guns are used differently in different parts of the country--for street violence in cities, for sport in rural states--and therefore, ""decisions about gun control should be made as close to home as possible."" That was his stated rationale for voting against the Brady Bill. On the same grounds, he voted against a Republican congressional amendment that would have repealed waiting periods imposed by states. In 2009 and 2013, Sanders also voted against federal legislation that would have extended the scope of concealed-weapons permits to states that hadn't approved such permits. 5. No loopholes. Sanders' opponents depict him as an NRA stooge because the organization helped him win a House seat in 1990. Actually, the NRA was only going after Sanders' opponent (for switching sides on assault weapons), and gun advocates expected to vote Sanders out in the next election. They now regret helping Sanders, and he has a D-minus rating from the NRA. One reason is his steady support for background checks on all firearm purchases. He voted against gun-show loopholes in 1999 and again during the Manchin-Toomey debate in 2013, after Newtown. He also advocates a crackdown on ""straw man"" purchases, which circumvent background checks. Like the NRA, Sanders says the most effective gun laws are those that target who can buy a gun, not what kind of gun can be bought. Unlike the NRA, he thinks these laws should apply to all sales. 6. Compromise. The United States is a big, diverse country. If you want to pass any federal laws. says Sanders, you'll have to respect gun owners. On that account, he brushes aside the idea of rounding up everybody's firearms. Three months ago, he told an audience of liberals in Arlington, Virginia, that while they might prefer to ban guns, they should prepare to work with people from rural states on balanced legislation that ""may not be your policy."" You can question parts of Sanders' record, and I would. I've yet to hear good reasons for his 2008 vote to exclude anti-firearm programs from the Indian Health Care Improvement Act or his 2006 vote to raise the burden of proof for federal agents investigating gun dealers. His most baffling decision, as Slate's Mark Joseph Stern has noted, was his vote to insulate gun manufacturers from liability for crimes committed with their weapons. To this day, Sanders defends that vote, arguing that gun-makers, like hammer or bat manufacturers, shouldn't be held responsible for abuse of their products. Yet he's running for president as the scourge of bankers, traders, polluters, and CEOs. Why, when the conversation turns to firearms, does Sanders develop such faith in corporate innocence? But if we're going to scrutinize Sanders' self-deceptions, we'd better not spare our own. His criticisms of gun-control dogma are worth considering. Do we really believe closing the gun-show loophole will prevent the next Roseburg or Newtown? Why should Chicago's gun laws apply to northern New England? Do you personally know anyone who hunts? When you speak of clips or semiautomatic weapons, do you have any idea what you're talking about? Yes, Sanders has some hard questions to answer. And so do the rest of us.

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/nancy_pelosi_should_help_elect_kevin_mccarthy_speaker.html	"House Republicans are in a bit of a bind. A majority of the caucus will very likely vote on Thursday to nominate Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California as the next speaker. But being elected speaker of the House requires an absolute majority of the chamber, not just of the majority party. Usually, once the majority caucus has chosen a candidate, the members of that party line up (nearly) unanimously behind that candidate. But Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah (so far as I know, no relation) is challenging McCarthy, counting on support from the roughly 40-member ""Freedom Caucus"" (though it might prefer the ""Tortilla Coast Caucus"" these days). Chaffetz has insisted that many members of that group would be unwilling to vote for McCarthy on the floor. In fact, he told the New York Times that McCarthy ""can't get to 218"" votes. But if the Tortillans deny McCarthy the speakership, is it really plausible that the rest of the Republican caucus would fall in line behind Chaffetz? Doing so would, essentially, ensure that the most extreme wing of the majority party controlled the leadership, and that doesn't seem like it would be too appealing to the rest of the caucus. And if no one gets to 218? Well, that could throw the chamber into chaos. The business of the House would not necessarily grind to a complete halt--House rules provide for a speaker pro tempore when the speakership is vacant--but it's hard to imagine the House doing much of substance in the midst of a leadership crisis. It wouldn't be the first time something like this happened: In 1856, in the tumult leading up to the Civil War, it took two months and 133 ballots to elect Nathaniel Banks as speaker. In 1923, it took nine ballots over two days for anyone to get a majority, and for a familiar-sounding reason: The Republican Party was split--back then, between progressives and more conservative ""regulars."" The progressive members refused to support the Republican conference nominee for speaker, Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts, on the floor. In exchange for finally agreeing to support Gillett, the progressives extracted a promise that legislation that the regulars had kept bottled up in committee would be brought to the House floor for a vote. The fight over Gillett was an intra-party fight, but maybe Democrats should take a page from the progressive Republicans' playbook. Or, to put it differently, maybe Democrats should come to McCarthy's rescue. That might sound a bit crazy, but bear with me. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi should offer McCarthy a deal: Democrats would provide the votes necessary to make him speaker and keep him in the chair for the remainder of the 114th Congress. In exchange, McCarthy would commit to bringing certain specified bills to the floor for a vote--the list might include a clean debt-ceiling increase through 2017 (or even an abolition of the debt ceiling entirely), a continuing resolution funding the government at last year's levels for the remainder of the fiscal year, something like the immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013, and more. The details would have to be carefully negotiated (and other members of the leadership, perhaps starting with Rules Committee Chair Pete Sessions, would have to be brought on board), but there are no insurmountable practical considerations preventing such a deal. In essence, this deal would make House Democrats the junior partners in a coalition government of the chamber. It certainly wouldn't be as nice as controlling the House, but it would be an improvement over their current position. Getting their high-priority bills to the floor would be a win-win: if the bills pass, they score a policy win, and if they fail, they've got Republicans on record, once again, voting against popular measures. Moreover, Democrats could publicly present their willingness to support a Republican speaker as an act of patriotic statesmanship, a willingness to put governing the country ahead of partisan advantage, and a reason to trust them with a majority in the 2016 elections. What's trickier to say is what the GOP might get out of it, but it could actually be a win for them as well. McCarthy would, in a key sense, be weakened as a speaker--after all, he would be starting his speakership reliant on a party that seeks to oust him from office. But presumably he would prefer a weakened speakership to no speakership at all. And in another sense, McCarthy might actually be stronger as the head of a quasi-coalition: Instead of being a prisoner to the most extreme members of his caucus, he would be free to kick them to the curb on certain issues and proceed with some Democratic votes. The deal would also be a win for the majority of the Republican caucus, which doesn't want a shutdown or a default. More broadly, it doesn't want to continue to be held hostage by its most conservative wing, the ""false prophets"" lambasted by outgoing Speaker John Boehner. Making this deal would allow most Republicans to demonstrate that they are, in fact, capable of governing responsibly, which, in turn, would tie in to their arguments that they should be trusted with a continuing majority in the next Congress. With a speaker vacancy--or, perhaps worse, the Tortillans in charge--routine and necessary legislation would likely fall by the wayside in favor of partisan warfare, further suggesting to the electorate that the party currently in charge of governing can't successfully do so. While it's true that there are political risks for more moderate Republicans to taking this approach--such as facing a Tea Party primary challenge--a number of them are from less rabidly conservative districts. And, at the end of the day, very few congressional incumbents have been successfully primaried out of office by a right-wing opponent since 2010, perhaps suggesting that centrist Republicans have less to fear than some think. The fact that Democrats, McCarthy, and the majority of the Republican caucus all stand to gain something from this arrangement should suggest that, crazy-sounding or not, it might just be politically feasible. Obviously, the people who would lose out in this scenario are Chaffetz and the Tortillans. For McCarthy and his allies, that might just be the best reason of all to make the deal."

Because the media really, really, really wants Biden to transform the Democratic primary into what it's currently not: a highly clickable three-way donnybrook in which Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders claw each other to death for public amusement. To wit: Politico's Mike Allen published a genuinely hilarious report Monday marketed as containing two pieces of in-demand information: that Biden is expected to make a decision on his candidacy this weekend and that he is supposedly leaning toward entering. Allen's report doesn't actually confirm either of those nuggets, though. It is sourced entirely to anonymous ""friends,"" though sometimes they double as ""confidants"" and other times as mere ""visitors""--idle swells who call on the Bidens during lazy Sunday afternoons in the Delaware countryside. ""The confidants,"" Allen writes, ""say the most likely scenario for a decision is a family council next weekend."" Unless ... that is not at all true? ""But these sources,"" he cautions, ""note that the timing will be driven completely by Biden, and he has proved to be ever-unpredictable as he contemplated a race."" While Allen writes at the top of the piece that several ""people who have visited Biden recently said he seems to be leaning 'yes,' "" a few paragraphs later we hear from other ""friends"" and ""visitors"" who disagree."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/bernie_sanders_polls_show_he_could_win_a_general_election.html	"America's most famous socialist might be more electable than he looks. In the swing state of Iowa, according to the latest poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, Bernie Sanders leads Donald Trump by 5 points and trails Jeb Bush by just 2 points. In purple New Hampshire, likewise, Sanders leads Trump by 10 points, and is tied against Bush. By contrast, both Trump and Bush lead Hillary Clinton--the presumptive Democratic nominee--in Iowa, and Bush stands ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire by 7 points. This comes after a national Quinnipiac survey last month showed Sanders similarly competitive nationally with the most visible Republican presidential candidates: He tied Bush with 44 percent, led Trump by a margin of 47 percent to 42 percent, and barely trailed Carly Fiorina, 44 percent to 43 percent. In each instance, other than against Fiorina, Clinton performed worse. In other words, if Sanders had an electability gap with Hillary, he's closed it. Of course, there are caveats. At this point in an election, head-to-head polls gauge sympathy and feeling; they can't predict an outcome. We don't know how Sanders would look in a national campaign, against a unified Republican Party. Likewise, when it comes to Clinton's weakness, we don't know how she would look if she were the nominee. Given her place in the national Democratic primary--a solid, double-digit lead over Sanders--there's a chance that her poor numbers reflect ambivalence from potential supporters, not outright opposition. Which is just to say that, to many Americans, the 2016 presidential election is still hypothetical, and when you ask them to choose between candidates, you're asking for a gut reaction more than a considered choice. But that's not to dismiss Sanders. Even if his base--college-educated workers and liberal whites--reflects the extent to which he occupies a traditional left-wing role that has appeared in past Democratic presidential primaries, it's meaningful that a self-described ""democratic socialist"" on the periphery of American politics is tied in two swing states with a man who has the same last name as two former presidents. Nor should anyone ignore the massive crowds that flock to every major Sanders campaign event; on Saturday, 20,000 people came to the Boston Convention Center to hear the senator speak, one of the largest presidential primary crowds ever assembled in Massachusetts. Indeed, there's evidence that Sanders' appeal might go beyond liberals. Writing for the Washington Post, David Weigel found a friendly reception for the Vermont senator in working-class West Virginia, where white Democratic voters rejected Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/how_roseburg_newtown_and_other_mass_shooters_got_their_guns.html	"On Thursday, after Chris Harper Mercer shot and killed 9 people at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, President Obama gave the latest in a tragic series of addresses in response to mass shootings in the U.S. ""It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm to get his or her hands on a gun,"" he said. But it is remarkably easy to get your hands on a gun in this country. Of the 11 shootings that prompted Obama to give a public address, eight were committed by gunmen who'd bought at least some of their firearms legally, some just days before their massacres. Several had histories of criminal behavior and mental illness that fell just shy of prohibiting their gun purchases--and in one case, a bureaucratic slip-up in the routine FBI background check was at fault. Here's how the guns in each attack came into the hands of the killers. Shooting: Military base at Fort Hood, Texas
Date: Nov. 5, 2009
Perpetrator: Nidal Hasan
Guns: FN Five-seven semiautomatic pistol and Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum revolver. He killed 13 people and injured more than 30.
How he got them: Guns Galore, a gun shop in Killeen, Texas, sold Hasan the gun legally three months before the shooting. He was not required to register the firearm on the base, because he didn't reside there. Shooting: Gabrielle Giffords constituent meeting in a Tucson, Arizona, parking lot
Date: Jan. 8, 2011
Perpetrator: Jared Lee Loughner
Gun: Glock 19 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. Loughner killed six people and shot 13 more, including Rep. Giffords.
How he got it: Arizona, which has some of the laxest gun laws in the country, passed a law in 2010 that allowed people to buy guns for concealed carry without a permit. Though guns cannot be sold to people with severe mental illness and though Loughner was suspended from his community college for mental health issues, no court had ever declared him mentally unfit, so his on-the-spot background check at a gun outlet came up clear. Shooting: Movie theater in Aurora, Colorado
Date: July 20, 2012
Perpetrator: James E. Holmes
Guns: Holmes used a semiautomatic Smith & Wesson M&P15 (a variation on the military's M16 weapons), a 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun, and a semiautomatic .40-caliber Glock 22, killing 12 and injuring 70. The New York Times reports that these three guns are some of the most popular in the U.S.--so widely used, in fact, that a ""three-gun competition"" has been established to test gun enthusiasts' proficiency on each in a target-shooting game of speed.
How he got them: All three guns were purchased legally in 2012 between May 22 and July 6 at three different Colorado gun stores. Shooting: Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin
Date: Aug. 5, 2012
Perpetrator: Wade Michael Page
Gun: Like Holmes and Loughner, Page used a semiautomatic handgun. His was a Springfield 9 mm. Page killed six and injured four before killing himself.
How he got it: Page purchased the gun legally in a Milwaukee-area store. At the time of the shooting, the Brady Campaign on Gun Violence had named Wisconsin among the 10 states with the fewest gun restrictions. Shooting: Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut
Date: Dec. 14, 2012
Perpetrator: Adam Lanza
Guns: First, Lanza shot and killed his mother with a .22-caliber Savage MK II-F bolt action rifle. At the school, Lanza used an AR-15 semiautomatic, like Holmes. Lanza killed 26 people in total and injured two before killing himself.
How he got them: Both guns belonged to Lanza's mother. Shooting: Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.
Date: Sept. 16, 2013
Perpetrator: Aaron Alexis
Gun: Alexis began the attack with a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun (he also took a 9 mm pistol from a police officer at the scene after shooting him). He killed 12 people and injured eight before killing himself.
How he got it: Two days before the massacre, Alexis bought his shotgun at a store in Northern Virginia that claims to be the ""only gun shop inside the Beltway."" He initially inquired about buying a handgun, but because he was from out of state, the store would have had to ship it to a dealer in his home state. That's when he went for the shotgun. Though he'd been arrested in 2004 after shooting out the tires of another man's car and in 2010 after shooting his gun (accidentally, he said) through his ceiling into the apartment of his upstairs neighbor, neither charge was enough to sully his Virginia background check. Shooting: Military base at Fort Hood, Texas
Date: April 2, 2014
Perpetrator: Ivan Lopez
Gun: .45-caliber Smith & Wesson M&P pistol. He killed three and injured 14 before killing himself.
How he got it: Lopez purchased his gun legally at the same Killeen, Texas, store that sold Hasan the gun he used in the first Fort Hood shooting. Because Lopez didn't live on the base, he was not required to register his weapon. Shooting: Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas
Date: April 13, 2014
Suspect: Frazier Glenn Miller Jr.
Guns: Remington Model 870 shotgun and a handgun. Frazier allegedly killed three people.
How he got them: John Mark Reidle of Missouri allegedly bought the shotgun at a Missouri Walmart four days before the massacre, because Miller's former felony conviction prohibited him from owning a gun. The handgun is of unknown provenance. Shooting: Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina
Date: June 18, 2015
Suspect: Dylann Roof
Gun: .45-caliber Glock. Roof killed nine people and injured one.
How he got it: A flaw in the FBI's background check system allowed Roof to buy the handgun at a South Carolina store eight days after his 21st birthday. When the gun dealer asked the FBI for approval to sell the gun to Roof, the bureau noted that he'd recently been arrested and exercised its three-day investigation period to get more information. Two days later, an FBI agent found that Roof had not been convicted of the felony drug possession charge, so an immediate denial was not merited. She tried to contact the appropriate police department for more information, but because of a jurisdictional issue the agent couldn't get the police report in time to make the three-day deadline. Had she gotten the report, she would have seen that Roof had admitted to drug possession, which would have kept him from obtaining the weapon. Shooting: Two military centers in Chattanooga, Tennessee
Date: July 16, 2015
Perpetrator: Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez
Guns: According to law enforcement, when police killed Abdulazeez, he was in possession of a 12-gauge shotgun, a 9 mm handgun, and an assault weapon along the lines of an AK-47. He killed five people and injured two.
How he got them: A friend of Abdulazeez's said the gunman had bought four firearms from an online arms sale site, which allowed him to skirt a background check, but the claim has not been confirmed. At least some of the guns were obtained legally. Shooting: Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon
Date: Oct. 1, 2015
Perpetrator: Chris Harper Mercer
Guns: Harper Mercer brought six guns with him on his shooting spree--five handguns and a rifle--and owned eight others, including pistols, four other rifles, and a shotgun. He killed nine people and injured seven before he was killed by police.
How he got them: All were purchased legally."	How Mass Shooters Get Their Guns: The Shocking Ease With Which 11 Killers Acquired Their Weapons	['Harper', 'Obama']	['guns']
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/obamacare_a_compromise_republicans_and_democrats_can_embrace.html	"Are the Obamacare wars over? The leading GOP presidential candidates have been spending all of their time sniping at each other over immigration, and talk of doing away with Obamacare has been largely relegated to policy briefs that hardly anyone reads. Granted, Republicans in Congress are currently putting the finishing touches on a bill that will repeal some of Obamacare's more unpopular provisions, like the individual and employer mandates and the Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans. But no one really believes that President Obama will let the House undo his signature domestic policy achievement. Most Obamacare opponents appreciate that to repeal the law outright, you'd need, at a bare minimum, a Republican president and Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. To really get the job done, Republicans would probably need a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. And that's just not going to happen. Moreover, repealing Obamacare without replacing it is a nonstarter, because doing so would mean disrupting the insurance arrangements of millions of people, and the horror stories that would follow would plague Republicans for years. Though there are a number of semiplausible Obamacare replacement plans floating around, like the Patient CARE Act and erstwhile presidential candidate Scott Walker's health reform proposal, conservatives are sharply divided over what such a plan should look like. Basically, purists want to spend as little as possible on a replacement plan while pragmatists are open to spending a bit more to ensure that large numbers of people don't lose their coverage. For now, at least, the conservative dream of completely undoing Obamacare and starting over from scratch appears to be slipping out of reach. But it's not just conservatives who have a problem with Obamacare. Just ask Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, both of whom have had a lot to say about how they'd overhaul Obamacare. Sanders favors scrapping Obamacare's convoluted structure outright and replacing it with a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. Clinton wants to make Obamacare's benefits more generous while also getting rid of the Cadillac tax, one of the law's chief revenue-raising measures. Wonks tend to like the Cadillac tax, which is designed to discourage employers from offering overly generous health insurance plans that give consumers little incentive to seek out cost-effective care. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities recently rallied dozens of economists on the left and right to make the case for the tax. But organized labor hates it, for the simple reason that securing expensive health plans is one of the main ways unions demonstrate their value to their members. Whether the next president is a Republican or a Democrat, Obamacare is going to be overhauled. The reason is that in its current form, it is not serving middle-class families all that well. Back in June, Robert Laszewski, a close observer of the insurance industry, pointed out that among people eligible for the Obamacare exchanges, it is only the poorest and sickest who've been signing up for coverage in large numbers. For example, 76 percent of eligibles earning between 100 and 150 percent of the federal poverty level have enrolled while only 20 percent of eligibles earning between 251 and 300 percent have done so. This is despite the fact that the law uses all kinds of carrots (subsidies for those who can't afford coverage) and sticks (penalties for those who forego coverage) to get uninsured people to sign up. The problem, according to Laszewski, is that while Obamacare-compliant plans are a good deal for the poor, who enjoy generous subsidies, and the sick, who get far more in benefits than they pay in premiums, they appear to be a bad deal for everyone else. Recently, the economists Mark Pauly, Adam Leive, and Scott Harrington released a working paper that estimates how much better or worse off ""non-poor"" uninsured people's earnings would be after buying Silver or Bronze plans on the Obamacare exchanges. Among other things, they took into account the average financial burden involved in buying coverage as well as the value associated with consuming more medical care. What they found is that while most uninsured people making between 138 and 250 percent of the federal poverty level seem to be somewhat better off, a substantial majority of those earning more than 250 percent seem to be worse off. Essentially, most of the better-off uninsured are paying far more for their Silver and Bronze plans in premiums than they are getting out of them in benefits. The result is that millions of middle-class people are choosing to go without coverage, despite the risk that entails. It turns out that it is very hard to force people to buy products that they don't want. True, the IRS could get much tougher about forcing the uninsured middle-class to pay penalties, and Obamacare's champions could get behind making these penalties more onerous. But does anyone see this get-tough approach as a huge vote-winner? As long as middle-class voters don't believe that Obamacare is benefiting them, Obamacare is going to be politically vulnerable. The time has thus come for a temporary Obamacare truce. Conservatives and liberals have very different gripes about Obamacare. On the right, critics fear that it will cause federal spending to skyrocket over time, and that it is stymieing cost-saving, quality-enhancing innovation with its stringent regulations. On the left, there is a sense that Obamacare hasn't gone far enough to expand coverage and to protect the interests of its poorest beneficiaries. What both sides have to confront is that their best-case scenarios--starting from scratch with a free-market approach for conservatives, embracing single-payer for liberals--aren't going to pan out any time soon. To achieve their goals, both sides will have to give a little, at least for now. What might an Obamacare truce look like? Rather than fight the fact that the Obamacare exchanges have become a refuge for the poor and the sick, Republicans and Democrats should embrace it. The central elements of the Obamacare truce would be to repeal the unpopular individual and employer mandates, which are meant to corral people into buying insurance, and to deregulate individual insurance plans that are not sold on the exchanges. (Right now, all individual health insurance plans must be compliant with Obamacare's insurance regulations.) If you want to buy an Obamacare-compliant policy, you'd be welcome to buy one on an exchange. But Obamacare's insurance regulations and its premium subsidies would only apply to plans sold on the exchanges. If you choose to buy private insurance not on an exchange, your plan would be regulated by your state government, and you wouldn't be eligible for any financial assistance. Premiums for off-exchange plans would tend to be much lower than for Obamacare-compliant plans, as they'd offer fewer free services upfront and they'd skimp on Obamacare-mandated benefits that many consumers don't want or need. Yet because these plans are better-targeted to meet the needs of the middle-class unsinsured people who are avoiding the Obamacare exchanges like the plague, there is good reason to believe that coverage levels would increase. That's an outcome both the left and the right should celebrate. In one fell swoop, this Obamacare truce would transform the regulated exchanges into high-risk pools that would serve the people the unregulated private insurance market can't serve well. Conservatives can talk a big game about replacing Obamacare with high-risk pools. Yet they often underestimate how expensive these high-risk pools would be and how difficult it would be to get them off the ground. The Obamacare exchanges are perfectly designed to serve this function. The downside, of course, is that because the exchanges would serve a poor and sick population, the average cost of serving beneficiaries on the exchanges would be high. This in turn means that insurers would charge very high unsubsidized premiums for exchange plans. But these high unsubsidized premiums would affect relatively few people, as almost everyone who isn't eligible for premium subsidies would flock to cheaper, lightly regulated off-exchange plans. (One big exception would be states like New York that had heavily regulated insurance markets even before Obamacare. This is an argument for allowing consumers to buy off-exchange insurance policies across state lines, so that New Yorkers could take advantage of lightly regulated Texan policies, or for states like New York to embrace deregulation.) Liberals will find much to dislike in this Obamacare truce, as it will allow millions of Americans to buy the policies that they deride as ""junk insurance."" Yet it will also protect the role of the exchanges in offering low-income households and the chronically ill affordable insurance coverage. Conservatives will bristle at any plan that entrenches any aspect of Obamacare. Nevertheless, they should appreciate that by deregulating the individual insurance market away from the exchanges, the truce will give insurers the freedom to devise plans that better meet the needs of their consumers. And by limiting premium subsidies to the exchanges, it will ensure that subsidies are narrowly targeted to the people who need them most. One thing I can promise you is that there is no major Republican or Democratic presidential candidate who will embrace this Obamacare truce. They'd be crazy to do so, as activists on both sides still want to believe that they can achieve a total Obamacare victory. By the time the next president takes office, however, I suspect that this truce will look very attractive as the number of middle-class uninsured people remains stubbornly high. There will still be plenty for the right and left to argue about, from the future of Medicare and Medicaid to how exactly we should pay for everything. Why not agree that we're not going to yank insurance coverage away from the people who've gained access to it over the past few years, and find a way to repair the broken system we have?"

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/roseberg_attack_why_do_americans_care_more_about_mass_shootings_than_inner.html	"There are two truths about gun homicide in America. The first is that we have a mass shooting problem. On Thursday, 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer opened fire on a community college campus in Roseburg, Oregon. He killed 9 people and wounded 7 others--allegedly singling out Christian students--before he was killed in a shootout with police.* ""Roseburg"" joins ""Charleston, ""Isla Vista,"" ""Newtown,"" ""Aurora,"" and ""Oak Creek"" on the long list of small towns and quiet cities marred by horrific gun violence. It's one reason President Obama was visibly angry in his brief remarks on the shooting. This, after all, was another address to give to another shattered community with another set of grieving families. ""[A]s I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough,"" said Obama. ""[I]t does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America--next week, or a couple of months from now."" He continued: ""This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."" And it's too many families. Under the broad definition used by ShootingTracker.com, no calendar week during Obama's second term has passed without a mass shooting incident. In the 274 days between the first of the year and the beginning of October, there were 294 mass shootings, claiming hundreds of lives. Before Roseburg, it was Roanoke, Virginia. Before Ronaoke it was Lafayette, Louisiana. And so on. Highly visible, these shootings are the focal point for most of our national conversation on gun control. The last serious legislation for universal background checks came just after the murder of 20 6- and 7-year-olds and six adult staff members at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, which resulted in national calls for new action. (It died in the Senate at the hands of a GOP-led and blue-dog Democrat-supported filibuster.) But as much as the attention makes sense, it also obscures that second truth about gun homicides in America: Ending mass shootings won't solve the problem. Between 2009 and 2013, 44,077 people were murdered with guns, according to the FBI. Just a fraction of those came from Roseburg-style incidents. Many more were domestic violence against women. But the large majority involved the deaths of men, and of those, most involved poor black Americans in inner cities and other marginalized areas. ""From 1980 to 2013, 262,000 black males were killed in America,"" writes Jeffrey Goldberg for the Atlantic. In general, when we talk about gun homicide in the United States, we are largely talking about violence between poor black men. Too many observers treat this as intractable problem, a product of pathologies and indifference. ""[Obama] also should have spent 15 minutes on training the [black] community to stop killing each other,"" said former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani after President Obama spoke on Ferguson last year. But there is no pathology or uniquely black problem. Like most social problems, high homicide rates in poor black communities--""black-on-black crime""--are a product of specific, contingent inputs: ""[s]egregation, economic isolation, and the flawed workings of American criminal justice,"" writes journalist Jill Leovy in Ghettoside: A True Story of Murder in America. Segregation forces intimacy and creates conflict, while economic isolation leads to illegal markets--like the drug trade--where there is no legal recourse for disputes. These, by themselves, are conditions under which homicide flares. But there's also the particular history of segregated black communities and law enforcement. For most of America's post-Emancipation history, officials were indifferent to violence against blacks, either from whites or from other blacks. ""When people are stripped of legal protection and placed in desperate straits, they are more, not less, likely to turn on each other,"" says Leovy. Taken together, these conditions breed violence, which is why black homicide rates have always been higher than ones for whites. (Or why, to move away from race, the American frontier was defined by its violence--isolation with desperation and without strong legal authority equals homicide.) To all of that, add guns. Patchwork gun laws within and between states means there's no way to keep guns out of a given area. Chicago, for instance, has strict gun laws. But surrounding counties and states don't. Cheap firearms--through theft, illegal sales, or extended networks of legal buyers--make their way into the city, where they're used for crime. And while guns don't necessarily cause violence, they (predictably) increase the lethality of conflicts, causing more deaths. Put simply, our focus on Roseburg-style shootings--as much it makes sense--obscures the extent to which most victims of gun homicide are poor, black, and live in America's most isolated communities. Moreover, the steps we could take to reduce those homicides--removing millions of handguns from circulation, preventing illegal sales, reforming police departments to solve more homicides (and deter potential shooters)--don't have much to do with ending mass shootings. Likewise, the steps to reduce mass shootings--universal background checks, stronger mental health services, liability insurance for gun owners--won't do much to reduce the nation's gun homicide problem (although it could reduce our other gun problem--suicides). Here, it's tempting to quip about the lack of black faces in our gun conversations and how America isn't energized--or seemingly interested--in bringing its wealth and power to bear on the problems of inner cities. But, as Obama made clear in his Thursday remarks, Americans aren't prepared to do anything against gun violence, period. We're not just captive to broken systems and implacable opposition; we're either paralyzed in the face of one kind of atrocity or blind to another, much more common one.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/why_jeb_bush_s_first_attack_on_marco_rubio_can_t_possibly_work.html	"It's a weekday, which means that Jeb Bush's presidential campaign isn't going very well. He's stuck in single-digit polling territory and his favorability ratings are poor. He's running around defending himself after saying weird things about black people. His backers, financial and otherwise, are pressuring him to either make a move in the polls soon or be fed to a pack of feral dogs in a Fort Lauderdale alley. It's always one thing or another for the Joyful Jeb! campaign. Fuming donors aside, Bush's more long-term existential threat is Sen. Marco Rubio, who positioned himself well over the summer to eat Jeb's lunch when the right time came. He has begun to do so. Rubio's sky-high popularity ratings are translating into improved polling numbers following two impressive debate performances and the late-summer evaporation of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Rubio is poised to take over much of Walker's fundraising apparatus, too. By the look of things, you might surmise that Rubio is beginning his move to box out Bush as the preferred candidate of the ""establishment."" You would be right. Rubio and Bush are close friends, as most news articles about them over the past year have mentioned. The specific term used most often to describe Bush's relationship to Rubio is ""mentor."" One would imagine, since Rubio is good at national politics and Bush is not, that Rubio may have had more than one ""mentor"" along the way. But Bush, who had refrained from attacking his supposed mentee this campaign season, now finds it politically useful to maintain the narrative that Rubio would just be another ho-hum Florida collector of maxed-out credit cards had the avuncular Jeb never shown him the path of worldly instruction. Since there would be no Marco without Jeb, the logic goes, Jeb should get to be president first. That's the subtext of a new line of attacks Bush has been introducing in media appearances since Wednesday. ""I'm a proven leader,"" he told CNN. ""I disrupted the old order in Tallahassee. I relied on people like Marco Rubio and many others to follow my leadership and we moved the needle."" Bush equals leader, Rubio equals follower. Get it? He had more on whether Rubio is ready to lead the country: ""Look we had a president who came in and said the same kind of thing--new and improved, hope and change--and he didn't have the leadership skills to fix things."" Bush reiterated this Rubio-Obama comparison during an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Thursday. He claimed he meant no insult to his former child-apprentice, now rival, and then offered the exact same jabs. ""I think I have the leadership skills to fix things and that's my strength,"" he said. ""Marco Rubio was a member of the [Florida] House of Representatives when I was governor and he followed my lead and I'm proud of that."" When Bloomberg's John Heilemann followed up with a question about whether Rubio ""has the leadership skills to fix things,"" Bush said, ""It's not known."" And you know who else's leadership skills were not known? ""Barack Obama didn't end up having them and he won an election based on the belief that people had that he could, and he didn't even try."" This marks the beginning--just a trial heat, really--of what ultimately could be a comically expensive battle between the establishment's top two horses. (More specifically, between their super PACs.) Let's interpret the new line against Rubio as a trial balloon even if--as with many things Jeb!--it was probably something that he just heard himself spontaneously saying to a cable news personality and decided to run with it. As with many things Jeb! (again), this line of attack is weak. You can tell that your new assault may lack the proper potency when it is prefaced with various compliments. That has always been a structural problem with the ""but he's inexperienced!"" approach. Because before getting to that ""but,"" you have to acknowledge that Rubio is youthful, fresh, and charismatic: things that are generally attractive in politicians. Conservatives of all stripes have expended many breaths over the last six years complaining about how President Obama's inexperience contributed to his lackluster performance on the job. But the reason many of them say this is because they do not like Barack Obama and his policies. They use that criticism because they use every available criticism. That Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio are doing so well right now--and Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, Rick Santorum, and others aren't--suggests that the GOP isn't actually looking for Daddy to come along and clean up the kid's mess. It's a lot like how Democrats wailed about how unprepared for the task Jeb's brother was when he sought the presidency, and then turned around and nominated Barack Obama to succeed him. ""Experience"" and ""proven leadership"" haven't been winners for a long while. Bill Clinton's 1992 election over George H.W. Bush shattered its potency for good. Experience didn't get Al Gore across the finish line in his bid against the second Bush. In 2008, Hillary Clinton and John McCain both pounded Obama on his inexperience; no one cared. Over a vetting process encapsulating some dozens of debates and a nearly two-year presidential campaign, Obama demonstrated to the American people that he had the requisite grasp of policy issues to match his strong set of political skills and qualify him for the job. Rubio, in his pitch to Republican primary voters, is doing the same. The Bushes usually come into elections with stocked arsenals of vicious, often fabricated tricks awaiting deployment. It won't be long until they'll be dispatching hitmen, fingerprint-free, to spread rumors about how Marco Rubio has tons of secret anchor babies in his basement, or something. They might as well pivot to those now. The ""inexperienced"" attack is a loser."	Why Jeb Bush's First Attack on Marco Rubio Can't Possibly Work	['Rubio', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'McCain']	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/ted_cruz_is_officially_the_most_cynical_man_in_the_presidential_race.html	"You know that Ted Cruz's brinkmanship tactics have gone too far when even Rand Paul, the original Mr. Filibuster, is fed up with him. On Tuesday, Paul criticized his fellow senator and Republican presidential candidate for his excessive intransigence, signaling that Cruz's stature within that body has reached a new low. ""Ted has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names, which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate,"" Paul said. ""As a consequence he can't get anything done legislatively."" That an anti-establishment figure like Paul is now standing up to defend the decorum of the Senate demonstrates the extent to which Cruz has antagonized his colleagues. That process reached a head Monday night, when frustrated senators coordinated to block Cruz from even speaking. ""It's easy to make Washington and the establishment and leadership a punching bag,"" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn explained afterwards. ""There's [not] much mystery"" as to why Cruz is quixotically thrusting himself front and center and urging senate leaders to ""fight"" in the latest government funding debate, Cornyn added. (Everyone has begun to recognize Cruz's attention grabs for what they are.) Fight how? This is the question that nearly all of Cruz's Senate chums want him to answer. Most directly, Sen. Kelly Ayotte--a New Hampshire Republican up for re-election this cycle--sent Cruz a letter demanding answers. ""During the last government shutdown, I repeatedly asked you what your strategy for success was ... but I did not receive an answer,"" the letter read. ""I am again asking this question and would appreciate you sharing your strategy for success with all of us before any damaging government shutdown becomes imminent."" Cruz will not be able to shut down the government in the immediate term after a temporary funding measure passed in Congress Wednesday, but he'll get another chance around Christmastime. Again, he will use his platform as a presidential candidate to espouse myths that Republicans can enact their entire ideological agenda through the government funding process and win a shutdown battle over positions that are broadly unpopular. Again, he will frame Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's and likely House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's objections to a shutdown as a matter of weakness and ""surrender politics."" Again, he will alienate all of his congressional colleagues--save his few dozen friends in the ""Tortilla Coast Caucus"" on the other side of the Capitol--and he will argue that it's because they're creatures of Washington. He will tell the public that the government can work the opposite of the way it's designed to work rather than speaking honestly. He will try to screw things up to boost his own political prospects--and he will do so knowingly. Ted Cruz is the most cynical candidate in the presidential race. Congratulations to him--it's an achievement. It's one thing for Donald Trump, Bobby Jindal, or some other candidate from outside Washington to rail against congressional Republicans for not ""fighting"" hard enough against the simple mathematical problems that prevent them from repealing the Affordable Care Act or defunding Planned Parenthood. It's quite another for Cruz, a sitting senator, to use his powers as an elected official to hold up the nation's basic business on crusades that have approximately zero chance of success. If he wants to give rousing speeches on the Senate floor, fine. But the work he does to foil the Senate leadership's plans (forcing them to develop months-long strategies to counter him), while stringing along like-minded House Republicans who maintain veto power over their own leadership, is a deeply mischievous ploy. He's been at it a long time. What's worse, Cruz's entire bad-faith campaign and its tactics are based on a contradiction: that this Congress should be able to achieve Republican goals without holding the White House but Republicans need a fighter like him in the White House to achieve those goals. In a recent op-ed, Cruz attempted to directly refute the leadership position that there's little Republicans can do without the presidency or a veto-proof Congressional majority:"	It's Official: Ted Cruz Is the Most Cynical Man in the Presidential Race.

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/next_speaker_of_the_house_presumptive_speaker_kevin_mccarthy_is_facing_the.html	"The post-John Boehner shuffle in the House of Representatives is beginning to take shape as an outline of the future GOP leadership structure started to emerge on Tuesday. First, the current majority leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, is not facing any serious challengers for the speakership. (No offense meant to his one declared opponent, Rep. Daniel Webster, the third-term Floridian who's reportedly distributing copies of his ""Widgets, Principles and Republicans"" treatise in an effort to woo colleagues.) The race to replace McCarthy as majority leader is setting up to be more of an entertaining spectacle. Since McCarthy is probably not conservative enough for the same members who just claimed John Boehner's scalp, House conservatives would like one of their own as the new majority leader. But who is acceptable? They have been fickle about this. Rep. Steve Scalise, the current majority whip, is running for the job. Recall that Scalise was installed to the leadership last year as the supposed leadership liaison to the conservative flank. (You may also remember Scalise for his great survival skills.) But now conservatives may be looking for someone else. How about Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price? He earned the endorsements of well-respected conservative Reps. Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling on Monday--enough for the Washington Examiner to report that conservatives might throw their support to McCarthy for speaker if they got Price for majority leader. But that was Monday. By Tuesday morning conservatives were talking up Rep. Trey Gowdy as the One True Conservative who could save America as the House's second most powerful figure. As chair of the select committee on Benghazi, Gowdy has already been tasked with dragging out an investigation into Hillary Clinton through November 2016. Is it really worth plucking him away from that important task? By Tuesday afternoon, he had decided no. So now, the far-right flank will have to rally around some other previously unexamined vessel of pure, uncut conservatism. They'll figure it out one way or another. But then what? Let's take a peek at the calendar. The Senate is expected to pass a continuing resolution funding the government through mid-December by Wednesday morning, and the House should rubber-stamp it shortly thereafter. That kicks the Planned Parenthood funding debate into the longer-term negotiations over the remainder of the fiscal year. The debt ceiling will also need to be raised this fall. A gentle request from a concerned citizen: It would be really nice if John Boehner could call that up before he flees Washington. That brings us to mid-December, the next funding deadline, and the first major test for the to-be-determined leadership team likely helmed by McCarthy and some super-duper conservative to be named later. What's this flashy new A-team's strategy for resolving that impasse? According to the Washington Post, the master plan appears to be more angry, vague hand-waving: ""Conservatives now view December as the better time to challenge the president because there will be a new House GOP leadership team in place that they will pressure to take a tougher approach."" House conservatives' new plan sounds a lot like their old plan, the same one they've been running for years: the Tougher Approach. Barring a change, presumptive Speaker McCarthy and his conservative sidekick will still be expected to defund Planned Parenthood during the government funding process in December. They'll also be expected not to cede Democrats one single demand in spending negotiations elsewhere. This is the stuff from which problems are made. Any sort of stringent ideological demand that 40-odd House conservatives make in exchange for their votes--like the defunding of Planned Parenthood--will be either filibustered in the Senate or vetoed. ""Fighting"" from there on out will mean a government shutdown and a battle in the court of public opinion at the start of a presidential election year, for which Republicans will likely be blamed. The GOP made a valiant effort on Tuesday to begin the narrative crafting by grilling Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards during a House Oversight Committee hearing, but that won't likely change the basic dynamic that makes shutdowns a losing issue for Republicans. Still, the Tougher Approach in this case will presumably mean House Republican leaders refusing to give ground on their demands until the public turns in their favor. ""We can win if we take the case to the American people. Show the Planned Parenthood videos. Stand united,"" wrote Sen. Ted Cruz--a presidential candidate who would certainly increase his profile and possibly his standing among conservative voters by helming a shutdown shortly before the Iowa caucus--in a Politico op-ed last week. ""If Obama follows through on his threat to veto funding for the federal government, we should force him to defend that radical position. Planned Parenthood is a private organization, not even part of the government. That's worth repeating."" Here's a contrary point worth repeating: Federal funding for Planned Parenthood is supported by 65 percent of the public. Only 29 percent of the public is against it, but that includes 59 percent of Republicans, which could only increase pressure for a showdown. The Tougher Approach, should House conservatives apply the same pressure on their new leaders that they applied on Boehner, would call for an open-ended government shutdown over an issue on which the public, already conditioned to blame Republicans for shutdowns, strongly disagrees with the Republican position. It would behoove McCarthy and whoever is elected as majority leader to resolve this funding issue during the leadership elections so there are no surprises heading into December--for everyone's sake. McCarthy can try to glide into the speaker's chair by not upsetting anyone along the way, but that's only going to prop up expectations, which will be sure to upset conservatives all over again in a couple of months."
