Bernie Sanders headed into the final Democratic debate before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary with somewhere between a 16 and 30 percentage point lead against Hillary Clinton, depending on which cheaply conducted poll with an unprofessionally large margin of error you choose to trust. We're going to wager that what Sanders has, in spite of the shakiness of the polls, is a significant lead and one that doesn't appear to be wavering following Clinton's narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses. That meant that if Clinton wants to either win the New Hampshire primary, or place above a well-spun bar of expectations (single-digit loss!), she needed to land a number of serious blows against Sanders Thursday night. She did not. On the issue of whether she is a ""progressive""--something Sanders and his campaign have (quite aggressively) questioned in word and tweets--Clinton reiterated the retort she debuted in Wednesday night's CNN town hall: Since when did you become the ""gatekeeper"" of progressivism? ""Under his definition,"" she said, ""President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street. Vice President Biden is not progressive because he supported Keystone. Even the late, great Sen. Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for [the Defense of Marriage Act]."" As she is wont to do, Clinton was trying to bang Sanders over the head with President Obama's popularity among Democrats. Sanders was able to respond in a measured way that reinforced his belief that he does not, in fact, hate President Obama: ""We are in much better shape today than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. That's the fact. Do I think President Obama is a progressive? I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues. But I think he's done an excellent job."" One of the reasons Sanders did so well was the favorability of the debate subjects during prime viewing time. Several segments in the first hour were devoted to Wall Street, Clinton's closeness to the financial sector, and her paid speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs, which she delivered, as she said, when she hit the ""speaking circuit"" following her tour at the State Department. Clinton, rather than coyly trying to deflect the importance of those speeches, tried to hit Sanders the hardest she has in any debate so far. ""I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be,"" she said. But now it's time to get nasty!"	Bernie Wins the MSNBC Debate, Narrowly

Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders are fresh off Schrodinger's Iowa caucus, in which they both won and lost. (Technically, Hillary won--but there's some fuzziness.) Now, Clinton and Sanders will be trying to consolidate support ahead of next week's New Hampshire primary and the impending Nevada caucus. Thursday's debate, which will be the first without Martin O'Malley, who has dropped out of the race, is a bit of surprise: It wasn't a sure thing until the candidates agreed to terms Wednesday. Pundits and politicos will be watching closely as the two candidates work to win voters in an increasingly competitive primary season. Below are their live tweets, drawn from a list of top accounts curated by Slate. Those who lean left are on the left; those who lean right are on the right. Enjoy the instant spin!

He's more conservative than most Americans, but he's not mean like Donald Trump or belligerent like Sen. Ted Cruz. Rubio has shown signs of constructive pragmatism, most notably when he sponsored bipartisan immigration reform legislation in 2013. And Rubio, unlike Trump or Cruz, seems to care about getting things right. He used to accuse Hillary Clinton of publicly blaming the Benghazi attack on an anti-Muslim video. Then reporters pointed out that Clinton had never done so. Since then, Rubio has dropped the charge. Rubio's reasonableness makes him a good instrument for measuring Obama Derangement Syndrome--an inversion of what conservatives used to call Bush Derangement Syndrome. Here's how it works: Once President Obama says something, no matter how sensible or mundane it is--or how closely it mirrors what Republicans used to say--Republicans must repudiate it. Today, this disease so fully consumes the GOP that even the more mainstream Republican candidates find themselves saying things that ought to embarrass them. That's what Rubio has just done on the subject of Muslim Americans. The latest outbreak of ODS began Wednesday afternoon, when President Obama visited a mosque and embraced Muslims as part of the American family. Obama wasn't the first president to do this: George W. Bush delivered the same message at a mosque six days after the 9/11 attacks. But now that Obama was saying it, Rubio had to attack it. Hours after Obama's speech, Rubio was asked at a town hall in New Hampshire how he would manage the presidency. In response, Rubio accused Obama of dividing Americans ""along ethnic lines and racial lines and economic lines and religious lines.""

What the results in Iowa make clear, though, is that super PAC spending alone doesn't ensure votes. Although Jeb Bush's leading super PAC has burned through tens of millions of dollars in his name, he came in sixth, behind even Rand Paul (who has since dropped out) and earned only one delegate. Other candidates who have had comparatively strong super PAC support, such as Govs. John Kasich and Chris Christie, earned one and zero delegates, respectively. Even so, expect many more millions to be spent before the primary season is over. We've updated the interactive below to show data through Feb. 1 and will update it regularly throughout the season. Original article, Nov. 17, 2015: American voters won't cast their ballots in presidential primaries until next year, but super PACs have already spent nearly $63 million influencing this election. In the interactive below, we've illustrated this electoral money war for some of the biggest (and best funded) candidates. Each blob that flies across the screen represents a chunk of money a super PAC spent to either attack (in red) or bolster (in green) the target candidate. Small blobs represent small purchases, such as online advertising and press releases, while big blobs represent bigger buys, such as TV ads. Pause the interactive and click a blob to learn more about the expenditure it represents. Super PACs can accept limitless donations from virtually anyone and spend unlimited amounts on political advertising, as long as they do not coordinate with a campaign. Although super PACs must eventually disclose their donors, they can accept cash from ""dark money"" organizations, which aren't required to reveal their backers. Nearly 40 people have donated more than $1 million each to super PACs in this election season already, with three donating $10 million or more. As the interactive shows, multiple conservative super PACs have been steadily barraging Hillary Clinton since April. But it's also clear that money alone can't win the White House--just ask Jeb Bush. Since his poll numbers started to sink, the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise USA has spent $32 million trying to inject new life into his campaign, but to no apparent avail. Gov. Chris Christie, Gov. John Kasich, and Sen. Rand Paul have received millions in super PAC support but lag behind the others in the polls. Leading the pack instead is Donald Trump, the target of the most negative spending among the Republican candidates, and Ben Carson, who has seen comparatively little super PAC support. Meanwhile, Sens. Marco Rubio's and Ted Cruz's poll numbers continue to rise even as their super PACs, which have raised tens of millions of dollars, hold their fire. (Only a single expenditure about Carly Fiorina, not shown, was filed: $6.33 for ""Copywriting for email communications,"" filed by a super PAC supporting Planned Parenthood.) This is only the beginning. In 2012, outside groups spent $653 million influencing the presidential election. Slate will continue to update this interactive throughout the election. A few caveats: PACs do not need to report expenditures on any communication that cost less than $10,000, though some do anyway to play it safe with the confusing election laws. The graphic does not, therefore, show all super PAC spending, but it does capture major media buys. Also not shown here is spending from dark money groups, known legally as 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(6) nonprofits. They can do more than just funnel funds into super PACs; they can also raise unlimited money from anyone and spend unlimited money running political ads as long as the nonprofits' political activities do not comprise the majority of their spending and as long as their ads are ""issue"" ads that do not explicitly tell people to vote for or against a particular candidate--although such ads often blatantly smear or praise politicians. These groups never need to disclose their donors, and unlike super PACs, they disclose their expenditures only through their tax filings, which often become available after the election ends. In the 2012 election cycle, these groups accounted for 37 percent of independent spending across all elections. See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

""Cruz Wins in Iowa, Dealing Trump a Humbling Loss,"" read the banner headline. Immediately below, the subhead asserted, ""Rubio Finishes in Strong Third Place."" It seems illogical to conclude that a second-place finish is a ""humbling loss"" while finishing third--just so we're clear, worse than second--is ""strong."" But here we have a textbook example of that venerable election year phenomenon known as the expectations game. How does the game work? Polls in the lead-up to the caucuses (polls that were, in hindsight, wrong) suggested Donald Trump would win outright, and thus anything less was considered a disappointment. Meanwhile, Marco Rubio ""outperformed"" his poll expectations (which were also, in hindsight, not a reflection of reality), so he gets proclaimed a victor. All across the media this twisted logic bloomed. The Washington Post deemed Rubio a ""winner"" because ""he made a strong run at Trump,"" while Trump got classified as a ""loser"" whose second-place finish (again, you understand, ahead of Rubio) might represent ""a catastrophic hole that will bring the whole enterprise down."" Politico's Dylan Byers tweeted that Rubio had secured a ""win for [the] establishment"" and that Trump had suffered a ""clear loss."" Further examples abound. Rubio himself, in a postcaucus address that sounded a lot like a victory speech, proudly embraced his tertiary status. ""So this is the moment they said would never happen,"" he began, beaming. ""For months they told us we had no chance ... but tonight here in Iowa the people sent a very clear message."" Indeed. Very clearly, more of them voted for Trump. A couple thousand more of them. It's a collective hallucination. Like we've all made a pact to disregard the actual vote tallies. You could plausibly argue that Trump and Rubio finished in a dead heat, since each garnered seven precious Iowa delegates. But Trump as obvious, clear-cut loser? A visitor alighting from a distant solar system might make befuddled inquiries regarding our planet's conception of math, and ordinal numbers, and ""losing."" The Iowan Trump voter, too, is surely miffed at this willful misinterpretation. Does her Trump vote count less than her neighbor's vote for Rubio? Yes, polls suggest that Rubio voters decided in the final few days before the caucuses, while Trump voters had made up their minds weeks or months ago--but in our political system, one vote remains one vote no matter how early the voter resolves her allegiances within her own mind. Trump backers might also fairly note that their squad is not some small, ragtag faction. There were 45,000 votes for the cotton candy-haired cretin--more than George W. Bush notched in Iowa in the 2000 caucuses. And a second-place finish is far from a death knell: Eventual GOP nominee Mitt Romney finished second in Iowa in 2012. So why this strange compulsion to invent a storyline that doesn't conform to the raw data? It could be in our nature: There exists social science evidence suggesting that third place feels somehow better than second place. Third place is redolent of fierce effort narrowly paying off--you've barely clawed your way onto the podium and are thrilled merely to be relevant. Second place, by contrast, feels more like ""not first place."" But at its core, the expectations game is a media-created phenomenon. It stems from overemphasis on predictive poll results--which, we've been reminded again and again--are notoriously unreliable, particularly in the early stages of a campaign. You can't really fault the media for reporting poll numbers. Polls offer general guidance about which candidates most intrigue voters and therefore which candidates merit further scrutiny. The problem comes when journalists use those faulty poll numbers to set faulty expectations (Trump's a newfangled electoral juggernaut!) and then rip into candidates who inevitably fail to meet them (Trump's a laughingstock!). It would be less annoying if the expectations weren't so fluid and arbitrary. What about the fact that Rubio spent substantially more time and money in Iowa than Trump did--shouldn't that make Rubio's third-place finish less impressive? Or what about the consideration for the larger time frame: Think back to last summer, when Trump was still a punchline and Rubio was a serious GOP heavyweight being groomed for the throne. Who's exceeded those expectations over the past several months? Back then, which would have seemed the bigger surprise: Rubio finishing in the top three in Iowa? Or the guy the Huffington Post relegated to their entertainment section finishing second, drawing a yuuuuge number of votes and rolling onward to New Hampshire with a solid edge in the polls there (we think)? The media's disregard for cold, hard facts in favor of an imposed narrative construct is far from a motiveless crime. Journalists crave an entertaining story arc, and a good arc requires frequent changes in fortune. Someone newly up, someone newly down--even if the ascendant fellow hasn't yet reached the heights of the fellow in mild decline. But this season's expectations game seems especially egregious. I suspect this is partly a function of anti-Trump bias. It's fair to say that, among media elites, there is general distaste for the short-fingered authoritarian. You can sense the glee brimming within that Times headline--the eagerness to humble Trump by labeling his failure to win ""humbling."" (He certainly doesn't sound humbled now.) Trump-hating Times columnist David Brooks even seized on Trump's second-place finish to write something of a eulogy. Brooks claims that Trump's supporters ""didn't show up"" (except for the 45,000--almost unprecedented in an Iowa caucus--who did) and marvels at ""the amazing surge for Marco Rubio"" (which, one more time, to be clear, surged Rubio to 2,000 fewer votes than Trump got). The most insidious thing about the expectations game is that it might matter, even though it shouldn't. Without a drumbeat of coverage insisting, in the absence of any tangible evidence, that Rubio was surging this fall--my Slate colleague Josh Voorhees, writing in October, ascribed this to ""a bored political press corps""--perhaps the high-heeled perspirator would have done even worse than runner-runner-up in Iowa. Massaged perceptions do help sway the citizenry. When the media peddles the idea that Trump is fading while Rubio is gaining steam (on its face a nonsensical proposition: There has been only one voting contest, only one real data point, and thus there's no up or down progress to plot), it can become a self-fulfilling notion. Imagined momentum turns into real momentum. It's only human: People want to align themselves with the go-getter on the make, not with yesterday's flavor. Of course, the game cuts both ways. If Trump finishes first in New Hampshire next week, amid another close three-way result, the expectations machinery will clank back into gear and start composing ""art of the comeback"" headlines (even though Trump has led New Hampshire polls for months). If Rubio finishes third again--remember, that's a ""strong"" finish--this time an identical result will mean he's missed a chance to ""consolidate"" his Iowa gains. As one of America's shrewdest strategists once said: ""Some things never change. The game is the game."" Read more of Slate's election coverage."

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/rand_paul_s_presidential_bid_was_destroyed_by_donald_trump.html	"Sen. Rand Paul, once the ""most interesting man in American politics,"" has dropped out of the Republican presidential race. You can read this as a failure of Paul the candidate, who couldn't inspire the enthusiasm of his father, Ron Paul, and couldn't reach beyond his base of young people and students. And that's true. But just as important to Rand Paul's failure was the unprecedented gravitational force of Donald Trump, the largest mass in this constellation of candidates. Paul had a simple and--when he entered the fray--persuasive theory for the GOP race. Since 2008, the Republican Party had grown more conservative, more skeptical of ""big government,"" and amenable to libertarian ideas as channeled through the Tea Party. At the same time, the GOP needed to branch out--it needed new voters. And if, as evidenced by the 2010 and 2012 elections, immigration reform was off the table, then Republicans had to find a way to grow the party without compromising key ideals. Paul had an answer: You meet key demographic groups where they were with policies that directly touch their lives. And in particular, Paul argued, Republicans had to repair their long and complicated relationship with black Americans. ""Several generations of black voters have never voted Republican and are not very open to even considering the option,"" he confessed in a 2013 speech to students at Howard University. Paul's pitch, emphasized in that speech, was criminal justice reform. ""We should stand and loudly proclaim enough is enough. We should not have laws that ruin the lives of young men and women who have committed no violence,"" he said. ""That's why I have introduced a bill to repeal federal mandatory minimum sentences. We should not have drug laws or a court system that disproportionately punishes the black community."" As a vehicle for this message, the Kentucky senator wasn't perfect. His address at Howard, for instance, was a little tone deaf, explaining the history of black voters and the GOP as if politics students at the nation's premier university for black Americans (in Washington, no less!) were ignorant of the relationship. Likewise, Paul wouldn't compromise partisan priorities like voter identification, even if opposition would build bridges with black Americans. And Paul had his own difficult history in the form of his father's background with racists and neo-Confederates, and his opposition (later qualified and obsfucated) to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on principled--if, to many observers, unconvincing--libertarian grounds. Still, unique among the GOP's presidential aspirants, Paul tried. As late as Monday, before the Iowa caucus, Paul was touting his plans to wind down the drug war to a group of students at Iowa State University. Under better circumstances, it might have borne fruit. But Trump changed the game. Whereas Paul wanted to appeal to minority voters, Trump aimed to antagonize them, sharing racist and anti-black memes on Twitter and warning voters of a dangerous, brown-skinned menace. With his campaign against Latino immigrants and Muslims writ large, Trump amassed a huge following--large enough to give him an impressive second-place finish in the Iowa primary. But Trump's most important impact is to introduce a new kind of Republican heterodoxy to American politics. Where Paul pushed a conservative-libertarian fusion as the solution to the GOP's electoral problems, Trump has shown that the real alternative is a kind of white nationalism, unmoored from conservative governing principles and dedicated to protecting the United States from nonwhite others, internal and otherwise. Republican voters have flocked to this, and in response, mainstream Republican candidates have aped the approach. For months, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz praised Trump in between his furious denunciations of the ""Washington cartel."" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, facing pressure from Trump in New Hampshire, has abandoned his once sunny disposition, railing against ISIS and other foreign threats with apocalyptic fervor and echoing Trump's claim that ""our military is a disaster"" and ""our country is run by incompetent people."" ""It's now abundantly clear,"" declared Rubio at a New Hampshire campaign stop in January, ""Barack Obama has deliberately weakened America. He has made an intentional effort to humble us back to size, as if to say: We no longer need to be so powerful because our power has done more harm than good."" Cruz and Rubio aren't minor figures. They are the leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. Which is to say that, through force of rhetoric and personality, Trump has pulled the GOP toward his person and shaped it in his image. He has done, in other words, what Paul couldn't do, because GOP voters didn't want to do it. Or at least, not on Paul's terms. Paul's terrible miscalculation was to believe that Republican voters--or at least a critical mass of them--cared about ideology. That they wanted someone who was consistent and could bridge the gaps between libertarians and conservatives, while winning new and old groups to the Republican fold. But they don't. After almost eight years of Obama, what Republican voters want is strength and aggression. And in Trump and his imitators, that's what they have. Read more of Slate's GOP primary coverage."

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/ted_cruz_is_still_lying_about_his_immigration_record.html	"Sen. Ted Cruz, fresh from his victory in the Iowa Republican caucuses, has done it again. He has told another whopper about his record on immigration. Cruz loves to brag about defeating the ""Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan."" He uses this phrase to remind Republican voters that in 2013, Sen. Marco Rubio--who's now jockeying with Cruz for the GOP presidential nomination--sponsored legislation that would have offered undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. As Slate demonstrated in an exhaustive time line, Cruz's story about his own role in the 2013 fight is bogus. But on Tuesday, at a town hall meeting in Windham, New Hampshire, Cruz embellished the tale. Responding to a question from the audience, Cruz spent more than 10 minutes recounting his heroism in the amnesty fight and denouncing Rubio and Donald Trump. Cruz accused Rubio of betraying his campaign promises by sponsoring the bill. Meanwhile, Cruz accused Trump of skipping the 2013 fight and then posing in 2015 as an immigration hawk. Cruz urged the town hall attendees to ignore the candidates' rhetoric and instead study the record. ""Don't listen to what we say now,"" he said. ""Look to what we did."" That's good advice. Let's start with Cruz. Let's examine what he did in 2013 and compare it with what he told the audience in Windham. Cruz told the crowd, as he often does, that the 2013 fight was ""the clarifying moment"" between him and Rubio--""what Reagan would call a time for choosing."" Cruz accused Rubio of betraying his constituents and sponsoring the bill in order to provide ""cheap labor"" for big business and ""drive down wages."" Cruz continued:"	Ted Cruz Just Lied Again
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/republicans_still_favor_donald_trump_or_ted_cruz_despite_marco_rubio_s_strong.html	"The Iowa Republican caucuses are over, and the media and the GOP establishment have announced the winner: Sen. Marco Rubio. That's an odd verdict, since Rubio came in third, trailing Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. But Rubio gets the plaudits for several reasons. He did better than expected, finishing close to Trump. Rubio also gives the media a three-man race, which makes the election more suspenseful and exciting. He gives party leaders an option they find more palatable. And he validates what pundits expected all along: that Trump would fade, that Cruz is too harsh, and that in the end, the GOP would turn to a more electable nominee. Rubio's late surge in Iowa illustrates his appeal as a candidate. But we knew about his appeal all along. The flaw in predictions of a Rubio nomination was never Rubio. The flaw was that Rubio isn't running in a general election or in the Republican Party of 2000. He's running in the Republican Party of 2016. And there's little evidence that today's Republican electorate--as opposed to the media or the party establishment--is sufficiently unhappy with the top two finishers, Cruz and Trump, to nominate the guy who's running third. Since the beginning of January, seven national pollsters--CBS/New York Times, NBC/Wall Street Journal, Fox News, CNN/ORC, ABC/Washington Post, Investor's Business Daily/TIPP, and  Monmouth University--have examined the state of the race. In these surveys, when Republicans and Republican leaners were asked which candidate they supported, the percentage who picked Trump or Cruz ranged from 52 to 60. (The Iowa results fell at the low end of this range: Cruz and Trump together drew 52 percent of Republican caucusgoers.) So most Republicans don't just find Trump or Cruz acceptable; they prefer at least one of these two candidates as their first choice. When second choices are factored in, Cruz and Trump do even better. In the four polls that have asked that question, Trump got the first- or second-choice votes of 46 percent of Republicans. Cruz got the votes of 41 percent. Nationally, Rubio has been a distant third. He averaged 11 percent in the seven polls, compared with 35 percent for Trump and 20 percent for Cruz. But let's take Rubio's dream scenario: Jeb Bush, Gov. Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, and Gov. John Kasich drop out of the race, and all of their supporters switch to Rubio. That's another 13 percent, which bumps Rubio up to 24 percent. That's still well below Trump's 35 percent. It's not even enough to catch Cruz, if Cruz does half as well in luring voters from Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, and Sen. Rand Paul--who have been splitting another 13 percent of the Republican electorate--as Rubio, in this fantasy scenario, does among the Bush-Christie-Kasich crowd. The NBC/Journal survey tested various ballot configurations to see what would happen as the lesser candidates dropped out. When the race narrowed to five candidates--Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Carson, and Bush--Trump led the pack at 36 percent, with Cruz next at 25 percent and Rubio trailing at 19 percent. With Bush and Carson removed, the remaining three still finished in the same order: Trump 40 percent, Cruz 31 percent, Rubio 26 percent. Finally, the pollsters removed Cruz from the ballot, giving Rubio his dream matchup against Trump. Trump won it, 52 percent to 45 percent. In post-Iowa ads and interviews, Rubio's campaign, a pro-Rubio super PAC, and the candidate himself are pitching him as the only candidate who's broadly acceptable to Republicans. That's an exaggeration. The ABC/Post survey did find that when Republicans and Republican leaners were asked whether they would ""accept"" each candidate or ""find him unacceptable"" as the nominee, Rubio ranked first, with only 22 percent calling him unacceptable. But Cruz did almost as well, with a 26 percent rejection rate. And Trump wasn't far behind: 65 percent said he was acceptable; 32 percent called him unacceptable. The NBC/Journal survey posed a slightly different question: whether ""you could see yourself supporting that person for the Republican nomination."" On that question, Rubio outscored Trump, but Cruz outscored Rubio. Twenty-eight percent of Republicans said they couldn't support Rubio. Only 25 percent said they couldn't support Cruz. The CNN/ORC poll went for a visceral reaction. It asked Republicans and Republican leaners whether they would be enthusiastic, satisfied, dissatisfied, or upset if Trump, Cruz, or Rubio were the nominee. More respondents said they'd be upset if the nominee were Trump than if it were Rubio. But when the dissatisfied and upset respondents were pooled, Trump outscored Rubio, getting a thumbs down from 31 percent, compared with Rubio's 37 percent. Cruz beat Rubio in both categories: His nomination left fewer respondents dissatisfied and fewer upset. The Fox poll asked the bluntest question: ""Are there any Republican candidates you would refuse to vote for against the Democrat in November?"" The question was asked without naming the candidates. Trump scored the worst: Fifteen percent of Republicans said they wouldn't vote for him. But Cruz and Rubio scored about the same, earning rejections from 6 and 5 percent of Republicans, respectively. In the CBS/Times poll, Rubio led the field in acceptability: Only 12 percent of Republicans said they wouldn't support him if he were the nominee, compared with 16 percent who wouldn't support Cruz, and 18 percent who wouldn't support Trump. But Trump and Cruz outscored Rubio in enthusiasm among Republicans, and Cruz beat Rubio on values and temperament. Only 24 percent of Republicans said Cruz didn't share their values, compared with 27 percent who said Rubio didn't share their values. And only 22 percent said Cruz lacked the ""temperament and personality to be a good president,"" compared with 25 percent who said Rubio lacked these qualities. Rubio is an attractive candidate. He's just the sort of person the Republican establishment would like to nominate. He fits what pundits expect in a successful politician, and on caucus night, he proved that he can get a lot of votes. But he didn't win. And when you look at polls of actual Republican voters, as opposed to party insiders or talking heads, it's far from clear that he can beat Cruz or Trump for the nomination. If Rubio fails, it won't be because he isn't the best candidate. He is. It'll be because the Republican electorate has lost its ability to choose wisely. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	Marco Rubio Isn't a Winner
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/donald_trump_lost_in_iowa_that_doesn_t_mean_his_candidacy_is_doomed.html	"Donald Trump's stunning and durable lead in polls of GOP primary voters raised expectations to such an extent that conservatives have been talking themselves into accepting his inevitability. In Iowa, it seemed as though Trump might attract legions of disaffected voters who'd overwhelm Republican regulars by becoming caucus-goers for the first time. But to the surprise of many, high turnout in Monday night's caucuses did not lead to a Trump victory. Instead, Ted Cruz defeated Trump by a comfortable margin, and Marco Rubio came surprisingly close to relegating Trump to third place. Naturally, anti-Trump Republicans are delighted by the outcome in Iowa. Rubio's success holds out the possibility that the party will rally around the Florida senator, thus preventing Trump or Cruz from winning the GOP nomination. But Monday night's outcome means less than you might think for Trump's prospects going forward. Cruz often speaks of his fight against ""the Washington cartel."" Yet it is Trump who has violated almost every tenet of movement conservative orthodoxy and who has maligned professional politicians, Republican or Democratic, as the pathetic cat's paws of billionaires like himself. He has demonstrated that there is a large constituency of Republicans who are indifferent to the fight against Obamacare and the battle to cut capital gains taxes, and who are instead passionate about restricting immigration and protecting America's industries against Chinese competition. Trump is threatening to transform the ideological configuration of the GOP, and all his Republican rivals can do is react to his erratic moves. This dynamic won't suddenly come to an end because of Iowa, and it has allowed him to shape the Republican race to fit his strengths. There is a widespread belief that because Trump so often emphasizes his talent for winning, any setback will prove devastating to his all-important aura of invincibility. Keep in mind, however, that Trump lost his lead on more than one occasion in the months leading up to Iowa, yet he kept pressing ahead. Trump's reality distortion field proved even more powerful than the polls, and it may yet prove more powerful than the Iowa caucuses. The truth is that Iowa was never the most favorable terrain for Trump's brand of populism. Indeed, one could argue that Trump would have been wise to play down expectations for the caucuses, though doing so would have been very off-brand for a man loved and admired for his brashness. His real strength lies not among the devoutly religious Republican caucus-goers of Iowa, 61 percent of whom identified as evangelical or born-again Christians in an entrance poll conducted on Monday night. Rather, Trump appeals most to working-class Republicans in rural stretches of the Deep South, Appalachia, and the Northeast, and in particular to those of a more secular bent. New Hampshire, then, is likely to prove far more favorable ground for Trump than Iowa. For one thing, New Hampshire voters are far less religiously observant, and there is at least some reason to believe that Trump's aggressive style doesn't appeal to all God-fearing Christians. And though much has changed in New Hampshire since 1996, it is worth remembering that it's the state where Pat Buchanan's nationalist challenge to the GOP establishment enjoyed its greatest success. Unless something dramatic changes between now and next week, there is every reason to believe that Trump will defeat Cruz and Rubio in New Hampshire, where he enjoys a wide lead in the polls, and there is an excellent chance that he will do the same in South Carolina, where he fares almost as well. Trump also benefits from the fact that Cruz and Rubio are not the only other Republicans left standing. Despite his abysmal performance in Iowa, Jeb Bush continues to have considerable resources at his disposal, and the super PAC allied with his campaign has already devoted vast sums of money to savage attacks on Rubio, Bush's erstwhile mentee. John Kasich and Chris Christie are not nearly as well-situated financially, but they also have nothing to lose. What reason do they have not to join Bush in savaging Rubio in the days to come? Cruz will largely escape attacks from these also-rans, as they don't see him as their chief competition for the ""somewhat conservative"" vote that is so important in GOP primaries. Instead, Cruz will focus his attention on South Carolina, where he will attempt to demonstrate that his brand of populism is more hard-edged than Trump's. That will be a tough sell. Over the past few weeks, Rubio and his allies have demonstrated that Cruz has not been entirely consistent about his stance on immigration. Trump has also held a number of contradictory positions on immigration, yet his extreme rhetoric has shown that he has no interest in placating the powers-that-be. The same can't be said of Cruz or Rubio, both of whom are hemmed in to at least some degree by their dependence on wealthy GOP donors. Trump, meanwhile, has only begun to start drawing on his personal fortune to finance his campaign and to build out a larger campaign staff. So is it inevitable that Trump will emerge as the Republican nominee? Not at all. If he experiences a few more ego-bruising reversals, Trump might lose interest in the political fray. The GOP field could also winnow, and Trump could fail to build his support beyond the third of the Republican electorate that supports him. But as long as Trump wants to pursue the nomination, he will remain a formidable force. Anti-Trump Republicans who believe otherwise are indulging in wishful thinking.

Marco Rubio just won the Iowa caucuses with the support of roughly 96.4 percent of caucus-goers. Rubio himself was very much playing up that impression in his, er, ""victory"" speech, which he wisely delivered before any of the two rivals who bested him had the opportunity to speak. ""So this is the moment they said would never happen,"" he said, grinning, referring to the third-place finish that most people had been predicting for several months. ""For months, for months they told us we had no chance."" Yup, and he didn't. ""But tonight, tonight here in Iowa, the people of this great state have sent a very clear message: After seven years of Barack Obama, we are not waiting any longer to take our country back."" Well, sure, Iowa Republicans are definitely interested in electing a Republican to replace President Obama. Rubio finished third place in the Iowa caucuses, behind Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz. He is not--repeat, not--president-for-life of the United States of America and its territories just yet. The candidate who looks like a considerably better bet to be the Republican nominee after tonight is the guy who came from behind to win the Iowa caucuses, Cruz. And though he suffered a humbling defeat, Trump still heads into New Hampshire and South Carolina with significant polling leads, and in primary states that don't have such a convoluted voting process. What did Rubio do for himself, though? Plenty. He exceeded expectations through a modest surge over the past week, largely among moderate Republicans in suburban Iowa, coming a few thousand votes from pulling off an upset second-place finish. That's a strong enough signal to the center-right and the ""establishment""--aka that nefarious group of Republican cigar-chomping devils who would like a Republican to have a fighting shot in the general election--that he's their vehicle, and all pretenders had better step aside. Barring some coordinated trolling effort from New Hampshire voters who like to mess with narratives--and they are capable of it--Rubio's better-than-expected placement opens the exit door for Jeb Bush, Gov. Chris Christie, and Gov. John Kasich immediately after New Hampshire, and it pulls what should be a frightening amount of funds and official party support in Rubio's direction. The longer the crowded ""establishment lane"" battle went on, the easier it would be for either Cruz or Trump to prevail. It now doesn't look like that battle will extend South of the Mason-Dixon line, although Bush--whose super PAC spent tens of millions of dollars in Iowa just to prevent Rubio from having the exact finish he had tonight--may choose to play stubborn for a while. And yet. How much space is there in the establishment lane, still? And how many people are willing to follow behind party leaders when they still have Cruz or Trump to line up behind? We'll have to wait for new polls to come in to show how fully Rubio shattered the world following his bronze-medal finish--sorry, strong bronze-medal finish--in the Iowa caucuses. These things can shake up quickly. But consider how much space South Carolina has for the top establishment candidates according to the RealClearPolitics polling average: Rubio, Bush, Kasich, and Christie earn a combined 27 percent. That ain't much, and it's not going to be much better throughout the Southern sweep that follows on March 1. If Rubio is going to win the nomination, his path would still rely heavily on the back-end of the primary schedule and its moderate, winner-take-all states. Rubio did not win tonight. But he did well enough to clear up the center-right and begin corralling a significant chunk of the party behind his candidacy, which had been showing a frustrating inability to take off.

Ted Cruz about his role in the Senate's 2013 fight over immigration reform. As Slate recently explained, that fight is an excellent episode to study if you want to understand Cruz's peculiar views about truth and deception. By pressing Cruz about discrepancies between what he said then and what he says now, Kelly forced him to show the public, on live television, how he thinks about honesty. It wasn't pretty. Kelly showed the debate audience four video clips. In the clips, taken from Cruz's speeches during the 2013 fight, he earnestly appealed for a compromise that would allow undocumented immigrants to earn legal status--as prescribed by a bill the Senate was considering--but not citizenship. The key to the compromise was an amendment, offered by Cruz, that would have closed the path to citizenship. Cruz now denies that he ever supported legalization. Here's how he tried to explain the video clips, and what the exchange revealed about him. 1. He lies. Kelly's first clip, taken from Cruz's speech in the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 9, 2013, showed him saying, ""I don't want this bill to be voted down."" The second clip, taken from his speech to the committee on May 21, 2013, showed him saying, ""If [my] amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically."" The third clip, taken from Cruz's remarks at Princeton University on May 31, 2013, showed him saying: ""I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem."" Cruz, like everyone else at Thursday's debate, watched these clips as Kelly played them. Each clip showed him pleading for the bill. But in an interview after the debate, he denied that he had done so:"	Fox News Is Getting Really Good at Catching Ted Cruz in Lies

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/bernie_sanders_revolution_isn_t_good_enough.html	"Bernie Sanders might win Iowa. The polling shows a virtual tie, and Team Sanders has built a formidable operation for turnout and organization. An upset over Hillary Clinton is possible, if not imminent. A Sanders win in Iowa almost certainly brings one in New Hampshire, and from there, the Vermont senator--the most successful ""socialist"" candidate for president in modern memory--will have a viable path to the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. Which is why everyone, from backers to critics, should start to take Sanders' theory of change far more seriously. At base, Sanders does not believe the American public is deeply split on key issues. Instead, Sanders sees a broad and unified public that's stifled and trampled by the power of concentrated wealth, from Wall Street to big corporations and beyond. And so, when asked by a voter about gridlock and Congress--""What specifically will you do to overcome the resistance, cure the gridlock, and garner the necessary support to implement your initiatives and actually get something done in Washington?""--Sanders replied with his call to political revolution. ""If we are serious about rebuilding the American middle class, if we are serious about providing paid family and medical leave to all of our people,"" he said at Monday's Democratic forum in Des Moines, Iowa, ""the real way to do it is to have millions of Americans finally stand up and say, enough is enough, for people to get engaged in the political process, to finally demand that Washington represent all of us, not just a handful of very wealthy people. That's the way you bring about real change."" If Sanders were still the gadfly--a minor message candidate without the support to win--this would be an OK answer. But, now Sanders is a contender. He could win, and represent the Democratic Party in a presidential election. While there's no question that, as the nominee, Sanders will have detailed plans and proposals to present to the public, in office, these could crash easily against political and institutional barriers. As a contender, in other words, it's not enough to have plans for what you will do. You also need plans for how you will do it, and Sanders' ""political revolution"" isn't enough. To be fair, there's a logic to it. As Sanders adviser Tad Devine explained to the Huffington Post, ""If he does win it is going to be such a shock to the system that we will not stop the fight the day he wins, we will pursue it vigorously."" In other words, the world where a self-described socialist wins the presidency is a world of tremendous political change, where untapped and new voters flood the polls to lift Sanders--and his Democratic fellow travelers--to victory. Still, there's a problem, and the reason is straightforward. Yes, Wall Street and big business are powerful forces that, in many ways, have captured important parts of the American political system. But just as critical is the simple fact that Americans disagree. And they'll continue to disagree, even in the face of a broad political movement. The closest analogy to Sanders' revolution--the civil rights movement--inspired a backlash that reversed important gains and moved American politics to the right. To make a more practical analysis, a political revolution might put Sanders into the White House and win the Senate for Democrats, but it doesn't change the landscape of House districts--where the Republican Party holds a firm advantage--and it doesn't diminish conservative ideological intensity. In the wake of a Sanders win--as we saw in the wake of Obama's 2008 victory--conservatives will push back. There's a response to this, from Sanders himself, that makes sense. He gave it to Vox in 2014: ""I think what people end up saying is that, well, you know, I may disagree with Bernie Sanders on the abortion issue or the gay rights issue, but I know he's fighting for me and my kids.. And I happen to believe that if you are strong on those issues people will give you a little bit of slack on some of the other issues that you may disagree with."" Sanders believes that he can persuade these voters--largely white and working class--through a robust economic message that appeals to their interests, and circumvents the racial and ethnocentric dynamics that shape American politics. That he can raise ""political consciousness"" and increase turnout by a whopping 20 percentage points, with most new votes falling for him. This movement would in theory transform politics, and in itself, lower the barriers to systemic change. Underneath this is the common liberal claim that working-class whites are ""voting against their interests."" But are they? There's no doubt that some have channeled their frustration and anxiety into a kind of cultural and symbolic politics. But just as many, perhaps most, are voting on principle. Their disagreement isn't false consciousness, it's a statement of sincere belief. They vote Republican because they care about guns and abortion as issues with their own importance (they're not ""clinging"" to anything). They don't want to sacrifice their vision of an ordered society to win economic equality. They want society to reflect their values more than they want particular outcomes. Even with a viable political revolution, a President Sanders would have a hard time persuading or budging a Republican House--still intact because of a powerful partisan advantage, cemented through gerrymandering and geography--that represents radically different, opposing values. The distance between his plans and their priorities is so great that it's hard to imagine a world where the two sides can be bridged. You could pressure those Republicans through grassroots action, but they weren't elected by the ""political revolution."" Why would they listen? Indeed, when you take disagreement and political pluralism seriously, it is difficult to even conceptualize the revolution that Sanders describes and touts as the key to success. Does it emerge in America's conservative bastions? Does it overcome decades of conviction, habit, and organization, the forces that gave John McCain and Sarah Palin nearly 60 million votes in an election almost designed to give a historic victory to the Democratic Party? The truth is that, even under the best scenario for Sanders--a growing economy, huge enthusiasm, and a weak opponent--it's hard to imagine a world where he beats Obama's total from 2008. Unless the revolution is truly that--a movement that overcomes partisan barriers--it, at most, leaves liberals where they were at the beginning of 2013. President-elect Sanders would enter the White House with gridlock ahead of him. And if the conservatism and moderation of places like Virginia and Missouri are any indication, then he would also face a split in the Democratic Party, among lawmakers who backed him and his socialist label, and those who ran from it. His campaign promises to challenge the establishment. Would these moderate and conservative Democrats challenge the establishment too? If they don't, would Sanders challenge them? None of this is to say that Sanders would be a bad president, or that he couldn't accomplish his goals through appointments, regulatory agencies, and executive action. He could. But America is a divided country, tens of millions of Americans disagree with liberal ideas and priorities, and our political institutions privilege this disagreement. As such, you can't rely solely on a ""political revolution"" to pass your program. You need a real plan to show supporters--and the country--how you get from pushing universal health care or free college to making it a reality. If Sanders is going to avoid the mistakes of President Obama, then he needs to merge his movement--his outside game--with an effective inside one. Otherwise, you end up in a place that's familiar to liberals and Democrats with memories of Jimmy Carter's and Bill Clinton's first terms and Barack Obama's post-2010 presidency--where a promising administration gets mired in countless small battles, losing its focus as it dies a death of a thousand cuts. Hillary Clinton, it's worth saying, has the opposite problem. Her experience in two administrations--and her overall approach to politics--suggests an eye toward the incremental. A President Clinton would have modest goals, pursued with focus. But, as we've seen with the Obama administration and its challenges, from health care to Wall Street, there are limits to liberal incrementalism. For as much as it shrinks the chance of failure, it also robs liberals of the ambition that they crave. It accommodates the institutional barriers to progressive change, instead of overcoming them. Pragmatism can work, but it's often bleak and uninspiring. Which is to say that, for liberals and progressives, Sanders is important. They need a figure who works to push and expand the world of the possible in a positive direction. But there's no such thing as a total victory and an unqualified win. Even with a movement at his back, Sanders needs a strategy. He needs tactics. And so far, he has neither. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Bernie Sanders Is Promising Lots of Big Things and Has No Real Plan on How to Deliver
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/donald_trump_s_fox_news_debate_ploy_might_be_a_disaster.html	"Analysts have long used the idea that Donald Trump ""speaks to American economic anxieties"" as a way to explain his popularity. One simpler explanation, though, is that he gets away with everything when the experts tell him he won't. This connotes strength on the immature, primal plane on which our national politics are conducted. When he mocks Sen. John McCain's war service, or implies that Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked pointed questions because she was menstruating, or pledges to ban members of the world's second largest religion from entering the United States, and doesn't collapse, that reinforces his image as a winner who's taking the political process by the throat. If Trump can keep breaking unwritten rule after unwritten rule and not just skate by, but thrive by doing so, moral hazard seeps in and encourages him to take bigger and bigger risks. Opting out of the last debate before presidential voting begins, because the network hosting the debate issued a snarky statement, is a very big risk. Not only because, on first glance, he looks like a petulant coward. Monday's Iowa caucuses will present us with the first opportunity to measure the real-life electoral effects of one of his tiresome, oxygen-hogging stunts. If Trump follows through on his supposedly settled vow to not participate in Thursday night's debate, he's applying more pressure on himself to win Iowa to confirm that he does, indeed, get away with everything. If he skips the debate and ends up losing Iowa, he will look like a tactical fool who made the most boneheaded, avoidable error of the cycle. The impression that he has it all figured out, experts be damned, will begin to crack. If his stunt pays off, though, that will only reinforce the impression that the rules are whatever Donald J. Trump decides they are. What's led us to this point? A number of puffed-up adult children seem to have had too many Mountain Dews and now are fighting for the sake of fighting. Trump does not like Kelly because she is, in his view, a mean lady who asks him mean questions. (Others would say she is a reporter who reads back direct quotes from his past and asks for comment.) So he tried to use his not-unreal leverage as the driver of Republican debates' record-breaking ratings to threaten nonparticipation if Kelly remained on the panel of moderators. Fox News issued a catty statement to Mediaite about how Trump was a pansy. ""We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president,"" the statement read. ""A nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings."" After that, Trump dropped out of the debate, and now he and Fox News president Roger Ailes are either not speaking to each other or pretending not to speak to each other in order to draw more attention to themselves. ""It's war,"" say the adult children who work for the other adult children who are the most dominant figures in conservative media. Based on nothing other than Trump's history of threatening boycotts before and never going through with them, I'd guess that this is something the two sides will resolve before debate time. (Probably about five minutes after this article is published, knowing my luck.) But there's still a lot of drama to be acted out. (Maybe a climactic tete-a-tete between Trump and Rupert Murdoch himself? In tuxedos? Atop the Empire State Building? Winner controls the galaxy!) But if it doesn't get worked out and Trump does not appear in the final debate, then that opens him up to quite reasonable charges that he's trying to run out the clock in Iowa against Sen. Ted Cruz. One imagines that Cruz would wield this argument against Trump in the debate, and Trump would not be there to respond. It might fire up Cruz's supporters, already the best organized in Iowa, to push their man over the top. How would that look for Trump? To have the impression out there that he had this wrapped up until he chickened out of facing both Kelly and his main rival? Trump is trying to spin this as a show of strength, as representative of the hard-line negotiating tactics that could be expected of his presidency. Were he to stay out of the debate and have Iowa taken from him in the final days, he would look like, well, a crappy dealmaker, and one who's drawn too much from a finite well of good fortune. It would be a crack-up. But if he stays out of the debate and wins Iowa anyway? He'll be in greater control than ever. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/donald_trump_really_does_have_a_lot_of_new_hampshire_supporters.html	"FARMINGTON, New Hampshire--Trump denialism has taken a comical turn in New Hampshire. The Republican Party gatekeepers who fancy themselves as controllers of vast voting blocs are baffled by the polls consistently showing Trump way out in front. Trump eschews the typical Granite State retail politics of diner meet-and-greets for a tarmac campaign focused on popping in, hosting a big rally, and then promptly flying back to New York. Can this strategy truly be working in the way that poll after poll suggests it is? Some Republicans have their doubts, because they don't see any Trump voters. The Washington Examiner's Byron York reports on the burgeoning Kaelism among Republican poobahs who were gathered at Saturday's First in the Nation Town Hall in Nashua. ""Most of the politicos in Nashua didn't deny that the polls are what they are,"" York writes. ""They just explained that they haven't personally encountered evidence that the Trump-dominated polls are accurate."" As one ""very well-connected state Republican"" says, ""I don't see it. ... I don't feel it. I don't hear it, and I spend part of every day with Republican voters."" Former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu and his wife, after racking their brains to come up with a single Trump supporter they know, say that yes, ""there's a guy down the street from them who does."" I can attest that there are indeed, more Trump supporters than the fellow down the street from the Sununus. I saw a raucous thousand or two of them fill a high school gymnasium in Farmington on Monday night. (As another reporter who's been following Trump said, a high school gymnasium counts as ""intimate"" by Trump standards.) One party official surmised to York that they don't know Trump voters because Trump voters are ""not Republicans."" Indeed, I spoke with Trump supporters last night who have either switched allegiances or been drawn into the political process through Trump's candidacy. ""We pretty much listened to everybody talk, and their bullshit, and decided there was really nobody else that would stand to the values that we were looking for in a president,"" said Michael Cassell, of New Durham, attending the rally with his wife Lisa. What issues made the decision so simple? ""A lot of it's the economy, the [border] wall, the military, welfare, the people that are on welfare, and all the immigrants, and just trying to get the world straight."" Like many Trump supporters--though not all, I found--Cassell considers Jeb Bush's campaign pathetic. He ""leaves his last name off all his signs"" because he's ""embarrassed,"" Cassell said. So who did the Cassells support in the previous election? ""It was Obama."" Sandy Woodmansee, a Trump supporter and volunteer from Epping clad in a tan suit and bowtie, has helped set up and break down every Trump event in New Hampshire ""except for Laconia."" ""I've never been involved in politics ever before,"" Woodmansee said. ""I think politicians as a whole have been screwing the middle class, both the Republicans and the Democrats. The bottom line is that I want a businessman to run the country. I can't agree with everything Donald has said, but I think he speaks from the heart and he speaks the truth."" And Trump's routine Monday evening was filled with many honest-to-goodness, heart-rending truths, largely about how wonderful he is. It began with the traditional Reading of the Polls, a roughly three-minute procedure. ""Zogby just came out, 45 to 13, can you believe that one?"" he began, to howls of approval. He briefly interrupted his list of conquests to remind the assembled that the only poll that counts is on Feb. 9, so ""you people"" must remember to vote. ""In New Hampshire: Trump 33--this is Franklin Pierce, we all know Franklin Pierce--then you have Cruz, Kasich and ... oh, there's Bush."" Trump effectively killed Bush over the summer and fall, but he still can't resist hacking away at the guy's corpse just for fun. ""What is he doing?"" Trump mocked. ""What is he doing wasting all that money? Such a waste of money! What. Is. He. Doing?"" Then he laid off for a few minutes. ""My poll keeps going up, his poll keeps going down,"" he said, despite all the money Bush is spending. ""He attacks and loses; he doesn't win."" ""He's low-energy, low-energy,"" he added for old times' sake. ""We don't need low-energy."" From there Trump began his Sen. Ted Cruz segment. ""The Canadian!"" someone in the crowd offered upon mention of Cruz's name. ""The Canadian, that's right,"" Trump said. ""That was very good! 'The Canadian.' "" He reiterated his call for Cruz to go to court to get a declaratory judgment on his eligibility for the presidency. Later in the event, when Trump was using his support of the Keystone XL pipeline as a shield against attacks on his support for eminent domain--eminent domain ""is a taking,"" he conceded--he mentioned how the pipeline was going from ""Canada, the birthplace of Ted Cruz,"" to Texas, the state Cruz represents in the Senate. ""I don't know, is there something going on there?"" Trump supporters in New Hampshire aren't just real; they're committed and there's nothing you can do to tell them to reconsider. This may be why New Hampshire Republican operatives don't see them: Because when they're not at Trump's rallies, they're in the privacy of their own homes with their minds made up.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/bernie_sanders_definition_of_progressive_is_a_very_selective_one.html	"On Monday, speaking to supporters, Hillary Clinton called herself a ""progressive who gets things done."" And on the other side of Des Moines, Iowa, at the caucus-night celebration for Sen. Bernie Sanders, his supporters booed her words as they played on television, yelling, ""She's a liar!"" The next day, the battle escalated, with advisers from both camps taking shots on the progressive question in interviews and on social media. And on Wednesday, this tug-of-war over who gets to define progressive moved to the CNN-sponsored Democratic forum in New Hampshire, where Sanders buckled down on his claim that Clinton cannot call herself a progressive. ""Some of my best friends are moderates, but you can't be a progressive and a moderate at the same time."" He continued: ""I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15 million from Wall Street."" During her time with the moderators, Clinton gave her response. ""I know who stands with me,"" she said. ""I know what I've done but I don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country."" Frankly, it's not worth the effort it would take to litigate this dispute. Progressive--like most ideological labels--is far from precise. In its original usage, it refers to a movement of middle-class reformers who sought to rationalize a complex and novel industrial economy and control a social order under pressure (and for some, under threat) from immigrants, blacks, and other perceived ""undesirables."" The original Progressives brought central banking, broader democracy, and the regulatory state to American politics. They also praised eugenics, opposed mass immigration, and--in the case of President Woodrow Wilson--resegregated the federal government. In short, they were a mixed bag. At the same time, Progressives--like their contemporaries, the Populists--were important antecedents to New Deal liberals, and modern American liberalism writ large. Important strains in liberalism--technocratic thinking, scientism, concern with corruption and ""good government""--have their roots in the Progressive movement. In present usage, progressive is largely a synonym for liberal that came into use after Ronald Reagan and the wide belief that liberal was a dirty word. To that point, centrist Democrats like Bill Clinton adopted the term to distinguish themselves from the traditional left and appeal to middle-class and suburban voters. But left and left-liberal Democrats also embraced the term, so that by the George W. Bush administration, progressive largely meant a Democrat who wasn't tied to centrist and conservative wings of the party, and who held liberal views or a generally liberal voting record. Which brings us back to the dispute between Sanders and Clinton. Sanders, who is running as an agent of radical change as much as he's running to serve as chief executive, is trying to make progressive a narrow term that hews close to his brand of ""democratic socialism."" This is not a small thing. If progressive is just a species of liberal, further to the left than most, then Clinton--as a ""moderate progressive""--fits the definition, at least in her career as a senator. Clinton was the 22nd most liberal senator in the 107th Congress, the 21st most liberal senator in the 108th, the 25th most liberal in the 109th, and the 20th most liberal in the 110th. (Barack Obama, by contrast, was the 21st most liberal senator in the 109th Congress and the 10th most liberal in the 110th.) Yes, Clinton voted for the Iraq War resolution--which looms large in Sanders' critique--but that's also true for John Edwards, who credibly ran from the left in the 2004 and 2008 presidential primaries, presaging today's progressive rhetoric with his ""Two Americas"" speech. Hillary's ""moderate progressivism"" was reflected in her priorities as a candidate in the 2008 election. Reaching back to her push for health coverage in the Clinton administration--including successful programs like the State Children's Health Insurance Program--she placed universal health coverage at the center of her campaign, along with universal pre-school education. But if progressive is defined in the image of Sanders, who used his perch on the left bank of Congress as a critical voice against conservative Republicans and Democratic Leadership Council Democrats, then Clinton falls short. On values, Clinton is a mainstream politician, who believes in the basic structure of American society. Sanders does not. Insofar that his socialism is substantive, it shows itself in his materialist worldview and Marxist belief in the primacy of economic arrangements. It's why, in debates and town halls, every question eventually comes back to inequality and the class divide. Likewise, on policy, Team Sanders is right about Clinton's record. In her career in national politics, Clinton has backed centrist priorities on welfare, crime, free trade, and bankruptcy law. And on other questions, like gay rights, she has compromised for the sake of expediency. The problem is that this is true for everyone who dives into the scrum of policymaking. Sens. Ted Kennedy and Paul Wellstone were luminaries of the Democratic left, with long-time liberal voting records. They also--following the then-consensus of the Democratic Party--backed the crime bill, and Wellstone supported the Defense of Marriage Act.* Under the Sanders rubric, they aren't progressives. But this kind of compromise is inevitable when you have attainable goals and voters with interests you have to satisfy if you want to keep or expand your influence and advance your priorities. The irony is that Sanders understands this, hence his position on guns--a compromise meant to satisfy rural voters and give him space to pursue his ideological interests. (On that note, Sanders also backed the crime bill ahead of a close election for his at-large House seat.) This isn't a knock against the senator, just a recognition that he, like Clinton, is a politician. And that he, like Clinton, will move and bend when necessary. All of this gets to something important. Sanders and Clinton have real and legitimate differences that don't stem from virtue or villainy as much as they reflect their critically different positions in American political life. After a decade as mayor of a small, liberal city--where, at most, he needed 7,000 votes to hold his seat--Sanders represented a small, homogenous state on the periphery of American life, first in the House, then in the Senate. And for as much as Vermont has changed partisan hands--it backed Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush before beginning its blue streak--it has always been a relatively liberal state, where political tension is more regional and economic (rural versus urban, labor versus capital) than ideological or racial, with a liberal Republican political class that endured until liberal Republicanism withered and died in the wake of the Reagan and Gingrich revolutions. Which is to say that, as long as Sanders could straddle the state's divides (for example, on guns) and deliver to constituents--which he did, consistently--he had space to stand as a uniquely left-wing figure in American politics. His incentives never pressed in a different direction. For Clinton, the reverse is true. With Bill, she went from being a reformist Democrat in a conservative, Southern state to trying to bridge the huge gaps in the national Democratic Party--from the racial divide between white and black Democrats to the rural and regional divides between North and South, to the divide between liberal Democratic leadership in Washington and the largely moderate party electorate. Whereas Sanders chose a path that allowed a measure of purity--in part, because he really is a socialist--Clinton chose one that forced (and often rewarded) close ties to the party consensus, something tied to her gender as well as her mainstream political beliefs. This doesn't excuse the consequences of Clinton's policy choices. But it is important context. If, at times, Sanders and Clinton feel like they're talking past each other, it's because they are--a fact obscured by this fight over the meaning of progressive and who, exactly, it covers. It's why this primary will stay angry and polarized. Clinton can't embrace a sharp, ideological message without jeopardizing her transactional and consensus-based politics, while Sanders can't do the reverse--move toward the consensus--lest he harm the strength of his appeal. It's an unusual dynamic for a party that normally chooses between different flavors of the mainstream. And, as we're witnessing in the online combat between Sanders and Clintons supporters, it's frustrating. Correction, Feb. 4, 2016: This article originally stated that Sen. Ted Kennedy voted for the Defense of Marriage Act. He voted against it. (Return.) Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."	Bernie Sanders Is Defining Progressive in a Way That Suits Bernie Sanders
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/ted_cruz_s_iowa_victory_might_end_up_being_his_high_water_mark.html	"Sen. Ted Cruz delivered a come-from-behind victory in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, surviving withering assaults from Donald Trump, the ethanol lobby, the state's popular six-term Republican governor, and the entire Republican establishment in Washington. Unlike previous late-surge winners of the Iowa caucuses, like Rick Santorum or Mike Huckabee, Cruz leaves the first voting state with all the money and resources he needs to compete for the full calendar. And he's a better politician than those guys, too. But now what? There's been an eerie sense of silence around Cruz since his Iowa victory. Much of that is because the stories of the two runners-up in Iowa, Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, are far more interesting. Everyone wanted to see how Trump, the winningest winner in the history of winning, would react to an official 0-1 career record in voting contests. (The answer: at first humbly, and then more Trumpily.) More important than his own reaction, though, will be that of his supporters. Will the ""once Trump loses Iowa and shatters his 'winner' image, his support will collapse"" theory bear out? There's evidence that that's beginning nationally, but the scant post-Iowa polling of New Hampshire so far suggests that his massive lead there is far from crumbling. The beating Trump already seems to be taking nationally, though, makes a New Hampshire victory critical. Meanwhile, Rubio's third-place Iowa ""victory"" primes him to place highly in New Hampshire and even more highly should Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush exit the race next week. The party establishment and its beloved money have already begun sidling up to Rubio--he now tops Bush in key party endorsements--and after New Hampshire and South Carolina, the support is going to reach a deluge. Rubio has real momentum in both New Hampshire and national polling, and he benefits from the winner-take-all backend of the primary schedule. It would, however, help for Rubio to actually win a state before March. Which brings us back to the reigning champ, Cruz, who's got a fat third-place finish staring at him in New Hampshire unless Bush and Christie's vicious (and coordinated!) assault on Rubio can drag the Florida senator down. Cruz's strategy in New Hampshire is to consolidate the state's modest conservative vote, but he doesn't seem to be doing so at the pace that Rubio and Trump are consolidating everyone else. ""I would advise Cruz to skip New Hampshire and go to South Carolina,"" former Mitt Romney strategist Stuart Stevens told the Daily Beast in a story titled ""Ted Cruz Will Get Crushed in New Hampshire."" ""I believe you shouldn't compete anywhere where it's not a favorable battlefield to win."" Cruz is competing in New Hampshire for the time being, though his team is setting expectations accordingly. ""I would be thrilled with second place in New Hampshire,"" Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said. ""And third would certainly be acceptable."" What awaits Cruz in South Carolina, though? The state is something of an unknown at the moment, as pollsters haven't surveyed it since Jan. 23. (Psst, pollsters: Poll South Carolina Republicans, please?) What those surveys had been showing was another dominating advantage for Trump, an average lead of 16 points, according to RealClearPolitics. If Trump is able to translate his New Hampshire lead into a victory and restore his irritatingly effective swagger, he would head into South Carolina the favorite. Barring some surprise, such as masses of Republican voters weirdly and suddenly deciding that they love Jeb Bush, this is a three-person race cut fairly closely between the three participants. In Public Policy Polling's national poll released Thursday, a hypothetical three-person race breaks down as 34 percent for Rubio, 33 percent for Trump, and 25 percent for Cruz. Cruz needs to rack up his delegates through the Southern primaries if he wants to compete with Rubio and Trump, who have greater crossover appeal for the more moderate, winner-take-all states at the end of the contest. If he follows a New Hampshire third with a South Carolina loss, he may not have the momentum he needs to carry through. Cruz should not be underestimated, though. He is a shrewd, Nixonian tactician who probably has had his path to the 2016 Republican presidential nomination mapped out on a county-by-county basis since he was 12 years old. But the trend lines are not working in his favor. Except for that immovable blob of 25 to 30 percent of Republicans that Trump lays claim to, we're seeing ""the old rules"" begin to assert themselves: the acceptably electable figure approved by a broad cross-section of the party, Rubio, is rising as votes are cast and party figures align behind him. If that reversion to the norm continues apace, then Cruz begins roughly around where he started: a factional candidate representing the hard right who will have a difficult time amassing a majority of delegates.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/bernie_sanders_brother_larry_sanders_discusses_his_brother_s_childhood.html	"OXFORD, England--Larry Sanders admires his younger brother, Bernie. Not long ago, while addressing a group of Bernie Sanders' supporters, Larry apologized for getting emotional when talking about his brother's candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, saying it made him well up ""because our parents would have been so proud."" Though more mellow and rumpled, he shares his younger brother's progressive views, old-school Brooklyn accent, and age-defying vitality. The 80-year-old Sanders is entirely supportive of his brother, whom he has always called ""Bernard""--or, he said, ""probably 'hey, you,' or maybe 'Bern.' "" After graduating from James Madison High School in Brooklyn and Brooklyn College, Sanders went to Harvard Law School but left after his second year to be with his ailing mother. (He returned and completed his degree in 1994.) In the course of traveling in the early 60s, he met his British wife, and when she became pregnant in 1968, they moved to Britain, where he has remained. A social worker and academic, Larry was inspired by Bernie's election as mayor of Burlington in 1981 and became active in local politics while raising his two children after his wife's untimely death, eventually serving as a Green Party representative on the Oxfordshire County Council. In 2015 he ran an unsuccessful campaign as the Green candidate for the Oxford West and Abingdon Parliamentary seat. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Stein: You were born in 1935 and grew up during the FDR era. Were politics discussed much at home? Sanders: Our parents were not particularly political. They didn't belong to any party, but they were idealists. There were just as many idealists in the neighborhood as there were Dodgers fans. We grew up thinking government can do good things. To somebody like my father--growing up impoverished in Poland and then coming to the States without a penny, no language, no education, no security ever--knowing that at a certain point there would be income from Social Security, it was like magic. My father was very keen on things like the gains made by labor unions even though as a [traveling paint] salesman he himself was not really helped by them. We didn't feel that we were outsiders. People say, ""Oh you grew up in an immigrant household."" Well, we did by one definition, but it didn't feel like that. We felt very American. I wondered whether the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn was at the root of your suspicion of the status quo. Certainly for me it was important in becoming a socialist, when one guy for his private profit could do so much harm and cause so much unhappiness for so many people. I thought, ""That can't be right."" I've never asked Bernard if the sale affected him. Bernie seems quite forceful and certain of his views. Was he always like that? He was much less like that as a child. If anything he was on the quiet side. He did think he knew the answer to things--in class he was frequently the kid with his hand in the air. But he was a regular guy. I think a lot of left-wing people feel somehow alienated personally and Bernard doesn't. Being an athlete at that time [Bernie Sanders was captain of the school track team] conferred status on our block, more than money and so on. So he had that acceptance and normalcy from a very early age. And was a politician from an early age. He was class president. The truth is, it was not highly coveted. But school president was a big thing. He came third out of three. The other two candidates were very polished, smiling guys. They were talking about prom or I don't know what--nothing very interesting. But Bernard had a serious platform. In the aftermath of the Korean War, there were hundreds of thousands of Korean orphans. And we read some place that school was not free. So there were kids who didn't have parents, didn't go to school, and had almost no future. Bernard came up with the idea that we could raise money for scholarships. The actual person who won the campaign adopted it, and they did raise money for a very good cause. Given that a portion of the electorate hears ""democratic socialist"" and sees the hammer and sickle being raised over the White House, do you think this label is something of a millstone around Bernie's neck? Should he rebrand himself as a something else, perhaps a New Deal Democrat? I think calling himself a socialist had a very powerful impact at the beginning of his political career because it said to people ""I think where we're going is not right and I'm not afraid to say it."" Where he's a democratic socialist is that he's firmly convinced that the center of politics is redressing economic injustice, and that is not a New Deal idea. His particular policies are very New Deal. He's not in favor of large-scale public ownership. The sense of economic insecurity in our family that I was talking about earlier is very deep, very real. What is unusual in Bernard is not that he comes from that background--tens of millions of people do--but that he hasn't forgotten it for a minute despite where he is now. He knows that economic insecurity is a psychological issue. It isn't just a lack of material things. Were you surprised when Bernie decided to run for president? He was mulling it over for at least a year, whether to go in or not, whether he should run as an independent or a Democrat, all that stuff. He didn't have to do this. He had a job he loved, and he could get re-elected forever. If somebody else--Elizabeth Warren perhaps, or somebody else with similar politics--had gone in, Bernard would not have run. The two big things were first whether somebody else would come in, and secondly whether he could do well enough. Because while he felt he could live with being humiliated if he was beaten badly--it had happened before, it could happen again, and he'd still be a senator--if somebody with his ideas was beaten badly, that would allow all the others to say, ""See, somebody with those ideas can't win,"" and all the people who needed those ideas would lose out. That is what he didn't want to happen. But so far the campaign has shown that these ideas are not seen as extreme by large numbers of people, so anybody who wants to say that these ideas can't fly is wrong. So are you prepared to be first brother? I'm working up to it. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."

19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/jeb_bush_s_super_pac_s_attack_ads_on_marco_rubio_are_backfiring.html	"Sen. Marco Rubio's rivals in the ""establishment lane"" of the Republican primary are not impressed with Sen. Marco Rubio's third place finish in Iowa. ""I listened to Marco's speech last night. You would've thought he won,"" Christie said in New Hampshire on Tuesday. ""Saying it doesn't make it so. He's got to come up here and he's got to compete and he's got to be under the microscope--and it's going to be a very interesting week for him, I can assure you that."" Christie has also been taunting Rubio as ""the boy in the bubble"" who is too scared to take questions. Jeb Bush also made a crack at Rubio for delivering a ""victory speech"" following his third-place finish. I too find it fascinating--and impressive--that Rubio's team was able to convince so much of the operative and pundit class that a third-place finish in Iowa had effectively landed him the nomination. Part of it is that this seems like the sort of thing that should be happening according to the rules of Republican presidential nominating: Voters fiddle around with outsider candidates for a time, but a more broadly acceptable, electable figure picks up traction once voters begin to cast ballots. Rubio's last-minute rise in Iowa offers the beginning of a narrative that makes sense to the political world after a six-month period that made very little sense at all. But if Bush is irritated with the way the media has bought Rubio's expectations setting, he should also target his ire at another group that helped set the standard that Rubio broke: his own super PAC, Right to Rise. Right to Rise was the biggest single spender on Iowa ads of any political entity on either side of the race. It wasn't because the super PAC harbored much hope of Bush winning, or even coming close, in the first caucus state. He came in sixth, with 2.8 percent of the vote, behind one guy who's already dropped out of the race and another who flew from Iowa to Florida to grab an extra pair of pants. Right to Rise spent a lot of that money on ads attacking Rubio. Here was one criticizing his use of a Florida Republican Party credit card for personal expenses. Here was one about how Rubio missed national security hearings and votes in the Senate to campaign for president. Who could forget Rubio as the weather vane, flippity floppin' all over the place and working with ""liberal Chuck Schumer to co-author the path to citizenship""? And then, of course, there was the Right to Rise ad about Rubio's effeminate, heeled boots. Plenty of people were confused in late December when Right to Rise began this assault by purchasing $1.4 million in ads for the missed hearings spot. Why, aside from money-burning, performance-art purposes, was Right to Rise even bothering? The idea was to stop Rubio from getting ... a strong third place finish in Iowa and the momentum that might follow. As I wrote at the time, ""But if [Right to Rise honcho Mike] Murphy's money can shove Rubio behind, say, Ben Carson in the final Iowa caucus results, Rubio would theoretically head into New Hampshire carrying loads of negative press about how the supposed leading establishment candidate can't close the deal."" Or as the Huffington Post put it: ""First and foremost, the agreement in Bush world is that the Iowa contest has become a race for third place, behind Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Donald Trump. The candidate who wins the bronze in Iowa will be able to claim to lead the 'establishment lane' of the GOP field. Bush's main competitors for this semi-dubious distinction are Rubio and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie."" In other words, Rubio got the result that Right to Rise was spending millions of dollars to prevent him from getting. Rubio did better, really: He didn't just get third, he got a strong third that was nearly a second. The expectations game may be silly in the abstract, but it concretizes if there's real money behind it. Right to Rise formalized Rubio's standard by throwing a lot of money behind its position, and now Rubio is collecting his winnings. That he prospered against such an onslaught of negative ads in the closing stretch also helps Rubio counter the impression that he's a lightweight, another of the approaches Bush (and Christie) are hoping will counter his rise. Bush's team envisions going to South Carolina regardless of his placement in New Hampshire. Bush is in decent shape in the first Southern contest, and he's supposedly going to trot out his brother, George, to campaign with him. (South Carolinians have a fond memory of George W. Bush, who salvaged his 2000 primary campaign there against a certain senator rumored to have fathered black children out of wedlock.) But if Bush goes there, he may be doing so alone. His donors and supporters in the party establishment are ready to jump to Rubio but will stick with Bush through New Hampshire largely out of loyalty. If he does not beat Rubio in New Hampshire--something that will be an even more difficult task after Rubio's Iowa performance--no attack ad is going to save him."

Donald Trump, who has had enjoyed a clear lead in national polls for months, suffered a surprising defeat to Ted Cruz and was nearly relegated to third place by Marco Rubio. But it's far from over--Trump enjoys a 22-point lead over Cruz in the next primary state, New Hampshire. We've updated the interactive below to include the latest national poll numbers, and we'll keep updating it as the primary season continues. The press is routinely accused of covering political campaigns as if they were horse races: so preoccupied with who's up or down in the polls that it ignores the substance of the campaign. To which we say: Pass the juleps! In the animation above, adapted from the one we built four years ago for the previous big derby, each horse is a candidate, with its horizontal position representing that candidate's standing in the polls. Our starting line is March 2014, when the major polling firms began releasing national polls of likely Republican voters on a consistent basis. The horse's position is determined by the average of the latest five polls, to smooth out the margins of error. The data is gathered from Real Clear Politics' aggregation of major polls. Check back regularly--we'll update the race as new polls come in. And don't think Hillary Clinton and company won't get their laps around the track. Later this week, we'll have an animation of the far less crowded yet surprisingly intriguing Democratic primary race. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign.	Here's What the GOP Primary Would Look Like as a Horse Race
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/hillary_clinton_s_campaign_is_going_to_be_tested_in_february.html	"Hillary Clinton was not able to knock out Sen. Bernie Sanders in Monday's Iowa caucuses. Not that Sanders or his campaign were entertaining the thought of exiting the race anytime soon. But pulling off a safe, resounding win--perhaps one that beat expectations, even--would have helped Clinton quell the insurgency before it could snowball into something enduring. Instead, Clinton appears to have taken the Iowa crown by a teensy 0.3-percent margin. Clinton staved off an embarrassing loss. Unfortunately for her, she may have an embarrassing loss facing her in one week's time. Though that New Hampshire loss has been baked into expectations for some weeks now, it will set off a difficult 11-day period that tests the strength of her Western and Southern firewalls. Sanders right now enjoys an 18-percentage point lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average of New Hampshire. Having just spent 10 days in New Hampshire, I can attest that this polling support is not illusory. Barring some sensational gaffe from Sanders, a supremely on-message candidate who doesn't offer a lot of extraneous currency, that support is unlikely to flip dramatically to the former secretary of state--especially after the ""virtual tie"" in Iowa. Clinton's team will spin that pending result like nobody's business. They will attempt to set their expectations at roughly 1 percent of the vote and likely declare victory once it becomes clear they've hit 30. They will argue--have been arguing, are arguing--that Sanders' support is overblown because New Hampshire borders his home state Vermont and matches its crunchy white liberal demographic. Caveats notwithstanding, the problem for Clinton is that she will have to spend the next 11 days as a loser, and probably a significant loser, until the Nevada caucuses. There are people out there--perhaps you know them?--who have not been paying much attention to the election thus far and are only beginning to tune in now. People who might vaguely be aware of Sanders but also don't expect him to win anything against Clinton. For 11 days, the story, just as people are tuning in, could be that Clinton barely squeaked by Sanders in the first state and then was blown out in the second state. Winning makes a candidate seem viable, and once a candidate is deemed viable, plenty of votes could flip. An Iowa victory would have been a real prize for Sanders in that regard, but he did well enough to at least show how competitive he is. Obama's Iowa victory did much to build his impression as a viable alternative to Clinton. ""Voters prefer to back a winner,"" the Huffington Post's Ryan Grim wrote yesterday, ""and candidates appear more attractive the more likely they are to win."" The more viable Obama appeared to be, the more he dug into Clinton's national lead--a form of polling that begins to matter more as we approach multiprimary voting days for which the campaign's resources are spread thinner. If Sanders pulls off the easy victory he's expected to have in New Hampshire, the numbers to watch over those 11 days--and the numbers that will decide the nominee--are preferences among black and Latino voters. These are the keys not just to Nevada and South Carolina but through the Southern states as well. Those 11 days will be Sanders' best shot of drawing down Clinton's extremely lopsided margins. Is Sanders likely to flip Clinton's advantages? No. But there's a spate of punditry out there that's already begun to, shall we say, pat Sanders on the head and give him a sort of participation trophy, suggesting that his run has simply been delightful for the Democratic Party, for the left, and for young people, and boy oh boy does he have so much to be proud of in what he's achieved. The subtext of this punditry is: Now get out of the way. This is patronizing, but it also it misreads Sanders and his campaign. He did not enter the race, and he did not hire top-tier consultants like Tad Devine, just to get his issues out there and push Clinton to the left. He read the mood of the Democratic electorate this cycle as one that could break toward a Sanders nomination. He really does want to win, and he should be expected to exhaust all of his resources and strategic opportunities to do so. He's made a lot of progress so far. Don't expect him to cash out."	Hillary Clinton Is Entering the Tough Stretch
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/the_republican_party_s_iowa_caucus_is_challenging_what_we_know_about_2016.html	"It seemed like Donald Trump was going to upend every truth of politics, but the rule of Iowa held. A campaign based on the tested model of voter courtship with state-of-the-art improvements won the day. The victory was so familiar that it fit into a pattern that could apply to either party: first-term senator with Ivy League law degree defeats his more famous rival by electrifying his party base with a message of grassroots revolution and employing a ground game that set a record for voter turnout. (Winner: political strategists in GOP politics. I've got a voter turnout dashboard app that will Cruz-ify your microtarget, persuasion, and analytics game.) The Republican Party's base asserted itself. Trump turned out new voters--some of them former Democrats, according to the Iowa GOP--but it wasn't enough to overcome the loyalists. The other story of Iowa is that the pragmatic wing of the party asserted itself, too. Of the 21 percent of the voters who said they were picking candidates they thought could win in November, 43 percent went for Rubio. Cruz came in third with that group at 22 percent. Trump came in second with 25 percent. Now there's a lane change. In Iowa 42 percent of voters picked a candidate who they said ""shares my values."" That number is likely to be smaller in New Hampshire, a contest that will favor a more mainstream Republican. It's the state that picked Mitt Romney and John McCain against more ideological foes. A contest that has been characterized as a fight between the establishment and the outsiders is going to become a fight between the pragmatists and the ideologues. Cruz was the first GOP candidate to take on Trump and not emerge weaker. He also took on the sitting governor, Terry Branstad, who had come out against him for his refusal to support the Renewable Fuel Standard. Cruz has a claim to having done more than simply survive. He can say he has emerged stronger. Though someone might assign him to the Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum category--past Iowa winners who then went nowhere--he has a vastly superior organization and almost $20 million moving forward. There's a crucial way in which Cruz is like Santorum, though. His share of the ""very conservative"" vote is his lifeblood, according to entrance polls. He won that group 43 percent to 21 percent for Trump. Outside of that group Cruz did not win. Rubio edged out those who self-identified as ""somewhat conservative,"" and Trump won among moderates. Right now Cruz doesn't have a big enough group to win the primaries, as Santorum eventually learned. Cruz in his throaty victory speech encouraged Republicans to ""come home"" to his cause. That was a recognition he needs more Republicans, but can he grow his vote beyond his die-hard base? Of the top three finishers in Iowa, it was Trump who did the best among all categories of ideological levels, but entrance polls showed that the biggest chunk of his support came from people who decided a month ago. That could suggest that what we've been saying for a long time is true: He has a ceiling of support beyond his die-hard supporters. Rubio was so buoyant leaving Iowa that he might have floated to the Granite State. He says he's the only one who can unify the party. But waiting for him at the border with blackjacks and very cutting things to say are the three other mainstream conservatives. They have a choice to make. Will they savage Rubio at the risk of tearing him down and elevating Trump or Cruz? It's the old murder-suicide fix. Such attacks tear you and your opponent down and wind up helping someone else. Chris Christie was already attacking Rubio before the Florida senator could trundle his kids off to bed in the New Hampshire hotel and shave for the morning shows. Maybe it's the road to victory of the New Jersey pugilist, but if it's not and he takes down Rubio, it'll remind some in the GOP of his election coziness with Obama that they think damaged Romney late in the general election. And what does Jeb Bush do? His super PAC is helping cement the governor's legacy as the principal destroyer of perhaps the most viable Latino candidate to ever run under the GOP banner. Does the scion of a family known for an older-style politics want to engage in a full-frontal assault against his former Florida ally? Or will he choose to put a more dignified cap on what may be the last burst of electoral activity of the third political generation of the Bush family? Bush and Christie have to feel particularly chastened by Iowa. They did try to compete there, and they left no mark on the state. Even McCain, who was openly contemptuous of Iowa, got 13 percent of the vote in 2008. It's a tough sell for a candidate to make the case that he has broad and unifying appeal in the party while leaving such a weightless impression in the Hawkeye State. As the race continues, we might get some actual clarity about the terms we've been using so far. What does it really mean to be in the establishment--no former lobbyists in your administration? Or does it mean just the right position on undocumented immigrants? What does it really mean to be an outsider when you're a sitting senator? Though this is supposed to be the year of the outsider, 56 percent of the GOP vote went to Washington senators (senators who are all in their first terms, which was once seen as disqualifying when Republicans were attacking Sen. Barack Obama). Cruz is an outsider within the Senate, but he used his Senate victory and his time in Washington to build his campaign and the movement behind it. He didn't line his pockets with the perks of the job, but he did use his national elected office and the platform it gave him to advance himself in the world. You can only do that from the inside. Trump is the true outsider. That's why in entrance polls of those who were asked, ""What is best preparation for being president?"" of the 49 percent who said that a president should come from outside the political establishment, 46 percent supported Trump and only 19 percent supported Cruz. (Despite Cruz's outsider claims, he nearly tied Rubio among those who think having political experience is important.) Trump is not of Washington, and he is not of politics. We'll learn in New Hampshire and future contests if that's really as important as we all thought. Or do pragmatic Republicans want an elected official who can win more than they want a winner who has never been elected? And while our winning wordplay is winning: If Trump doesn't win in New Hampshire, it'll likely be the last word for his campaign. See more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."

At one unnamed precinct, there was a tie: Both Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton had an equal number of supporters. But someone must win the precinct for officials to allocate delegates, and so they chose a classic solution to the problem of a tie: They flipped a coin. Clinton won the toss, and the precinct. As analysts and observers, we will have to play this game for the Iowa Democratic caucus writ large. As of Monday night, with 95 percent of precincts reporting, there isn't a winner. Clinton has 49.8 percent of the vote, but Sanders has 49.6 percent of the vote. As for Martin O'Malley? He withdrew from the race after receiving less than 1 percent. (Although, that small showing might make the difference in the final count between Clinton and Sanders.) Clinton and Sanders are tied, and in their election-night speeches, neither candidate tried to pretend otherwise. Speaking to supporters in a packed gathering at Drake University in Des Moines, Clinton said she was ""breathing a sigh of relief."" ""It is rare that we have the opportunity we have now to have a real contest of ideas, to really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for,"" she said. ""I am excited about really getting into the debate with Sen. Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and America."" Not far from Clinton's gathering, Sanders stood with his wife, Jane, to speak to a huge crowd of jubilant supporters. ""Given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics,"" he said, with shouts of ""feel the Bern!"" in the background. Given the bitterness in this campaign--when Clinton declared she was a ""progressive"" during her speech on Monday, viewers at the Sanders event chanted that she was a ""liar""--it's hard to believe that this is just the beginning. But it is. With an almost even number of votes and delegates out of Iowa, the contest turns to New Hampshire, where Sanders holds a decisive advantage. The next fight is in Nevada--where there's not enough polling to say anything about the race--and from there we go to South Carolina, where Clinton dominates. By the end of February, the Democratic primary will likely be where it was at the beginning of the month: divided. As for the final outcome of the Democratic presidential primary? It's still too early to say. But, the tie in Iowa means the basic shape of the race hasn't changed. To win, Sanders needs to dominate in friendly states and survive in hostile strongholds. Iowa, with its young people and liberal voters, was a test of the former, and he couldn't deliver. Put differently, as the consensus candidate of much of the Democratic Party--with strong support among people of color, Democratic moderates, and a large minority of Democratic liberals--Clinton is still favored to win the nomination. For Sanders to advance--and capture the prize from Clinton's hands--he needs to excel, or she needs to stumble, badly. The former is a challenge, and while the latter is possible, after the 2008 primary and the surprise of Barack Obama, I wouldn't count on it. For anyone who followed the 2008 campaign, all of this sounds wearying. But if you are a Democrat who wants to win the White House for a third term--or a progressive who just wants to minimize the damage to your priorities--you should relish the upcoming combat. Why? Because a competitive primary will energize the Democratic Party and prime it for a tough and grueling general election. In Iowa, for example, returns suggest turnout that either meets or exceeds the record from 2008. Across the state, caucus rooms were teeming with people eager to vote for either Clinton or Sanders. People who had never participated in their lives--from college students to retirees--were canvassing, volunteering, and otherwise giving their energy to the candidates. And we should expect something similar in New Hampshire, where both campaigns are fighting to to find and activate supporters. Not everyone who participates in the primary will give their time, their labor, or their votes in November. But many will, and in doing so, they will strengthen the Democratic Party at a time when strength is critical, and every effort matters. If Democrats pull the unlikely feat of holding the Oval Office for a third consecutive term, they may look back at this fierce, acrimonious primary as the critical variable. Together, Sanders and Clinton have begun to make millions of moderate, left-leaning, and liberal Americans care about the outcome of November. No, as Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign can tell you, enthusiasm doesn't win elections. But it doesn't hurt either. And right now, Democrats are on the path to an enthusiastic electorate.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/bernie_sanders_has_already_changed_the_future_of_the_democratic_party.html	"DES MOINES, Iowa--""There is a huge grassroots movement,"" explained Jeremy Schafer, one of many people who traveled from California to support Sen. Bernie Sanders in Iowa. ""People building infrastructure to support future progressive candidates."" He continued: ""Bernie Sanders is building a foundation. Win or lose, we will be there to keep Hillary honest and the next person honest."" The Vermont senator isn't running to hold Hillary Clinton accountable--he's running to win. And at his final event before Monday's caucus--a packed rally of more than 1,000 (possibly 2,000) supporters in a modest arena at Grandview University in Des Moines--Sanders made that clear. ""You want a radical idea? All right, here's a radical idea,"" said the socialist who has captured the hearts of millions of Democratic voters. ""Together, we're going to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent."" To wild cheers from a crowd of college students and union volunteers, he pledged that he would fight for his smorgasboard of social democracy: single-payer health insurance, paid family leave, new infrastructure, tax hikes on big corporations, a $15 minimum wage, and free tuition at public colleges and universities. He called for equal pay for women, pledged to end ""institutional racism"" in the criminal justice system, and denounced companies like Walmart for paying workers so little that they qualify for Medicaid and food stamps. ""I say to the Walton family: Get off of welfare, pay your workers a living wage,"" said Sanders. But for as much as Sanders indicted the ""political establishment"" and pledged to fight ""the billionaire class,"" this wasn't a jeremiad. Sanders knows his crowd and they know him. When he hits his applause lines--""This will be a government for the people, by the people, and of the people""--they chime in to finish. And when an eager teenager screams ""I love you Bernie!,"" he smiles, grateful and (I imagine) a little embarrassed. In a Sunday interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Sanders announced his plan to fight this primary to the end. ""I hope we win, but if we lose by two points, so what--we're going to go to New Hampshire, then we're going to go to South Carolina, then we're going to go to Nevada,"" he told the Today show anchor. ""We are in this to the end."" Sanders is in it to win it, and that gets to the truth of California supporter Jeremy Schafer's statement. Win or lose, Sanders will stand as a historic presence in the Democratic Party. Whether it was the socialist left in the 1950s and '60s, the New Left in the 1970s, or the labor left in the 1980s, Democrats have always kept their left flank at arms length. This became principle (or, for critics, pathology) in the late 1980s and 1990s, when centrist reformers marginalized the left in a drive to--in their narrative--save liberalism from itself. Led by President Bill Clinton, and backed by a phalanx of Democratic lawmakers, Democrats built ties to Wall Street, embraced the conservative ""war on crime,"" and reshaped the safety net, scrapping programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children in favor of more limited, market-friendly alternatives. For a generation of Democrats who cut their teeth in the age of white racial backlash, the Moral Majority, and Ronald Reagan--where ""liberal"" was a slur and conservatives controlled the zeitgeist--this was the only option. ""The era of big government"" had to be over if liberalism was going to survive. For Sanders and others in the remnants of the old left, this wasn't just wrong, it was ruinous. For them, Democrats would only flourish when they embraced the left. Twenty years after Bill Clinton won re-election on a centrist platform, and at the twilight of an administration that spurned the left as much as it embraced it, Sanders and his allies have all but confirmed their hypothesis. With uncomplicated language and simple sincerity, Sanders has rallied millions of Democrats under the banner of ""democratic socialism""--a kind of neo-New Deal liberalism, set against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's attempted synthesis of Great Society policies and Third Way politics--and moved ""socialist"" from the realm of epithet to legitimate label. Win or lose, that counts. It's the Democratic analogue to Reagan's 1976 primary against Gerald Ford--a sign of the times and of the future. If Sanders wins Iowa, New Hampshire, and the nomination, then he'll bring (or drag) the Democratic Party to the left. If he loses, then he'll represent the largest faction in the party, with the power to hold a President Hillary Clinton accountable and even shape her administration, from appointments and nominations to regulatory policy. With that said, the impact of Sanders goes beyond presidential politics. I am skeptical that any ""political revolution"" can change American politics in the short term. But if Sanders inspires supporters to delve deeper into Democratic Party politics, then it could change the long term. His supporters--his workers and volunteers and activists--are (potentially) the next generation of Democratic operatives, who will bring the lessons of this effort to future campaigns. And in the same way that Jesse Jackson opened the door to politicians like Barack Obama, Sanders may do the same for ""democratic socialists."" Like the veterans of George McGovern or Howard Dean, the veterans of Bernie Sanders will change and shape the Democratic Party. The Iowa caucus will make or break the Sanders campaign. Without a win, it's hard to see his path to the nomination. But it means little for his legacy. Sanders is already a historic candidate--the first socialist in a century to build a genuine mass movement in American party politics. And whatever the Democratic Party is in the next 20 or 30 years, it will owe a great deal to Sanders and all the people--young or otherwise--who felt the Bern.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/ted_cruz_lost_the_fox_debate_to_donald_trump.html	"The absence of Donald Trump from Thursday's Fox News debate left Sen. Ted Cruz, typically the sharpest debater in this cycle, the opportunity to solidify himself as conservatives' only alternative to Trump. He would be at center stage, the attacks would come for him, and he would fend them off one by one, in his usually unflappable style. He failed. Cruz had his worst debate at a time when polls suggest he's fallen well behind Trump in Iowa. Unless organizing can make up the shortfall, he needs to make something happen in the few days left. But instead of commanding the stage and hammering the absent front-runner, Cruz turned in a sloppy performance consisting of flat jokes, whining to the moderators, whining to the moderators as a set up for flat jokes, and taking substantive poundings from his rivals--and from Fox News itself. Cruz opened with a joke about Trump's absence. ""Let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon,"" he began. ""Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way..."" The joke got a smattering of applause, certainly not enough to justify serving up footage of him saying ""I'm a maniac"" for his opponents to use for as long as he remains active in politics. He would add, when pressed about his strategy of bear-hugging Trump for months before only recently going negative, that ""I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to. I'm glad he's running and produced enormous enthusiasm and to every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support."" He added that ""policy and record"" are ""fair game,"" and ""that's where I'm going to focus."" One of the cliches about Iowa voters is that they don't respond well to negativity. As a countervailing point, we present to you the fact that Trump is currently leading Republican polling in Iowa. Cruz had a chance to position himself directly against Trump as the alternative and rip into his record without fear of retort. Instead he continued treating Trump as the goofy, entertaining sideshow who will go away. When will they learn? Cruz later made a fool of himself by trying to interrupt moderator Chris Wallace, repeatedly, as Wallace tried to pose a question to Jeb Bush. Cruz claimed that Chris Christie mentioned his name in an answer and so he had the right to respond. ""I don't think your name was mentioned,"" Bush said, correctly. After some more tussling, Wallace was finally able to put him to rest: ""Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but we're going to conduct the debate."" When Cruz was allowed to speak next, he continued complaining: ""Chris, I would note that the last four questions have been Rand, please attack Ted, Jeb, please attack Ted ..."" ""It is a debate, sir,"" Wallace interrupted. The questions did not really pick on Cruz that much but apparently did meet the minimum threshold needed for Cruz to issue his other pre-prepared Trump joke. ""I will say this, gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage."" Some confused laughter ensued. For some reason that we won't question, because it was glorious, Fox News decided to spend a segment near the middle of the debate nuking only Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz with clips from their past on immigration. Rubio sweated plenty when his shifting positions over the years on ""amnesty"" were examined. Then it was Cruz's turn to go under the knife. Fox went after Cruz's shifting history on whether he supported offering legal status--the lesser ""amnesty"" behind offering citizenship, but an ""amnesty"" damning enough by this primary cycle's standards--during the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform debate. Cruz denies he ever did, that he was merely engaging in clever parliamentary attacks, but the tape showed another story. It muddied the waters on immigration more efficiently than Rubio's intensive efforts to muddy the waters late last year did. Cruz's fellow senators piled on with some pent-up frustration. ""I was there and I saw the debate,"" Sen. Rand Paul laid in. ""I saw Ted Cruz say, 'We'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass and I'm for the bill.' The bill would involve legalization. He can't have it both ways. ""What is particularly insulting, though: He is the king of saying, 'Oh, you're for amnesty, everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz,' but it's a falseness. And that's an authenticity problem, that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty. I was for legalization. I think, frankly, we could have border security, you can have legalization. So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so. That's not true."" Then in was Rubio's turn: ""This is the lie that Ted's campaign is built on, and Rand touched upon it: That he's the most conservative guy and everyone else is, you know, everyone else is a RINO. ""The truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign you've been saying ... anything to get votes. You worked for George Bush's campaign. You helped design George W. Bush's immigration policy. When you got to the Senate ... you said on the issue of people here illegally, we can reach a compromise. In the committee you said I want to bring people out of the shadows. Now you want to trump Trump on immigration. We're not going to beat Hillary Clinton with someone who's willing to say or do anything to win an election."" Cruz wasn't anything special Thursday night, and it didn't help later on either, when the moderators pointed out that Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, seated in the audience, had directly instructed Republicans to caucus against Cruz for his position on ethanol. Cruz on Thursday night wasn't the dominating presence he needed to be. He was just another one of the people losing to Donald Trump. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	Ted Cruz Somehow Managed to Lose the Fox Debate to the Man Who Wasn't There
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/twitter_commentary_about_the_trump_free_fox_news_debate.html	Thursday night, Fox News will air the last Republican presidential debate before the Iowa caucus. Donald J. Trump, who leads in the polls, has refused to participate and is betting that you won't watch. (Rumors suggested that Trump will be replaced by a 7-foot-tall CGI carrot and voiced with clips from the Apprentice, but that might not pan out.) Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and Ben Carson will be there in the flesh, as will Rand Paul, who has been promoted from the baby debate. Slate will be providing coverage throughout the evening. You can start with this helpful rundown of what's at stake for the candidates. Pundits and politicos, meanwhile, will be trying to understand what it means to hold a debate without the front-runner. Some are even starting to wonder if the rise of Trump and Cruz spells the end of the Republican establishment as we know it.  Below are their live tweets, drawn from a list of top accounts curated by Slate. Those who lean left are on the left; those who lean right are on the right. Enjoy the instant spin!	What Twitter's Smartest Liberals and Conservatives Are Saying About the Fox News GOP Debate
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/the_gop_is_a_failed_state_donald_trump_is_its_warlord.html	"People who call themselves leaders of the Republican Party--politicians, donors, strategists, elders--are panicking over an impending disaster. Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz are about to roll through the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, crushing the ""establishment"" Republican presidential candidates. Trump and Cruz are also running first and second, respectively, in South Carolina. They even lead in Florida, the home state of Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush. It's hard to see where Trump or Cruz could be stopped--and how either of them, if nominated, would win a general election. The party's putative leaders, desperate for a third option, are begging the establishment candidates--Rubio, Bush, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio--to consolidate their support or at least to stop attacking one another. Many Republican insiders, resigned to a Trump or Cruz nomination, are blaming anyone but themselves: mainstream candidates who failed to connect with voters, super PACs that didn't take Trump seriously, donors who wouldn't pony up to stop him. The disaster, the blame game, and the establishment's surprise at what's happening are related. Since President Obama's election, the GOP has abandoned its role as a national governing party. It has seized Congress not by pursuing an alternative agenda but by campaigning and staging votes against anything Obama says or does. The party's so-called leaders have become followers, chasing the pet issues of right-wing radio audiences. Now the mob to whom these elders have surrendered--angry white voters who are determined to ""take back their country"" from immigrants and liberals--is ready to install its own presidential nominee. The Trump-Cruz takeover is the culmination of the Grand Old Party's moral collapse. In foreign policy, there's a term for governments that don't govern. We call them failed states. A state can fail for many reasons, but weak or clueless leadership is usually a factor. In a failed state, insurgencies grow, warlords arise, and chaos reigns. That's what the GOP has become. When did the collapse begin? Maybe it was in late 2008 and early 2009, when congressional Republicans decided to block anything Obama proposed. Maybe it was in 2010, when they refused to compromise on health insurance reform or to agree on a plausible alternative. Maybe it was later, when they staged dozens of pointless votes to repeal the new law in its entirety, treating health care as a campaign issue rather than a problem to be solved. Maybe it was in the 2011 debt ceiling showdown, when they took the nation's credit rating hostage, or in 2013, when they forced a federal shutdown to protest the health insurance law. Republicans captured the House in 2010, but they didn't use that power to cut favorable deals and pass legislation that might be signed into law. Instead, they reduced Congress to theater. House Republicans, unwilling to offend their base, killed immigration reform. In 2014, Republicans captured the Senate. Again, they spurned the opportunity to govern. Forty-seven Republican senators advised Iran not to sign a nuclear nonproliferation agreement with the United States. The Senate became such a farce that according to Rubio, there's no point in attending, since nothing happens there but ""show votes."" Republicans no longer have a policy agenda. They have a scapegoating, base-stoking agenda. Their economic plan is to blame legal immigrants for the demise of upward mobility. Their social policy is to defund the nation's leading birth-control provider and promote disobedience of court orders. Their foreign policy is to carpet-bomb Syria, insult the faith of our anti-ISIS partners, and void Iran's pledge to abstain from nuclear weapons production. In the race to the right, yesterday's conservatives can't keep up. John Boehner, a right-wing rebel in the House 20 years ago, has been purged as speaker by the GOP's new hardliners. Kasich, another House rebel from the Boehner era, is now ridiculed in the presidential primaries as a liberal. Cruz and Rubio accuse each other, correctly, of having switched positions on immigration. Both men have shifted to the right--Rubio turning against illegal immigrants, Cruz turning against legal ones--in pursuit of angry white voters. When you run a party this way, chasing after your most radical constituents--in Republican parlance, leading from behind--you shouldn't be surprised to find that the audience you've cultivated doesn't match your original principles. National Review's Jan. 21 editorial, ""Against Trump,"" is eloquent but far too late. Today's Republican electorate doesn't belong to National Review. It belongs to Trump. Trump is leading almost every national and statewide Republican poll. Together, he and Cruz are drawing the support of 60 percent of Republicans in the latest CNN/ORC poll, 58 percent in the ABC News/Washington Post poll, 54 percent in the Fox News poll, and 53 percent in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. In Iowa, Trump and Cruz are splitting 60 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers. In New Hampshire, they control 47 percent of the vote. In South Carolina, they're drawing 61 percent. Even if all the establishment candidates pooled their support, they wouldn't win. Together, Rubio, Bush, Christie, and Kasich are attracting only 18 percent of the Republican vote in the CNN/ORC poll, 22 percent in the ABC/Post poll, and 22 percent in the Fox News poll. The NBC/Journal poll found that even if the Republican field narrowed to Trump, Cruz, and Rubio, Rubio would still finish last by 5 percentage points. With Cruz removed, Trump would still beat Rubio, 52 percent to 45 percent. Trump's grip on this Republican electorate isn't superficial. It's based on shared attitudes. In the CNN/ORC poll, 34 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners picked Trump as the candidate who ""best represents the values of Republicans like yourself."" Twenty-five percent picked Cruz; only 18 percent picked Rubio, Bush, Christie, or Kasich. Many surveys show that Republicans share Trump's distrust of Muslims and his willingness to discriminate against them. In an analysis of the ABC/Post data, pollster Gary Langer found that ""anti-immigrant views"" and ""interest in a candidate from outside the political establishment"" were ""the single strongest independent predictors of supporting Trump vs. any of his opponents."" These views now dominate the GOP. The ABC/Post poll asked: ""Overall, do you think immigrants from other countries mainly strengthen or mainly weaken American society?"" Republicans and Republican leaners, by a margin of 50 percent to 38 percent, said immigrants weaken America. The rest of the sample, by a ratio of more than 2 to 1, said the opposite. The poll asked: ""Would you like the next president to be someone who has experience in how the political system works, or someone from outside the existing political establishment?"" Republicans and Republican leaners, by a margin of 54 percent to 42 percent, preferred an outsider. The rest of the sample, by a ratio of more than 3 to 1, preferred experience.  The poll asked whether ""America's best days are ahead of it or behind it."" A 49 percent plurality of Republicans and Republican leaners said the country's best days are behind it. The rest of the sample, by a ratio of 2 to 1, said the country's best days lay ahead. What these polls illustrate is a party adrift from America. By chasing the right and abandoning the middle, Republican politicians have developed a constituency that turns out in midterm elections and believes it's entitled to control the country but doesn't think like the rest of the population. Trump is on course to win the Republican presidential nomination and then lose the general election precisely because he mirrors this constituency. The crisis for leaders of the Republican establishment isn't that Trump doesn't represent their party. It's that he does. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	The Republican Party Is a Failed State, and Donald Trump Is Its Warlord
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/the_democratic_primary_between_hillary_clinton_and_bernie_sanders_echoes.html	"Unlike debates, candidate forums aren't the place for political combat. And at Monday's Democratic forum--hosted by CNN at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa--the three contenders stuck to their records, their judgment, and their experience when answering questions from the audience. At the same time, the candidates weren't disarmed. They drew contrasts and highlighted differences among one another. That, in essence, is what Sen. Bernie Sanders did with his time on the stage. In his closing argument to Iowa Democrats, he urged them to look at all the ways he has had superior judgment to that of his chief rival, Hillary Clinton. ""The truth is that the most significant vote and issue regarding foreign policy that we have seen in this country in modern history was the vote on the war in Iraq,"" he explained to the audience. ""Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq."" He took the same approach on questions of financial regulation. ""Wall Street has operated, in a very significant way, in a fraudulent way, and obviously their greed and recklessness helped destroy our economy and create the worst recession since the Great Depression,"" he said. ""I led the effort against Wall Street deregulation. See where Hillary Clinton was on this issue."" It was a variation on the message that helped carry Barack Obama to victory in the Iowa caucuses. On the critical issues of the day, Sanders argued, Clinton was wrong. And while he doesn't have the same experience as the former secretary of state, you can trust his judgment above hers. This was an aggressive approach, but Sanders needed to be aggressive. At this stage, the Iowa caucus is a tossup. Clinton leads by an average of just 0.6 points, reflecting a deep divide in Iowa polling. In polls conducted from registered voter files, Clinton excels, with her highest support among older people and women--groups most likely to vote. But in polls conducted through random dialing, Sanders wins. As Nate Cohn notes for the New York Times, a recent poll ""found Mrs. Clinton ahead by nine points among those who said they would 'definitely' vote, with Mr. Sanders ahead by 10 among those who said they would 'probably' caucus."" Sanders has less than a week to convert his likely supporters into definite supporters, and throwing a few elbows--clarifying the differences between himself and his chief opponent--is part of that approach. Clinton has the reverse problem. She needs to hold on to her nominal lead. Earlier in the month, Team Clinton approached this through attacks on Sanders for his health care plan and ""democratic socialist"" identification. But, as evidenced by the forum, Clinton has moved away from that tactic. Instead, she's going for persusasion, presenting herself as best equipped to accomplish progressive goals without attacking Sanders or alienating his supporters. ""You know, you can say all the kinds of things you want in a campaign,"" said Clinton, ""And we are drawing distinctions with the Republicans, and we should because I have very deep disagreements, as I just pointed out, with a lot of what they're saying and doing."" But, she continued, ""Once the election is over we must come together to work to solve the problems facing our country. That is what I did. I did it as a First Lady when I worked, as I said, to get the children's health insurance program. I did it to reform the foster care and adoption system with one of the most partisan Republicans in the house, Tom DeLay. I did it when I was in the Senate."" Continuing this kinder, gentler approach, Clinton applauded Sanders for engaging young people in the election (following a question from a Sanders supporter, asking why she's ""dishonest""). ""I'm totally happy to see young people involved in any way,"" she said. ""That's what we want."" Likewise, in her final remarks, she praised one of Sanders' closing advertisements as the kind of ""prose"" that is important for energizing the country. ""You know, look, you campaign in poetry, you govern in prose,"" said Clinton, paraphrasing former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. ""And we need a lot more poetry in this campaign and in our country. So, I applaud that. I love the feeling. I love the energy."" When thinking of where both candidates stand and how this contest in Iowa might end, it's worth watching their closing advertisements to caucusgoers. Clinton focuses on herself as a ""fighter"" for the interests of ordinary people. It's a frame that emphasizes competence and experience--her main selling points. Sanders has a different goal. He wants you to imagine a better America. ""There are those who say we cannot defeat a corrupt political system and fix a rigged economy,"" he says. ""But I believe we need to lift our vision above the obstacles in place--and look to the American horizon."" Sanders is focused on his vision--his ""political revolution."" It's movement-building, and it's effective. The key question to Iowans, six days before they caucus, is a familiar one, an echo of the 2008 contest that changed the face of American politics. Do they want a fighter for their interests or an inspiration for their dreams? Then, when Democrats were almost certain to win the White House and Congress with it, the answer was a little easier. Now, against an intractable Republican opposition, it's far less clear."	The Democratic Primary Has Echoes of 2008
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/_liberals_and_conservatives_are_teaming_up_to_call_a_new_constitutional.html	"It's only a short phrase buried in the U.S. Constitution, but it enables an unprecedented mechanism to change the law of the land: If two-thirds of the states demand it, Congress ""shall call a convention"" for proposing constitutional amendments. A hopeless pipe dream? Actually, no. Some 27 states have called for a convention on a balanced budget amendment, which would force the federal government to pass budgets that do not enlarge the national debt. This means that theoretically just seven more states have to act for a constitutional convention to be called, at least on that subject. In just the first few weeks of this year's state legislative sessions, at least 10 states have bills pending that call for a convention. So suddenly such a meeting, not held since the earliest days of this country, is becoming a real possibility. Even GOP presidential candidates are seizing on the burgeoning movement, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich endorsing this unconventional process and rallying their supporters as legislative sessions start up again. While the legislation appears to be a grassroots effort bubbling up from the states, in reality it's quite the opposite. National groups have been holding workshops, publishing tips, and even crafting model legislation for years to persuade legislators to use their states to circumvent the logjam in Congress. The push is led by the American Legislative Exchange Council, the Virginia-headquartered conservative think tank known as ALEC made up of state lawmakers and corporations that advocate free-market policies in the states. It has a cadre of other like-minded national allies working on the controversial strategy to revise the country's supreme laws. But in a fight reflecting the broader schism within the Republican Party, other national groups on the right such as the John Birch Society and Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum are combating these efforts with their own legislative push to rescind those calls for what is called an Article V convention. Working alongside unlikely liberal allies, they say the country runs the risk of a runaway convention where delegates could change the complete makeup of the Constitution. ""Once you open up the Constitution to change at a convention, then you can change anything in the Constitution,"" said Michael Leachman at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that has written about the dangers of a balanced budget amendment. ""It's theoretically possible."" How It Works Americans can amend the Constitution in two ways, as laid forth in Article V of the body of laws. The first has been used to pass all 27 amendments that exist today: Congress proposes an amendment with two-thirds majority in both chambers that must then be ratified by three-quarters of the states. The second route requires two-thirds of states to call a convention for proposing amendments, according to the Constitution. Besides these few words, the Constitution doesn't give much more guidance. Lawmakers grapple with how to conduct such a meeting: Who attends? Where is it held? What is the agenda? Who leads the proceedings? What are the rules? Activists trying to convene such a convention are drawing on historical records to interpret the body of laws for clues on how to pull it off. Based on that limited research, they see two routes to such a meeting. On one side, ALEC and its allies seek to persuade 34 states to pass resolutions to call the meeting, as well as parallel legislation that outlines the rules and structure of the convention. After the convention delegates meet, 38 states would still need to ratify any amendment that the attendees produce at the convention. For bills to count toward the necessary 34 applications, though, they must seek the same amendment to discuss at the convention. So far, a balanced budget amendment is the closest to that requirement. But bills have also called for conventions about a cornucopia of issues, ranging from reforming campaign finance to congressional term limits. Critics are concerned that other topics could be introduced once the convention begins. The other, albeit more unlikely path, wraps up the resolution, rules, and ratification in one neat package: an interstate compact. This alternative method requires 38 states to pass the compact package, as well as congressional approval. This compact strategy still has a long way to go. The group leading the charge, Compact for America, has helped pass bills only in Alaska, Georgia, Mississippi, and North Dakota so far. But it also has the backing of ALEC, which posted model compact legislation on its website. And at least four compact bills have been filed to be heard in 2016. ""The founders thought this was a very controlled, moderate, predictable process,"" said Nick Dranias, Compact for America's president and executive director. ""It was not meant as a red button. Nothing could be more lawless than what we already have going on in Congress."" The Texas-based group has deep ties to the conservative Goldwater Institute in Arizona; its leaders, Dranias and Thomas Patterson, were both formerly top brass there. Compact for America does not disclose its donors for ""fear of political retaliation,"" according to its tax filings. The campaign for conventions, however one comes about, is not solely led by a conservative bastion. Former Democratic presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig stands out as a major leader in the movement. Lessig and ALEC are pushing for different final goals, though. Lessig hopes to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court campaign finance case Citizens United with a constitutional amendment. Still, they have united on using states to overcome congressional stagnation. ""In my view, if you look at American government today, the fundamental stale institution of Congress is crippled by the way congressmen are selected,"" Lessig told the Center for Public Integrity. ""It produces a widely more polarized Congress than the population. An Article V convention is the only solution the framers gave us."" Critics say the only precedent for a successful convention occurred in 1787 when framers met to discuss weaknesses found in the Articles of Confederation. Instead of tinkering with the articles, the attendees scrapped the whole set of laws for the current Constitution. This context only intensifies critics' fears of a runaway convention. ""It's quite clear that any convention would be subject to enormous lobbying pressure,"" Leachman said. ""This convention is deciding amendments to the Constitution. Any interest group in the country would be very interested in the results of that."" Convention supporters point to research that suggests states held nearly 20 smaller conventions before 1787 that can be used as guidelines, according to Rob Natelson, a senior fellow at the free-market Independence Institute think tank in Colorado, who wrote ALEC's handbook on such conventions. ""Essentially, they served as task forces where delegates from different states could share information, debate, compare notes, and try to hammer out creative solutions to the problems posed to them,"" Natelson wrote. Natelson said many safeguards exist to prevent chaos at a convention: legislation that limits the scope of the meeting by attending states, the potential for lawsuits, and the required ratification of any proposed amendment. The more pressing worry, he says, is that delegates won't be able to agree on the fine print of an amendment to fix the issue they're discussing. ""The more legitimate concern is not that they'll go wild, but that they won't cure the problem,"" Natelson said. ""Getting so many people to agree on wording is difficult and deadlock is probable."" The Race to Secure States The push for a constitutional convention isn't just a recent phenomenon. Between 1957 and 1983, 32 states passed calls for a convention to discuss a balanced budget amendment--two states away from the required total. The National Taxpayers Union, a conservative advocacy group that works to rein in federal spending, led the effort decades ago. But Alabama reversed its call in 1988 after intense lobbying from the John Birch Society, the Eagle Forum, the progressive nonprofit Common Cause, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and Norman Lear's liberal People for the American Way. It was the first of 16 states canceling their calls between 1988 and 2010. ""We have a wonderful Constitution that has lasted for 200 years, and we don't think anybody should play games with it,"" Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly told the Washington Post at the time. Almost two decades after states began withdrawing their legislation, Lessig and Mark Meckler, co-founder of the conservative Tea Party Patriots, helped rally a renewed push for a convention. They brought together about 300 people at Harvard Law School in 2011 for the Constitutional Convention Conference (nicknamed the Con Con Con). There, the two men on opposite sides of the political spectrum preached about corruption in Washington and why a convention was a citizen's last resort to combat it. ""Politicians profit when we are inflamed against each other,"" Meckler said in his opening remarks. ""If we spend time fighting each other, the politicians can do what they want. It's the incumbents versus the citizens. Those are the two parties we are facing today."" Around the same time, ALEC and related groups jump-started a new campaign to hold a convention to discuss a balanced budget amendment. ALEC, primarily funded by corporations and trade groups, released Natelson's handbook for state lawmakers, drafted model legislation, and held workshops on the subject at its annual conferences. The convention supporters are trying to build off the earlier wins in the 1970s and '80s, because the votes do not expire, according to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee. ""Let's get Article V passed, get the power out of Washington back to the local government where the founders intended it to be,"" said Mike Huckabee, a keynote speaker at ALEC's annual meeting in San Diego in July. ALEC did not return multiple requests for comment. But the group has written about its push on its site: ""The federal government has steadily consolidated its power while eroding state control."" Connected to ALEC, the Florida-based Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force lobbied state legislators in at least 13 states in 2014, according to its tax return, with successful resolutions passed in Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, and Michigan. The task force has targeted 13 more states in 2016: Arizona, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Those pushing for the conventions face some legislative leaders who refuse to send any convention bills to a vote, such as Arizona Senate President Andy Biggs, a Republican, according to the task force's co-founder, David Biddulph. But he said his organization has connected with like-minded groups to help push through these barriers. ""We've got extremely limited resources but extremely valuable friends,"" Biddulph said. While primarily composed of volunteers, the task force has partnered with larger, well-resourced groups, including ALEC, the conservative think tank the Heartland Institute, and the D.C.-based small business organization, the National Federation of Independent Business, to push its message and lobby state legislators, Biddulph said. Another ALEC ally, the Virginia-based Convention of States, is founded by Meckler's right-wing advocacy group, the Citizens for Self-Governance. With big name conservative endorsements ranging from former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to Fox News host Sean Hannity, Convention of States uses similar tactics as ALEC: providing model legislation, citizen toolkits, and responses to opposing arguments. The group hosted Article V workshops at recent ALEC conferences and has planned information sessions in Arizona, Illinois, New Jersey, and Virginia for this January and February. Convention of States members did not return requests for comment. However, its co-founder Meckler told Fox News after Rubio endorsed the effort in December, ""I've never been more excited about our prospects for achieving real governmental reform as I am right now."" The advocates are bolstered by last year's momentum. A Center for Public Integrity review of legislation found that state lawmakers introduced approximately 190 bills in 45 states last year about conventions on a range of issues. Bills passed in at least seven states. Supporters are also taking more symbolic action. Activists introduced a ballot measure in California to seek a constitutional amendment and Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott proposed nine constitutional amendments to strengthen state powers earlier this month, urging Texas and other states to push them using an Article V convention. Not Giving Up the Fight But the Eagle Forum and the John Birch Society are continuing their efforts from the '80s to combat this renewed push from ALEC and its allies to seek a convention. ""The whole Article V 'Convention of States' process is a prescription for political chaos,"" wrote Schlafly in a Jan. 11 fundraising email. ""Alas, I don't see any George Washingtons, James Madisons or Ben Franklins around today who could do as good a job as the Founding Fathers, and I'm worried about the men who think they can."" Meanwhile, the John Birch Society, which advocates for limited government from its Wisconsin headquarters, sends out action alert emails, posts videos, distributes educational materials, and works with state legislators, according to Larry Greenley, the group's director of missions. Florida state Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda couldn't believe a constitutional convention bill passed 73-42 in her chamber with scarcely any debate in April 2014. ""I was flabbergasted,"" she said. ""I didn't understand why it wasn't more of a heated issue, thinking about changing the Constitution."" After seeing this legislation pass, Rehwinkel Vasilinda raised her concerns among her friends, family, and fellow lawmakers. Shortly after, she said, a John Birch Society field coordinator brought the Democratic lawmaker language for a bill to repeal all past calls for a convention. Bills with similar rescinding language have cropped up in the past five years in other states, including Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and North Dakota. Rehwinkel Vasilinda introduced the bill last year, but it died in committee. Undeterred, she introduced a new version for this legislative session, which began Jan. 12. ""My bill is in some ways a statement and not a bill,"" she said. ""I want the issue to get heard and on people's radar. I want there to be honest debate instead of letting these bills slide by.""
