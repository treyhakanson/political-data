There were no notable conservative or Tea Party leaders onstage in Tampa--the closest we got was Ted Cruz, who is not yet a senator (he will be soon), and who is beloved by both the secular Tea and Teavangelical wings of the party. But the Democrats' ideological allies are all over the Charlotte stage. Just tonight, we get Mary Kay Henry (SEIU), Nancy Keenan (NARAL), and Doug Stern, a firefighter who sometimes served as the compelling spokesman for the ballot initiative to overturn Ohio's new labor reforms. Democrats won that battle--actually it was probably the biggest labor victory of the Obama years. Oh, and we get Lilly Ledbetter. I went to the women's caucus this morning and noticed which names/lines got applause. Not much applause when Obama was credited with doubling wind energy. Very solid applause for ending ""don't ask, don't tell."" But roof-raising peals of joy when speakers mentioned Sonia Sotomayor and Lilly Ledbetter. This is what we expected, right? That Democrats would try to reinflate the bellows that they filled in 2008? That they realize they're not going to by going after the independents who have given up on them? I think that the ""worst campaign ever"" arguments imply that this sort of base-rousing is uninspiring. Sure. It's not inspiring. But it's substantive. People elected Barack Obama and some Democrats. Barack Obama and some Democrats passed a series of laws that put burdens on employers to give birth control to employees, to raise pay, et cetera and et cetera. Lots of white male voters dislike this stuff, understandably. It goes to what John was saying--this is an interesting campaign, and whoever wins it has to confront the costs of the welfare state. But I'm saying this before Democrats go in front of a big TV audience, aren't I? Maybe they'll water down the cream to 1 percent milk.

I think you both are asking all the right big-picture questions about the durability of Obamania. But as the resident political technician, I've spent my long holiday weekend in Charlotte wondering if the mode of political storytelling has changed. That's a suspicion I developed by the end of last week in Tampa. For all we should be rightfully sick of consultants and pundits using the word narrative, the Republican convention was befuddlingly free of plot. The major speakers seemed to all make discrete, disjointed arguments, without any overarching themes or recurring language. We're supposed to be learning about Romney's humanity, but most of the big speakers are not even able to testify to it--and so talk instead about their own journeys and accomplishments?  The keynote speaker devotes his time on stage to explaining why the central test for today's leaders is making difficult decisions around benefits and entitlements--and then the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees barely touch on the subject? Late Thursday night, a couple of hours after the Eastwood/Rubio/Romney triple bill, I found myself in a conversation with a Republican operative who has spent time in the Romney orbit. I asked what he thought of the speech, and he said he thought it went really well. He asked what I thought, and I said it was probably the finest presentation, the best delivery I'd ever seen from Romney. Then I asked him: So what was the speech about? He looked at me, perplexed, and asked, ""What do you mean, 'What was it about?' "" In fact, the week was so incoherent that I have trouble imagining it reflects inattention on the part of Romney's team as much as a new paradigm for thinking about how information travels. We got into all this talk about ""narrative"" in campaigns because political communicators were thinking about how to package a single, consolidated story that would rhyme across mass media: the sound bites picked out for the nightly news would ratify accounts in the morning paper and guide word of mouth. Now coverage is as likely to move through niche media or be consumed as raw, if edited, material online. What if that means that convention planners think of it less as a weeklong storytelling exercise and more as a project in which they generate discrete bits of content able to exist alone? That Christie riff on austerity, a Romney putdown of Obama's messianic ways, an inspiring immigrant Bildungsroman from Rubio--they don't need to fit together, they just need to each develop a momentum and audience of their own. All this brings us to Day 1 in Charlotte. It's Obama and the Democrats who've been accused most of the year of administering a fragmented campaign, talking to women about their uteruses and white guys in the Midwest about their assembly lines. So I will be curious to see if these three days add up to one big argument for Obama's re-election, or lots of little ones allowed to stand on their own.

Mitt Romney had a lot of work to do Thursday night. The Republican nominee and convention headliner had to take the idea of his candidacy--something that has often failed to excite large audiences--and translate it into something appealing. His speech was one of his best chances to explain who he is as man, father, husband, and leader. The speech didn't deliver any breakthroughs, but the idea managed to be pleasing enough for some people. Romney appeared assured, competent, kind, maybe even presidential. The third Slate/SurveyMonkey snap survey--posted, as usual, at the end of Romney's speech and held open until 9:30 Friday morning--took the temperature of voters across the country in the afterglow of the GOP's three-day pep rally. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Results show that America may not be burning with Romney fever, but people are beginning to warm to the candidate. We kicked off the insta-poll by asking: ""Did Mitt Romney's acceptance speech make you more likely or unlikely to vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the upcoming election?"" But instead of the usual apathy, we got a surprisingly positive response. The largest group of survey takers, 31.2 percent, said they were ""much more likely"" to support the Republican ticket after hearing Romney speak. When we added in those who chose ""slightly more likely,"" that favorable number rose to 43 percent. On the other hand, about 27 percent of respondents described themselves as less likely to vote Romney-Ryan in the wake of the speech, and 29.1 percent were unmoved in either direction. Over at the Breakfast Table, John Dickerson summed up the prevailing wisdom about Romney's address: It was perfectly respectable, reached at least a few listeners, and helped to humanize the candidate. Perhaps history won't remember it as a turning point, but at least it smoothed over the debacle that was Clint Eastwood. The second question was aimed at Romney's running mate. We asked: ""Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan's speech on Wednesday night of the RNC has been criticized by some media organizations for containing false or misleading information. Do you think that Ryan's speech will harm Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's chances of winning the election in November?"" Incredibly, 45 percent of those surveyed didn't think that a candidate delivering a speech littered with fibs would do any harm to Romney and Ryan's chances. Maybe those surveyed don't believe their fellow Americans will be able to discern fact from fiction. Or maybe they just think the average citizen doesn't care what's true. (By contrast, 27 percent of survey takers suspected the speech would hurt Romney-Ryan, and 28 percent weren't sure.) In an article Tuesday on the Atlantic's site, James Bennet imagined a world in which the electorate turned a deaf ear to the press as it continually pointed out lawmakers' lies. Have our politics entered a post-factual age--can political campaigns no longer be shamed? If true, this race will get a lot uglier before it's done."	Will Paul Ryan's Lies Hurt Romney's Chances?

The official theme of the GOP convention Wednesday night was ""We Can Change That,"" but that didn't stop several of the speakers from revisiting Tuesday's theme, the base-rallying battle cry: ""We Built It."" The message: The righteous exploitation of President Obama's ""You Didn't Build That"" gaffe isn't going away. Ever since the president stood before a crowd of supporters in Roanoke, Va., on July 13 and, while explaining why the wealthy should pay more in taxes, uttered the infamous words ""If you've got a business--you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen,"" conservatives have hammered him for his disregard for small-business owners. And liberals have hammered back that Obama was taken out of context. To be fair, this is the full quote: If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business--you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. Obama supporters can complain all they want. They can argue that when he said ""that,"" he was talking about the roads and bridges, not the business itself. It doesn't matter. And it's pointless to blame Mitt Romney or the RNC or anyone else for taking it out of context. Here's why. Many moons ago, I spent a couple of years in a fiction-writing program at a local university. I never finished the novel I aspired to write, but I did learn some valuable lessons. The most important: ""It doesn't matter what you meant. What matters is what you conveyed."" In the context of class, that meant when we were sharing our work and listening to feedback, we couldn't butt in and say that we'd meant something else. We needed to take ourselves out of our own head and try to understand what our readers had heard. In the case of Obama's Roanoke speech, conservatives everywhere heard, ""You don't get credit for your hard work."" I agree with the Washington Post for giving the Romney campaign  four Pinocchios for repeating the truncated quote ad nauseam. I wish Romney's team would use the full version. Because even in its full glory, it would inspire largely the same reaction.  The sentiment resonates with small-business owners--and it's small-business owners who have been most vocal in their response to Obama's comments, from the co-owner of an Iowa deli who good-naturedly catered an Obama campaign stop in a T-shirt saying, ""Government didn't build my business"" to the hardware store owner who was a bit less gracious. Conservatives suspect that President Obama sees government as the solution to everything. Only someone who thinks government is the answer would describe a stimulus program that cost at least $185,000 per job as successful. I can't think of a starker difference between the liberal and conservative worldviews than the Life of Julia slide show.  Liberals look at that video and see a woman aided by a social safety net. Conservatives look at it and are creeped out by the fact that liberals think the very-capable-seeming Julia can't do anything without government help. That same sentiment comes through in the ""You Didn't Build That"" speech. Obama's words contain an undertone that business owners are selfish, that they are ungrateful toward those teachers who helped them along the way. And that is where Obama's misunderstanding of small business, real or perceived, shines through. Quite apart from whatever taxes they pay, small-business owners are part of the very fabric of their communities. Someone has to run the pharmacy. Someone has to run the gas stations. Local businesses don't send their profits back to Bentonville, Ark.; Minneapolis, Minn.; or Cupertino, Calif., but rather put them back into the community. The restaurant owner gets his produce and meat from local stores, the mechanic hires a local painter to spruce up his shop. They are the ones who not only give money to the athletic booster club and the PTA, but show up to help out at fundraisers.  And if that teacher who helped them with their math homework stops by, the owner gives her a free oil change or an extra slice of pie for dessert. The president's comment implies that business owners are ignorant of all the benefits they get from government. And it makes Obama's supporters look unaware of all that government gets out of businesses and how political decisions affect entrepreneurs. Ask a business owner if they feel like they get more out of the government than they give. Sure, it helps that the city paves the road that was there for 20 years before they opened their business, and maybe they are grateful for that new traffic light. They understand that the local police protect their livelihoods. On the other hand, do politicians not appreciate that business owners match every dollar their employees contribute to Social Security and Medicare? Do politicians not understand when they are patting themselves on the back for raising minimum wage that somewhere, some shop owner is reaching for the ulcer medication while he weighs whether to raise prices, cut back employee hours, or rethink his hours of operation? By Friday morning, crews will be tearing down the GOP convention stage and those crazy screens and banners that hung throughout the Tampa Bay Times Forum.  We'll have forgotten ""We Can Change That"" and ""We Believe in America."" But every day for the next two months, business owners will pull on T-shirts and hang signs on their stores that say ""I Built This."" Go ahead, try telling them what their president ""meant."""

Ann Romney and Chris Christie delivered two different messages on the first night of the Republican Convention. Ann Romney talked about the importance of love, but Chris Christie said love wasn't as important as respect. On the face of it, the two messages seemed in discord, but actually the messages were well-aligned, at least politically. Love Mitt Romney enough to elect him and then respect him when your love is tested because he's making the hard choices that a president must make. This kind of pitch works with marriages where the odds are stacked against the young couple. The groom tells his bride that their life together is going to be hard. ""I don't care,"" she says. ""I love you."" ""We're only going to be able to afford ramen and tap water,"" he says. ""I don't care,"" she says. ""I love you."" He persists: ""You're going to have to walk a half an hour to the bus stop because I can't make the car payments."" She is resolute: ""I still love you."" In the end, passion and trust overcome whatever fears there are about the future. On Tuesday night, Ann Romney and Chris Christie were marriage counselors. Ann Romney tried to vouch for the groom's credentials. Don't worry about this union, she said in effect, I know him better than anyone, and he's a trustworthy guy. He'll work hard. You'll get home safe from whatever journey he takes you on. Chris Christie spoke on behalf of the clear-eyed groom. Times are going to be hard, but it'll be worth it in the end. You can believe that things will be better because the groom is being straight with you about how hard the road will be. Honesty as an aphrodisiac. What's a bride (or a voter) to do? If you are already in love with the handsome man from Detroit, you probably already have been texting him about meeting in the alley to elope. On the other hand, you could just be stringing him along to make your old boyfriend jealous (and confuse pollsters). If you are somewhere in the middle, you have a dilemma (or you are now the main character in one of this fall's new romantic comedies). Which of the two counselors should you listen to? Ann Romney made a solid case, but it was limited. If someone is undecided, you can't just assert that she should ignore all warnings. So perhaps Ann Romney helped some people lean a little more toward this squeaky clean fella, but you could understand if they were still looking for a little more from Gov. Christie about this suitor's prospects. But after 20 minutes of Christie talking about himself and Bruce Springsteen, I doubt Christie's words made the choice any clearer. Indeed, some may now want to marry Christie. Others may be a little spooked. In the sales pitch, Christie talked about how hard things were going to be. The couple is going to ""live, not by avoiding truths, especially the hard ones, but by facing up to them."" Well, just how hard are things going to get? Christie won't really say, but he does keep talking about how things are going to be hard and tough choices are going to be made. You probably want specifics--after all, this is a big decision--but Counselor Christie only repeats generalities that you have heard from so many suitors before. One thing he's very clear about, though: hard choices. It's time to step off this imperfect metaphor before someone gets hurt. But the topic of hard choices deserves a closer look. Tuesday night, Christie defined hard choices as those that are difficult because they anger voters and therefore put a politician in political peril. Christie wants points for brave decisions he made in New Jersey, and he wants Mitt Romney to get bravery points, too. But there's a difference: Romney is seeking an advance bravery credit. Having not been elected president, he's not actually made any hard choices. He hasn't really talked about them either. (Though, like Christie, he promises he will.) If Romney and Christie really believed in the hard-choices formula, they'd get specific about the hard choices now, explaining to people the trade-offs they're going to face and the government assistance they're going to have to do without. (Think about how many bravery points they could win then.) But the hard-choice theory of politics doesn't really call for candidates to announce hard choices. Or, to think of it another way, it's a promise to diet in the future, which you bolster by pointing out how poorly your colleague's diet is working. Make no mistake, the hard choices will be hard for the people who will be affected by them, whether it's in reduced Medicare benefits, barred access to financial aid, or bumpy roads from a drop in infrastructure spending. The pain from not addressing the budget imbalance will also have hard consequences. There is going to be change resulting from the unsustainable budget deficit. That change will come from Democratic policies, Republican policies, or no policies. Voters are looking for someone to trust in handling the belt tightening. And that takes us back to Ann Romney and her proclamation that she trusts her husband to make the inevitable hard choices that have to be made. Again, it was just her assertion. Whether you stand to gain or feel the pinch from those policies will determine whether you believe her."	Does Anyone Want the Marriage Ann Romney and Chris Christie Are Selling?

He is followed by a fast-moving amoeba of blue, white, and khaki. On closer inspection, the amoeba is made up of an assistant, volunteers, and signs that read ""Joe Kennedy for Congress."" The drivers quickly realize that their windshields will not be squeegeed. They roll the windows down. ""Good morning, I'm Joe Kennedy,"" says the candidate. ""I'm running for Congress in this district."" He hands over a leaflet. He jogs to the next car. For quite some time he sprints across the intersection of President and Eastern avenues in Fall River, Mass., shaking hands. The candidate's grandmother, Ethel Skakel Kennedy, stands on another corner, waving at cars. She's campaigned, successfully, for her late husband, her two late brothers-in-law, one son, one daughter, and one nephew. So: As a candidate, as a hand-shaker, how's Joseph Patrick Kennedy III? ""I think he's got the traffic pattern down,"" she quips. The next Kennedy is pretty good at this. His campaign for Massachusetts' 4th district, the one currently held by the retiring Barney Frank, launched with the hype and care that you typically see for a Michael Bay movie that's supposed to anchor a studio's summer schedule. The Boston Globe's first long profile of ""JKIII""--who turns 32 in October--led with a story about the candidate's teetotaling. (His old lacrosse teammates at Stanford teased him at bars; they'd order him pints of milk.) Later profiles have told of Kennedy's work at the Middlesex County DA's office, about JKIII's new dog, Banjo, and his plans to get married after the November election, which everybody expects him to win. We should back up and explain why that matters. Ted Kennedy died in 2009, his Senate seat quickly snatched away from Democrats by Scott Brown. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, the first member of JKIII's generation to serve in Congress, retired in 2010, ostensibly to help others deal with the depression and substance abuse problems that had bedeviled him for years. The 112th Congress was the first since the Sputnik era to include zero members of the Kennedy family. People aren't supposed to take this so hard, but they do. After Martha Coakley blew the special election for that Senate seat, former Rep. Joe Kennedy II--JKIII's father--was asked why he didn't run. ""It wasn't the greatest decision I ever made in my life,"" he sighed. Joe II is here in Fall River, too, stopping to talk to motorists, offering them a right hand with splints on two fingers. At the family's next stop, a get-out-the-vote seminar for volunteers, Joe II swears that a motorist just dissed him and told him: ""If the vote's for you, forget about it. If it's for your son, I'm happy to give it."" The story is credible. JKIII looks remarkably like a ginger RFK. When he laughs--the   polite chuckle of the trail, the kind that emerges when a voter's too enthusiastic or a debate moderator wants to break tension--JKIII bobs his head, squints, and flashes an aw-shucks-no-really grin. I spent 15 minutes covering the candidate before a Fall River voter, Susan Dumais, handed him a book about Rose Kennedy and asked him for a signature. JKIII obliged. Later, when JKIII walked door to door in Foxboro, I heard an elderly voter talk and talk about how ""the people need a Kennedy in there."" I'd seen the young Kennedy tell interviewers that he had to earn the seat himself. How did the family campaign day fit into that plan? Kennedy talks quietly, as if he's constantly sharing secrets. The secrets sound a whole lot like well-rehearsed answers. ""It's something I'm very proud of. My family's record of public service, the impact they've had on Massachusetts. With that comes the recognition that I am on the ballot. It's me. I'm running this race. It's me, not my grandfather, my grandfather's brothers and sisters."" This is a nice, self-effacing explanation that can never really be true. It's in JKIII's interest for this to be seen as a KENNEDY election. Then again, it's in the interest of his likely opponent, Sean Bielat, for this to be a KENNEDY election, too. In 2010, when he was 35 years old and had never run for anything, Bielat challenged Barney Frank. It was a dream election--a Marine veteran with idiosyncratic views (no to term limits, Iraq was a mistake) versus a House chairman whom people had started to blame for the financial crisis. Bielat spent $2.5 million and lost by only 10 points, in a district that had gone for Obama by 28 points. He built a massive email list and an online following. Trading Frank for Kennedy meant trading one high-profile race for another high-profile race. Inside his Foxboro, Mass., office, a supporter has dropped off a dog-eared copy of The Kennedy Men: Three Generations of Sex, Scandal and Secrets. That's totally unofficial. On the wall, there's a fundraising letter that tells donors ""the only thing worse than Frank is another Kennedy!"" That's more official. ""Barney Frank brought 32 years of experience, chairman of House Financial Services, $4 million--obviously qualified for the job,"" says Bielat. ""This guy brings a name, and some money. If you ask most people around here what they know about Joe Kennedy, they can't tell you a damn thing. His resume is three years as a DA and two years in the Peace Corps and the Dominican Republic? There are direct flights from Logan to the Dominican Republic. It's a tourist destination; he helped build up a tourism company. I don't bear ill will towards the family. I bear ill will toward the idea that, in America, by virtue of your name, you can get into political office."" Eventually, Bielat wants to talk policy. So does Kennedy. A few days after my quick visit to the district, I return to watch two candidate forums--Kennedy versus his Democratic primary foes, Bielat versus two other Republicans. Bielat's race is a bit of a mismatch. Kennedy's is just hilarious. One of his challengers is Rachel Brown, a Lyndon LaRouche cultist who won brief YouTube fame after she challenged Frank in a Q&A and he asked ""what planet"" she was from. The other is Herb Robinson, an engineer and blues musician who responds to nettlesome questions by saying, ""Pass."" Kennedy survives. But he doesn't take chances. I'd asked him previously whether he'd try and move into the financial-services issues that Frank mastered, and whether he'd seek Frank's committee assignments. Kennedy had pivoted immediately to a preferred issue, education, explaining that a healthy economic picture ""starts with education, from early childhood education, access to that, to secondary education."" At the debate, Kennedy hits on the exact same lines. He skillfully evades a question about Citizens United and outside campaign spending by saying--truthfully--that it would be tough to amend the Constitution and change the disclosure standards. When he's asked to think of a ""funny"" moment from the campaign trail, he's legitimately stumped until he jokes that he ""probably can't talk about"" whatever might have been funny. After that, and a few Rachel Brown monologues about the economic benefits of space exploration, Kennedy's done. He leaves without talking to reporters. Bielat gamely offers to help fill their notebooks. ""I enjoyed when Kennedy was talking about campaign finance reform,"" says Bielat, ""and with a straight face he said we needed to reform the system. This is a guy who's out-raised everyone in Congress except John Boehner and Allen West."" The challenger happily feeds the David-vs.-Hyannisport narrative. ""It's like that famous quote that they said in the first race against Ted Kennedy. Change the name on his resume, change the name on his signs, and nobody's talking about him right now."" Hang on, though--the guy who said that, Edward McCormack, looked like a hate-crazed jerk. Kennedy beat him like a drum. ""I know,"" deadpans Bielat. ""But that was a while ago."""

He crosses the street, doffs his black sunglasses, and apologizes for running a little late to our coffee meeting in his adopted city of Englewood, N.J. ""We just got back from Rwanda,"" he says, rubbing his eyes. (""We"" are the rabbi and an assistant.) ""It takes time to recover from an experience like that."" The Rwanda visit came during a two-week journey across Africa, a soul-searching interruption of the campaign. He didn't see it as an interruption. As he wrote in the Huffington Post, where his byline appears several times every month, ""I always promised myself that if I ever ran for public office I would highlight anti-genocide legislation as one of the principal planks of my platform."" It makes sense to me, but when I bring it up, he starts defending the trip as if he's talking to a critic. ""Everyone's saying that the biggest issue in the campaign is the economy,"" says Shmuley. (Note: Nobody calls him ""Boteach."") ""And that's obvious, right? But where I differ is, I don't think you can fix an economy without a national sense of purpose. I'm reading Robert Caro's book right now, his latest installation of the LBJ biographies, and you'd be amazed. During JFK's administration, it was all economics. It's always economics. And yet if you look at JFK's inaugural, the most eloquent inaugural of the modern era, it spoke about freedom, and liberty, and America's responsibility to others. If you frame the economy and everything else within a sense of national purpose, people know why they're working hard. It's not just to buy the newest PDA, it's not just to buy the newest plasma TV."" Shmuley's cinnamon dolce latte arrives, as does my frappe. Shmuley takes a swig. He delves deeper into this well-practiced lament about hyper-consumerism and the loss of values. This riff is all over his recent book Renewal, which means he's promoted it on TV shows, which means he's written columns about it. If Rabbi Shmuley has an idea, that idea is transmitted to as much media as humanly possible. Shmuley has been a celebrity rabbi--the first and only of his kind--for more than a decade. His campaign literature prints a picture of Shmuley rallying against Muammar Qaddafi when the late dictator wanted a visa. Right above that picture, this bio: Shmuley has authored 27 books and hosted television and radio programs including 'Shalom in the Home' on The Learning Channel, as well as The Rabbi Shmuley radio program on WABC and XM Satellite Radio. He is a regular contributor on Fox News, CNN, and other broadcast outlets, as well as a guest on programs such as The Dr. Phil Show, The Dr. Oz Show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and many others. And now he's a Republican congressional candidate who will soon reap the gains from a $500,000 Super PAC donation from Sheldon and Miriam Adelson. He tells me that lessons learned in a country that survived genocide work both ""microcosmically"" and ""macrocosmically."" ""When you live for yourself,"" he says, ""I think your economy corrodes. When you live with a greater sense of purpose, I think you do really well. The United States when it had far higher defense expenditures, during the Cold War, had a far more robust economy for the most part. It stood for something. I think we need to regain that. That's why I went to Rwanda."" Democrats hope they can ignore this for a few months. Shmuley's opponent, Rep. Bill Pascrell, won the seat after a blood-letting primary. He was forced to square off against Rep. Steve Rothman after redistricting forced the two of them into one district across the water from New York. Rothman was Jewish; Pascrell isn't. Republicans--Shmuley included--exploited that opening by attacking Pascrell's past support of Imam Mohammad Qatanani. But the Cook Political Report gave the new district a D+11 rating, meaning that it votes about 11 points more Democratic than the country as a whole. ""If Joe the Plumber's bid in OH-09 is a pipe dream,"" says Cook's disturbingly pun-conscious David Wasserman, ""Rabbi Boteach's run in NJ-09 has even less of a prayer."" But there's that Super PAC money--equal to one-third of Pascrell's last campaign budget--and there's the Israel issue. ""Where there is no conflict, where there's been no terrorism, Israel gives total freedom to 1.5 million Arabs,"" says Shmuley. ""They have Israeli passports, they can serve in the Knesset."" George W. Bush, whom Shmuley had ""the utmost respect"" for, understood that. ""But now you have a Democratic, African-American president who is really Kissingerian in tone. When the Arab Spring broke out, he made that speech about Israel returning to the 1967 lines. I don't even know why he made that speech."" Shmuley rubs his temples. ""President Obama broke my heart,"" he says. ""I'd expected that an African-American president would continue the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., but this time with the powers of the American presidency. That he'd be the foremost advocate and champion of human freedom and human rights in the world."" The disappointment ran so deep that Shmuley--whose relationship advice and advocacy had never been really partisan--became a Republican candidate. His economic plan is straightforward--a flat tax and a tax credit for businesses that close on a Sabbath day. ""There are times when the government needs to be big, like during the Second World War,"" says Shmuley. ""But the rest of the time, we should go back to what the Founders believed--an entrepreneurial citizenry, a government that is large enough to facilitate those opportunities but no larger."" This is a slight departure from what he'd just said about moments of great national purpose, but it's the sort of libertarianism you hear from Tea Partiers all the time. As is the Shmuley spiel about regulation. ""I'm at the lake with my son, and a water cop comes up to me on a jet ski and gives me a ticket because I'm not wearing a life vest. In two feet of water. That's a nanny state!"" The tax-credit-for-Sabbaths idea isn't so common. Shmuley ties it into his over-arching theme of cultural, moral restoration, which in turn he brings back to Michael Jackson. In one of the many tapes Shmuley recorded with Jackson, the pop star spoke of the need for a national Children's Day, a time set aside to celebrate the whole family. ""He made a simple point that was very well-argued,"" says Shmuley. ""There's a mother's day, there's a father's day--what about a kid's day? He said he'd have had a better relationship with his father if, when he was a kid, there was a day where he could tell him 'Okay, now we do what I want to do.' When he died, and I wanted to honor his memory in some way, I started Friday Night into Family Night--you can see the website. And we've released an audio clip of Michael talking about Children's Day."" So far, Shmuley is the only Republican candidate talking about those ideas. But he gets along with the rest of the party. He adores House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, though they ""used to talk about the Torah,"" and now they talk politics. ""He's an incredibly busy man, but he graciously takes my calls."" When Mitt Romney said that ""culture"" explained the Israel-Palestinian wealth gap, Shmuley understood it, but gave his own spin. ""I feel that in Palestinian culture, there is sometimes a greater regard for defeating Israel than there is for Palestinian interests."" The interview has to end there, because Shmuley's got another appointment. ""I'm talking about 50 Shades of Grey,"" he says. ""Do you want to watch? Come on over to the house."" So I follow Shmuley's SmartCar through the gates, into his stately Englewood home, and watch him turn on a dime to discuss what Christian Grey's proclivities say about the degraded state of romance. If you switched some words around, he could be talking about the decision he wants Obama voters and liberal Jews to make when they go to vote. ""I go talk to audiences around the world,"" he says into a camera, ""and I ask them: There's two factors in a relationship. There's attraction, and there's compatibility. Which is more important? All the hands go up for compatibility. We no longer believe that attraction--the raw, carnal desire of a man for a woman--is enough to sustain a relationship."""

But if you live in the overlapping world of politics and media, as I am learning, anything less than full transparency can potentially do you in. There are quite a number of us who inhabit this world of mixed marriages and familial ties (mazel tov to the ABC News campaign reporter who just married an aide to President Obama), and we have all struggled at different moments with the question of how much to disclose about our personal ties. I'm having a moment. My husband, Dan Senor, is an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Gov. Mitt Romney (He also worked for Romney in 2008, but since Romney never made it out of the gate, no one cared.) I do not have any involvement in this campaign. After a 15-year career in television news, sometimes spent biting my tongue in the name of objectivity and balance, I retired to raise our two small children. I am now basically a very opinionated mom, enjoying the freedom of being able to fully speak my mind. I have been fortunate that publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have allowed me to share some of my opinions with a wider audience. And since I am writing against the backdrop of this campaign, I have tried (and mostly failed) at getting the disclosure part right. First, since I am writing opinion and am no longer an objective reporter, different rules apply. It is a bit more challenging for NBC political reporter Chuck Todd, whose wife was a Democratic consultant. But he is on TV so much (deservedly so) that if he disclosed this fact every time he opened his mouth, no one else would ever get a word in. My friend and former colleague NBC's Andrea Mitchell has managed to have one of the most illustrious careers of anyone in TV news while being married to (and well before being married to) former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski's personal life is a minefield. Her father is Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, and while one brother is an Obama appointee, the other advises Romney. Mika says she is always being labeled as ""in the tank"" for President Obama, and she finds transparency to be her savior: ""I voted for Obama, and I am the first to say it."" Fortune magazine's Nina Easton, who is also married to a Romney guy, once began her comments on Fox News with the disclosure, ""I'm married to a Romney guy, so take this with a grain of salt"". I'm seriously tempted to begin any future op-ed exactly that way. Here is the truth: To assume that someone's views are invariably influenced or shaped by his or her partner is lazy. It is an intellectual crutch we grope for when we do not have an effective counter to someone's argument. In my limited experience writing opinion, smart people have challenged me with a reasoned response pointing out the weaknesses of my argument. The less intellectual partisans say, all full of ire, ""She's married to a Romney guy"". But here is another truth: You can't ignore the fact that two married people are most likely together because of some commonality. Given that, it is hardly unreasonable to assume they share some sort of identity and outlook, including, perhaps, a political worldview. The messy reality of our relationship, and I suspect most others, is that we are together on a lot of things and apart on many more. A few we agree not to even talk about. But mostly we challenge each other, learn from each other, and spend the rest of the time talking about the kids. Again, I'm married to a Romney guy, so take this with a grain of salt. The degree to which my husband and I agree--or influence one another--is really less the issue than the disclosure. Failing to disclose gives your intellectual opponents a means of distraction, a way to create a diversion so that your arguments go unheard. It is an effective strategy. And I was slow to catch on. Here are the mistakes I have made and tried to learn from. If you are going to criticize President Obama (as I did in the New York Times over his campaign for the women's vote) then disclosing a Romney relationship is certainly a no-brainer. Where I apparently failed was in putting the disclosure in the middle of the piece, rather than at the top. Outraged readers filled the comments section and my Twitter feed with their disgust that I didn't share my Romney connection. Clearly this was super  annoying to the people who wanted to dismiss the piece, but didn't want to actually read it all the way through. Message received. Another piece for the Times criticized Planned Parenthood for a weak legislative strategy that I felt was putting its federal funding at risk. I support funding for Planned Parenthood. Gov. Romney does not, so I didn't think my husband's role on his campaign warranted disclosure. But what followed was another round of attacks on my disclosure lapse, with Planned Parenthood, its supporters and many of my friends demanding to know why I hadn't stated that I am ""married to a Romney guy."" My mistake this time was not recognizing that during campaign season, you are never allowed to criticize those you support lest you give the other side ammunition to use against them. My bad. Most recently an op-ed I wrote for the Wall Street Journal was critical of New York teachers unions for supporting a policy that makes it very hard to fire teachers who engage in inappropriate sexual behavior with children. In this case, I failed twice. The teachers union immediately pointed to my Romney tie (apparently in their view only a Romney supporter would oppose sexual predators in school?). They then rightly asserted that  my husband serves on the board of StudentsFirst--New York, an education reform group that advocates for charter schools. He receives no money from the organization, yet the teachers unions blasted me for hiding this connection, and falsely accused me of a financial conflict of interest. Here I failed to disclose because I stupidly did not connect the teachers' unions' opposition to charter schools to their support for a system that protects teachers who engage in sexual misconduct. My sincerest apologies to the teachers unions for not fully appreciating how wrong they are on not one but two issues. As you may have guessed, I am not feeling very apologetic. These pieces represent my opinion and mine alone. If you want a different answer, ask a different girl. I have, however, gone back and forth on the disclosure question many times with a journalist friend. She believes the only way to go is to overshare, because as long as you are a Romney wife, there are certain people who will always believe that you are somehow doing his bidding. (Thank you, Twitter, for allowing me to engage with those people each and every day.) So in the interest of full disclosure, let me share a few more potential conflicts (that are mostly with my husband). Hopefully this will satisfy those who believe I am his ideological twin. For the deeply offended, contact info below. Dan likes the Jets. But we all know that Eli Manning is inimitable. (Jets fans can reach me at @campbell_brown via Twitter. Tom Brady fans, you can look up inimitable on dictionary.com). Dan works in finance. I think the financial industry is EVIL, with the exception of my husband. (Goldman Sachs--see above Twitter handle.) I support Simpson-Bowles. Dan is opposed to tax increases during an economic downturn. But we are working on this one in couples counseling. (Grover Norquist, please call Dan directly. He has some influence with me except when he doesn't.) Dan wants to try for a girl. I think two boys are enough. (See couples counseling.) Dan is obviously voting for Romney. I supported Obama in 2008. This year I am voting for... Some things we should be able to keep to ourselves."

Rep. David Cicilline, who was the mayor of this city for eight years, strides quickly and carefully from booth to bar to booth. His much-taller aide, identically attired, keeps one eye on the congressman and one eye on his smartphone. The annual Foo Fest, an art-and-counterculture celebration that takes up a couple of downtown blocks, has attracted some people who really don't want to meet a congressman. Cicilline walks through the Anarchist Books tent in the center of the block. ""Hi,"" he tells two members of the Rhode Island Anti-Sexism League, which is selling a collection of Occupy and feminist literature. ""David Cicilline."" He doesn't ask for their votes or tell them what he's running for. They know what he's running for. Cicilline sees a mother with a baby nearby, and beelines over to meet them. The Anti-Sexism Leaguers are gobsmacked. ""Is he actually doing that?"" asks a horrified Renae Chaves. ""I thought that was a cliche, politicians kissing babies. Oh, come on. What a douche."" She's offended that a politician would even show his face at Foo Fest. ""I think everyone's cynical about politics now. None of these guys do anything they promise. Rhode Island always votes for the Democrats, anyway."" Not necessarily. For ages, Democrat David Cicilline was one of the most popular mayors in America. Half-Italian, half-Jewish, the son of a mob lawyer, and openly gay, he ran against Mayor Buddy Cianci in 2002, declaring his candidacy a few months before the incumbent was sentenced to five years in prison for corruption. Cicilline won that election with 84 percent of the vote; he was re-elected with 83 percent. Then he ran for Congress. In 2010, Cicilline won the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island's first district, which includes almost all of Providence as well as the towns in the northern and eastern parts of the state. Barack Obama had carried the district by 32 points. Cicilline won it by 7 points. The reason: Providence, like so many cities, was unable to close a budget gap. Cicilline got the blame. After he won the congressional election, voters stayed angry about how he'd told them not to worry about the city budget, then learned they were running a $57 million deficit, with hundreds of millions of dollars in unfunded pension and health care costs. The first poll on Cicilline's 2012 re-election found him trailing a Republican opponent, Brendan Doherty, by 16 points. The incumbent was dragged down by a 65 percent negative approval rating. So imagine all of Barack Obama's problems, but worse. Cicilline has to convince 50-odd percent of voters that, yes, mistakes were made, but they should focus on what he could do--how much more fair and decent America will be if they give him another chance to work. ""We now have a [Republican] presidential candidate who has embraced the Republican House budget,"" says Cicilline. ""People get to decide whether they want to send a Republican who'll strengthen the Tea Party-backed budget in the House, which'll weaken Medicare, which will keep tax breaks for big oil, which gives another big tax break to millionaires and billionaires, which guts Pell grants, which guts education generally. It's a very clear choice of what kind of America you want. It's described as a courageous set of ideas? It's not. It's a very old set of ideas."" What about the Providence budget story? ""It's a good narrative for Republicans to talk about, because what they don't want to talk about is what they would do if they got to Washington."" Over the weekend, as he meets voters, the Ryan choice is Cicilline's preferred ice-breaker. ""You hear about Romney picking Ryan?"" ""What do you think of Ryan?"" Often, they don't know much about the telegenic new Republican veep nominee, so Cicilline gives a sort of negative elevator pitch about Paul's scariest ideas. At a cookout for a Democratic state legislator in Providence, one voter worries to Cicilline that the Ryan pick was a ""hail Mary pass, but the danger is, they complete it."" But everyone there agrees that the Ryan pick will, generally, help someone like Cicilline. He deserves to have the subject changed, they say. Mayor Angel Taveras, Cicilline's successor, speaks in Spanish to a couple of kids, then tells me that the rap on Cicilline is overwrought and unfair.* ""There's enough blame to go around,"" he says. There's irritation at ""what he said during the campaign,"" about the city being in better shape than it was, but there's not as much anger about the budget itself. ""When you look at his record, and what he did, he deserves a lot of credit--being the first to fund the pension system, negotiating an agreement with tax-exempt colleges."" And that might be resonant. On the way out of the city, I drove past a sign--right across from the state capitol--demanding that Brown University give more to the city, insisting that ""Rhode Island needs a tax revolt."" But Rhode Island Republicans are betting big on the anti-Cicilline, budget-revenge storyline. If Cicilline survives a primary challenge from businessman Anthony Gemma, he'll face the Republican recruit, Brendan Doherty, who leads him by 16 points. Doherty was born across the border in Massachusetts, rising to become superintendent of the Rhode Island state police, ready with a story about how he stopped bureaucrats from trying to build a new $40 million building for $70 million--and how, after he intervened, he got it built for $27 million. Cicilline jokes with voters and zips from handshake to handshake. Doherty stands nearly a full foot taller than the Democrat and carries himself like a nail-chewing member of the Expendables. ""He misled the voters of the city of Providence,"" says Doherty as he's getting ready to shoot a TV ad in the northern Rhode Island town of Woonsocket. ""As I travel through the 1st District, a lot of people just come back, and say, 'It's terrible, the current congressman left the city in a mess.' I'm all about fiscal responsibility and taking responsibility for a mess. That's a clear contrast with him."" There's an even clearer contrast this week, though--the Ryan plan. Doherty wants to blur that difference. ""He has some great ideas in there,"" he says of Ryan. ""I don't espouse the same ideas that he has with Medicare, as far as privatizing or vouchers. But he has some great ideas, and I support them."" Doherty is acutely aware of the problems he could face if voters panic about Ryan. Before he wraps up talking, he reminds me that he comes from law enforcement. ""I don't know if you were aware,"" he says, ""of the fact that he [Cicilline] was a mob lawyer."" That's not true, though--John Cicilline was a ""mob lawyer,"" but his son went from D.C. firms into Rhode Island politics. It was an important biographical note when Cicilline challenged Cianci, back when he was the Hope and Change candidate. Cianci definitely remembers. He's 71 now, hosting a radio show, and going without the leonine hairpiece that he wore when he was mayor. ""Cicilline's a great subject for talk radio,"" says Cianci. ""People like to talk about dishonesty. Whether it's right or wrong, they blame Cicilline for the budget, and he's polling lower than whale shit."" But Cianci won't count the guy out. Maybe Cicilline can run against the Ryan budget, and maybe he can benefit as Barack Obama clobbers the Romney-Ryan campaign over Medicare and taxes. ""Cicilline does not have the virtue of honesty or integrity or shame,"" says Cianci. ""He's got the virtue of being a Democrat in a Democratic district.""

""We would have hired him at Bain,"" he told a campaign colleague. The buoyant 42-year-old Ryan did look a bit like the junior partner in the duo's first sit-down interview with Bob Schieffer on 60 Minutes, matching Romney with a checked shirt and blazer. As Ryan kicked off his first two days of campaigning he was crisp, effective, and eager to show that the boss' confidence was not misplaced. ""We know who we are. We know what we believe. Now let's go do it,"" said Ryan Sunday. The line sounds a little like a motivational mantra from Ryan's beloved P90X workout. The next 85 days are going to be an extreme workout for Ryan. (It will also be 85 days of Democrats calling him extreme.) The test for Ryan will be whether he has the stamina to retain that broad grin: his genial manner may be the best defense against the claims by Democrats that he wants to dismantle the social safety net and against the rigors of a campaign where his every move will be observed and analyzed. The competition is well under way to define Paul Ryan, and it has now become a competition to define the Romney campaign as well. For the moment, at least, the Romney team has made the Ryan selection the narrative of the campaign. That means Ryan is no longer himself. Three forces are acting on this manikin: The Romney campaign, the Obama campaign, and the press. For two days the campaign gets to tell the story of its man, but now those other voices are starting to chime in. There's a lot of room for definition, if the Gallup poll is to be believed; nearly half of Republicans can't rate Ryan in a survey where six in 10 adults are not familiar enough with Ryan to offer an opinion of him. Mitt Romney made a ""bold"" choice and is ""placing a bet"" that ideas will win the election. That's how the campaign is selling it. As Mark Halperin has expertly detailed, the Romney team produced a nearly flawless Ryan roll-out. The pitch is that these two men are a kind of Geek Squad for the nation: efficient problem solvers who love numbers and analysis. Romney has the executive skills and Ryan knows every inch of the budget, so together they will turn around the country. The pitch spans the generations: Romney, who seems like a man of the '50s, linking up with the first man on a national ticket from Generation X. Ryan wasn't the only beaming new guy on stage this weekend. The man at the top of the ticket seemed like a fresh presence too. ""Ryan jacks him up,"" said a campaign adviser. Romney is looser on the stump, at one point leading a cheer of ""Paul! Paul! Paul!"" He's clearly pleased with his pick. So is the conservative base. The crowds at Romney/Ryan events were more raucous than they have been for Romney before. The party purists who love Ryan were going to vote against Obama anyway, but Ryan now moves those people to greater action before Election Day. Republican state offices are boasting of more volunteers. As of Sunday, the campaign reported more than $3 million in donations. The convention will look better on television with Republicans so enthusiastic and Romney has saved himself a good amount of grief in the future from conservatives who can now feel confident that he's put one of their kind on the ticket. All of this affection glosses over some rough spots in the narrative though, as the Obama camp and the press are beginning to point out. Ryan has none of the experience Romney has said is a requirement for the job. The campaign doesn't think voters will care about Ryan's lack of executive experience if he looks like a leader. (That's why Romney boasts so much about Ryan's leadership in taking on Medicare reform.) Campaign aides say Ryan's ability to step into the job right away if necessary was the key reason he was picked. But when asked what element in his background gave him this instant and unassailable credential to be commander in chief, they cited his oversight authority of the defense budget. They will drop this soon, just as the McCain campaign dropped the claims that Sarah Palin gained military insight from her relationship with the anti-missile batteries stationed in Alaska. It just doesn't wash. Fortunately, Barack Obama had arguably less commander-in-chief experience. Ryan is also a longtime Washington insider. Romney spent the primaries campaigning against Washington. Now he argues that Ryan will offer the perfect complement to his executive experience because Ryan has legislative experience. But what kind of legislative experience does he have? Romney presents Ryan as a bipartisan deal-maker, but the record there is not strong. He does not have a long list of bills passed. The Huffington Post reports that he's only authored a few bills that have passed during his near 14-year tenure in Congress, none of them towering bipartisan achievements. The Romney campaign provided two examples of bipartisanship: Ryan's collaboration with Sen. Ron Wyden on a Medicare white paper and his work with Congressman Chris Van Hollen on the Expedited Legislative Line-Item Veto and Rescissions Act. Wyden has called Romney's characterization of his collaboration with Ryan ""talking nonsense"" and Van Hollen issued a press release for the Obama campaign attacking Ryan. ""The Romney-Ryan budget is great for the wealthiest Americans like Mitt Romney,"" he said, ""but at the expense of everyone and everything else."" This is not the first time a top candidate has oversold his record of bipartisan accomplishment. Sen. Barack Obama made claims to bipartisan achievement that far outstripped his actual performance. His reliance on Tom Coburn was the equivalent of Paul Ryan's reliance on Ron Wyden. If Ryan is not the deal-maker Romney claims then he's not a solutions man. He's just an articulate spokesman who has won the respect, devotion, and loyalty of his team. Ryan's ability to broker bipartisan compromise is particularly important given the ambition of the candidate's ideas. How do you put something like his Medicare plan in place when the public is reluctant? A new survey conducted by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 58 percent of Americans want Medicare left alone. How do you overcome this opposition? Not through assertion, but through bipartisan cooperation and explanation that reaches beyond your teammates. That's what Gingrich was talking about when he criticized the Ryan plan as ""right wing social engineering."" The former speaker made this assertion based on his career of passing legislation with a Democratic president. Doing big, bold things requires skills of salesmanship that neither Romney nor Ryan have demonstrated. Yet Romney asserts that these skills are part of the Ryan package. Ultimately, selling the boldness of the Ryan plan falls on the candidate at the top of the ticket. If the Ryan pick was a bold vote for a campaign of specifics, Romney has not suddenly started talking at length about Medicare reform. That's not surprising. Who wants a PowerPoint presentation during the honeymoon? However, it does suggest that we should set our expectations low when it comes to specificity. The campaign still hopes that this election will be a referendum on Barack Obama. That means the focus will largely remain on Obama. But the campaign also knows that being the anti-Obama isn't enough to get Romney elected. Voters also want to know that Romney has a plan. Ryan helps Romney fulfill that requirement. Romney and Ryan want points for being leaders without having to get into the details of how they'd lead. The Romney team does not want the campaign to turn into a House Budget Committee mark-up where every idea Paul Ryan has had is debated. That outcome would be bad for three reasons. First, campaigns are no place to talk complicated policy, especially if you have the burden of explanation (as Romney and Ryan do on Medicare). Second, Romney is not as good a salesman of Ryan's views as Ryan is. Three, a deep policy discussion inevitably exposes daylight between Ryan and Romney, and that will give Democrats more opportunities. To play offense in the Medicare battle, Ryan will travel to Florida later this week to attack President Obama for the Medicare provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act. This trip is a crucial debut. But Ryan's trip is about more than the debate over the future of the program. It's a test of the campaign's theory of boldness. Part of what the Romney/Ryan ticket is arguing is that they should get leadership points for being bold about tough issues. It's an interesting theory. Usually politicians say they're bold, seek the credit but then never actually present anything that is bold for fear of terrifying people. That's what Bush did with Social Security reform and what Obama did with health care reform during their campaigns. (Remember, Obama wasn't for the individual mandate as a candidate.) Ryan is going to try campaigning on boldness when the boldness is actually down on paper. In his 60 Minutes interview, Ryan said that he wasn't going to destroy Medicare because his mother, who lives in the battleground state of Florida, benefits from the program. This was a prelude to another strategy we're likely to see more of in the coming weeks as Ryan deploys his biography. Romney campaign aides argue that Ryan will help Romney connect with middle-class voters the way Biden helps Obama do the same. This election is in large part about how a small number of swing voters feel about which campaign team is going to be on their side. Ryan's story of being a middle-class kid whose dad died when he was young is the Romney campaign's shield against the claim that the GOP ticket only cares about the wealthy. It's a story Democrats can't refute, but they'll do their best to make it hard for him to tell it."	Romney and Ryan Are Electric on the Campaign Trail. But How Long Can the Fun Last?

JANESVILLE, Wis.-- Mitt Romney has made his first presidential-level decision, picking Paul Ryan, the 42-year-old, seven-term Congressman from southern Wisconsin, as his running mate. The choice offers the first real hints about what kind of president Romney will be. Here's what we learned: He takes risks, he can adapt, and he's willing to campaign on a bold set of ideas rather than generalities. If you're looking for the attributes of presidential leadership, these are all strong qualities. The Ryan pick also tells us less flattering things about Romney: He's willing to discard what were once deeply held views about the necessity of business and executive experience and to cosset the GOP base for political reasons at the expense of independents. Thanks to the endless coverage this campaign of gaffes and out-of-context quotes, it had seemed like we were going to have a donut election: fluffy, sugary, and with nothing in the middle. The stakes for voters have always been high, but the way the campaign has played out has not matched the claims by both candidates that this is the most important election of a generation. Romney has had plans he could point to, but he wasn't really running on them. Now he's put a greater emphasis on those plans. They are no longer in the background, which means this election will be a clearer choice for voters. It will touch on the central question of how you refashion government in a time of scarcity and when a majority of the public is scared, thinking the country is headed in the wrong direction. The Ryan pick is thrilling. That's a first for Romney's campaign. Throughout the primaries, a segment of conservatives were lukewarm about him. Since then, in countless interviews with activists, strategists and voters, it has been clear that Republicans are voting more against Obama than for Mitt Romney. Now conservatives have something to vote for. Paul Ryan is a revered figure in conservative circles. He is a conservative evangelist for the free market and lower taxes, and he doesn't apologize. Ryan, along with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walter, is loud and proud--willing to be specific and controversial despite the political heat. Mitt Romney has never been considered in the same mold. Over the last few months, there has been an influential chorus of Republicans--joined by Walker--calling for Romney not only to get specific about conservative solutions but to campaign on them. To run merely as the anti-Obama alternative was not enough, argued people like Ryan-backer Bill Kristol. Romney had to present a set of alternative ideas and champion them. Others, like Mitch Daniels, argued that only by campaigning with brio could Romney win a mandate for governing. By picking Ryan, Romney has staked his campaign on fundamentally restructuring the government and its relationship to the people who fund it. Ryan has called for the privatization of Social Security and transforming Medicare from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan. The seven-term congressman has pushed these ideas for years, pointing to his continued success in a contested state and in a district that Barack Obama won in 2008 as proof that conservatives could be true to their beliefs and survive politically. As a conservative ideas man, Ryan is well ahead of most others in his party not just in his level of specificity but in his willingness to stand behind his ideas. But in 2010, Republican leaders didn't embrace Ryan's ""roadmap,"" knowing that it would be too controversial, particularly the change to Medicare. House Republicans were running against Democrats by arguing that Democrats were destroying Medicare, something that would have been hard to do while also championing the Ryan plan, which would have opened them to the same charge. Those ideas are now so central to the party's chances of winning back the White House that they have won Ryan a spot on the ticket. Ryan is loved by conservatives, but he makes moderate Republicans nervous. ""We've switched the campaign from being about jobs and Obama's bad record to one about Paul Ryan's Medicare plans,"" said one Republican strategist, echoing the sentiment of several I interviewed. The Romney team argues that swing state independent voters will see the new policy focus as a road out of their current economic woes. Some Republican strategists think it's a gift to the Obama campaign. That's because one of the Obama teams' goals has long been to tie Romney to Ryan and his budget proposals. They also wanted this election to be a choice, not a referendum on Obama. When both the campaign and the challenger have the same goals it suggests that one of them really has it very wrong. Ryan is not a complement to Mitt Romney. He's an injection of energy, like Sarah Palin was for John McCain or Jack Kemp was for Bob Dole. He is telegenic and enjoys sparring with those who doubt him, which are important skills. He's also a possible ambassador to middle class and Rust Belt voters in the way that Joe Biden has been for president Obama. That might put a state like Wisconsin, which was trending toward Obama, back in play. When Mitt Romney talked about his vice presidential pick before it was announced, he said, in an interview with NBC, that he wanted a candidate who had ""a vision for the country that adds something to the political discourse about the direction of the country."" Sounds good, but the president is the one who is supposed to have the vision. In this case though, the No. 2 has the vision and instincts that Romney doesn't. It's why so many wanted Ryan to run for president. To be fair, Romney is certainly capable of articulating a vision. That's what he did with his health care plan in Massachusetts. But he is reluctant to boast about those achievements. Perhaps Romney can take a vision graft from Ryan. He'll have to, because voters won't be lured by Ryan's ideas unless the man at the top of the ticket makes the case for them. But for all of the talk of a new emphasis on policy specifics, this is still going to be a campaign deeply connected to American values. When Ryan spoke on Saturday, he talked about the threat Obama poses to the American way of life. Underneath every policy debate will be the argument that when tough choices have to be made about the federal government, you're going to want candidates who share your values when they're doing the awful math of scarcity. The Romney choice represents a significant adaptation from the plan that the campaign had been running before, which relied mostly on keeping the campaign focused on Barack Obama's record. By picking Ryan, who comes with a very detailed set of ideas and proposals, Romney has embraced the view that he needs to run a campaign that offers bright alternatives to Obama's vision. Even the Romney bus sends this message. It has been redesigned on the outside to read ""The Romney Plan."" Every president needs to know how to stick to a plan against all advice to the contrary, but perhaps even more important is that they know when to adapt. Romney has been slipping in the polls against Obama. The Real Clear Politics average has him down four points. Voters have a more unfavorable view of him than they do a favorable one, according to a variety of polls. By picking Ryan, Romney has a chance to redefine himself in a way that might relaunch the brand. But unlike the Sarah Palin pick or Bob Dole's pick of Jack Kemp, this is not an odd couple. It is a rebranding that is mostly consistent with Romney's general approach. There is one big way in which Ryan is not in the Romney mold: He lacks executive experience. Romney has repeatedly said this shortcoming makes politicians from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama to Rick Santorum unqualified for office. It was the talking point for those who have endorsed Romney, particularly N.J. Gov. Chris Christie: ""Let's be very leery, very wary of sending another member of Congress to the White House. Now, see, members of Congress, they can be OK, but they don't know the first thing most of the time about using executive authority. They don't know the first thing about getting things done."" Ryan also has no real business experience, a quality that Romney has said should be a qualification for office. Romney is running an attribute campaign: His argument is that his skills and experience are particularly suited to the White House. Given that, it's no small thing to then throw away the key attribute when selecting your vice president. In picking a running mate, Romney has said the first criteria is that he needs to be able to step into the job. Either he doesn't mean that or his previous emphasis on the necessity of executive experience was meaningless. It is a time-honored tradition to revise the criteria you set before you picked your vice president to fit the person you actually do pick. It makes the sale harder, though, for a candidate like Romney who has a reputation for ideological malleability. To get around this, the Romney campaign has sold Ryan as the Washington counterpoint to Romney's leadership skills. ""I believe my record of getting things done in Congress will be a very helpful complement to Gov. Romney's executive and private sector success outside Washington,"" Ryan said at the announcement. This is a new criteria for Romney's vice presidential pick, but it's also one that will require some scrutiny. Is Ryan really the bipartisan deal-maker he claims? He didn't sign on to the Simpson-Bowles, even though a strong conservative like Sen. Tom Coburn was able to in the name of bipartisanship. And he has not been a willing partner with Obama, despite Obama's early view that he could work with Ryan. Liberals cite Obama's appreciation for Ryan as one of his foolish early moves: mistaking an ideologue for someone who actually wanted to exchange ideas. Romney will now test the proposition at the heart of all of the good advice he was getting from conservatives: Whether specificity kills or whether the country is really hungering for a detailed plan. Until this point, Romney has been almost allergic to specifics. Now he will have to give nuanced, precise, and powerful answers. He's going to have to flip a switch, which might not be that easy given how hyper-careful he has been to this point. His aides have long said that Romney loves policy details. He'll get a chance to prove it now."	Dickerson: Someone Is Going To Be Very Disappointed By the Ryan VP Pick	['Romney', 'Paul', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'McCain']	[]
13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news/politics/2012/08/romney_tax_dodge_and_obama_welfare_corruption_policy_implications_of_campaign_slurs_.html	"August is supposed to be the stupidest month of any presidential campaign. Voters, who have figured this out by now, are distracted by other news and waiting for Labor Day. Pollsters are waiting on the voters to tune in, so they can finally start releasing some accurate numbers, instead of the ""registered voters"" gruel they keep serving. In 2004, August became the Month of the Swift Boat Veteran. In 2008, the Obama ""celebrity ad"" distracted us until the Russia-Georgia conflict briefly became the most important foreign conflict of our time. This August is different. We are suddenly drowning in policy, things that are real-world relevant, stuff that costs money and keeps thousands of bureaucrats busy. It may not seem like that. It seems like the candidates have spent a week talking about Mitt Romney's taxes and Barack Obama's hatred of welfare reform. But to figure out what they're really debating, you have to understand what sort of presidents they plan to be. Start with the still-new welfare attacks. On July 12, the Department of Health and Human Services informed states that it would ""consider waiver requests that strengthen the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program."" The waiver requests could be broad, because HHS would ""authorize a state to test approaches and methods other than those set forth"" in work requirements. You want a check? Prove you're trying to find a job. The waivers might be granted as long as they found ""more effective means of meeting the work goals of TANF."" This was a massive policy shift, done after three years of study and state-to-feds-to-state discussion. Longtime students of welfare reform worried that the Obama administration had punched holes the 1996 reform law, because the work requirements weren't supposed to be waivable in any way, lest some perfidious liberal-run states decide to ignore the law. And that takes us to Mitt Romney's new ad, which claims that Obama is ""dropping work requirements"" and will ""just send you your welfare check"" if you're lazy. Is the Romney ad true? Not right now. The waiver requests haven't even gone out, as state-government spokespeople keep telling me when I ask them for their action plans. What is true is that the Obama administration would allow states to mess around with welfare-to-work requirements, and Mitt Romney says he wouldn't. Also true: The Obama administration will offer waivers to states that don't want to implement the personal insurance mandate peg of the Affordable Care Act, as long as they figure out ways to get their residents insured. Romney's said he'd offer the same waivers, but only as a stopgap measure toward repealing the whole law. Boil that down. Vote for Barack Obama and you'll have an administration that will help liberal states enact more liberal policies: single-payer health care in Vermont, experimental welfare-to-work requirements in Hawaii. Vote for Mitt Romney and you won't get that. It's not complicated. Actually, no, it's better than that. It's so open-ended that it can survive the he-said-she-said-lie-o-meter Tantalus of campaign journalism. When PolitiFact looked at the Romney ad, it debunked the ""just send you your welfare check"" line. But it couldn't prove that the work requirements had been spared. ""That's for a court to decide,"" wrote PolitiFact's Molly Moorhead. And then she gave Romney a ""Pants on Fire"" rating anyway. That's the problem with Pants-on-Fire-ism. You can fact-check a lot of things, but you can't quite fact-check a theory about how a policy might work. You also can't fact-check a claim that's been made about evidence no one's allowed to see. That brings us to Harry Reid's yarn about a ""Bain investor"" who told him that Romney ""didn't pay any taxes for 10 years."" The entire professional fact-check squad has called Reid a liar while admitting that he may not actually be a liar. ""Without seeing Romney's taxes, we cannot definitively prove Reid incorrect,"" wrote the Washington Post's Glenn Kessler. ""But tax experts say his claim is highly improbable."" Well, there you go. Four Pinocchios. But look at how Kessler got there. He made a Homerian journey through the cliffs and shoals of tax law, and found that Bain Capital allowed employees ""to co-invest retirement funds in takeover deals,"" that ""61 percent of high-income returns with no tax liability stemmed from tax-exempt interest,"" and that Romney himself ""chaired the audit committee of Marriott International when it engaged in a highly aggressive tax shelter."" We have not evolved highly enough to gaze into Harry Reid's mind, but we can make an assumption: He wanted the media to ask more questions about tax laws that favor the rich. That's a policy dispute, folks. It's at the center of Barack Obama's campaign. It's a major Republican critique of the first three years of the president's term: Why didn't he take tax reform seriously when Bowles-Simpson asked him to? A good amount of Romney-Reid-Bain-gate coverage has actually delved into the tax issues. The rest of the coverage has been of the dueling-angry-quotes variety, but that can't be helped. The Washington Post condemned Reid for ""smear tactics not unlike those of Joseph McCarthy,"" which makes sense if you think that refusing to release your tax returns is like being unfairly accused of membership in the Communist Party. It's a nice idea, that the majority leader of the United States Senate should operate under some rules of decorum about truth, even if it is only randomly applied. There's a kind of beauty to the Reid and welfare stories, though. They can only be explained or debunked with torturous policy analysis. Bill Clinton's response to the welfare story (he appears in Romney's ad as a sort of beacon of bipartisan hope and change) was a long explanation of how welfare waivers were actually implemented in the 1996 reform. ""In Clinton fashion,"" snarked Politico, ""brevity is not at play."" Readers could skip the snark and read more about the policy. Not bad for a slow, stupid August."

The fretful Tea Party activists sitting in front of me grimace, then nod. A couple of them even tweet. It's Saturday morning at Americans for Prosperity's annual, D.C.-based Defending the American Dream Summit, the largest and most open event that David Koch's political organization holds. The overall frenzy is tamped down from the commotion at the 2011 event. That year's conference was set upon by Occupy protesters, who blocked doors and choked traffic and (accidentally, probably) sent a grandmother hurtling down a small flight of stairs. The Occupiers have packed up the tents. This year's panic will be provided by investment broker, radio host, author, and former U.S. Senate candidate Peter Schiff. He appears on two panels--one ostensibly about regulation, one about health care--and in his calm, measured tone, he pivots both subjects back to the coming economic crash. ""Two-thousand and eight was just an overture,"" he tells the crowd. ""The opera is coming. The real financial crisis is coming in 2013, 2014. And so, we'll get a real choice, a fork in the road. One way is going to lead toward complete authoritarianism, complete totalitarian government, and the other way is going to lead back to freedom."" This crowd takes Schiff seriously, for good reason. In February 2007, when unemployment was low and there was very little financial eschatology in the conversation, Schiff published Crash Proof: How To Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse. He blamed Alan Greenspan's policies for creating ""an inflationary housing bubble to replace the stock market bubble"" and worried that the government had inflated Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae far beyond their natural size. His recommendation: Buy commodities, buy gold, buy stock in mining companies. ""Being patriotic does not mean going down with the sinking ship,"" he wrote. ""It means helping in the rescue effort, and you can't do that if you're drowning yourself."" Very few people took the book seriously until September 2008, when everybody took it seriously. Schiff's theory of collapse was a godsend to economic conservatives, who could explain why government meddling, and not business, caused the crash. The theory was proven by anyone who invested the Schiff way--an ounce of gold, worth $685 when Crash Proof came out, is now worth around $1,600. On Saturday, at the regulation panel, one Tea Partier stands up and asks Schiff the kind of question that validates everything he says. ""Why do we have any regulations at all,"" she says, ""since they just distort the market?"" The panel ends, and I'm supposed to talk to Schiff, but it's clear that the swarming crowd isn't going to let me. For 45 minutes he declines another bid for U.S. Senate--""not this year""--and explains how his Euro Pacific Capital is hauling in profits. ""We have a lot of money in Singapore, a lot of money in Hong Kong,"" he says. ""There are areas of the world that are prospering, that have less government, fewer regulations, and more freedom than we have here. And we can invest in those countries."" They're safer bets than the United States. ""We're either going to default or inflate. Fortunately, the same investment strategy will work under both."" Schiff pushes back our interview until after the health care panel. He uses it to make the rare case against the Affordable Care Act's popular requirement that health insurance companies offer plans to people with pre-existing conditions. ""Under Obamacare, they have to sell me the same policy after I get sick that they would have sold me before I got sick,"" he says. ""That's like being able to buy fire insurance after your house burns down."" That's a wrap, and Schiff offers to give the interview as he packs up his suitcase and checks out of the hotel. We pack into an elevator with four tourists who lack the conspicuous white-and-green conference badges. Schiff susses out the meaning of the Fed's decision not to print more money and shovel it into the economy. ""When Ben Bernanke says we're only going to give the economy more stimulus if it needs it,"" says Schiff, ""it's like telling a heroin addict, 'We'll only give you more heroin if you need it.' The economy is going to need it, because without it, it's going to collapse. But it's not right to give a heroin addict more heroin just because it'll keep him high. It's better to send him to rehab. That's what we need to do, instead of injecting more monetary heroin into the system."" Four very confused tourists exit onto the fourth floor; we continue to Schiff's room on the sixth. His point, which he can make with any number of metaphors, is that it'd be best if policymakers let banks fail, so we could grit our teeth for a while and start over in a stable system. This has been Ron Paul's argument, too, and it's implicit in the populist arguments against the Dodd-Frank consumer protection act or other financial sector regulation. And you don't build majority support for Americans for Prosperity's goals without some gut-appeal populism. Tell people they should be worried about the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and you stoke some confusion. Tell them that it's funded and protected by the profits of the secretive Federal Reserve, and you get apoplexy. The most successful legislation of Paul's recent career, after all, was his bill to audit the Fed. But when these ideas are popular, they get co-opted. In 2010, Schiff ran for the seat vacated by the scandal-plagued co-author of financial reform, Sen. Chris Dodd. ""I thought I had a great story,"" says Schiff. ""There was plenty of video of me predicting the crisis."" But after spending $4 million on the race--$637,000 of it from his checkbook--Schiff got only 23 percent of the Republican primary vote, losing to former World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon, who'd spent $50 million. This year Schiff watched ""the only politician who was right about the crisis,"" Rep. Ron Paul, lose to Mitt Romney in the GOP presidential primary. ""[Romney's] economic plan is more about re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,"" says Schiff with a shrug, packing away his pinstriped suit to change into some plane-ready jeans. ""Romney, I don't believe, understands the severity of the problem. Just like in 2008. He didn't understand. Romney was campaigning on the eve of the financial crisis and he had no idea what was going on."" Schiff clicks on the TV to find the hotel's automated check-out system. AFP has already paid the bill for the room. This is the second Koch-affiliated conference Schiff has spoken at, after a closed-press 2010 conference in Colorado, where Glenn Beck was the main speaker. ""That was the 1 percent, or the 1 percent of the 1 percent,"" he says. ""I met billionaires at that conference. This crowd is the 99 percent. You hear a lot of the same things, though--they're all good people."" We head out of the room so Schiff can catch some of the conference's closing ceremony, a speech by radio host/lawyer/author Mark Levin. Democrats, I tell Schiff, are convinced that they can turn voters against Mitt Romney by campaigning against his investments and his hiring practices, habits that Schiff considers laudable, what he'd recommend to anybody. Democrats ""want to play on people's envy and greed,"" he says. ""Here's a rich guy--he's got money in Switzerland. Oooooh! He doesn't have some patriotic obligation to send money to Washington, so they can waste it. I applaud people for trying to limit their tax bills. Is [Romney] betting against the dollar? Well, it's a smart bet. If I were him I'd say, 'Of course I'm betting against the dollar. I want to change the policy, so I don't have to bet against it.'

That's why I thought Romney had to emerge with a single sentence that would live on after the balloons were in the landfill. You would know what the scientists say about the power of messages, but I wonder if there isn't some benefit still to narrative. What that does is help people puzzle their way back to the essential meaning of a candidacy. The narrative links their views of things to stories they already know. So when Clint Eastwood said ""it's halftime in America"" in that Super Bowl ad, that was a narrative that felt like it worked. Good narratives are sent through single sentences that live on. I feel (key word) like that is still more powerful than a direct appeal that carefully targets women or some other group. But what I really want to know from you are your thoughts on how the Democrats are using this meeting to register, motivate, and massage their ground game. Democrats say they won Colorado in part because of all the work they were able to do in 2008 at the convention. Is there a chance that helps in North Carolina? Because the problem with Democrats is getting them out to vote, and they've got three days to work on that here in a concentrated way? I'm going to weigh in on something else here for a minute: Politico has a story about how all the reporters hate this election. I don't agree and am kinda puzzled by it. The campaigns do feel smaller and cheaper than before. It's not just that the candidates are walled off from genuine inquiry and their strategists are obsessed with slap fights on Twitter. Neither candidate seems very brave. Romney hinted that he might be bold by picking Paul Ryan, but then Ryan just turned into an energetic attack dog and gave up his posture as an ideas guy. The president's campaign has long been founded on simply disqualifying Romney. Both campaigns are mirthless. I sympathize with the desire to throw open a window and freshen up the room a bit. But the thing is: We control the window. This is an interesting campaign! Big issues are at stake. They always are, but this time we've got a chance to talk about how we reorient the relationship between people and their government. The programs of the New Deal need a redo: There will be winners and losers. Who decides which is which? The promises of American life need a big, messy conversation. People are really worried about this country, and our politicians are incapable of dealing with the problems of the day. Given all of this, why would we let the politicians dictate the terms of the campaign? That's what this complaint about this campaign implies: that the politicians are the only actors. We could go off and write stories that have nothing to do with the diminished sideshows the campaigns put on every day. There's plenty of material. Some people are doing those stories, but the obvious problem is that those aren't the stories that get viewers or readers talking or fire their interest. The daily sideshow stories are what people talk about. I've long wanted to put together a list of 10 stories, documentaries, et cetera that every voter has to read before they can claim this campaign is shallow. I'm trying to put a few things on that list, and we'll see if when they run any voters want to bother with them. By the time we get to the campaign it would be possible for the press to reclaim the election by saying, ""Here are the questions that should be answered but aren't being answered. Here are the dodges the campaigns will offer in response to those questions and why they are insufficient."" This is what the debates are presumably going to be about. If the candidates chicken out and don't answer them, then fine. Seems like an insult to the people you're trying to get to vote for you, but insulting the intelligence of the voters seems to be low on the campaigns' worry list this year. But there are ways to ignore the campaign as its being run and cover the story that's actually out there. Strong letter to follow.

No real tension in the party (not like the overplayed Obama/Clinton tension of 2008) and not a lot of great speakers. The Republican convention had the jazzy speakers: Walker, Christie, Rubio, and Ryan. This strategist argued that these speakers are from the Reagan generation. All that comes after belongs to the Democrats but they have a hole in that spot. Interesting theory. On the street art for Obama. It is true that there are people here who are deeply, passionately in love with this president. They are realistic--he hasn't done everything--but given what he's been up against they seem even more adamant about having his back. I am just repeating your point that the street vibe is so much more pro-Obama than it was pro-Romney. It's not the aimless love of 2008, but it's still very strong. (Caveat: I haven't spent time with the journalists who were angling to get into the Obama friends and family pen in Chicago on Election Night; they may still have eyes as wide as saucers.) Heck, I mean even Chuck Norris can't seem to mention the name of the candidate you're supposed to vote for in order to save us from socialism ""or something worse."" There is one great speaker:  Bill Clinton. One of the stories right now is that his speech has not been vetted. This is not just inside baseball; it's inside the atoms as they bounce off one another in the cork at the center of the baseball. It must be said, though, that Bill Clinton's endless speech in 1988 (which may still be going on, for all we know) was a major miscue, so maybe the people who are obsessed with the vetting issue should be. But when I last wrote about the bouncing ball that is Bill, pretty much everyone I talked to said, ""He's a former president of the United States. Some staffer doesn't tell him what to do."" You could imagine that Clinton sees himself as the great rescuing force. Barack Obama once dissed him. He said he was not a transformational figure in the way that Reagan was. Now Obama's relying on Clinton to transform this race. That's the way Clinton no doubt sees it. He's not just trying to save Obama's bacon. He's going to speak for the entire Democratic dream. As you've quite rightly pointed out, there are huge issues at the center of this election (despite the coverage of same). Clinton wants to make the case for those big issues. Can I make a prediction, by the way? I have high hopes for one of the ""real people"" at the convention. The Obama campaign has promised they'll be testifying for the president at every turn. The real people who introduced Obama on the Ohio bus tour I was on a month or so back were pretty compelling. Remember Barney Smith from the 2008 convention? He was a lifelong Republican who said we need a president ""who takes care of Barney Smith, not Smith Barney."" I bet we get another fellow like him. Or maybe we get a reprise of Barney himself. You know where he works now? Chrysler, the auto company that is back on its feet in part because of the auto bailout Obama supported. Smith was asked the question of the day recently: ""Am I better off than I was four years ago? Sure, I'm a lot better off."" If this guy isn't here, someone isn't doing their job.

Bush. Sort of. A video started rolling on the convention stage's web of screens, opening with Bush, in mid-sentence, talking about how proud he'd been when his dad first saw him in the White House. New camera angle, and there he was, George H.W. Bush, carrying the anecdote. ""I was in the bathtub at the White House residence,"" mused the senior Bush, ""and Ramsey, the guy that worked there, came in and said--get outta that bathtub, your son is in the Oval Office!"" ""As I recall,"" said the younger Bush, ""the conversation went something like this. 'Welcome, Mr. President. It's good to see you, Mr. President. And that's all we said.' "" It was a short video, shot by the old Bush friend Mark McKinnon, who copped the Errol Morris style of letting people get personal and stream-of-consciousness without any interviewer prodding them on. The two former presidents' wives appeared on a couch, talking the same way. Everybody praised the Romney family. Senior Bush described junior Bush as ""a good, honest president who got a lot of things done."" And ... scene. The five-minute tribute to Old Guys Hanging Out and Talking was the Republican National Convention's only reference to the last Republican presidency. The name ""George W. Bush"" has not appeared in any convention speeches. Absolutely, there were years between 2000 and 2009, and someone was in charge, but we are never told who. We're just told that it was lousy. The election, said Paul Ryan, will not be fought over ""the economy as Barack Obama inherited it."" The president, said Mike Huckabee, was ""aiming excuses at his predecessor,"" whatever his name was. Republican delegates aren't stupid. Unless they're for Ron Paul, they probably liked Bush. Some of them bought copies of Rebel-in-Chief and prayed for the president's family and worked in GOP offices with pictures of Bush throwing the first pitch at a post-9/11 Yankees game. And hey, Jeb Bush is here, flitting around to various education-themed and corporate-sponsored luncheons, speaking from the stage tonight. But George Bush isn't popular anymore, and hasn't been popular in years. ""It's a pragmatic approach,"" said North Dakota delegate Clare Carlson, shrugging. ""Obviously, his popularity wasn't real high when he left office. He seems to be comfortable with how he did as president, under difficult circumstances."" To be more specific: ""Things went well for his presidency right up until the day when voters gave control of Congress to the Democrats."" You hear this often from the ground-level Republicans, especially the Texas delegates. They worked hard for the guy, and the media smeared him unfairly. In 2007, as his approval ratings fell through floor after floor, Bush said that ""history [was] going to have to judge"" him. That's what everybody here expects. History's just not fair, yet. ""The smart thing to do is focus on here and now and not give President Obama an opportunity to bring up George Bush's presidency,"" said Ari Fleischer, Bush's first spokesman. ""Obviously, I'm sorrowful about it. I'm still who I was."" But the offstage strategy would work. ""You create things that drive the news, and typically people ignore the things that aren't in front of them. If George Bush walked onstage, he'd get a huge ovation. But people aren't going to walk out of here wishing he was onstage."" Maybe not, but it's a strange feeling to pretend that eight years of policymaking never happened. ""It's too bad,"" said former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, who retired in 2006. ""He should be here. We should celebrate with him. That's my feeling. The first two years I was speaker, we paid down about $650 billion of public debt. Then we had 9/11. So I think history will treat him well. We did have an increase in spending, but it was almost all homeland security and national security spending."" But what about the reasons Republicans distanced themselves from Bush? The Tea Party movement, in its infancy, was framed up as a rebellion against both parties. Yes, we screwed up, too. The most effective Tea Party spokespeople corrected for Bush's unpopularity by denouncing Medicare Part D and TARP--one popular program, one mess. The movement--grassroots and donors and groups like the Club for Growth--tomahawked a couple of Republican incumbents, which had the long-term effect of changing everybody's image. That's how Rep. Paul Ryan can say he was ""miserable during the last majority,"" when he was voting for the bills FreedomWorks hated. ""There's no doubt that Mitt Romney and George W. Bush are very different men,"" said Ted Cruz, a former Bush lawyer who's now a Tea Party-branded Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Texas. ""I think George W. Bush has made a decision to retire from public life, and not to intrude. President Obama, unfortunately, has tried to blame everything under the sun on former President Bush, and I think that people aren't buying it."" Polling contradicts that. More people blame Bush for the recession--still, after three years--than Obama. And that's why the Bush name will make its first non-canned-video appearance at the start of Jeb's speech. He has to defend his brother, he told Fox News. ""That's kind of my role in life now."" Read the rest of Slate's coverage from the GOP convention."	Why Won't the Republican Party Talk About George W.

Ryan's speech was also notable for its aggressive, combative tone (As John Dickerson observes, the veep nominee has so far neglected his role as the ticket's ""idea man"" in order to play the attack dog). Unsurprisingly, the second Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll--posted at the end of the address and closed at 9:30 Thursday morning--reveals an electorate torn between approval for Ryan's steeliness and dislike for his pitt-bull style. We asked registered voters across the country: ""Did Representative Paul Ryan's speech make you more likely or unlikely to vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the upcoming election?"" (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Overall, answers confirmed an election in stalemate, as around 53 percent of survey takers reported that they felt moved neither one way nor the other. But Ryan's broadsides uncorked passionate feelings in viewers, too: Almost 24 percent said they were ""much more unlikely"" to vote Republican after watching the nominee talk, while 14 percent declared themselves ""much more likely."" Paul Ryan's words Wednesday night did not help Mitt Romney's problems with the fairer sex. Men responded more warmly than women did to Ryan's bare-knuckled show of strength. About 17 percent of male survey-takers claimed they were ""much more likely"" to cast a ballot for Romney and Ryan after hearing Ryan fume about shuttered factories and lapsed leadership. Only 10.6 percent of women said the same. Not surprisingly, Ryan's divisive approach has led to a splintered result. On Thursday night, we will find out how Mitt will build on the words that went before him. Will he try to deal the final blow or will he to take the stage in a calmer, more affable style? After Ryan's performance, there may be no more need for this team to show its teeth."	Does America Like Paul Ryan's Pitt-Bull Routine?	['Paul', 'Romney']	[]

TAMPA - Sen. Rand Paul was trapped in a corner. It'd been like this all afternoon. He'd been walking the floor of the Tampa Bay Times Forum, hounded by reporters, having the same conversation with every delegate loyal to his father's campaign as bulky cameras nosed in. They were diehards, angry that a quick vote on the Republican National Convention platform had affirmed a rule that blocked some of their fellow delegates. David Jaques, an Oregon ""Ron Paul follower for 20-plus years"" told the senator that he still wanted to put the candidate's name into nomination. The senator kept telling him not to. ""It does break my heart,"" he said. ""But we fight on. We won't stop. We've just got to follow the rules."" ""We tried to play by the rules in Oregon,"" said Jaques, ""and they just threw 'em out the window."" Sen. Paul reasoned with him. ""Realize, as I go about this room, hundreds of people have come up to me,"" he said. ""There is support out here. We're not gonna win this time. Maybe next time. Maybe the time after. The party can only grow bigger, and there's only so many places they can win without us."" Right then a short, white-bearded man marched past Sen. Paul, over to his chief of staff, Doug Stafford. It was Ben Ginsberg--veteran of the Bush-Gore recounts, top legal macher for Mitt Romney, ""the lawyer for the Republican establishment,"" author of a new Republican National Committee rule that would bind delegates more closely to winning candidates. Ginsburg, carrying a sheaf of papers, leaned in and buttonholed Stafford. ""I've got your guys trying to put Paul's name into nomination,"" he said, pointing at the papers. ""Right here, buddy."" Ginsberg, having delivered the message, kept on walking. Stafford didn't know what to say. ""He was yelling so much that I couldn't hear him,"" he explained. But Ginsberg had nothing to worry about. There would be no nominating Ron Paul from the floor. John Sununu--who had just gotten the new rules pushed through the committee--nominated Mitt Romney for president. Nobody nominated Ron Paul. After each state announced its delegate totals, only Romney's totals were repeated and put on the convention's mega-screens. The Paul fans, with a combination of irritation and acceptance, would try and amend that by--what else?--yelling. It went like this: State: Missouri casts four votes for Ron Paul, and 45 votes for the next president of the United States, Mitt Romney! Chair: Missouri: 45, Romney! Whole bunch of people: And four for Ron Paul! What else were they going to do? Ron Paul's 202-delegate haul was a footnote to the 2012 convention, a riveting distraction that few voters actually watched. ""Probably CNN will find a way [to cover it],"" snarked Haley Barbour, speaking for just about every non-Paulian Republican. It was fantastic television and even better blog fodder--give 'em enough cameras and a hundred or so people can cause ""mayhem,"" even if nobody actually gets hurt. But the rules that most outraged the Paul delegates will outlast Paul. In the Michael Steele era, when Republicans busily reverse-engineered the techniques Barack Obama used to beat them, the party changed primary and delegate rules to make them more competitive. If a state held a primary before April 1, it couldn't set up ""winner-take-all"" rules without punishment--losing half of its delegates. That rule was scrapped. Many states left it up to conventions and caucuses to choose the ""unpledged"" members of the delegation. That was changed, too. In 2016 (if that's the next open Republican primary), if, say, Artur Davis wins Iowa and the nomination, it would no longer be possible for some other candidate's supporters to take over a convention and choose non-Davis delegates. The meeting that altered these rules was swift, crowded, and brutal. After Sununu gaveled it in, a group of Paul delegates from Nevada gathered in a circle, hugging, and comforting the ones who'd started to cry. ""Tyranny wins again,"" muttered a Nevada alternate delegate, Marla Criss. Morton Blackwell, the Virginia delegate who'd teamed up with the Paul faction, left the meeting shortly after Sununu did. When Sununu saw his defeated rival, he offered him a handshake: ""Well fought."" The people who wanted longer primaries and meaningful state conventions had clearly lost. And most of these people, in 2012, were supporters of Ron Paul. When news of the rule changes got to them on the convention floor, they stewed and predicted the death of local politics. ""It's the end of the grassroots,"" sighed Jim Ayala, a Nevada delegate for Paul, who wore his Oath Keepers T-shirt to the floor. ""It's going to ruin the Republican Party."" Ayala had been part of a pro-Paul faction that dominated the 2008 Nevada conventions before the old rules helped take their delegates away. ""I've been waiting to get here for five years, and I don't know if anyone like me will get here again."" This panic hasn't spread. Matt Kibbe, the president of the Tea Party group FreedomWorks, was annoyed by the rule changes, and the GOP's fear of ""beautiful chaos."" But he wasn't worried. ""The Utah convention process was designed to protect incumbents,"" said Kibbe. ""And yet [Sen.] Mike Lee won there, and [anti-Tea Party quote machine and former Sen.] Bob Bennett lost."" The people who wanted to stop coronations would learn the new rules. ""Mitt Romney will be the last Republican nominee chosen by the insiders."" And it's no fun to be the last hold-out as the Insiders' candidate gets crowned. The last, fitful exertions by Paul's delegates were handled like the blatherings of senile uncles at Thanksgiving. When one Romney delegate saw a ""Ron Paul R3VOLUTION"" sign go up in the Nevada delegation, he squeezed next to the culprit and held up a MITT sign. One of Paul's Texas delegates, Sung Song, tried to wave a Ron Paul flag during his state's roll call. A Romney volunteer in a khaki suit hustled over to stop him. ""That's not an approved sign,"" said the enforcer. Song folded up the sign inside one of the Romney placards, and put them both down. A fellow delegate walked over to commiserate. ""Oh, okay"" he said. ""Now they care about the rules?"""	How the GOP's New Rules Are Intended To Stop the Next Ron Paul	['Haley', 'Paul', 'Romney', 'Obama']	[]

The spin machines are a-whir in the wake of Tuesday's speeches at the Republican National Convention. Did Ann Romney succeed in making women across the country fall in love with her husband? Was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie secretly testing the waters for a presidential run? We're as interested in romance and long-term campaign strategy as the next person, but what we really want to know is: Did Ann Romney or Chris Christie affect the way Americans will vote in November? We teamed up with SurveyMonkey once more to conduct an overnight survey of registered voters throughout the nation. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) The questions were posted right at the end of each speech, and responses were gathered up until 9:30 a.m. sharp on Wednesday. Here's how the snapshots developed. The query ""Did Ann Romney's speech make you more likely or unlikely to vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the upcoming election?"" elicited the poll equivalent of a blank stare. Almost 64 percent of respondents reported that Ann Romney had failed to sway them in either direction. While roughly 17 percent felt that the speech nudged them toward voting Romney-Ryan, a comparable 19 percent were repelled from the GOP ticket. Next, we asked, ""Did Governor Chris Christie's Keynote Speech make you more likely or unlikely to vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the upcoming election?"" Again, survey takers seemed to be on autopilot. Sixty-three percent revealed that Christie's fiery disclosure of ""hard truths"" didn't affect the way they'd cast their ballots one way or the other, and 17 percent resolved anew to vote for Romney after hearing the speech. About 20 percent said that the address made them less likely to vote for Romney. These numbers indicate that, while media pundits may have drawn strong conclusions about Ann Romney and Chris Christie's performances Tuesday night, the electorate had a far more muted response. Neither speaker was really able to move the needle (or shake up the Etch A Sketch) in terms of projected voting behavior. Now it's up to the men on the ticket to win voters to their side Wednesday and Thursday nights."	Were American Voters Won Over by Ann Romney and Chris Christie last night?

The University of South Florida Sun Dome, which seats 10,411, is full-up in the second and third decks. The bottom deck isn't full. Easily more than 100 seats, in clean view of TV cameras, are empty, even when the noon start time arrives. Those seats were supposed to be for Republican National Committee delegates. There were supposed to be more of them. ""We welcome you, delegates!"" says our MC, presidential family historian and Paul diehard Doug Wead. Alas, ""some are so traumatized that they aren't even coming here."" They'd been ""locked out, lied to, told that the 'nays' have it when we can all see on YouTube that the 'ayes' have it."" Everybody boos; everybody knows. The big boys down the road, at the convention center, need to be shamed and exposed and shamed some more. Ron Paul supporters are not immune to paranoia, and in rooms all over Tampa, they are trading rumors about the ways their movement is being screwed. Did you hear that they kicked out all our delegates? The RNC sent out a message that this rally was cancelled. And so on. They're right to be confused. This stuff is confusing. Paul's third, and probably final (he's 77), presidential bid ended with zero primary or preference poll wins. Thanks to proportional representation, he managed to grab a bunch of delegates in places like Rhode Island and Vermont and Virginia. Then Paul's movement seriously knuckled down. Throughout the spring and summer of 2012, Paul supporters swarmed state Republican conventions and precinct-county-district-state caucuses, scooping up delegates that lazy media counts had assigned to the ""winners"" of the preference-poll states. Iowa. Minnesota. Colorado. Maine. They needed pluralities in five state delegations in order to nominate Ron Paul from the convention floor on the first ballot. They failed. Other presidential campaigns have gotten much further, then folded. But Paul's people kept up hope. Maybe they could influence the Republican platform. Maybe they could scoop up uncommitted delegates and nominate Paul anyway. Maybe they could force the convention to a third ballot--which would free up delegates to look into their souls and vote for Dr. No. This hope is alive in Tampa, exacerbated by blurts and shouts and tweets of new proof that the Paul delegates are getting screwed. The Paul movement has largely gathered in two large rallies, a few thousand people at each--""We Are the Future"" at the Sun Dome, the P.A.U.L. Festival at the Florida Fairgrounds. (People Awakening and Uniting for Liberty, if you were wondering.) Paul would only speak at the first rally, a tightly controlled five-hour lectures-and-music session. The second, a three-day freedom-palooza, let in everybody--Scientologists, the John Birch Society, authors of self-published books about the healing powers of oregano, and the Libertarian Party. (Paul's not speaking at the Republican National Convention itself. He declined to ""fully endorse"" Mitt Romney.) The common theme: Ron Paul could still win, if these bastards didn't keep taking delegates away. A group of Maine delegates walked around PAUL Fest in matching baseball caps, explaining how the state party had taken half their votes away in a series of arguments before the larger, pro-Romney Republican National Committee. It was so rotten, such obvious cheating, that Maine's Republican governor was refusing to come to Tampa. ""The rationale is that there was 'lax security' at the convention,"" said Ashley Ryan, 21, a Paul supporter who's become the nation's youngest RNC member. (Each state has two of them.) ""Here's the funny thing about that. The people in charge of security at the convention were on the state committee. My own mother checked me for ID at the convention, which should tell you something about how 'lax' it was."" This is what outsiders don't understand: Oodles of Paul supporters believe that the delegate switch-ups literally cost them a chance at the nomination. James DiPasquale, a Florida activist who watched some friends try and fail to become delegates, argues that Paul could win if the contest stretched on for a few ballots. (There has been no multi-ballot convention for decades.) ""If every delegate was allowed to vote his conscience,"" he asks, ""how many of them really would want to vote for Romney? It would be a landslide for Ron Paul."" To emphasize the point, he walks around with a life-size stand-up poster of Ronald Reagan, to which he's attached a quote from the Republican demigod, praising Paul. And then there are Paul fans who want to move on. There are legitimate reasons. Paul won only 10 percent of the GOP primary vote, after all, and around 10 percent of the delegates if you round up. The Libertarian Party's investment in PAUL fest comes with speeches from their presidential ticket, former Gov. Gary Johnson and former Judge Jim Gray. On Saturday afternoon, I see his most famous Republican backer, the legendary Nixon fixer Roger Stone, dressed in a purple polo shirt, explaining how the GOP might alienate Paul fans by taking the delegates away. ""I can't imagine why any voter would vote for Mitt Romney!"" Eventually, surely, that's got to help out his guy Johnson. Right? Doesn't it? I join Gray and walk past the booths to the vast concrete hangar where Johnson's going to speak. ""Some of these supporters are avid,"" he says, half-admiringly, half-frustrated, ""and they're holding out hope that Paul will be the Republican nominee."" He settles in backstage; I stand behind two men wearing ""Ron Paul or Bust"" T-shirts. Johnson's strategy for winning over the crowd: solidarity with the angry delegates. ""This is an exclusionary process, and each and every one of you know it,"" he says. ""You've had sand kicked in your face again and again!"" That gets huge cheers. They are less huge when Johnson says he's the ""only other candidate"" on the ballot with Romney and Obama, and that he's been given a rare chance to carry the torch of liberty. A blond woman in a sundress right next to me is overcome. She wants to scream. And then she does. ""Give it to Paul!"" On Sunday, at the official Paul party, I'm reminded of all the reasons it's hard to imagine Paul's people backing someone else. They've come to adore the guy. They cheer at video clips of Paul quoting Friedrich von Hayek to Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. They tote copies of the Ron Paul family cookbook, an old promo brochure from the trail. The speakers--chosen by Paul--pay tribute to their friend as if he's being buried with the Oscar and six gold medals he just won. ""He's the one congressman who can actually be described as 'the honorable,' "" says the old Paul aide Lew Rockwell, chairman of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, proprietor of LewRockwell.com They had to cancel it. If they held it, only the Ron Paul people would show up. ""He is our Gandhi,"" says Wead. ""He is untouched."" ""When he calls it's like Mises calling me,"" says Walter Block, an economist at that think tank. ""It's like God calling me."" God arrives onstage shortly before 5 p.m. He's a little modest, giving the movement the credit, denying it to himself. ""One paper in Washington had a headline, 'The Revolution Will Not Be Happening,' "" he says. ""Don't they wish!"" But actually, what the Washington Post had claimed was that ""The Ron Paul Revolution Will Not Be Happening."" He politely redacted his own name. He seems to be moving on, past the whole idea of getting the Republican nomination. Almost. ""Ultimately, numbers do count,"" says Paul. ""And numbers do count even when they don't count all the votes as well. Because we do have the numbers!"""	Will Ron Paul's Supporters Ever Give Up?	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Nixon']	['god']

Biographical sketches cite the event as a formative early trauma that helped turn Ryan into a ""man in a hurry."" With the Republican National Convention days away, we will soon hear Ryan's origin story--and the role his father's death played in it--repeated and echoed many more times. The strange thing, though, is that Paul Ryan is hardly alone--American politics is overflowing with stories of absent fathers, alcoholic fathers, neglectful fathers, and untimely deceased ones. Indeed, one of the more interesting questions raised by Ryan's biography is: Why do so many of our politicians have daddy issues? The list is surprisingly long. Take Ronald Reagan, who was haunted by a moment when he discovered his alcoholic father on the front porch ""drunk, dead to the world,"" his hair filled with snow. The 11-year-old Reagan had to drag him indoors. Or Bill Clinton, whose biological father drowned in a car crash, and who remembered standing up to his alcoholic stepfather and demanding that he never beat Clinton's mother again. Gerald Ford's father, an alcoholic, was found guilty of extreme cruelty to his family, and refused to pay child support when Ford's mother left him. George W. Bush's relationship with his father was less lurid, but infamously resentful: He spent his entire life, including his presidency, careening between attempts to live up to H.W.'s impossible expectations and efforts to garishly repudiate them. And it hardly bears recounting that President Obama built his political persona around a search for his absent dad. This isn't just cherry-picking either. It's a representative window into the emotional makeup of our political class. While there are few academic studies on the subject of political daddy issues, the ones that do exist suggest an outsized percentage of prominent politicians have absent or dysfunctional fathers. The most methodologically credible of these is actually a British study called The Fiery Chariot: A Study of British Prime Ministers and the Search for Love, which found that, in the words of a peer reviewer, ""the rate of bereavement amongst prime ministers was exceptionally high,"" somewhere around half of all British prime ministers. That was much higher than the estimated rate for the population as a whole, and the bereavement rates for Cabinet members also ran consistently higher than the general public. What could be going on here? Is this simply politics imitating Shakespeare, or is there some causal reason that so many people with father issues make it to the upper reaches of public office? One possibility is that kids who are immersed in traumatic personal environments early in life become hypersensitive to the feelings of those around them and develop coping mechanisms that also make them better politicians. Quoting psychology literature, the best biography of Reagan notes that children of alcoholics become perceptive enough that they can ""walk into a room, and without even consciously realizing it, figure out just what the level of tension is, who is fighting with whom, and whether it is safe or dangerous."" The same instinct may have fed Reagan's desire to comfort the nation on the model of FDR's fireside chats. Bush on the Couch, a psychoanalysis of the 43rd president, traces George W.'s folksy jester behavior to the period right after his sister Robin died, when he felt it was his responsibility to keep his family cheerful. Another explanation may be that dysfunctional fatherhood forces children to take on an early leadership role. Bill Clinton was characteristically explicit about this dynamic, musing that in the process of standing up to Roger Clinton, their roles seemed to reverse and ""I was the father."" David Maraniss' biography of Clinton notes that the children of alcoholics often assume a role known as the ""Family Hero,"" who takes on adult responsibilities and becomes ""a vessel of ambition and the repository of hope"" for the family by excelling in the outside world. Moreover, one academic study suggests, ""a boy whose father has died forms a grandiose idea of him; and, he calls strongly upon himself to replace the parent who has been thus idealized."" President Obama openly discusses this type of motivation in Dreams From My Father; and Obama on the Couch, the sequel to the Bush psychoanalysis, ascribes Obama's academic drive to a feeling that he was a vessel for his father's wasted potential and his mother's hopes and ambitions. Of course, there is the hunger for attention and the gaping psychological need to be loved. It's often been observed that electoral politics is so demanding and unpleasant that no normal person would endure the indignities required to become a successful politician. In that sense, anyone who is willing to fundraise, glad-hand, and defend their smallest gaffes for months must derive some additional psychological benefit from politicking. Many of the people willing to keep going must be, in some sense, broken inside and driven to salve their emotional pain by courting the adulation of voters. In any case, the phenomenon is real, and it can most likely be explained by a combination of all three of these hypotheses. So what does all this tell us about Paul Ryan? According to Justin A. Frank, the psychiatrist who wrote the Bush and Obama on the Couch books, the death seems to have prodded Ryan to become more determined, self-reliant, and industrious. ""When there's a sudden death like that, [children] can become extremely, very responsible. They step up to the plate,"" says Frank.* According to Frank, Ryan also exhibits an ""anti-gratitude"" that is very common in some of these children, especially Republicans. ""The anti-gratitude has to do with an unconscious hatred of the part of the self that needs other people,"" says Frank. ""Somehow you degrade unconsciously the part of you that needs help, and then you project that onto other people and say they don't need help."" While Ryan benefited from his large family and government support, Frank says Ryan's reaction recalls George W. Bush's feeling that nobody helped him get through the death of his sister. More concretely, this analysis suggests that Ryan's experience mirrors that of a great many other politicians. His story is moving, but similar tales can be found throughout Congress, the executive branch, and the history books. And it's worth noting that, compared with the violent traumas experienced by many of our presidents, the death of Ryan's father was relatively peaceful, and probably left fewer psychological scars than the toxic childhoods of Clinton or Ford. Indeed, Ryan's daddy issues seem to play a comparatively smaller role in his biography than those of many presidents. Given the destructive power with which some of those psychodramas may have played out in the White House, that is probably a good thing.

When a candidate has a particularly good day--a killer debate, a speech that goes off with no falling lights or flags--journalists get a missive from the campaign that runs through the bedazzled takes of your peers. The subtext is this: Why haven't you written your story about how fantastic we're doing? On Saturday, shortly after Rep. Paul Ryan spoke at The Villages in Florida, the Romney campaign sent out no fewer than 14 incredible headlines. ""Nothing but Cheers for Paul Ryan's Medicare Plan at The Villages,"" reported the Tampa Bay Times. (The planned community, where souped-up golf carts dominate the roads, is a Republican stronghold.) ""Ryan Campaigns With Mother, Vows To Protect Medicare for Seniors,"" reported the Hill. And so on. The point of all this: proving that the first ""Medi-scare"" battle of the election is ending and that Republicans have fought it to a draw. Ryan got his message down to a zinger, and repeated it all week. ""We want this debate,"" he said. ""We need this debate. And we will win this debate."" It just depends what the meaning of this is. To keep on winning the Medicare debate, Ryan needs to please three groups of people. They are: conservative voters who are fine with any Medicare scale-back, conservatives who are fine with any Medicare reforms that don't affect them, and swing voters who aren't sure what they want. The campaign has moved on now, and our cable chyrons and Web leads have been given over to Todd Akin. Look back at Week 1, though, and Ryan's done a stellar job pleasing all parties. What do we know about the anti-Medicare conservatives? They are not numerous, but they exist. On Friday, right before Ryan flew to Florida, I saw him speak for 20 minutes in Springfield, Va. Before he got there--actually, before a road show that included black Democrat turned Republican Artur Davis and unsuccessful Obamacare-slayer Ken Cuccinelli--I polled Ryan fans on what they wanted to happen with Medicare. The ""just end it already"" crowd skewed young and talked plain. ""I don't want to give money to the government that I'm not going to get back,"" said Grace Kennedy, a 14-year-old student who'd swung by the rally with her mother. ""I don't want to be paying for Social Security when I get a job. I'm going to be saving money. And I'm sorry, but if there are people who aren't thinking about that, it's their fault."" More numerous: the ""Medicare for me, then no more"" types. They were older. King Dietrich, 54, is just old enough to make it into the new ""premium support"" program if Romney-Ryan won and implemented the budget chairman's plan. ""If I understand the Ryan plan correctly,"" he said, ""I'll have an option by the time I get there, whether I want traditional Medicare or whether I want a voucher."" Pat Tilleny, who would only say politely that she was in her 60s, was confident that Romney and Ryan wouldn't really end the Medicare program. One reason, she said, was that ""Ann Romney has MS."" Clearly, the GOP ticket was going to look out for people. And after that, what would Romney and Ryan do to Medicare? They'd keep it for the people who paid into it. Dietrich called the Obama administration's promise to find $716-odd billion in Medicare payment reductions a ""scam,"" moving money from a program that worked into Obamacare, which could never work. ""I don't want to pay for anyone else's health care,"" he said. ""I don't want to pay for your health care. No offense--I don't know you! What I'm saying is that I don't want to pay for sex changes for anybody. I don't want to pay for somebody's cosmetic surgery."" When Dietrich said that, I heard an echo of an old Tea Party argument from 2010. It was a seven-word slogan that made liberals guffaw: ""Get your government hands off my Medicare."" As my old colleague Tim Noah pointed out, this was a newly popular version of an old, odd myth--that Medicare wasn't really a government program. Government programs were unsatisfying and ineffective. Medicare worked. Surely, it was better than a government program. Ryan brought back that argument and fed it Miracle-Gro. In both Florida and Springfield, Ryan claimed that Obama, and only Obama, was cutting the program that seniors loved. ""The president raids $716 billion from the Medicare program to pay for the Obamacare program,"" he said in The Villages. ""Medicare should not be used as a piggy bank for Obamacare. Medicare should be used to be the promise that it made to our current seniors."" He repeated the killer verb, raid, one more time in the speech. You hear that word plenty when Ryan discusses programs that ""current seniors""--that's another clip-and-save phrase--use and adore. In the past, when Ryan has talked about allowing Social Security to be privatized, he's said the move would ""put an end to the raid of the Social Security trust fund."" To keep those current seniors happy, Ryan needs to assure them that they're pulling the ladder up behind them. He was fairly clear about that in the Villages Medicare speech. ""To save it for this generation,"" Ryan said, ""you have to reform it for my generation so it doesn't go bankrupt when we retire."" It's solid campaign patter. Ryan alternates between the specific, like when the plans would switch over, and the vague. He'll keep ""the promise"" of Medicare, which is different than keeping Medicare as it is. He'll keep a ""guarantee"" of coverage, which is different than keeping it a full-coverage entitlement. I don't see anyone who's already inclined to vote Republican having a problem with this. And those swing voters? They've got to be reading the pretty headlines."	How To Decode Paul Ryan's Medicare Message	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Hill', 'Obama']	[]
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/08/elizabeth_warren_vs_scott_brown_massachusetts_senate_race_on_the_road_.html	"QUINCY, Mass.--Elizabeth Warren is in the right place, next to the hole in the highway. She exits an SUV and chats excitedly, one by one, with the construction workers and ironworkers who'd been waiting there for the photo op. It's Aug. 14, and the foreman explains what's being dug: a new road underneath the highway, one that will unchoke the traffic that flows down I-93 from Boston, a project monitored from the foreman's trailer. ""How do you get any work done?"" says Warren. ""I'd just want to watch this all day!"" Warren tells the workers that she'd been watching the highway project since she ""saw the model laid out"" in a Quincy municipal building. ""Quite frankly,"" says Quincy Mayor Thomas Koch, ""none of the project would be possible without the help of the stimulus."" A dozen reporters stand, digital recorders extended, to capture a conversation about public-private spending that has the rhythm, wordiness, and can-you-believe-this giddiness of the late-night infomercial for juice machines that comes on after you pass out during Real Housewives of Atlanta. Warren is thrilled, just thrilled. ""The program I've put together,"" she tells Koch, ""is more effective in reducing the deficit than Scott Brown's program of not focusing on investments and infrastructure. It's really about priorities."" For a few months--they seemed like years--the race for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts was completely disconnected from the economy. In April, the conservative Boston Herald scooped that Harvard University, where Warren taught law, once listed her as a ""minority"" faculty member. Reporters became amateur genealogists, seeking out records that could validate Warren's claim to be a 1/32nd member of the Cherokee Nation. The Herald's headline department cranked out classics like ""Arrows May Fell Warren in Fall"" and "" 'Pow Wow' Factor."" Republicans wanted the swing voter to see Warren as an entitled, elitist carpetbagger. This story should've done it. But it didn't. When the Cherokee story wound down, Warren remained tied in the polls with Brown. A Suffolk University survey found most voters believing Warren's version of the story and even more voters unable to give a damn about it. Democrats picked Warren to give a prime-time speech at the national convention. Then came Mitt Romney's pick of Paul Ryan. The unexpectedly silly Senate race is all of a sudden about stimulus spending and Medicare and taxes. You could tell just by watching Scott Brown. On Aug.13, the incumbent's only public event was a charity basketball game in Springfield for a mentoring program called A Path to Manhood. On the front of the $10 ticket: A photo of Brown spinning a basketball on his thumb as preteens gaze at his awesomeness. On the court, it was even better for Brown. The other politicos on the charity teams swapped out frequently and struggled to get to the net. Rep. Richard Neal--a Democrat, like everyone not named Brown in the Massachusetts delegation--made an early run at the basket, threw a brick, and quickly found his way to the bench. ""Basketball!"" laughed the announcer when another politician stumbled over the ball. ""It's basketball!"" Brown stayed on the court for all but two minutes of the game. He was constantly in motion and got fouled four times--more than all of the other players combined. He missed one foul shot and let out a gut-deep ""AAGGGNNH-AGGH!"" Moments later, when he sank a three-pointer, he ran past the bleachers (and attending photographers), grinning widely and holding up three fingers. As a photo-op, it was perfect. As a press event, it was tougher to control. Local reporters insisted on asking Brown about the Ryan choice, which put him in a spot, because he opposed Ryan's budget when it got to the Senate. ""I think the corporate tax rate needs to be cut, but I don't know if 25 percent is the number,"" Brown told reporters. ""While we don't agree [with Ryan] on everything, I certainly appreciate his efforts to bring budgetary issues to the forefront."" Brown's just-a-regular-dude appeal is one of his biggest assets. It sets off audible rage alarms whenever you mention it to a Democrat. On Tuesday, when Warren is asked whether Brown's ultra-physical events put her at a disadvantage, she theorizes that for Brown, ""the point is to be out and visible in a way where he doesn't have to talk about the issues or take any questions.""State Democratic Party Chairman John Walsh, in an interview at his office, made sneering references to Brown's image, accusing him of ""hanging up the barn coat and putting on a nice tuxedo"" when he got to Washington. There's a trauma behind the gripe. Democrats underestimated Brown in 2010. Attorney General Martha Coakley, groomed for higher office, sleepwalked through the election until she panicked and tried, too late, to get the state's Democratic machines humming, after Brown had already worked the state in his photo-op friendly pickup truck. ""The truth of the matter is, we screwed that up,"" Walsh said. ""I take responsibility for it. We took the race for granted. I could try and justify it. Scott Brown was sort of a no-account state legislator. Been there for a dozen years, he never passed any legislation. But that's a terrible excuse for doing something you should never do, and that's take the race for granted."" And they lost Ted Kennedy's seat. Warren never gives the impression that she's coasting. On Tuesday, before she got to Quincy, she campaigned at a bar and grill in Dorchester, giving out the kind of hugs you typically see when a mom sees her kid come off the plane after a long semester. She learned that a tot is five years old and offered her a high-five. Waiting in the main dining room were activists who'd been backing Warren for months. ""I'm probably the only person who can say I've had Courtney Love and Elizabeth Warren in my house,"" said Joyce Linehan. (She used to work for Sub Pop records.) ""I'm an Irish-American working-class woman, born in this neighborhood, and I couldn't identify with Brown if he was the last man on earth."" Warren's speech in Dorchester was short, all contrast-building with the Ryan plan. ""I'll tell you,"" she said, ""I never thought I would run for office, but when there's a vision like that--and it's put forward as the serious vision of the Republican party--then it's time for all of us to get involved in this race."" As Warren heads to Quincy, Brown attempts to take back the advantage on taxes. His speech to the South Shore Chamber of Commerce is billed as a ""major policy address"" on taxes. It becomes, basically, a campaign speech accusing Warren of supporting ""the largest tax increase since World War II"" (a scary-sounding way to describe the plan that Barack Obama ran on in 2008), and deriding her for not voluntarily paying higher taxes. He takes no questions, but he has turned the story of the day into a ""spat."" In Quincy, Warren pauses during the construction-site visit to answer a press corps that wants her rebuttal to Brown. ""He called you a job destroyer,"" says one reporter. ""I'm sorry--job destroyer?"" says Warren. ""We were just talking about how many jobs were created by investments in infrastructure."" ""They said they tallied up all the tax increases you support,"" notes another reporter, ""and they say they came up with $3.4 trillion over the past decade. They have a list that they've been emailing out."" Warren responds with an amused Are you kidding gasp. ""This is just a made-up number,"" she says. ""You say that, but they say they have this list."" ""Well, show me the list. Do we have to go through this? This is a made-up number. The interesting question is why, right now. I think Scott Brown is very worried about this race. And the reason he's worried is that when Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running mate, the economic issues clicked into place."" But if the Cherokee-and-trucks stage of the campaign is over, does that mean Warren is winning it? That's what the pre-emptive attacks on Warren's DNC speech were about--portraying her as a spiteful enemy of business, whose YouTube'd speech about what business owners owe to government inspired the damaging Barack Obama riff on the same subject. ""Do you have any second thoughts about your famous YouTube video?"" a reporter asks. ""They go back to that again and again."" ""No,"" says Warren. She lets the comment hang in midair. ""Why not?"" ""Because I told the truth. And I'll tell it again."" Out of nowhere, a construction worker slips into the press scrum to introduce his friends. It feels like Warren is getting bailed out. She was surviving all those tax questions, sure, but nothing makes her point like an ironworker with a thick Quincy accent telling her that he had to work on New York's Freedom Tower because there wasn't enough public spending in Massachusetts. ""I was out for over a year,"" says Jim Lyons. ""Out for over a year?"" asks Warren. ""I want to hear that again. I want to make sure everybody heard that."""

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/08/twitter_and_other_social_media_will_make_the_next_close_presidential_election_much_worse_than_florida_in_2000_.html	"This article is excerpted from Richard L. Hasen's book, The Voting Wars: From Florida 2000 to the Next Election Meltdown. The tweets were full of rage. As officials began to tally the results of the tight ballots, many voters suspected fraud. After all, there had been allegations of election misconduct before, as well as lost-and-found votes. Trust in government officials didn't run high. By late in the evening, one opposition party leader came forward, accusing a local election official of ""tampering with the results."" Fears of a political backlash rose. Soon there were even suggestions of violence. The scene wasn't the site of some Arab Spring-inspired revolution. It was Wisconsin in August 2011. Wisconsin residents had just voted on whether to recall a number of state senators, with the potential to flip the legislative body from Republican to Democratic hands. The vote totals were rolling in from polling places across the state, and I was following the reaction of hundreds of political junkies tweeting about the results using the hashtag #wirecall. That evening provides a window into what the world could look like should we be unlucky enough to have our next presidential election as close as the 2000 presidential election. Wisconsin could be our future, and it's not a pretty picture. In 2000, just a few hundred votes out of millions cast in the state of Florida separated Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush from his Democratic opponent, Al Gore. The outcome of the election rested on Florida's 25 electoral votes, and legal wrangling continued for 36 days. Then, abruptly, one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions in U.S. history, Bush v. Gore, cut short the battle. But partisans learned that it is worth fighting tooth-and-nail over election rules. Since the Florida debacle, we have witnessed an ideologically fueled war over election rules. Election litigation has skyrocketed, and election time brings out inevitable accusations of voter fraud and voter suppression. These allegations have shaken public confidence, as campaigns deploy ""armies of lawyers"" and the partisan press revs up when elections are close and the stakes are high. Wisconsin shows us that social media is bound to make things much, much worse than they were in 2000. By 2010, Wisconsin's politics had already become among the most polarized in the nation. The election of Republican Scott Walker as governor and some of his early legislative initiatives--in particular, a new law curtailing the power of public sector labor unions--had contributed to the ideological rancor. After Walker's victory but before the Senate recall elections, Wisconsin voters voted in an expensive and ugly state Supreme Court race that would determine the ideological balance of the court. The court at the time was mired in a partisan spat unconnected to Walker. Someone had leaked an internal court email from a few years earlier in which incumbent Republican Justice David Prosser called Wisconsin Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, a well-respected Democratic jurist, ""a total bitch,"" a claim that repeated again and again in anti-Prosser television ads. On April 6, 2011, the lead between Prosser and his Democratic opponent Joanne Kloppenburg seesawed all night as returns rolled in. In the middle of the night, when it appeared that all the returns were in aside from some uncounted absentee and questioned ballots, Kloppenburg had eked out a come-from-behind lead of about 200 votes. The Wall Street Journal's John Fund led a parade of conservative bloggers and Twitter users charging that voter fraud was responsible for Kloppenburg's late surge. But then the waters got murky. The next morning, Kathy Nickolaus, a Republican election official from Waukesha County who used to work for Prosser in the state legislature, announced that she had been storing her county's election results on her personal laptop computer, and when she reported votes on election night she had inadvertently failed to include 14,315 votes from the city of Brookfield. With those votes included, Prosser jumped to a 7,300-vote lead statewide. Fund and Republicans quickly dropped their cries of voter fraud, but Democrats and their allies immediately suggested chicanery by Nickolaus, who had previously been chastised for lax security with her ballots. The influential liberal blog ""Think Progress"" said that ""critics"" suggested the result must be from foul play or incompetence. The URL for the blog post was a little more blunt. It read in part: ""kathy-nickolaus-crook-or-idiot."" Ramona Kitzinger, the Democrat on the Waukesha elections board, at first vouched for Nickolaus, but the next day she issued a statement posted on a local Democratic Party website: ""I am 80 years old and I don't understand anything about computers. I don't know where the numbers Kathy was showing me ultimately came from, but they seemed to add up. I am still very, very confused. ..."" Kloppenburg demanded a recount and an investigation. Eventually, given the margin of Prosser's victory and no evidence of intentional wrongdoing by Nickolaus, Kloppenburg conceded. Prosser did what everyone expected: He cast the deciding vote on the state Supreme Court to uphold the Wisconsin law limiting the collective bargaining rights of public sector unions. The collective bargaining rights case was so contentious at the Wisconsin Supreme Court that during the drafting of the opinions, Prosser and Justice Ann Walsh Bradley got into a physical altercation at the courthouse, which remains under investigation. Things were just as heated outside the courthouse. Labor unions and Democrats, angry with Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican legislature, started recall campaigns against state senators in an effort to flip the state Senate to the Democrats. They succeeded in qualifying six recalls for the state ballot. Republicans, not to be outdone, qualified two recall elections against Democrats for the following week. The time leading up to the August 2011 recall election saw its share of voting controversies. A group affiliated with the conservative Koch brothers, Americans for Prosperity, sent absentee ballot applications to Democratic areas asking recipients to send in their requests for absentee ballots two days after the election was to be held. The requests were to be mailed to a post office box shared with other conservative organizations. Liberal blogs and groups publicized the mailing as an effort at voter suppression; an AFP spokesman called it a ""typo"" and added, ""I'm sure the liberals will try to make a mountain out of a molehill in an attempt to distract voters' attention from the issues."" Results from the recall elections began to roll in shortly after 8 p.m. on Aug. 11, when the Wisconsin polls closed. Control of the state Senate hung on the race in Senate District 8, pitching incumbent Republican Alberta Darling against Democratic State Representative Sandy Pasch. For much of the night, the election results did not move. Pasch had a small lead over Darling, but 10 of 11 precincts from Kathy Nickolaus' Waukesha County had not yet reported, and 12 of 51 Milwaukee precincts, typically a Democratic Party stronghold, had not reported either. But the Twitterverse wasn't going to wait for results; it soon lit up with conspiracy theories. From the left, Twitter messages sporting the #wirecall hashtag were quick to accuse Nickolaus of criminally interfering with the election outcomes. ""Kathy Nickolaus should be jailed for vote tampering and voter intimidation by proxy."" ""Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus is either THE most incompetent clerk or a lying cheat!"" ""Will state of #WI get out their pitchforks&torches if Kathy Nickolaus rigs ANOTHER election?"" ""#WTF Is up with Waukesha county #WI I SMELL A ROTTEN FISH ! #Wiunion #Wirecall #FRAUD ! FIRE KATHY N NOW !"" The paranoia spread beyond Twitter. After Nickolaus reported most of Waukesha's numbers, putting Darling comfortably over the top, a state Democratic Party official told the news media, ""We believe there's dirty tricks afoot."" The state chair released this statement on the party's website: ""The race to determine control of the Wisconsin Senate has fallen in the hands of the Waukesha County clerk, who has already distinguished herself as incompetent, if not worse. She is once more tampering with the results of a consequential election and in the next hours we will determine our next course of action. For now, Wisconsin should know that a dark cloud hangs over these important results."" The paranoia on the right was just as great, but it was directed against the Democrats and the outstanding votes in Milwaukee. ""Amusing that nobodys asking about MKE County being late. County with recent election fraud convictions. Waukesha is smoke screen #wirecall."" ""Wait for the ACORN recounts and the absentee-voter fraud in #wirecall."" ""Remember wisconsin, not only must we get more voters to vote, we have to win beyond the margin of liberal vote fraud. #wigop #tcot #wirecall."" Pasch conceded after midnight, when it was clear the election was lost. By morning, Democrats had retracted their charges of vote tampering and removed the incendiary statement from their website. Not everyone approved of this capitulation. One person tweeted about wanting Nickolaus dead: ""I wish I had a missile to shove up her fat ass! So I pray someone closer to her gets Wisconsin some justice! Now FUCK OFF!"" The Wisconsin story should provide pause for anyone worried about how this country could handle another election meltdown. And it isn't some hypothetical scenario; we are in the midst of another close presidential election that will come down to a few swing states. If we have another razor-thin election going into overtime, the high levels of political polarization today almost guarantees that partisans will push hard for the losing presidential candidate not to concede the race, just as they pushed Al Gore to fight on in 2000. But there are two big differences between Gore's situation in 2000 and the situation a candidate will face in a future meltdown. First, the last decade's Voting Wars have made partisans less likely to trust the results of a close election and more likely to believe that litigation could succeed in reversing the losing candidate's fortunes While there used to be fewer than 100 election cases nationwide on average each year, the number has more than doubled and it peaks in presidential years. Candidates litigate early and often, and Florida 2000 still reverberates among the political elite. Second, as Wisconsin showed, social media like Twitter will fan partisan flames in ways we did not experience in 2000. There is no shortage of sparks for this powder keg. The pretext could be vote counting machinery, partisan election officials, provisional ballots, absentee ballots, claims of voter fraud or voter suppression, unclear rules--everything would be up for grabs. And the fight would almost certainly be happening in a battleground state, where emotions would already be high because the election contest would have been fought the hardest there for months. We should not forget the emotional aspect of these disputes. There is a feedback loop between close elections and the Voting Wars. The Voting Wars undermine voter faith in election results, especially among partisans. This makes it more likely that candidates will see less downside in challenging every close election in court. The pursuit of those remedies exposes more flaws in how we conduct our elections and inflames partisan emotions. That further undermines faith in our elections and makes candidates even more willing to go down this path. Social media, including Twitter and political blogs, both increase the chance that a candidate would litigate rather than concede in the razor-thin election, and increase the chances of extreme nastiness after the vote is tallied up. Social media seem to exacerbate the dangers of an enclave mentality. Today, thanks to Twitter and the Internet, people are encouraged to get their news only from like-minded sources that reinforce their existing worldview. These media inhibit the democratic deliberation necessary for political compromise. Back in 2000, when the Florida story was at its height, it took what felt like an interminably long time for any news outlet to post the Supreme Court's opinion in Bush v. Gore. (I accessed it slowly over a dial-up connection.) Opinions about the controversial opinion were formed gradually and disseminated by elites: the major television and cable news networks and the leading national newspapers. The Internet obviously provides many more outlets for individual expression than ever before. Anyone can have a Facebook page, blog, or Twitter account. Many important political blogs allow users to have publicly available ""Diaries."" Comments appear on virtually all of these media. Everyone is a publisher; everyone is a critic. The technology for mass publication about our political disagreements or election disputes has emerged just as trust in mainstream media has decreased and partisanship has spiked. Of course, some people have always held extreme opinions and felt paranoia about how elections are run. But those opinions were often sent as letters to the editor that never saw the light of day. Now anyone with a cellphone can broadcast to the world that the Waukesha County elections clerk should have a missile shoved up her ass. The enclave can be ugly, and it allows people with extreme opinions to reinforce and legitimate each other. Even when it is not personal and offensive, social media can shape public opinion during election disputes. The Internet allows for a kind of crowdsourcing of every decision made by every election official and judge. People can second guess every challenged ballot, piece of voting machinery, election official delay, and judicial opinion. While it sounds democratizing, much of this analysis is not particularly thoughtful or well-considered. In a world in which it is increasingly hard for people to accept objective truth--think of the idea that President Obama is a Muslim or that President Bush caused 9/11--a million comments about an election meltdown in a million partisan echo chambers sounds scary. It's not just our gut that tells us to be concerned about these trends. A study by scientists at the Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research at Indiana examined more than 250,000 tweets on politics from the six weeks leading up to the 2010 U.S. congressional elections. Not surprisingly, the researchers found that Twitter users used ""retweets"" (reposting someone else's message) in a highly partisan way. Approximately 93 percent of right-leaning tweeters and 80 percent of left-leaning tweeters retweeted from other users with whom they agreed. Tweets that included ""mentions"" of other people (which were far less frequent than retweets) linked to a more ideologically balanced group of tweeters--Democrats would mention Republican tweets and vice-versa. The use of common hashtags by Democrats and Republicans (like #wirecall in Wisconsin) had the effect of exposing users to ideas with which they were likely to disagree. The Indiana authors found that exchanging messages across the ideological divide in this medium did not lead to moderation. Instead, the authors saw what I saw in the #wirecall thread: ""Many messages contain sentiments more extreme than you would expect to encounter in face-to-face interactions, and the content is frequently associated with disparaging of the identities and views associated with users across the partisan divide. ... [T]hese interactions might actually serve to exacerbate the problem of polarization by reinforcing pre-existing political biases."" During a political battle, to know you is to hate you, especially behind the relative anonymity of the Internet. It's a mistake to dismiss the emotional content of political tweets and blog posts as merely people blowing off steam. The ideological echo chamber of Twitter, political blogs, and other social media reverberates to elites in the mainstream media, campaigns, and elsewhere, fueling greater partisanship. When the Democratic chair in Wisconsin retracted his statements accusing Waukesha County election official Kathy Nickolaus of ""dirty tricks,"" he blamed his initial comments on the ""heat-of-the-moment."" If Romney-Obama goes into overtime, the ""heat of the moment"" could last a very long time, as Twitter-fomented anger causes people to spill into the streets. At that point, comparisons between U.S. election controversies and political uprisings overseas may not seem like such a stretch."	Why Twitter Will Make the Next Election Meltdown So Much Worse	['Obama']	[]
26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/08/paul_ryan_for_vp_his_budget_would_cut_medicare_by_the_same_amount_as_obama_.html	"The headline at Buzzfeed read ""Ryan Skips Florida."" The story, the first of many on a go-go-go weekend--suggested that Mitt Romney's running mate would be put at a safe, electric-fence distance from senior citizens, lest he give them night terrors about his Medicare plans. Nine hours later, the Romney-Ryan campaign sent out a schedule alert with a pungent whiff of ahem. ""I wanted to advise you that Congressman Ryan will be visiting central Florida next weekend,"" wrote campaign spokesman Brendan Buck. ""There, he will highlight President Obama's record of slashing Medicare for current Florida seniors to fund Obamacare."" The GOP ticket will have to defend Ryan's budget on at least three fronts. They are: Who gets its tax cuts, who suffers from its spending cuts, and whether or not it ""would essentially end Medicare."" That last bit is the most immediately problematic, so the campaign is jujitsu-ing it first. (The ""end Medicare"" label comes from the news pages of the Wall Street Journal, the paper whose opinion pages have ran thick with pro-Ryan spin.) The response is a version of the sophisticated parlor game I'm Rubber and You're Glue. The Affordable Care Act, if implemented, caps the rate of increase in Medicare spending over 10 years to GDP growth plus 0.5 percent. Medicare spending was $499 billion in 2009, and the Congressional Budget Office projects it to hit a post-ACA high $929 billion in 2020. This was expected to mean $450 billion of cuts; some new math suggests it'll mean $700 billion. Where will that $700 billion come from? Most of the savings are supposed to come from the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a yet-to-be-staffed agency charged with finding waste. That's the ""death panel"" that Sarah Palin, et al, have warned about, sort of, but in the law it's spelled out that the cuts ""shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums."" More savings will come from Medicare Advantage, the prescription drug benefit program that Ryan voted for in 2003--less payment, probably, for a few services, to be determined. In those ways, some Medicare benefits that currently get covered won't get covered. And that is how Republicans have toxified Obamacare and turned seniors against it. Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign, good at rhetoric and straw polls and not much else, referred to this as Barack Obama ""stealing"" from Medicare. It was a good line! ""He stole $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare,"" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus on Sunday. ""If any person in this entire debate has blood on their hands in regard to Medicare, it's Barack Obama. He's the one that's destroying Medicare."" The ""Medicare cuts"" appeared in tens of millions of dollars worth of 2010 campaign ads. Of course they did. In the past, typically, it was Republicans who'd proposed to cut the rate of growth in Medicare and been called granny-killers. Throwing this back on Democrats was a sweet cosmic revenge--and it worked. No group swung over to the GOP in larger numbers then did voters over 65. In 2008, that bloc narrowly voted for Democratic candidates in House races--49-48, according to exit polling. In 2010*, these same seniors broke 59-38 for the Republicans. But in 2010, there was no ""Paul Ryan budget."" That's where this gets sticky. Remember, Obamacare is supposed to save $700 billion by capping the rise in Medicare spending from GDP growth plus 0.5 percent. The Ryan budgets in 2012 and 2013 don't alter Medicare for anyone entering it before 2022--a buffer that lets current retirees breathe easy. After 2022, it turns all of Medicare into a premium support plan like Medicare Advantage. At that point, ""an annual competitive bidding process"" is supposed to push providers to provide lower rates. ""The per capita cost of this reformed program for seniors reaching eligibility after 2023,"" explains Ryan in his budget guide, ""could not exceed nominal GDP growth plus 0.5 percent."" So, if it works, it's got the exact same Medicare cap as the Obama plan. You might expect this to muddle the Romney/Republican argument against Obamacare. It hasn't. ""He's the only president to cut $500 billion from Medicare,"" says Romney on the trail. (Remember, changing calculations could put the size of the cut at $700 billion, but just saying ""Obama"" and ""cut"" is usually enough.) Republicans think that the ""Obamacare cuts Medicare"" issue is so potent that the old Obama numbers among older voters are forever lost to him. ""Every bit of polling I've seen in Florida, both public and private, shows Florida seniors are scared to death of Obamacare,"" says Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant in the state. ""They think they're going to lose their doctors, lose their Medicare Advantage, have lower quality care and be subject to IPAB death panels. Doesn't matter if it's true, [it] matters that they believe it."" That's the upshot, really--whether voters will break out the calculators and decide which spending cap they like better. It's a choice. Look back at the article that the Romney campaign sent out yesterday, as it promised that Ryan would campaign in Florida against Obama ""slashing Medicare."" It's a short item, by reporter Marc Caputo, that explains why a video of Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter talking about Medicare ""cuts"" is ""reverberating in the conservative blogosphere."" But that's not all that Caputo wrote. ""Unmentioned"" by the meme, he writes, ""was that the Ryan plan could also cut as much money."" Details, details. ""ObamaCare specifically calls for no reductions in benefits because it's essentially a defined benefit plan. Ryan calls for a defined contribution plan. And under Ryan's scenario, there's a good bet that the contribution won't be enough to cover health expenses that ObamaCare seeks to guarantee."" The biggest political danger facing Obama's Medicare plan is that voters won't understand it. The biggest political danger facing Ryan's plan is that they will.

Former Republican congressman and current U.S. Senate candidate Chris Shays found the stage and grabbed a microphone. ""Thank you for loving your country!"" said Shays. He spotted a Gadsden flag, the semi-official banner of the Tea Party, and rubbed the fabric. ""This is our heritage,"" said Shays. He turned and walked toward the modern American flag, and repeated the laying-on of hands. ""This is our heritage, it's our present, it's our future."" Many hacks and strategists have struggled to define the ""Tea Party candidate."" Almost no definition is broad enough to cover Chris Shays--elected to the Connecticut legislature in 1974, moved up to Congress in 1987, losing his seat in the 2008 Obama wave. He was one of the GOP's trustier pro-choice votes. He sponsored campaign finance reform legislation. Anybody holding a vote on gun control? Better call Chris. In the past year, though, since announcing his comeback bid, Shays has tried to hotwire a connection to the new Republican Party. The sponsor of a health care reform bill that demanded state-by-state insurance mandates now pledges to repeal Obamacare. In New Milford, Shays apologized for his last vote to raise taxes, in 1991. ""I voted for a luxury tax,"" he sighed, ""and all I did was put boat manufacturers out of work."" He's slowly won over some critics. ""I got the impression that he learned from his mistakes,"" said Al Brant, organizer of the New Milford group. To prove it, all Shays has to do is win the Republican primary on Tuesday It's tough to find people who think he can. The odds-on favorite to win the nomination here is Linda McMahon, co-founder (with her husband, Vince) of World Wrestling Entertainment, net worth around $232 million, the 2010 Republican candidate, spender of more than $62 million on her two campaigns. McMahon beat Shays at the state GOP convention, and the last poll of the race gives her a 68-20 lead on the Last Republican Moderate. ""If I win this election, I won't be surprised,"" said Shays on Friday. ""If I lose this election, I won't be surprised, because it all depends on who votes. Mrs. McMahon has broader support, and [it's as] thin as paper."" I caught up with Shays on Friday at the Jewish Home for the Elderly in Fairfield. He was scheduled to talk to retirees at 10 a.m. He arrived early to be introduced to a Korean War veteran named Archer Karnes. ""Thank you for your service,"" said Shays. ""Why don't you send me a check, then?"" said Karnes. Shays laughed; he could brag about his old constituent service if he wanted, but maybe this wasn't the year for it. He worked a steadily  filling synagogue of residents, most of them in wheelchairs, sometimes putting his hand on one chair as he took a knee and talked to two people. When the residents were assembled, he told them some decades-spanning anecdotes about the wise voters and statesmen he'd known. He accidentally referred to the prime minister of Israel as ""President Netanyahu,"" then apologized: ""I keep thinking of him as Bibi."" He'd been to Israel 15 times. The pitch, when he gets around it, was a softer, gentler remix of the Paul Ryan plan. ""You don't need to be afraid that Social Security won't be there,"" he said. ""You don't need to be afraid that Medicare won't be there. You don't need to be afraid that Medicaid won't be there. The people you need to worry about are your kids, and your grandkids."" After the meeting, as Frank Sinatra tunes played over the P.A. system, Shays chatted with reporters about the winnability of the race and about just how conservative he was willing to be. ""At one of those first [Republican presidential] debates,"" he said, ""when they had, like, 10 candidates, they were asked if they'd take $10 of spending [cuts] for $1 of tax increases. They all said they wouldn't. I'd have said: 'Would you repeat the question again?' When they repeated the question, I'd have said, 'I'll take it.'"" Fiscal policy was cake. Social issues were a little trickier. As pro-choice as he is, Shays couldn't endorse the new HHS rule that requires health care plans to pay for birth control. ""You have a separation of church and state,"" he said. ""It means religious freedoms for individuals, but also religious freedoms for institutions. If you work for an institution that has certain religious beliefs, you have to respect them, and understand you might not have the same."" He'd back Mitt Romney's position on the rule, but he wouldn't endorse the ""war on religion"" line Romney's used to describe it. ""I don't think there's a war on religion,"" said Shays, ""and I don't think there's a war on women. People use these terms, and it stifles debate. Let's have an honest discussion."" Shays wrapped up and headed to his next meet-and-greet, in Stamford. I headed to Danbury, where Linda McMahon would appear to open her ninth campaign office. (Shays has only one.) A helpful volunteer in a LINDA shirt waved me to a parking space, ""right there behind the BMW."" Inside the office, staffers were handing out four kinds of free T-shirts, two thick campaign-policy brochures on full-color cardstock, and a cornucopia of Italian sandwiches and pasta salad. The WWE fortune buys one hell of a spread. Once the room was full, McMahon and Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton emerged to rally troops. She lumped in Shays with her likely Democratic opponent, Rep. Chris Murphy--""career politicians"" who never so much as moved a widget. They didn't have economic plans, and she did. ""It's detailed. It's online. No other candidate has that kind of plan. As a matter of fact, Congressman Murphy says his is a work in progress. It's time to stop having things in progress. The people of Connecticut want action."" McMahon plunged into crowd, ping-pong-ing between people with ultra-specific local issues (""We've got to get rid of that sludge"") and homemade energy-independence plans and just plain fans who still wore LINDA 2010 gear. Then she stopped to talk to reporters, who asked how her vaunted plan actually added up to the campaign's promise-- ""$6,000 in savings per year for the average Connecticut family."" To get to that number, McMahon assumed that all of the Bush tax cuts would expire in January 2013 (something neither Republicans nor Democrats want) and define the ""average"" family as one that makes $125,000 per household per year. ""I'm talking about a plan that goes into effect in 2013,"" she said. ""You can go online and plug it right in. I'm basing my plan on the fact that the current tax law, which Congress voted on last week to not expire--that will be the tax law."" I asked how McMahon would pay for the tax cuts, and she pointed at the campaign brochure tucked under my arm. ""I have a total six-point plan. You have it there. Part of it is to reduce spending."" The candidate moved on. Her supporters kept on talking, and signing up for grass-roots campaign tasks, and explaining why they'd ruled out voting for Chris Shays, the old congressman who'd reformed his moderate ways. ""He's the man who came to dinner,"" said Randolph Summ, a retired marketing manager. ""If you stay in Washington too long, you start doing what you're told to do. Here's my idea. In January, we move the House of Representatives out to Alaska, and the Senate out to some unpleasant place in North Dakota."""

But as the presidential campaign has worn on, the candidate has become more adventurous. Here, he demonstrates his folksiness--and agility--by delivering a stump speech from atop a picnic table outside the Jefferson County Fairgrounds building in Golden, Colo., last week. When there's no table available, Romney has proven his versatility by speaking to his followers while perched on a chair. ... though when it's a wobbly chair, Romney wisely enlists the assistance of a strong staffer, such as Garrett Jackson (below). Romney appears to live by the motto Any chair is fair game. Homely upholstered chairs, stately alumni chairs--they've all served as  pedestals for the former governor during his two presidential campaigns. Sometimes, Romney asks his wife, Ann, to join him for some chair-standing--but only after she's taken off her heels. The campaign can't be going around poking holes in people's upholstery. Romney's gusto for standing on things allows him to show off a down-to-earth side of himself. It says, ""Maybe I'm not the presidential contender you want to drink a beer with, but I'm not too rich to stand on your cooler."" Is standing on things always a good idea? Take this speech at Happy Joe's in Clinton, Iowa. Even without the chair, Romney would be way taller than all of the diner's seated patrons. Is it really necessary to elevate himself further? Does it give him an air of command--or just make him seem out of touch? Still, you have to hand it to Romney. Chair/table/cooler standing is no easy feat. Many politicians try it, but only a few succeed in pulling it off with dignity. Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt's expression, as he joins Romney atop a Dave & Buster's pool table back in 2008 during Romney's first bid for president, suggests he'd have preferred to remain floor-bound. Romney, by contrast, looks like a man who is passionate about making his pitch to the American people from a table covered in felt.

It's hot outside, the presidential candidates are running from one rally to the next, but, for all their hustle, we don't really see much movement. In our last Slate/SurveyMonkey political survey, our pool of more than 1,000 registered voters told us that they felt the United States was veering off course; that around 30 percent--the largest plurality--""strongly disapproved"" of Obama's efforts as president; and that, nevertheless, the American people would still rather have Obama change their tires and babysit the kids than Romney. Americans seem unhappy with the economy--particularly with dribbling jobs numbers--but Mitt's failure to connect with voters appears to be handing the advantage to Obama. Well, in late July, we again took the temperature of more than a 1,000 registered voters and guess what? Thirty days have passed, Americans still don't like the economy, Obama still crests on a swell of charisma, and Mitt Romney still needs a personality coach. (Information on our respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) In July, a familiar 55 percent of survey-takers reported that the country was either ""definitely"" or ""probably"" heading in the wrong way. Still, the president's ineffable magnetism remains intact. When we reprised the auto-in-distress question (""If your car was broken down on the side of the road, which presidential candidate would you want to stop and help you change the tire?""), Obama's edge increased slightly. Nearly 50 percent of respondents, up from 47.6 percent in June, would prefer to see the POTUS approaching with a spare and a toolkit. Likewise, 51.7 percent of survey takers in July would hire Obama as a babysitter: an increase from 48.7 percent last month. But Obama's marginal gains aren't the most important shift in July's survey. It isn't so much that Obama is doing better during the midsummer months than Romney appears to be doing worse. The former governor had a tough month. In the shadow of the Bain ads, the brouhaha over his unwillingness to release his tax records, and a botched overseas ""charm offensive"" that one British paper derided as ""utterly devoid of charm and mildly offensive,"" he's been struggling to get out of his own way. Heading into November, Romney will need to assure voters he can stitch up the economic wounds Obama's administration has failed to address. And based on our survey numbers, he lost some ground in July. For instance, when we asked whether respondents thought their lives would get better, get worse, or stay the same if Barack Obama were re-elected, the largest group (27.5 percent) projected that things would turn ""somewhat better."" Again, that's a marginal increase from June's 26.1 percent. But when we asked the same question of Romney, people's confidence slumped. Only 22 percent thought their lives would improve ""somewhat,"" which is bad enough. But the combined total of survey takers who supposed a Romney White House would make their lives either ""a great deal better"" or ""somewhat better"" fell from 34 percent to 27.6 percent between June and July. A combined 49.3 percent--up from 42 percent in June--suspected things would worsen with Mitt at the helm. What is ailing Romney? In addition to the gaffes and attack ads, our survey results suggest that the former governor may suffer from an honesty deficit. When asked ""How honest do you think Mitt Romney is with American voters,"" 29.4 percent of respondents replied with ""slightly honest,"" 26.6 percent offered a lukewarm ""moderately honest,"" and 26 percent said ""not at all honest"" (ouch). Furthermore, 30.4 percent of those surveyed believe Romney hides his true political opinions ""about half the time."" To be sure, even if Obama inspires a little more trust, people still understand he is a politician. The largest group of survey takers, 28.1 percent, considers him ""moderately honest,"" followed by ""very honest"" (22.3 percent), ""slightly honest"" (20.6 percent), ""not at all honest"" (20.4) and ""extremely honest"" (8.6 percent). Only 22.4 percent thinks the POTUS conceals his real attitudes ""about half the time."" The largest faction, 38.3 percent, would amend that statement to ""once in a while."" But American voters give credit where credit is due. As last month's survey revealed, people readily acknowledge Romney's business acumen--and some even conjecture it might give him a hand in the Oval Office. We were curious about what people saw when they looked at the presidential candidates--what skill sets they perceived and how those abilities aligned with the country's priorities. So we asked, ""Some people are 'book smart' and some people are 'street smart.' How would you characterize Barack Obama?"" The largest group of respondents, 44.1 percent, gave the POTUS the best of both worlds, replying that he was book smart AND street smart. Twenty-five percent described him as book smart only, 22.1 percent said he was neither, and 8.8 percent called him street smart only. Then, we asked the same about Romney. The fattest slice of survey takers granted the governor ivory tower credentials but withheld his diploma from the school of hard knocks. Nearly 41 percent considered him book smart only, 32.1 percent called him neither book smart nor street smart, 19.1 percent said he was both, and 7.9 percent said he was only street smart. These results indicate that respondents may see Obama as a more complete individual than his opponent. He has both knowledge and practical know-how--after all, he's the guy you want around when your engine sputters or your child tries to swallow the remote control. Romney's seen neither as unintelligent nor as unlearned, but he again loses points for seeming out-of-touch. And that knack for connecting with people on the street may be exactly what Americans yearn for in their head of state, as July's final question reveals: ""Would you prefer a president who is street smart or book smart?"" The biggest set of survey takers, 42.9 percent, chose street smart; 21.5 percent opted for book smart; and 35.6 percent were undecided. After a month like July, Mitt Romney may be the only person in America who is happy to see August."	Would You Prefer a President Who Is Book Smart or Street Smart?	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
