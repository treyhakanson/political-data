Justice Kennedy, recognizing that the current hyperpolarized Congress cannot get much done, asked if the court in thinking about congressional reaction to its ruling should consider ""the real Congress or a hypothetical Congress."" Justice Kennedy's question introduced a dose of realism into the debate. Of course the current Congress won't overcome its differences and do anything constructive if the court kills Obamacare. For the foreseeable future, the court's word on the health care law will be final. And if that word is a death knell to Obamacare, it would likely mark the end of any remaining illusions of a ""hypothetical Supreme Court."" You know which court I'm talking about--the one where justices act as ""umpires,"" calling balls and strikes, discovering but not making law, acting with humility and judicial minimalism. The one which Chief Justice John Roberts promised the country at his 2005 confirmation hearing. The smart money before the argument was on an 8-1 upholding of Obamacare. A 5-4 decision striking the law down for exceeding congressional power will reveal a ""real"" Supreme Court unafraid of ignoring well-established legal precedent in a favor of its own ideological preferences: It is an activist conservative court that has already opened up the corporate money spigot in Citizens United, that favors ""states' rights"" over national solutions to national problems, that could soon bar affirmative action and strike down the Voting Rights Act, which has expanded gun rights and will further weaken reproductive rights, and that has been a friend to business interests above the interests of consumers, minorities, women, and the disabled. If it overturns Obamacare, the Supreme Court will have revealed its radical nature. That would have three important political implications. First, for the first time a Democratic candidate may be able to run for president against the Supreme Court. Conservatives have done this in the past, railing against the expansion of rights by the Warren Court, but Democrats have been much less successful. Now the strategy could work. By 2016, both Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy will turn 80.* If a Republican wins in 2012, Scalia and Kennedy will probably retire before the end of that first term. That would give the new Republican president the chance to entrench the five-justice Republican majority for decades--and to cement it, by replacing Kennedy with a wholly reliable right-wing vote. The second implication is related to the first: The ever-nasty confirmation battles over Supreme Court justices are likely to get even more acrimonious. No one will be able to pretend that a Supreme Court justice is merely an umpire calling balls and strikes, and it will become more legitimate for senators to expressly take ideology into account when considering whether or not to confirm someone for the high bench. We could well see senators become willing to filibuster Supreme Court nominees for ideological reasons the way they have filibustered lower court judges. That could lead to vacancies on the court, and the court becoming further mired in a partisan morass. The third and final political implication is that the Court's legitimacy could suffer in ways which we have never seen. It is true that even Bush v. Gore--the 5-4 decision determining that George W. Bush rather than Al Gore would become president in 2000--did not cause long term damage to the court's reputation in the eyes of the public. But things are different now, because of the partisan realignment of the Supreme Court. Partisan realignment is not a new phenomenon for our institutions. It happened in Congress beginning in the Civil Rights movement. There used to be conservative Democrats, especially in the South, and liberal Republicans. These days, the most conservative Democrat in Congress is more liberal than the most liberal Republican. This shift has made it exceedingly difficult to get almost any bipartisan compromise in Congress. Partisan realignment has now hit the Supreme Court as well.  Justice Stevens and Justice Souter were both fairly liberal Justices but both were appointed by Republican presidents. Now the Court's liberal-conservative split lines up with a party split too.  The four liberals--Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor--were appointed by Democratic presidents, and the five conservatives--Alito, Kennedy, Roberts, Scalia, and Thomas were appointed by Republican presidents. How soon before we start talking of ""Democratic justices"" and ""Republican justices,"" and fully expect the justices to decide constitutional law and statutory cases in line with each party's legislative preference on these issues? Even if the justices really think there is a distinction between the meaning of the Constitution and their party's political preferences, will the public believe it when the correlation between the two is nearly perfect? This is a far greater danger to the Supreme Court's legitimacy than allowing a live audio broadcast of the Court's oral arguments--which the justices still bar. I have no idea whether or not Justice Kennedy or Chief Justice Roberts will blink when faced with the political implications of a ruling striking down the health care law, the signature achievement of President Obama's first term. But such a decision could not only influence whether or not Obama gets a second term; it could also change in fundamental ways how justices are chosen and what the public thinks of them and the institution they represent.

As the nation's highest court listened to arguments over the Affordable Care Act this week, the justices were considering abstract questions about power, precedent, and purpose. My work this month implementing the Affordable Care Act began with the Sneetches. At about 10 on a cool morning in Annapolis, Md., I ran to the front of a large room full of advocates, lobbyists, and concerned citizens. They were waiting to hear about dozens of proposed amendments to legislation that will set the terms for our state's health insurance exchange. This is the new marketplace scheduled to launch in the fall of 2013 and help more than 300,000 Marylanders find health insurance. The crowd was anxious, and I was late. I had lost track of time reading Dr. Seuss classics to a room full of fourth-graders in Baltimore, as part of the Read Across Maryland program. I had especially enjoyed reconnecting with the The Sneetches, a story about status-conscious creatures who are convinced by the charismatic salesman McBean to jump into machines that add or remove stars from their bellies. I went straight to the podium, apologized, and announced that state government would not mandate insurance coverage for the placement or removal of belly stars. Some confused looks, a few chuckles, and then off we went. We reviewed draft amendments on how dental benefits will be offered to consumers, how transitions between health plans will be managed, and how community organizations will reach people who have all but given up hope of ever being insured. For nearly two hours, two state health officials and I listened, answered questions, and took notes. Winding up with a package of amendments with very broad support, we had good news to report to Gov. Martin O'Malley and Lt. Governor Anthony Brown, who are both interested in seeing steady and sustained progress. In Maryland, the Affordable Care Act is not a special three-day miniseries that interrupts regular programming. It's the evening news. It's not a controversial visitor from out of town, but rather the family that lives down the street. Here health care reform is far less political football than it is daily exercise--deploying a new set of tools to help individuals, families, and small businesses obtain health coverage and to address longstanding problems in the health care system. Some of these tools are pretty simple and require little extra effort at the state level. In Maryland, seniors have received about $44 million in subsidies to help them afford prescription drugs. Young adults stay on their parents' insurance, and children are no longer denied coverage for having a pre-existing condition. Other aspects fly so far under the radar that hardly anyone realizes that they were tucked into the Affordable Care Act. Its funding supports home visits for high-risk pregnant women, our electronic immunization registry, and testing to identify HIV infections. In September 2011, we developed 39 public health metrics and encouraged local coalitions to address them. Today, hospitals, health officers, businesses, and others are working together on challenges as diverse as obesity, drug addiction, and infant mortality.  Support to jump start all of this came from the health reform law. Of course, some aspects of the law are more public, complicated, and controversial. Our health exchange will offer access to subsidies for individuals and families with incomes less than four times the federal poverty line and will create a forum for competition between health plans. Naturally, some worry about changes to existing coverage. The main concern that I hear is not with the insurance mandate per se; it's whether coverage will be affordable. So I spend a lot of time meeting, listening, explaining, and working through the details of how we can mitigate risk and keep costs down. Our exchange's four advisory committees held more than 20 meetings with citizens of all stripes. Their recommendations helped shape the state's proposed legislation.  To my very pleasant surprise, many thorny issues that once seemed impossibly complex have yielded to consensus solutions.  We have plans for which insurers will be required to participate in the exchange, how the exchange can set requirements for health plans, and when our state's insurance commissioner can intervene to protect consumers. A week after the Sneetches, I found myself on a small stage in an enormous hotel ballroom at the Thurgood Marshall BWI Airport. About 500 insurance brokers and other industry representatives came to hear about how the new exchange markets would roll out. As I took the microphone, I recognized this was not the moment to linger on the more arcane details of risk adjustment or plan qualification. This was a chance to make a connection and build trust. I asked the group to imagine an alien landing from Mars and being handed the challenge of enrolling hundreds of thousands of uninsured people. If smart, the alien would look around for allies. It would see there were thousands of insurance brokers who understand the value of insurance and know how to sell it. The astute alien would want to figure out how to join forces. With such a natural overlap in our goals, I said, it would be crazy for us not to take the alien's perspective. I explained that insurance agents in Maryland, with some basic training on tax credits and subsidies, will be able to sell insurance in the exchange--while still being paid commissions, as they are today. Then, even though I had not expected him to speak, one of the industry's most respected leaders walked to the stage. I drew a long, slow breath.  A few adverse words would be a huge setback. Instead, he recalled when Maryland's health insurance market for small businesses was established in the early 1990s and some had been wary of any partnership with government. But he noted that effort had fared well, and he offered that the exchange could prove to be a similarly productive and important public-private venture. I exhaled. Other March events are a blur. I remember a meeting with Montgomery County Council members on how the Affordable Care Act will allow safety-net clinics to expand.  I heard a young woman tell a press conference in Baltimore how the federally funded high-risk insurance pool allowed her to receive treatment for kidney disease, get back on her feet, and find a new job. I spoke with senior lawmakers in Annapolis about how Maryland will choose the required coverage known as the ""essential benefits package"" by Sept. 30--a meeting that may or may not have ended with my promise to dress up as an essential benefits package for Halloween. Twice this month, I drove to Washington, D.C., to talk about Maryland's experience with the Affordable Care Act. To a large audience at the annual meeting of America's Health Insurance Plans, I shared my experience on a recent panel with conservative Republican lawmakers from Ohio and Alabama. After each gave an apocalyptic review of health reform, there was an uneasy silence when I leaned forward to speak. As a pediatrician, I said, I would like to remind everyone of the Sesame Street segment that one of these things is not like the others. In such settings, I acknowledge that Affordable Care Act is not a magical solution to all of the health care system's problems. But I argue that the law's tools and resources give states a fighting chance to reverse ongoing erosion of coverage and to pursue critical innovations in health care.   As we have written this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Maryland is using our state's unique all-payer hospital system, health data information exchange, and primary care infrastructure to obtain better health outcomes at lower cost. Our options have only improved since the health law came to be. To those hostile to health reform, I point out the irony that Maryland, a state whose leaders support the Affordable Care Act, is working hard to design and run our own exchange. Under the law, states with a nyet attitude get a federally run program in their own backyards. A few days later, I visited the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, a small gathering of advocates and senior officials from insurance and pharmaceutical companies. There was some parsing of recent statements from the Department of Health and Human Services and not a small amount of handwringing about what could go wrong. I noted that the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and insurance exchanges will make comprehensive cancer treatment, including access to clinical trials, possible for millions of Americans. I felt like a high school coach: All hands in, let's get this thing to work! Last Thursday, our Medicaid director told me that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services awarded Maryland more than $100 million in special funding under the Affordable Care Act to expand community services for the elderly. When implemented, thousands more Maryland residents will be able to age in the comfort of their own homes, rather than in nursing homes. Of course, his smile is constrained by the recognition that all of this could be taken away. I have tried to avoid Supreme Court previews and the initial reactions to the oral arguments--unsuccessfully. There seems to have been a lot of talk about broccoli, cars, and burial insurance. Not so much about the vast policy failures the Affordable Care Act is aiming to address. Very little about the many people whose health and lives may well hang on a single vote. Between now and when the Supreme Court is expected to rule in late June, I am going to keep myself busy. Maryland's proposed exchange legislation, with our consensus amendments, is on track to become law. There is a computer system to build and an outreach campaign to plan. It helps me to recall that even Dr. Seuss' creatures were able to overcome their short-sightedness. One day, the Sneetches got ""really quite smart"" and recognized that belly star or not, ""Sneetches are Sneetches.""  Were we to come to a similar conclusion, the Affordable Care Act would have nothing to fear."	A Look at How One State Official Is Trying To Make Obamacare a Reality	[]	[]

The color on the election board will change from blank to purple, because for whatever reason that's the color Santorum's been assigned. Wolf Blitzer will pronounce this ""very interesting"" or a development that CNN is ""watching closely."" If we're lucky, he'll do both. It'll be fun. It won't actually tell us who's getting most of Louisiana's 46 delegates to the Republican National Convention. Only 20 delegates will be assigned tomorrow, split between whichever candidates get more than 25 percent of the vote. The leftover delegates, and 23 more besides, will sit in limbo until June 2, when Republicans will meet in Shreveport to parcel them out. Hang on, sorry. Right before that, in April, there'll be district conventions that assign delegates for Shreveport. And none of these newly empowered Republicans have to pay attention to primary results. This is extremely confusing, isn't it? Now you know why Mitt Romney's rivals, seemingly bested by the cruel God of Math, are confident that they can still take him out. In Louisiana today, set for his worst defeat in the South so far, Newt Gingrich was musing about the rule that allows anyone to be nominated if enough delegates in five states make it so. ""My hope is we will find five states,"" he said, ""and I also think, frankly, that the Republican National Committee would be quite willing to have me put in nomination under any circumstance."" A few days earlier, Rick Santorum's campaign gave reporters a 56-minute briefing on how they--and, to a lesser extent, Ron Paul--would mop up delegates in under-the-radar state conventions. How many delegates are we talking about? The states that have already held primaries and voted represent, technically, 983 delegates. Eight of these states--Iowa, Maine, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington, Alaska, and Wyoming--have not yet assigned all of their delegates. Together, they have 246 delegates waiting to be meted out at district and county conventions. Just look at Iowa. That state's Jan. 3 caucuses assigned no delegates. None. The real work there only started to happen on March 10, when Republicans gathered in 99 county conventions, picking their representatives for the four congressional district meet-ups on April 21. In their Tuesday conference call, the Santorum campaign's delegate-counter John Yob predicted that he'd win the ""vast majority"" of Iowa's 25 delegates. The AP count had Santorum winning only seven of them. Is the Santorum campaign right? We have no idea. If anyone might know, it would be Ryan Gough, the Iowa Republican Party's organization director. I called him on Friday to check what had happened in those March 10 klatches. ""I'm just now getting back lists of delegates from 99 counties,"" he said. ""They're lists of names and addresses. They don't have an R for a Romney supporter or an S for a Santorum supporter, or anything like that. The party can't tell where the support is at this point."" Other caucus states have started to turn in pledged delegate lists, and the results aren't too bad for Romney. When he lost Colorado's mid-February caucus (the nonbinding one that reporters covered), Romney won Douglas County by a rough 3-2 margin over Santorum. He won the next round--the one that actually counted--by a 5-1 margin. On March 18, in Washington, Ron Paul won delegates from Seattle-area districts that he'd lost in the first, nonbinding caucus. The chaos may end up helping Romney. In the big Tuesday conference call, the Santorum campaign claimed that they were only 124 delegates behind Romney, not 281 delegates behind, as CNN had been saying. Those projections, according to Yob, were based ""on what has transpired in the early stages of the Iowa, Washington, and Missouri contests."" They were, to some extent, guessing. Romney's campaign knows what it's doing in some states. Ron Paul's base consists entirely of triathletes who can outlast anyone in a game of stand-around-till-the-caucus-ends. Hang on, though--step back a few paces. In the long run of the primary, this chaos is a huge waste of time, and that's only bad for the front-runner. Organizing some primary state, or even organizing in a binding caucus, can help a national campaign organize in virgin territory. Canvassers learn how to canvass. People who don't DVR through their commercials meet the candidates in 30-second bites. Slogging through county and district conventions gets you none of that. It bogs staff time and money down in a picayune process that won't matter five minutes after the conventions are over. The Facebook page of Washington for Romney is not full of people organizing to take a blue state away from Barack Obama. It's larded up with articles about how Ron Paul or Rick Santorum is trying to take delegates away from the guy who should be winning. Should they feel so entitled? Well, Romney will probably cross the 4 million popular vote margin when Louisiana votes. He's more than 1 million votes ahead of Santorum, close to 2 million votes ahead of Gingrich. The Santorum campaign has all but admitted that a convention win would require some delegate-math chicanery, like a challenge to break up delegates from winner-take-all states. (The campaign helpfully noted that the state getting challenged doesn't vote on the challenge. Florida wouldn't be able to vote on the threat to 50 Romney delegates.) If Santorum or Paul win delegates in places that voted for Romney, are they thwarting the will of the people? Honestly, they don't care about that. ""Different states set their processes under which they elect national convention delegates, and we're just following that process,"" Yob said on Tuesday. ""In some states, it so happens that the media chose to cover events that weren't relevant toward the election of delegates. That's just the reality of our political system."" He kind of has a point about the media."	Don't Believe CNN. Nobody Knows How Many Delegates the GOP Candidates Have.	['Romney', 'Paul', 'Wolf', 'Obama']	['god']
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/the_republican_national_committee_rule_no_40_b_won_t_be_the_reason_newt_gingrich_can_t_be_the_party_s_nominee.html	"Now let us talk of Republican National Committee rule No. 40(b). Must we? I'm afraid we must, my friend, they're printing stories in the press. Some believe it to be a hurdle to Newt Gingrich's march to the nomination. You mean the one where he keeps losing but at the Republican Convention is held aloft by 1,144 delegates as the one true nominee? The very same, my friend. Oh no! His plans may be undone. Fear not, this minuscule rule tucked away in Republican Party handbook does nothing to alter the Gingrich plan at all. Hurray! That's because the Gingrich plan has always been so fantastical, rules don't really apply, whether they be party rules or the rules of time and space. Huh? Let me explain: RNC rule No. 40(b) states: Each candidate for nomination for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States shall demonstrate the support of a plurality of the delegates from each of five (5) or more states, severally, prior to the presentation of the name of that candidate for nomination. On its face, this looks bad for Gingrich. The former speaker has won primaries only in South Carolina and Georgia, and it doesn't look like he will win a plurality of delegates in any future state. If he can't meet the five-state threshold, he can't get on the ballot. If he can't get on the ballot, he can't get nominated. True enough, you earthbound simpleton, but you are refusing to embrace Gingrich's bold vision for winning as he and his aides have articulated it for the last several weeks. Here's how it works and why 40(b) is meaningless: According to the Gingrich plan, come the August convention, he'll have well more than the necessary number of delegates in a good deal more states than five. That's because the Gingrich plan ignores the primary process where his fortunes are concerned. As he tells it, all these caucuses and primaries are simply exposing Mitt Romney's deficiencies. Sure, Romney keeps winning and amassing delegates, but in a few Southern states he has not won. That regional blemish is evidence of a irreparable flaw that will deprive him of the 1,144 delegates he needs to win the nomination, so the Gingrich story goes. By the end of primary season in late June, the Republican Party will have ""a real conversation,"" as Gingrich calls it, about who can defeat Barack Obama. In that chat, Gingrich, who will likely be more than 800 delegates behind Mitt Romney, will convince hundreds of delegates that he is the best person to beat Obama. They will suddenly drop their allegiance to other candidates and at the Tampa convention  1,144 of them will vote for Gingrich. Since rule 40(b) applies to your delegate count at the convention--and not at the time the states vote--Gingrich will rise on the shoulders of these newly converted delegates and easily smash the five-state threshold to get on the ballot. Did you think something like Rule 40(b) could stop a man of destiny? Rather than a new hurdle to Gingrich's plans, RNC rule 40(b) simply brings into higher relief the extraordinary unlikelihood of Gingrich's plan to win the nomination. He has already staked his victory on 18 home runs in the ninth inning with two outs. Rule 40(b) simply says he must hit each home run 400 feet, the distance of the plate to centerfield.* A fact to bore them with at dinner: If Gingrich were somehow to pull off his plan, it might require that his name be put into nomination after Romney loses the first ballot vote at the convention. That would turn a contested convention (where several candidates on the ballot fight it out) into a brokered convention (where a new candidate is added to the ballot after the first vote). Correction, March 28, 2012: This article originally stated that the distance between home plate and the centerfield wall is 400 yards. It is more often 400 feet."	How Gingrich's Vision for Becoming the Nominee Has Gone From Absurd to Downright Crazy	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]

But one thing he should not be called is ""Mr. Speaker."" Gingrich ceased to be entitled to that title when he left the House on Jan. 3, 1999. But you would never know it from the obsequious way journalists have addressed him during the campaign, where ""Mr. Speaker"" and ""Speaker Gingrich"" have become standard. It's as if he is Downton Abbey's Earl of Grantham, his honorific adhering to him for life. Gingrich is not the only figure in American politics who's attached to a job title he no longer has. Every ex-Cabinet official seems to think he or she is a permanent secretary. John Nance Garner, who served as a vice president of Franklin Roosevelt, famously declared that the office ""wasn't worth a pitcher of warm piss."" But oh, how former vice presidents hold onto that piss pitcher now. When Al Gore or Dick Cheney shows up to be interviewed, it's all ""Mr. Vice President."" And, of course, we have a gaggle of former presidents running around who are loath to abandon being called ""Mr. President."" As the indispensible Judith Martin slyly notes of the recent president-for-life trend, ""Miss Manners would have thought that having reached that position would surely have cured anyone of status anxiety."" Such title inflation is not only pretentious and incorrect, it's un-American. Our forefathers so disliked the notion of an aristocracy that they forbade it in the Constitution. Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8 begins: ""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States."" It's a little noticed proscription these days, but at the time it represented a profound break with the ways of the old world. As Alexander Hamilton wrote, ""Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people."" Jay Wexler, professor at Boston University School of Law and author of The Odd Clauses, about the lesser-known provisions of the Constitution, says the increasing practice of title-keeping--while not strictly unconstitutional--is unseemly: ""It does by analogy speak to the issue of creating a small but nonetheless permanent class of citizen who get titles forever and can be distinguished from everyone else. So it's inconsistent with the spirit of the clause."" But is there really any harm in humoring the pompous ex-official who enjoys that toasty feeling that being called ""speaker"" or ""secretary"" or ""president"" brings? I think so. Those who hold the highest offices in the land deserve a bit of deference. The problem arises when the people who hold those offices start to take the deference personally. To ease the shock of losing power, the former official, like a kindergartener taking a teddy bear to school, may prefer to cling to an old honorific. But our country was founded on the notion that certain people don't get to lord it over the rest of us just because of the title they carry. It is rare to see politicians correct someone for over-inflating their title. Admonishing people who don't give them their due is another matter. A good example of the latter came when Sen. Barbara Boxer verbally boxed the ears of a brigadier general testifying before her who, in proper military fashion when speaking to a high-ranking woman, called her ""ma'am."" Boxer's response: ""You know, do me a favor. Could you say 'senator' instead of 'ma'am'? It's just a thing. I worked so hard to get that title, so I'd appreciate it,"" In her last re-election campaign that moment was used against her as an illustration of her arrogance. But former officials who don't set straight those who incorrectly call them by their old titles should come in for criticism as well. Even if Gingrich doesn't twist journalists' arms until they call him ""Mr. Speaker,"" he clearly basks in the undeserved esteem the title brings. (If you believe that, in declining to point out that he should be called ""Mr. Gingrich,"" the candidate's real goal is to save others awkwardness and embarrassment, then you don't know Newt Gingrich.) The websites of the presidential libraries are also lousy with references to President Carter and President Clinton. And if they didn't want to be called ""secretary"" in their joint appearance at the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Ft. Worth, surely James Baker or Condoleezza Rice would have made that clear before they were introduced. And what of the reporters who slather on the titles? Journalists could argue they use appellations as sign of respect, but I think it's a feint--a touch of obsequiousness before sticking in the shiv. So, as CNN's John King's did, you preface your question to Gingrich about whether he suggested to his second wife that they have an open marriage by calling him Mr. Speaker. But the press should get things right, and not implicitly misinstruct the public. That titles are important is illustrated by the month-long congressional debate that took place in April 1789. At issue was what to call the first president of the new nation. Historian David Currie described how the Senate, always the more la-di-da half of Congress, proposed, ""His Highness, the President of the United States of America, and Protector of their Liberties."" The House refused, and it was pointed out that this form of address was likely unconstitutional, as Article 2, Section 1 designates, ""The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America."" George Washington had an exquisite understanding of the power of symbols, so when (not-His Highness) President Washington retired from public life, he chose to cease being called ""president"" and revert to his previous military title of ""general."" And when Harry Truman left office to return to Independence, Mo., his neighbors appreciated, David McCullough writes in Truman, ""the way 'Mr. Truman' conducted himself, as a fellow citizen."" Just think, a president returning to the life of a private citizen sans imperial retinue--how quaint. Robert Hickey, deputy director of the Protocol School of Washington and author of Honor & Respect: The Official Guide to Names, Titles, and Forms of Address writes that the rules of the road vary for former officials. Hickey says that for those who held offices filled by only one person at a time--such as president, vice president, secretary of state, and even governor or mayor--it is confusing to the public, and disrespectful to the current office holder, to hang onto the title. People with titles held concurrently by many, such as senators or judges, are not violating tradition by keeping their honorifics. There's an exception for members of the House: Despite hearing Ron Paul endlessly called ""congressman,"" there is no such official title. Members of the House of Representatives are supposed to be referred to by their social title (that is Mr. or Ms., or Dr., Mrs., or Miss as preferred). But when everyone around you has a fancy title, lacking one grates. So the State Department's Office of Protocol notes, with some resignation: ""The titles 'congressman' and 'congresswoman' are becoming more common in social usage, but are not, strictly speaking, correct forms of address."" Retaining an aura of power has obvious benefits--including being able to trade on that power. Hickey says the military is particularly sensitive to title abuse in the business world. He explains that after 20 years of service a retired officer is entitled to use his or her former rank socially, but they are not supposed to use that title in business if it can be misconstrued. A former colonel can call himself that on his daughter's wedding invitation, for instance, but if he's employed by Boeing, he's supposed to be Mr. when he's on the job. Although, Hickey adds, ""Around Washington it's very typical for defense contractors to encourage employees to use their rank."" Hickey says the best rule for any ex-official is, ""Who are you at this moment?"" If you're a former senator who's now a lobbyist on K Street, you should work your contacts as a private citizen, not as ""senator."" (As for the use of ""the Honorable,"" Letitia Baldrige says it is properly affixed for life to those who have served high office at the federal, state, or local level. But the important nuance is that ""the Honorable"" is a way for others to describe the former official--in an introduction or on a place card, say. It's not how exes should style themselves.) In her book on American manners and their origin, Star Spangled Manners, Judith Martin writes that despite Americans' reputation as being brash and uncouth, ""we have had an enormous and beneficial influence on the way people everywhere behave."" Among our good work is modernizing the way people are addressed, ""so as to minimize the differences between the weak and the powerful."" We diminish that accomplishment if we treat the once-powerful as if they have ascended to a peerage. As an exemplar of American unpretentiousness, look to John Quincy Adams. During his remarkable and distinguished career he was our ambassador to the Netherlands, Prussia, Russia, and the United Kingdom. He was a senator, secretary of state, and president. After he finished his presidency, he was elected to the House of Representatives, where he vigorously opposed slavery. Joseph Wheelan, author of Mr. Adams's Last Crusade, about Adams' last 17 years in the House--he died in the Capitol-- says that during that entire time this man of many titles was known simply as ""Mr. Adams.""* Correction, March 20, 2012: This article originally misspelled Joseph Wheelan's last name.

""He doesn't have a core,"" Santorum said on CBS's This Morning. ""He's been on both sides of almost every single issue in the past 10 years."" Does that sound familiar? If you wonder where you've heard that before, it came from President Obama's top strategist David Axelrod, who first said Romney lacked a ""core"" last October. It was then repeated by David Plouffe, a senior adviser to Obama who ran his 2008 campaign. The fact that Santorum is now cribbing from the Democratic playbook is precisely why some Republicans fear a long slog of a primary will damage their chances to beat Barack Obama. Not only is Santorum potentially weakening the likely nominee, but by parroting the administration's critique he lends weight to their claims. If Romney is their opponent, the Obama team will be ready to hit ""replay"" on the Santorum clip this fall. And that isn't the only Democratic talking point the Santorum campaign is lifting. His chief strategist, John Brabender, is now making an issue out of Romney's private-sector career. ""While Mitt Romney was at Bain Capital, almost one out of every four companies they were involved in either went bankrupt or out of business,"" Brabender said on MSNBC this morning. A couple of months ago, during the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, it was Newt Gingrich who first gave life to this line of argument. Back then, Santorum wasn't a fan of that tactic. ""It's this hostile rhetoric, which unfortunately--I don't want to stand here and be a defender of Mitt Romney, but unfortunately even some in our party now, even some running for president, will engage in with respect to capitalism,"" Santorum said to nearly 200 people in a town hall meeting in West Columbia, S.C. ""It is bad enough for Barack Obama to blame folks in business for causing problems in this country. It's one other thing for Republicans to join him."" The Romney campaign has been facing charges over his constancy since he became a presidential candidate. They've argued that on the pillars of his life--his faith and his family--he has been more solid than any other candidate, which is true. They also respond to Santorum's claim of congenital flip-flopping with an embarrassing flip-flop of Santorum's own making. Today, the former Pennsylvania senator says Romney has no core, but last election Santorum made the exact opposite case. ""Nobody puts words in my mouth,"" Santorum said in 2008. ""If you want a conservative as the nominee of this party, you must vote for Mitt Romney."" Santorum is reaching into the Democratic playbook because he is taking a pounding on the airwaves in Illinois, where Romney is vastly outspending him. The Romney campaign is running a television ad that calls Santorum an ""economic lightweight"" and points out that he has no executive experience.  A new radio reminds Republicans thinking about the general election that Santorum took a drubbing when he lost his Senate race in 2006. The latest American Research Group poll from Illinois shows Santorum with just 30 percent to Romney's 44 percent. If Romney wins by that margin and picks up a large share of the state's 69 delegates, it will kick off a good stretch for him. Of the nine remaining contests through the end of April, he is likely to win six--and maybe as many as eight--of them. Santorum's can count on winning Pennsylvania but little else over these weeks. If there's a relationship between the odds Santorum faces and the sharpness of his attacks, April is going to be a cruel month for Republicans."	Is Santorum Becoming the GOP's Worst Nightmare?

They say its governments are dysfunctional, its welfare states are wasteful, its war-weary populations effeminate and, worst of all, its health care systems socialist. But perhaps the most traditional foil to America's superiority is the Old World's fixation on class. In places like Europe, the standard story goes, a combination of social snobbery and a stagnant economy limits the prospects of ordinary people. In America, on the other hand, class simply doesn't exist. Here, anybody can start at the bottom and work their way up to the top. These days, though, politicians are no longer so confident about the American Dream. Questions about America's class system--and its strain on the country's social fabric--have entered the national conversation in a way unlike any time in recent memory. Occupy Wall Street grew popular in good part by contrasting the ""99 percent"" of Americans who've suffered over these lean years to the ""1 percent"" who seemed to be growing richer even in the midst of a deep recession. This inspired liberals to voice their worries about the widening wealth gap and falling rates of economic mobility more stridently than they'd dared to in decades. As Barack Obama said in a speech in Osawatomie, Kan., rising ""inequality gives lie to the promise at the heart of America: that this is the place where you can make it if you try."" America's increasingly visible class divisions have been fodder for conservatives as well. Mitt Romney claims to fear that Obama's ""class warfare"" is tearing America apart. For all its faults, Charles Murray's new book Coming Apart takes seriously the decaying state of the white working-class. And Rick Santorum was honest enough to compare the worsening condition of America's economic have-nots to their counterparts in Europe. As Santorum pointed out, economic ""mobility in Europe"" is now greater than in the United States. All this talk can be salutary. It's high time for Americans to have an open conversation about the reality of their own class divisions. For too long, excessive pride in the notion of a ""land of opportunity"" has masked the fact that too few tickets to the top are getting punched--and that the lives of those who are left behind are getting tougher. But if some politicians and commentators now go so far as to claim that America's class system is as rigid as that of Europe, they simply can't recognize an old-fashioned social hierarchy when they see one. It is true that economic mobility is lower in America than it is in most parts of Europe. But the class system remains much more static and entrenched in, say, Britain than it does in the United States. If this sounds like a paradox, that's only because, for most Americans, class is largely a matter of money. If you punch a time clock, you're working class--even if your ancestors came over on the Mayflower. If your portfolio makes more than you do, you're upper class--even if you were born into abject poverty. By definition, an American who is born poor but attains vast wealth sheds his original class label along the way. In Britain, by contrast, class is about a lot more than the size of your bank account. If you live in poverty, you could still be upper class--a member of the landed gentry who has gambled away his estate is no less an aristocrat for being hard up. And if you earn a lot of money, that still doesn't make you an aristocrat--if you weren't born into the right family, you may be no more than nouveau riche. Class doesn't necessitate money, and money certainly can't buy class. To understand the difference between America's and Europe's class system, we therefore have to make a distinction between economic and social mobility. Economic mobility in the United States has, according to a host of recent studies, now fallen below European levels. Forty-two percent of American men raised in the bottom fifth of incomes never manage to move up. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, how much a dad earns is highly predictive of how much his son will earn: High-income fathers in the United States are able to transmit 47 percent of their above-average earnings to their sons; in Denmark, a father's high earnings boost a son's income by no more than 16 percent. America's educational system favors the rich even more flagrantly: According to another OECD report, a teenager's performance in science classes is more dependent on his parents' socioeconomic background in the United States than anywhere else in the developed world. But the promise of social mobility remains much more real in the United States. In America, it is still possible for a lucky few to transcend their social station over the course of a lifetime. In Europe, even the most successful self-made men forever retain the mark of their lowly birth. Consider the contrast between Bill Clinton and Margaret Thatcher. Clinton, whose father died in a car accident months before he was born, was initially raised by his grandparents, who operated a grocery store in Hope, Ark. Later he moved to Hot Springs, where his stepfather, a gambler and alcoholic, co-owned a modest car dealership. Thatcher comes from a rather similar background. Born in the distinctly unfashionable town of Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, she was raised above a grocery store owned by her father. Against the odds, both Clinton and Thatcher rose to become leaders of their respective nations. But whereas Clinton is now unquestionably a member of America's upper class, Britain's upper class still regards Thatcher as the ""greengrocer's daughter""--somebody who feebly tried to mask her humble origins by taking elocution lessons. They may have thought she was an excellent prime minister--they may have even voted for her--but that doesn't mean they think she belongs. By distinguishing between social and economic mobility, we can remind ourselves what's great about America--and yet acknowledge that it has a lot to learn from Europe. America's class system may be less snobby, but there are tangible reasons why Europe has higher levels of economic mobility. From much better public schools in bad neighborhoods to much greater financial support for children born into poverty, most European countries simply do more to ensure that everyone has a real chance to succeed. American politicians have finally started to acknowledge this point. But most of them still ignore another, equally important lesson. It is that mobility, important though it is in a society that aspires to be meritocratic, should never become the be-all and end-all of economic policy. As John Stuart Mill once pointed out, ""if some Nero or Domitian were to require a hundred persons to run a race for their lives, on the condition that the fifty or twenty who came in hindmost should be put to death, it would not be any diminution of the injustice that the strongest or nimblest would [...] be certain to escape."" In other words, if average Americans have come to feel that the game is somehow rigged against them, it may be because it is harder for them to imagine their children winning the desperate race to the top. Another reason, though, is that the prospects for those who aren't quick enough have gone from bad to worse. What's truly frightening is not the supposed fact that America's class system has become the same as Europe's: It is that, even as a successful few have amassed vast fortunes, so many more have fallen hopelessly behind."

Have voters seriously contemplated the chaos that Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are promising at the Republican convention in Tampa? These two upstarts are planning a messy delegate fight, full of anger and recriminations, under the bright lights of the Tampa Bay Times Forum and in primetime. The GOP convention is supposed to be four days of purposeful choreography highlighting the array of Republican wonders and Barack Obama's many shortcomings. What people will see instead is a food fight. Stop it now, before it's too late! Perhaps things will get exciting, say Romney's rivals, but if the GOP nominates Mitt Romney, that smooth, seamless Tampa convention will be a nighttime sleep aid. Only by nominating a candidate of conviction and passion will Republicans rise to beat Obama in November. Whether a contested convention will be a horror show or the beginning of a unified march on Obama is now a part of the daily face-off between Romney and the remaining Republican candidates. It is a debate in which the arguments match the candidates. Mitt Romney stands for order and careful planning to avoid the threat of wrinkled jeans or blemishes. Santorum and Gingrich are all snort and shove, spoiling for a fight. Modern-day conventions are centerpiece moments for parties to communicate with Americans. To present a diverse looking crowd to the television cameras, delegates are selected from as broad a palette as possible. Prime-time speakers are picked to send a unified and appealing message to swing voters. If there is a brawl, all of this is threatened. ""If the Republican convention is a mish mash of conspiracy theories and backroom dealings and competition back and forth, and we wake up the morning after we've nominated a candidate and then have to start the campaign against Obama, we're going to start out in a deep, deep hole,"" said  Romney backer and former Congressman Vin Weber in an interview I did with him for CBS's Face to Face. Romney's campaign is trying to scare Republicans straight. Think about 1976, they say, the last time Republicans had a contested convention. It was dramatic when Ford muscled out Ronald Reagan, but in the end, the Republicans lost to Jimmy Carter. This time, a Republican Thunderdome convention will leave the party smoldering and with only eight weeks to repair the damage and present a unified argument for replacing Barack Obama. The Santorum campaign says that Romney is emphasizing his delegate count to hide the unpleasant fact that Santorum is winning and attracting excitement. ""It feels like Charlie Sheen, who, when he was being fired, kept talking about winning,"" says John Brabender, Rick Santorum's top strategist. ""What I would suggest is that Mitt Romney grow up and concentrate on winning the nomination, not trying to stop the process. It's starting to embarrass the party."" You're embarrassing the party! No, you're embarrassing the party! Santorum isn't even running a real campaign, Romney's allies insist. He's just a man with a suitcase. (He can't even afford sleeves for his sweaters!) ""This election is going to be about competence and the ability to do the job rather than hire an entertainer or whatever,"" said New York Jets owner Woody Johnson at a Romney fundraiser Wednesday. Webber said something similar: ""He's a candidate running from state to state trying to make this emotional appeal, and it's working with some people. It certainly will not beat President Obama in the fall."" Those remarks echo Romney's claim before the Michigan primary that suggested Santorum was winning votes by pandering to the rabble: ""It's very easy to excite the base with incendiary comments. We've seen throughout the campaign if you're willing to say really outrageous things that are accusative, attacking of President Obama, that you're going to jump up in the polls. I'm not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support."" The message is tactical--and not terribly inspiring. It says nothing about the promise of the future or how Romney will put the country back on track. It doesn't matter, says one member of the Romney camp. The governor is already inspiring voters on the key issue of the day: the economy. He consistently is the choice of the plurality who say that issue is the most important. He also destroys the competition when it comes to who people think can defeat Obama. These are the issues that matter in the end, and he is making headway with them. Talking about the reality of delegate math does not obliterate Romney's other positive qualities. But it does something else: the argument coming out of the Romney camp reinforces Santorum's claim that he is the guy with the grit and determination upsetting those who are obsessed with doing things the orderly and usual way. ""We are breaking all the rules,"" Santorum said last week. ""And folks who like to play by the establishment rules, they just feel really nervous about us."" That's one thing both sides agree on: The establishment is nervous. What's not clear is whether the jitters are coming from losing power in the party or losing a shot at winning the White House."

The Pennsylvania senator won the primaries in Alabama and Mississippi. He is now the leading conservative alternative to Mitt Romney, though Newt Gingrich promised to take his fight all the way to the Republican convention. Mitt Romney, who came in third in both states, is approaching the qualities of some cursed mythological figure who gets stronger on the outside while his insides decay: With each contest, Romney gains delegates but appears to get weaker. In Alabama, Santorum won with 35 percent of the vote. Gingrich and Romney both earned 29 percent. In Mississippi, Santorum captured 33 percent of the ballots to Gingrich's 31 percent and Romney's 30 percent. The Republican presidential race is holding the pattern that first emerged on Super Tuesday: It remains a race of mathematics versus a movement. Though Romney lost the marquee contests of the evening, he was expected to do well in Hawaii and American Samoa, perhaps giving him the most delegates of any candidate for the evening. The math is still on his side: Romney has won more states, has more delegates, and hundreds of thousands more Republicans have voted for him.  But the momentum and energy of the night belonged to Santorum who continues to captivate the grassroots heart of the party. ""Ordinary people across this country can defy the odds,"" said Santorum about the message of the evening and the message of his campaign. ""This campaign is about ordinary folks doing extraordinary things, kinda like America."" Being president requires grit, perseverance, and drive and, by those qualities, Santorum has proven himself for the job. Romney once again vastly outspent him in the contests. Santorum also faced a persistent challenge from Newt Gingrich who was playing on the familiar ideological and cultural turf of the South. Santorum won by capturing his normal mix of evangelical voters and strong conservatives, but his win wasn't rock solid. In Alabama, 36 percent of voters said defeating Barack Obama was their No. 1 priority, and only 15 percent said Rick Santorum was the best man for that job. Fifty-one percent believed Romney was best equipped to win in the general election. In Mississippi, 39 percent chose defeating Obama as the top quality they sought in a candidate, and Santorum lost by 24 points to Romney on that score, with only 22 percent of the voters picking him. In the same state, 49 percent said they thought Romney could defeat Obama. Half as many said the same of Santorum. In Alabama, when voters were asked who could best handle an international crisis, Santorum received the lowest marks of the three candidates with 21 percent to Romney's 28 percent and Gingrich's 40 percent. Santorum's argument for why he will take the convention by storm in Tampa, Fla., relies on his emerging position as the conservative juggernaut. But if the majority of voters have doubts that he can beat Obama or handle an international crisis, it will be hard for him to thunder into the convention as the obvious choice. The Romney campaign had hoped for a win in Mississippi and a strong showing in Alabama. This is the downside of lurching forward for the knockout punch; sometimes you land on your face. In reality, though, no one should have expected him to do well in these Southern states. The Republican voters that dominate Alabama and Mississippi are precisely the kind with whom he has the biggest problem winning--evangelicals and those who identify themselves as very conservative. Eighty-four percent of Mississippi voters identify themselves as evangelicals. On Tuesday, there may have been more religious conservatives in voting booths than you'll ever find in church pews on Sunday. Still, Mitt has a problem. As Newt Gingrich put it, ""If you're the front-runner and you keep coming in third, you're not much of a front-runner."" He has a point. Though both of Romney's presidential campaigns have stressed the word strong in  speeches and television ads, he is increasingly being hounded by the opposite word: weak. Indeed, it may follow him all the way to Tampa. Bill Clinton managed to revive himself in 1992, but he was a natural politician and he had a personal story that more people found appealing. Mitt Romney can't be both the Republican front-runner and the Comeback Kid. The Santorum campaign wants Gingrich out of the race. Though Santorum's bid remains fragile, he has consistently beaten Gingrich. He would have a better shot at beating Mitt Romney in future states if he was the only alternative, since he would win a larger share of Gingrich's voters (though he certainly wouldn't win all of them). ""The time is now for conservatives to pull together,"" Santorum said in his victory speech, calling a two-man race the best chance to win the election. Gingrich, who is the weakest of the three candidates, boasted that he was the only one who could beat Obama in a debate, an argument he says will help him convince unbound delegates at the convention. It's a big long shot and Gingrich's rationale for staying in the Republican primary rests on soft logic. On Tuesday night, he boasted about his viability because, he said, he won delegates despite losing. It was precisely the same argument Romney made--and that Gingrich claimed revealed Romney as weak. The next big test for Romney's long slog to the nomination comes in Illinois. It's a no-excuses state. The southern part of the state, which is rural and conservative, favors Santorum, but not so much that Romney can pretend it's like Alabama or Mississippi. He's got crucial advantages in the Chicago suburbs. Illinois is a state like Michigan or Ohio, where Romney's financial and organizational strength should give him the edge. If Santorum were to pull off a win, it would be a state where he could legitimately say he made inroads into the Romney base, something he has failed to do anywhere so far. By the end of the night, the best thing the Romney campaign could say came directly from  Obama's campaign headquarters. Jim Messina, who is running the incumbent's re-election efforts sent out an email saying that according to a new poll, if the general election were held today, Obama would lose to Mitt Romney. The Romney campaign simply forwarded the email and asked donors to contribute.  Romney probably wishes that the election could be held today. If nothing else, it would mean he'd finally won the nomination."	Could Santorum's Southern Victories Be the Start of Something Big?	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/the_complex_delegate_math_for_winning_the_republican_nomination_make_mitt_romney_a_near_certain_winner_.html	"When they hand out the bunting, funny hats, and elephant pins at Republican Party headquarters, no one talks about the math test. For the next several weeks and perhaps months, GOP politics are going to center around a complex debate about delegates that will remind us all of those math problems you hated in grade school: If Rick leaves Philadelphia headed for Tampa on a train powered by coal his grandfather mined and Mitt drives his Mustang to the same destination, how many attacks on the elite media will it take Newt to stop them? All campaigns are spinning the delegate math to their advantage. Mitt Romney's team is arguing that his opponents cannot win enough delegates to overtake Romney's delegate lead. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are arguing that they have a shot at accumulating enough delegates to surpass the weak front-runner and steal the nomination. Both sides are spinning fantasies, but as might be expected, Romney's fantasy is closer to reality. He is offering something closer to historical fiction whereas Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich's tales are more like science fiction. To understand what's going on, it's best to think of two dramas, one that takes place in the primaries and caucuses to come and one that takes place at the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla. First Drama: It's almost impossible for Mitt Romney's rivals to catch him This is a hard truth for Santorum and Gingrich supporters, but independent Republican experts and delegate guru Josh Putnam of Davidson College say it's so. That was the view before Santorum's exciting showing on Super Tuesday and it's even more true after. Super Tuesday is a good example of the split dynamic that now rules in the Republican contests. One story on Super Tuesday centered on the dramatic moment in Ohio: Romney narrowly defeated Rick Santorum. He couldn't win over the most conservative members of his party. Conclusion: The race is close! The other dynamic that night took place in Virginia: Romney won 63 delegates and his opponents won nothing. On Super Tuesday, Romney won six of 10 states. He won 65 percent of the delegates and hundreds of thousands of votes. Conclusion: The race is not close! Unfortunately for Gingrich and Santorum, the delegate math is what matters in winning the nomination and Romney has a huge lead. Romney now has 396 delegates--748 away from the number needed to win. Santorum is in second with an estimated 146. Newt Gingrich has 97 and Ron Paul comes in last with 38. In order to reach the required 1,144, Romney needs to win about half of the remaining delegates, while Santorum would need to win two-thirds of them. But what if the drama overtakes the math? What if Rick Santorum keeps winning? Romney can't keep losing, can he? The answer is that Santorum won't win every contest, no matter how much momentum he picks up after possible wins in Alabama and Mississippi next Tuesday. The states he does win won't provide him with a big enough margin to overcome Romney's existing delegate lead. It's going to be a long slog that batters Romney, but the math is his life preserver. Here's why: Proportionality: Delegates are awarded proportionally in 31 of 35 future contests, which means winning a state doesn't mean you get all its delegates and losing a state doesn't mean you don't get any delegates. Mitt Romney lost Tennessee but still picked up 14 delegates. Rick Santorum won 29, giving him only a net 15 in his race to close the more than 200 delegate gap. Not all states are created equal: To catch the front-runner, Santorum or Gingrich will have to do well in winner-take-all states. There are just four of them and they're all favorable to Romney: Utah (where there is a large Mormon population and Romney helped turn around the Olympics), New Jersey (Gov. Chris Christie has endorsed Romney and the electorate is made up of his kind of voter), Delaware (the electorate is also favorable), and Washington, D.C. (Santorum isn't even on the ballot). Santorum also didn't make the ballot in parts of Illinois, which deprives him a chance at 10 delegates. Other states like California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York have electorates that are dominated by moderate voters with whom Romney does well. Romney's rivals are too weak: If they hope to overtake Romney, Santorum or Gingrich would not just have to win future contests, they'd have to dominate them in a way no candidate has dominated any contest so far in this election. They'd have to steal huge chunks out of the Romney coalition--converting people who like Romney a lot and think he's most electable. There is no evidence in any of the races so far that Gingrich or Santorum could do that. Mitt Romney may be weak, but his opponents are weaker. Drama 2: Mayhem in Tampa Mitt Romney's challengers know that they're not going to catch him on the delegate count in advance of the convention--though they aren't broadcasting that idea. Their battle plan rests on keeping him from winning the 1,144 he needs to get the nomination and then zooming ahead of him in Tampa. To do this, Santorum or Gingrich have two tasks: win enough remaining races to get within striking distance of Romney and then sweet talk however many delegates they need to make up the difference between the ones they've won and the ones they need to get to 1,144. Romney is still in a good position to capture the magic 1,144. For Gingrich or Santorum to draw close enough to him, one of them must emerge as the sole conservative alternative. That way, the last conservative standing can suck up all the possible anti-Romney votes (and delegates). It will also help them win states outright, which will matter when momentum and public perception become a part of the big sales pitch in Tampa. When the feuding Republican Party arrives in Tampa, if Romney has not locked up 1,114 delegates, the candidate in second place will embark upon a charm offensive to convince unpledged delegates and party officials that he should be the nominee. There are two main audiences that need convincing: The first are the unbound delegates, and the second is the Committee on Contests. Let's start with the committee. This is the body that meets in Tampa a week before the convention to adjudicate disputes over the delegates that were awarded during the election season. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are likely to focus on the states of Florida and Arizona. Romney believes all the delegates in those states go to him because they are winner-take-all states. His challengers argue that the delegates in those states should be awarded proportionally because those states lost their winner-take-all status when they jumped ahead in the Republican Party primary calendar and held their contests in January and February. ""This idea that Mitt Romney is going to get 50 delegates out of Florida, that's just simply false,"" Santorum said on Friday. ""All these delegate counts, they are shadows."" If the Romney challenger convinces the committee, Romney will still get the majority of delegates in those states, but he'll lose some depending on how his opponent performed. The committee is not the biggest hunting ground for delegates. In Florida, a successful bid would give Gingrich 16 more delegates and shrink Romney's total by 27 to 23. The other 11 delegates would be split among Rick Santorum and Ron Paul. But the committee is a place where lawyers can debate rules and the terms of debate are at least fixed by common language, culture, and custom. None of that is true in the other venue where Gingrich or Santorum will have to make his case: the 513 members of the unbound delegate pool. When advisers to Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum talk about the unbound delegate pool, they make it sound like it's a huge group of swing voters ready to be persuaded by the best argument. That's not quite right: Most are technically free to do as they please, but they are a Romney-leaning group. If you were to think of this group as an electorate, they are more like the voters of Florida or Michigan--predisposed to liking Romney and more susceptible to his arguments--than they are the voters of South Carolina. Who are these people? Among the more than 500 unbound delegates, there are various subgroups. First are the Republican ""superdelegates,"" 117 party officials most of whom are free to vote their conscience. Then there are 130 unbound delegates from states like Colorado, where they can choose to be bound at their state conventions, which have yet to be held. The remaining 266 or so are unbound, but that doesn't mean they are ripe for the picking. Some of these delegates will be pro-Romney people picked at their party conventions. So, for example, when Iowa Republicans meet in the summer to pick the delegates to go to the national convention, the 12 that go to Romney (of the 25 total) will be die-hard Romney fans. When they get to Tampa, they're going to be a hard bunch to convince to abandon their man. The pool of persuadable delegates is not only smaller than Romney's rivals would like to admit, but there's also the matter of what arguments are going to persuade them. Despite Romney's perceived weakness at the moment, he is beating Santorum by 11 points in the Gallup poll. He is consistently seen as the most electable in national and state polls by as much as 40 points over Santorum. He is also considered the candidate who can handle the issue of the economy better than anyone else. He will arrive at the convention having won more states, more delegates, and hundreds of thousands of more votes. He did none of this through trickery. Santorum and Gingrich will have to make a case built on ideology and momentum. They will argue that Romney doesn't represent the base of the party--the Tea Party stalwarts and those who identify themselves as ""very conservative"" in exit polls. But the base of the party is not the whole party. Unless Santorum or Gingrich can prove in the coming contests that they have appeal outside the one-third of the party that loves them, they are going to be making a case that the loudest part of the party is more important than the largest part. If Mitt Romney doesn't get to 1,144 delegates before the convention, his opponents have an opening with a contested convention. But pulling off a win would still be a long shot. In 1976, at the GOP convention, Gerald Ford went to Kansas City without the required number of delegates to secure the nomination. Ronald Reagan fought right up until the end and got pretty close--delegates even broke their pledges to back Reagan--but ultimately the Gipper lost. Neither of Romney's opponents is likely to be that close by convention time. Also, neither of Romney's opponents are as popular as Ronald Reagan (which is part of the problem with the entire field). These underdog victory scenarios are implausible, but Romney's challengers have good reason to keep to this unlikely course, because the rules for delegate allocation are confusing. Want another example? What if Gingrich wants to throw his delegates to Santorum or vice versa? Well, it depends on whether he ends or suspends his campaign and the particular rules of the state from which he was awarded the delegates. All of this complexity means it's hard for Romney to make an airtight case that the math is on his side unless every voter wants to sit for a 25-minute PowerPoint presentation. And, to be fair, this has been an unpredictable campaign in which things we thought we knew are no longer the case. (Unless, Nostradamus, you predicted the Missouri nonbinding straw poll would help Santorum skyrocket.) The ""rules"" would seem to favor Romney, but what if 20,000 people surrounded the arena in Tampa shouting, ""We want Rick!"" That might encourage delegates to break ranks, make up new rules, or find some other way. ""We are breaking all the rules and folks who like to play by the establishment rules, they just feel really nervous about us,"" said Santorum on Friday. ""That's why everybody is trying to angle us and saying he can't do this. ... You know what? If I listened to what people said ... it would be an act of God for Rick Santorum to be here in March back in December. Well here I am."" In a party in which the establishment is fighting with its populist wing, it's also dangerous for any party official to look like he is shutting out the most loyal, passionate, and vocal supporters. If you've read this far, you deserve some kind of prize. For the party that hates the tax code so much, the Republican delegate apportionment process makes filling out your 1040 seem easy by comparison. If nothing else, like the tax code, the process makes a person feel like she's being snookered out of something. If all of this is still being sorted out in Florida's summer heat, delaying the chance for the party to take on the incumbent president, the Tampa Bay Times Forum will be the perfect location. The inaugural event for that venue was a circus."	Why Santorum and Gingrich's Chances at Winning the Nomination Don't Add Up	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Christie', 'Davidson']	['god']

What Worries GOP Voters About the Candidate They Like Best?	[]	[]
11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/the_deep_south_is_irrelevant_in_the_2012_republican_party_primary_.html	"KNOXVILLE, Tenn.--Shortly after 9:30 on Saturday, Lloyd Daugherty sat down, rested his cane on his chair, and retold his Ronald Reagan story. The Tennessee Conservative Union, which Daugherty has run since the 1980s, had wrapped up its annual banquet, and its members were slowly finding their way to the hospitality suite, so Daugherty had some down time. ""President Reagan was speaking in Washington, and he invited me backstage,"" said Daugherty. ""He liked to talk to people after the events, take the pulse. I'd been running his campaign in Tennessee. He asked me, 'How do people think I'm doing?' I told him. 'Down where I come from, they think you're the best president since Jefferson Davis.' He said, 'Jefferson Davis? That's a great compliment.' "" When he delivered Reagan's lines, he waved his arms; he was wearing presidential seal cufflinks, given to him by the 40th president. ""A couple of months later, he's in Tennessee,"" recalls Daugherty ""He remembers my comment. And he asks, 'Am I still the best president since Jefferson Davis?' I say, 'Yes, sir, I think you are.' And he says: 'Well, I ain't lost a war yet!' "" It was a nostalgic night. When representatives of the four GOP presidential campaigns showed up to speak, two of them quoted Reagan at length. The Conservative of the Year award, handed out during dinner, was a plaque imprinted with the faces of three smiling, departed Republicans: Reagan, Barry Goldwater, and Jesse Helms. Mitt Romney will never be among them. ""If he wins,"" said Daugherty, ""the South is still going to vote, I think, for the Republican candidate. What it does, I think, is hurt the Republican Party down-ticket. It's probably not going to cause Obama to pick up any Southern states, but it is going to hold down enthusiasm and fundraising in the South."" Two days later, Daugherty introduced Gingrich at a rally in Chattanooga, and reminded his crowd that Ronald Reagan beat George H.W. Bush in Tennessee ""with all the money against him, with every congressman but one against him."" The next day, Super Tuesday, Gingrich would win only 24 percent of the vote in Tennessee and come in third place. Mitt Romney, the first Republican front-runner since 1996 with no real ties to the South, would lap the field for delegates. You have to drive the DeLorean far, far back in time to find another Republican primary where the South was this irrelevant. From 1980 to 2008, in every competitive race, the eventual GOP nominee had minted his crown in South Carolina. In 2008, John McCain got at least 30 percent of the vote in every southern Super Tuesday state except Mike Huckabee's Arkansas. He lost by only 2 percent in Georgia, 3 percent in Tennessee, and 4 percent in Alabama. Back to 2012. Mitt Romney has lost every southern state thus far by at least 9 percent. Put together, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina have 300 counties. Romney has won nine of them, all urban or wealthy suburban areas. As CNN's Peter Hamby first noticed, Romney actually came in third place in most Appalachian counties. Romney won Florida, but he won only three counties in the panhandle, the part most like the rest of the South. Can Romney actually win the nomination if he bombs out in the South? He may need to. The next primaries, on Tuesday, are for Alabama's 50 delegates and Mississippi's 40 delegates. There hasn't been much polling in those states, but they slant heavily toward Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Both candidates are campaigning in the Deep South today and tomorrow. Mitt Romney hasn't scheduled any Alabama or Mississippi stops. The only mention of either state from his campaign today came in an afternoon email, announcing the endorsement of a former Alabama governor. Romney's opponents take pride in his inability to win the South. ""He'll either learn to win here,"" said Newt Gingrich after a Tennessee rally, ""or he won't be the nominee."" At Gingrich's Super Tuesday Party, his former spokesman-turned-super PAC honcho Rick Tyler predicted wins in the Deep South and in Texas, when that state's up in May. ""Mitt Romney's false ads don't work in the South,"" he said. ""The whole South turned Republican under Speaker Gingrich. They didn't forget that."" Watching Romney compete for Southern votes is not like watching Gingrich or Santorum. I attended one of the only two Southern stops Romney made before Super Tuesday, a Sunday rally at a high school outside of Knoxville. His crowds didn't look like Gingrich's. Most of Romney's voters were wearing blazers or nice dresses. (The ones I talked to weren't headed to evening service, either.) Gingrich's Tennessee voters weren't the type to don button down shirts just to see a politician speak. When I'd ask them why they liked Gingrich, I heard that he understood the South--the culture, the conservatism, the history. ""We know what it's like to be attacked in an illegal war,"" said Hank Barkalow, a retired military pilot. He was referring to the Civil War. You won't hear that at a Romney rally. His voters chatted amiably about how nice the candidate's family was, and how much business sense he had. They sang along to the state's theme song, ""Rocky Top,"" then helped Romney along as he tried to remember another song. ""This place always has a special meaning in my heart,"" he said at an event in Knox County on Sunday, ""because when I grew up, I was thinking about Davy Crockett, all right? I grew up watching--oh, what was it called--oh, Disneyland! And how did it go? Davy, Davy Crockett. Born on a mountaintop in Tennessee. Greenest state in the land of the free. Raised in the woods so he knew every tree. Killed himself a bear, when he was only three. Davy, Davy Crockett!"" Romney's boosters cheered for his memory and Disney-fueled state pride. ""Obviously, the leaves aren't on the trees, but there's some green out there. This is the greenest state in the land of the free, with very good people, and very good values!"" Romney was proving his connection to the South with a songbook. In the end, it didn't take--he would lose Knox County to Rick Santorum. Even before the votes came in, though, it was clear that the best he could hope for was a non-humiliating, delegate-winning loss. His endorsers, including Tennessee's governor and three Republican members of the congressional delegation, didn't quite understand it. ""There's this perception that he's not conservative, but you couldn't have a man that's more family-oriented than this man!"" said Rep. Phil Roe, standing over to the side after Romney's speech. Without any prodding, he started to talk about Romney's Mormonism. ""They don't drink, smoke--I don't know what they do for fun."" A voter walked over to Roe to ask him something. ""Do Mormons drink any caffeine?"" ""No, I don't think they can drink caffeine,"" said Roe. ""These folks serve for two years. When they get out of college they give two years to their church. So I think it's more of a perception. When you look into his heart and soul, he's a conservative."" This is part of why Romney's losing in the South. Too many Southerners don't think he's conservative. Some of them--and some will admit it--cannot get past his Mormonism. ""Let's face it, we're stubborn,"" explained Lloyd Daugherty. ""We're independent. We don't like to be told what to do, especially from other parts of the country."" In 2012, they might not have a choice."

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/gay_marriage_doesn_t_harm_children_but_the_facts_don_t_seem_to_matter_.html	"Last month's news that the majority of births to American women under 30 now occur outside of marriage will likely confirm for social conservatives that marriage itself is becoming a relic, with major consequences for society. It's one of the main reasons they cite for opposing anything that might alter society's image of the institution, like calling a same-sex union a marriage. If marriage includes the union of two people of the same sex, they worry it will be unrecognizable to many Americans, who will stop taking it seriously enough to tie the knot. Yet when you look at the new research from Child Trends, the group that released the latest data, you actually find evidence against the suggestion that same-sex marriage undermines the health of marriage more generally. Here's why: The conservative argument against the freedom to marry, newly resonant in an election year, is primarily a norms argument. Maggie Gallagher, who many believe has done more than anyone to block the freedom to marry through her writing, fundraising, and founding of activist groups, says she is not anti-gay, just pro-marriage--and concerned about child welfare. ""Children need a mom and a dad,"" she says whenever she can. To hear her tell it, marriage needs protecting not as some abstract moral principle but because marriage is a fragile but vital institution that society depends on to make adults more responsible to their biological children (and to each other). Government sanctions the institution as a unique, procreative bond in order to reinforce this norm, and those who identify as a ""husband"" or ""wife"" are more likely to honor their commitments. ""After gay marriage,"" she said in a recent interview, ""marriage will not be about that anymore. We will not have an institution dedicated to putting together mothers and fathers and children."" This argument is grossly imprecise at best. After all, infertile couples, post-menopausal women, and those who choose not to procreate can still wed, so long as they're straight. The only way to make sense of the argument is to assume that it's really saying this: Most straight people so dislike gay people that they'd choose not to marry rather than share the honor with gays. But according to the Child Trends research, the only demographic of young mothers who resisted the out-of-wedlock birth trend are college graduates, and this educated demographic is the one most likely to support same-sex marriage. If Gallagher's assumptions were right--that acceptance of same-sex marriage leads to less marrying--then these supporters of same-sex marriage would be the least likely to marry, not the most. There has never been any evidence that same-sex marriage, or parenting by lesbians and gays, hurts children--and mountains of data say they don't. Nor has there ever been any evidence that acceptance of same-sex marriage causes a decline in willingness to marry. The historical timeline works against this argument anyway: marital rates declined, and divorce rates increased, beginning in the 1960s, over three decades before any jurisdiction in the modern world held a legal gay wedding. Though the ""harms"" arguments about gay equality have consistently been falsified, many of those who make them cling tenaciously to their anti-gay positions. Is there any hope of reaching these folks in a rational discourse about whether gay people ought to enjoy equal legal--and indeed moral--standing in our society? New research from Yale's Cultural Cognition Project offers some promising, if unsurprising, suggestions for gay rights advocates. Using focus groups and national surveys, researchers were able to correlate negative views about gay people with an exaggerated perception of the risks involved in granting them equality. It turned out that people will disbelieve new information--such as the fact that having gay or lesbian parents does not harm kids--unless they're confident that absorbing it will not threaten their values. (The same goes for cultural liberals, of course, who are also prone to such cognitive bias. The Yale researchers cited a similar unwillingness to absorb factual information among opponents of nuclear energy, for example.) Yale's team suggests increasing open-mindedness by presenting people with new information in ways that conform with values they already hold dear. Research commissioned by the Third Way, a moderate think tank in Washington, illustrates how this might look. A team of research psychologists conducted in-depth interviews with members of the ""moveable middle,"" or those considered open to supporting gay equality but not yet fully there. They used psychological tools to identify their subjects' emotional states and concerns around issues of gay equality. What their research revealed were subconscious anxieties around what they perceive to be a world spinning out of control, a feeling exacerbated by a sense that new understandings of old institutions are being forced upon them. Some may oppose same-sex marriage in an effort to seize control and bolster values they see as besieged. Third Way recommends reassuring opponents of same-sex marriage that gay people wish to reinforce, not undercut, the responsibilities of marriage. Responsibility is a value conservatives hold dear. It's certainly something that's important to Gallagher, who has spoken recently about the very personal basis of her concern with marriage culture, as a college student who was left single and pregnant by the man she loved 30 years ago. (In her forthcoming book, she writes that, under the false sway of feminism, ""whole generations of formerly young women of my age grew up shocked, shocked to discover they are pregnant, and the men who impregnate them feel minimal responsibility."") And Santorum's beef with contraception seems to revolve around the idea that it gives people a ""license to do things in the sexual realm"" without any of the responsibility that conjugal procreation represents. The value of responsibility is clearly important to opponents of the freedom to marry. The Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law that bans federal recognition of same-sex marriages, states as its rationale for restricting marriage to heterosexuals that society has an ""abiding interest in encouraging responsible procreation and child-rearing."" Liberals also value responsibility, in their belief that society is obligated to care for the poor, the old and the sick, and protect the Earth's natural resources. Suppose we grant that teaching responsibility, as such, is important to society. There's no reason we can't teach ""procreative responsibility"" and the importance of marital norms, while also supporting equality for gay people, including their freedom to marry. In other words, there's no reason we can't make a change to marriage laws that's congruent with the stated values of conservatives and moderates. In fact it's already happening. Equality Maryland, the state's major LGBT equality group, recently helped secure the freedom to marry with a message that gay people, like straight people, seek to ""make a public promise of love and responsibility for each other and ask our friends and family to hold us accountable."" The values that would be more likely to appeal to liberals who already endorse same-sex marriage--those of individual rights and entitlements--were not the message. In her forthcoming book, Supreme Court lawyer Linda Hirshman argues that a rhetoric of moral values, which itself strikes many as conservative, was the gay movement's ""surprise weapon"" in beginning to win the freedom to marry. Telling the stories of heroic caretaking throughout the AIDS crisis and of committed relationships through thick and thin, advocates stopped relying on feeble appeals to tolerance, and showed naysayers that gay people shared their moral values and deserved equal treatment. This doesn't mean that liberal equality advocates must turn more conservative in order to advocate to the middle. What it means is recognizing the common ground that already exists, in the form of what I'd call ""sub-values"" (responsibility, fairness, respect for tradition, sanctity) within the larger values debate around homosexuality. This was convincing to Ted Olsen, former solicitor general under President George W. Bush, who explained that he joined a constitutional challenge to California's gay marriage ban to protect conservative values: ""We believe that a conservative value is stable relationships and stable community and loving individuals coming together and forming a basis that is a building block of our society, which includes marriage."" Along the same lines, after discovering in their research that some moderates were offended by seeing same-sex couples throwing weddings in jeans or during parades, Third Way recommended that gay and lesbian couples find a way to signal they took marriage seriously, appreciating the sanctity of such a solemn commitment. Truth be told, many liberals and gay people are also alarmed about rising out-of-wedlock birth rates. Some are even concerned about a society where personal liberty seems to have trounced social responsibility. We care about people honoring their commitments to each other, about relationships having security and about children having permanence. Could pointing this out help temper Maggie Gallagher's rhetoric about the threat that gay equality poses to the nation? It's not likely. But what has become for her a crusade against the freedom to marry, likely reflects the real anxieties of millions of others, reachable people who want to do what's right, but just need an olive branch to help them get there."

The crowd, a few hundred people inside a tastefully decorated quadrant of an airline hangar, skews old. There are only a few whoops of excitement, a few shakes of the new Gingrich signs that place the former House speaker's name on a gas pump. ""Just raise your hand,"" says Gingrich. A few dozen people raise their hands. Success! ""When you get a chance, go to your Facebook page, and put in 'Newt = $2.50 a gallon.' That'll spread, and spread. How many of you are on Twitter? When you get a chance, go to #250gas. That's a new thing we've built on Twitter."" At every stop today, a charter plane trip through eastern Tennessee on a 45-degree angle, Gingrich has talked up his energy plan. He is as meme-happy as any kid signing up for his first Tumblr. ""Newt = $2.50 a gallon"" will give him a better Super Tuesday result than all the eggheads predicted. Just look at this hangar: It's a ""great turnout,"" just like the turnouts in Knoxville and Kingsport earlier today, just like the Georgia crowds he pulled all last week. Herman Cain, who endorsed Gingrich in Florida--Newt hasn't won a primary since--gives the crowd an update on his trip to Oklahoma, the supposedly sure-thing Santorum state. ""Newt is surging in Tennessee,"" says Cain, who still speaks about twice as loud as anyone else on his stage. ""He's surging in Oklahoma. He's surging in a lot of places. We can do this!"" Cain goes on to argue that Gingrich can win the Republican nomination because he beat Stage 4 cancer, and anything is possible. ""Stay inspired!"" I've seen losing campaigns before, and this doesn't feel like one. Technically, Gingrich isn't really losing. Republican voters will start awarding 437 delegates today. Georgia voters control 72 of those delegates. They will award most of them to Gingrich, who represented some arriviste northwest Atlanta suburbs for 20 years, who campaigned here when Romney and Santorum were in Michigan. Neither of them can take Georgia away from Gingrich. Only Romney even made a recent stop here, serving pancakes at a Sunday event, notable because he avoided saying anything off-putting about his massive wealth. So the Gingrich voter is staying put. ""I want him to stay in until he wins,"" says Esther Taj, a retiree trying to get Gingrich's signature on her campaign sign. ""The media's been rough on him from the beginning. Of course they're saying he should drop out."" Matt Brown, a cement salesman, holds out a guitar for Gingrich to sign. He'd brought it to another Gingrich appearance, but forgot the silver Sharpie that really shows up on the black wood. The Sharpie made it with him this time. ""It's like NASCAR,"" says Brown. ""I'm in it until the race is over. No pit stops. Can you imagine if he wins Tennessee? I was looking at the polls on the way over here. He's tied."" PolitiFact would rate this as ""true."" On only a few days Gingrich appeared impossibly behind Rick Santorum in Tennessee. One measure of this came on Friday, when State Sen. Stacey Campfield, the youthful-looking sponsor of legislation that would prohibit homosexuality from being described in schools, quit Gingrich's campaign and signed up with Rick Santorum. ""He's done a lot of great things, but I just don't see the scenario where he gets a victory,"" explained Campfield in a short Saturday conversation. ""The only conservative with momentum is Santorum. Look: If he doesn't get up to 20 percent in Tennessee, it doesn't matter what I do. He won't get delegates here."" On Monday, two days after Campfield and I spoke, came the WeAskAmerica poll, with a decent sample size (1,023 voters) and a not-bad record of predicting winners. It put Gingrich at 29 percent, tied with Santorum, one point behind Romney. Perhaps the endorsements of Campfield and his ilk had been holding him back. Gingrich trekked to Alcoa, a town around 100 miles northeast of Chattanooga, named for the aluminum smelting company that occupied its skyline. In the ballroom of an airport Hilton, standing behind a ""Newt = $2.50 per gallon"" sign, Gingrich broke the good poll news. ""We are one point ahead in the latest poll,"" he said. Not to quibble with one point in a poll, but why say Newt was up when he was actually down? ""Compare this poll to the Vanderbilt poll that everyone was looking at last week,"" said Gingrich's spokesman, R.C. Hammond. ""We were at negative 12 points or something."" If the campaign is on the upswing, why quit? Gingrich, who talks delegates and strategy perhaps more than a candidate should, has repeatedly told local and national media that his plan is to do well enough on Super Tuesday to benefit from the inevitable Santorum collapse. ""[Santorum] was running fourth in every single primary,"" Gingrich said on Fox News Sunday. ""Suddenly, he very cleverly went to three states nobody else went to, and he became the media darling and bounced back."" What would stop Gingrich from bouncing back if--oh, I don't know, if Santorum lost Ohio and the next polls from Alabama and Mississippi, which vote next week, show voters getting bored with their new toy and trudging back to Gingrich? The candidate is ready for them, waiting with his energy plan. He delivered a 35-minute version of it in Alcoa: It may be the most passionate energy pitch any presidential candidate has delivered without wearing a sweater. (It's gone somewhat viral. A button seller at the door offers up an item for only $2.50, ""one Newt gallon!"") Gingrich has hollowed out the rest of his stump speech, junking the stuff about ""challenging Obama to seven three-hour debates in the Lincoln-Douglas model"" and replacing it all with a promise to build the Keystone pipeline and ""ensure that no American ever again bows to a Saudi king."" He offers to take the president on a ""field trip"" to North Dakota--a lighthearted version of the old Obama-is-a-schmuck trope, much softer than any teleprompter joke--and explains why Obama's opposition to drilling is ""intellectually fascinating."" ""I give him credit,"" said Gingrich. ""He said, 'I want to try to get Americans to leave gasoline and use something else.' He then described a breakthrough in batteries and research which could, in five, 10, 15 years have a significant impact, except, of course, it uses electricity, much of which is coal-generated, and since the Obama team hates coal, you couldn't have electricity, because that would be inappropriate, so you'd have expensive electricity for your battery, so if it's expensive to drive your electric car, you'll drive a gas car, except Obama's goal is to make gas expensive so you use electricity!"" Reporters who have watched Gingrich go through nine or 10 campaign ""narratives"" are a little thrown off. But it makes sense. Gingrich's futurism hurt him when he campaigned in Florida's space coast and promised a moon base by 2021. (Stacey Campfield cited this as one of the reasons Gingrich had blown it.) Geeking out about oil prices, though--that's something people want to hear. Theoretically. Enough people in Georgia, at least. Maybe enough people in Tennessee.

In Chattanooga, Gingrich keeps his speech short, leaving plenty of time to pose for photographs, high-five kids, and sign copies of his books. His wife Callista reaches Matt Brown and his guitar, and grabs a pen to sign it. ""I'm a musician, too!"" she says.

While Gingrich is signing the guitar, I ask him a little bit about his endgame. He's constantly asked if he'll drop out, so I reverse the question. He won the South Carolina primary, which no Republican has won the GOP nomination without. The campaign is headed to Alabama and Mississippi. If it wasn't for Virginia, where Gingrich was kept off the ballot, Romney might be on track to lose every state between Maryland and Florida. Could the GOP nominate Mitt Romney if he loses the South and Gingrich wins it?

""It won't happen,"" says Gingrich. ""He'll either figure out how to win here, or he won't be the nominee."" See what he did there? It's not Newt Gingrich who has to figure out a way to survive the primary. It's everybody else."	After Super Tuesday, will Newt rise again?	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/the_kochs_brothers_are_trying_to_seize_control_of_the_libertarian_think_tank_cato_.html	"On Friday afternoon, as the Washington offices of the Cato Institute were emptying out for the weekend, the libertarian think tank's president sent an e-mail to all staff. The subject was the Koch brothers crisis. ""Catoites,"" wrote Ed Crane, ""You are all probably aware by now of the unfortunate development with Charles and David Koch. They are in the process of trying to take over the Cato Institute and, in my opinion, reduce it to a partisan adjunct to Americans for Prosperity, the activist GOP group they control."" His fellow Catoites were waiting for this. On Thursday morning, the Washington Post published news of a lawsuit the Kochs had filed against the 35-year-old libertarian think tank, claiming that they could buy the controlling shares held by the late co-founder and chairman William Niskanen. A ""Save Cato"" page materialized on Facebook; Cato staffers, on their public pages, were telling friends to join. On Friday, before he sent out the e-mail, Crane summoned some of his top scholars for a special briefing on the Koch crisis. Attendees described it as a ""war meeting,"" with Crane pledging to stay on and fight the lawsuit as long as it could be fought. This was basically what Crane would say in his all-Cato e-mail. ""Cato is the gold standard of libertarian organizations around the world,"" wrote Crane. ""We are respected and admired for our commitment to libertarian principles, integrity, independence and non-partisanship. That respect encompasses traditional liberals and conservatives. That would all end with a Koch takeover, despite Charles Koch's protestations to the contrary."" How did this happen, and why should anyone outside of the libertarian sphere care about it? The first question has a complicated answer. The second question answers itself. Charles and David Koch have been putting some of their hard-won oil wealth into libertarian causes since the 1970s. A lot of the money has gone to theoretical, academic research--Cato, the Mercatus Center,* internship programs for college students. Charles Koch had helped to found Cato in 1977, but in 1991, he bolted; the think tank wasn't producing his kind of results. David joined Cato as Charles left, becoming a minority partner, present but not really policing the think tank's work. In 2009, after Barack Obama's Democrats passed health care legislation and tried to pass a cap-and-trade energy tax, the Kochs stepped up their political activism. Americans for Prosperity, a grass-roots organizing group chaired by David Koch, helped build the Tea Party movement with conferences, bus tours, and punditry; its budget grew from $7 million pre-Obama to $40 million in 2010. The Cato Institute had never been so directly involved in politics. Its scholars had criticized Republicans when they were in power; they criticized Democrats when they started ruining things their own way. But if other Koch-connected organizations were at war with Obama, Cato largely sat it out. When the Occupy Wall Street movement began, Americans for Prosperity denounced its ""violent rhetoric."" Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at Cato, blogged a Venn diagram and wrote that ""to the extent the substance of [Occupy Wall Street's] grievance is, or can be turned to, corporations' use of government power to win unjust power and profits for themselves, that's a grievance I can sit in a drum circle for."" In 2011, according to Cato chairman of the board Bob Levy, the think tank got no money whatsoever from the Kochs. On Oct. 26, 2011, Niskanen passed away. Within days, Crane learned that the Kochs would be coming after the Cato shares held by Niskansen's widow, arguing that they were not hers to hold. A win would give them complete control of the think tank, with a supermajority to make key hiring decisions; that, Crane was led to believe, would end his 35-year tenure as president. In early November, David Koch met with Bob Levy, chairman of Cato's board of directors, at Dulles International Airport. They were joined by Richard Fink, Koch's chief adviser, and Kevin Gentry, a vice president of Charles Koch's charitable foundation who'd been put on Cato's board of directors. (Former Americans for Prosperity President Nancy Pfotenhauer had joined the board after the same meeting.) ""They said that a principle goal was to defeat Barack Obama,"" remembered Levy. ""The way David [Koch] put it was, 'We would like you to provide intellectual ammunition that we can then use at Americans for Prosperity and our allied organizations.' AFP and others would apply Cato's work to advance their electoral goals."" Levy asked them: ""What gives you the impression that [Cato isn't] providing intellectual ammunition?"" He says now: ""I never got a satisfactory answer. The only answer that makes sense was that Cato needed to be more responsive to their needs. We would take closer marching orders. That's totally contrary to what we perceive the function of Cato to be."" Cato's leadership didn't respond to this directive, nor did they change anything about the think tank. The Kochs began to change it for them. In February, they nominated 16 people for four slots on Levy's board. Levy and others were aghast at some of the names. One nominee, Tony Woodlief, a former leader of several Koch-funded groups, had blogged in the past about ""sanctimonious libertarians"" who refused to get serious about policy. ""Libertarianism in practice largely consists of a homogeneous group of people talking to one another about a narrow set of things that matter most to them (legalized drugs, lower taxes), and hoping that the rest of America will wake up and elect them to office,"" he sneered in a 2002 post. ""The majority of Americans are not, in fact, 'live and let live' types."" John Hinderaker, a lawyer and founder of the blog PowerLine, had backed the Iraq war and called George W. Bush a ""man of extraordinary vision approaching to genius."" In the end, the board chose the four members that horrified libertarians the least. The four new members were Judge Andrew Napolitano (""the only one of these nominees who actually is a libertarian,"" says Levy), former solicitor general Ted Olsen, Koch Industries shareholder Preston Marshall, and Charles Koch himself. Both brothers were now on the board. They or their close allies held seven of 16 seats. Two more, and they would have had control of the board.* That would end Cato as Washington knows it. ""You think I'd WANT to stick around a partisan propaganda farm?"" tweeted Julian Sanchez, a Cato research fellow, on Friday. ""The Kochs are making me root for that asshole Ed Crane,"" tweeted Will Wilkinson, a scholar with some liberal leanings who left the think tank in 2010, sparking a now-quaint round of speculation about Cato's politics. ""I don't think there's anybody, maybe with the exception of Charles and David Koch and their employees, who believes that Cato's better off being governed by the corporate and political interests of the Kochs,"" said Bob Levy. ""Maybe they will wake up to the fact that this is destructive for everybody. It seems obvious. What is the purpose of doing this? What is there about Cato's activities that requires redirection? What is there that they're not satisfied with?"" The Kochs haven't explained themselves yet. (I e-mailed the Kochs' representative over the weekend, and I will print any reply.) The money speaks loudly enough. In 2010, AFP and the Kochs' own donations went to support Republicans running for Congress. (AFP's spending was ""educational,"" so most ads gently suggested that voters should call Democrats and explain why they were wrong.) In 2012, the Kochs talk about steering $200 million to conservative candidates. If they're successful, Republicans will win the total control of Washington that they had from 2001 to 2007. Of course, even in those years, the Cato Institute produced some of the most consistent, passionate, and predictive attacks on Republican policies. One example: In December 2001, a Catoite grew worried that the Bush administration would expand the ""war on terror"" to Iraq. ""The Bush administration should not follow a successful prosecution of the war in Afghanistan with another war in Iraq,"" he wrote, ""unless it presents evidence, at least credible enough for Tony Blair, that Saddam helped finance, organize, or implement the Sept. 11 attacks or that he has supplied weapons of mass destruction to a terrorist group. No such evidence has been presented to date."" The author: William Niskanen. If the Kochs win control of his shares, and the Koch-skeptics bolt, a much-less-credible Cato Institute will never be so rude to the Republican Party. The think tank's response: total war, ending either with victory or with Ed Crane's libertarians salting the earth as they retreat. Correction, March 5, 2012: This article originally misstated the number of seats on Cato's board. It's 16, not 12. The article also misidentified the Mercatus Center as the Mercatus Institute."

It's the setting of the most popular Rick Santorum commercial of all time; half a million YouTube clicks for a video set in a dark, dramatically edited 2014.  Santorum isn't the first candidate to try to scare Americans into voting for him. There's a history here, a rich tradition of ads from candidates who predict doom if they don't win. These candidates, being desperate, usually lose. America endures. But the ads keep coming anyway. This is a collection of some of the greatest hits from campaigns that had nothing else to lose. 2012: If Obama Rules We see sad children in gingham dresses, a man pointing a gas spout at his head, and stacks of TVs that flash between images of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Barack Obama. Santorum has made a movie out of what Mitt Romney's only been implying: Elect Obama, and the world as we know it ends. It's an unusually good year for this message--high unemployment, 13-digit debt, two wars. Apocalypse Rating: 5 out of 10. America looks like District 12, and that leaves us with all kinds of bad associations. 2006: The Taxman Before they lost Congress, Republicans hired Airplane/Naked Gun director David Zucker to design a dystopia of tax hikes. ""What if you woke up a year from today,"" asked a narrator, ""the Democrats had taken over, and you were able to see their new taxes?"" An unsmiling federal agent haunts ordinary Americans as they watch baseball, eat at restaurants, and give birth. It's all a little like The Adjustment Bureau, without the happy ending. (Spoiler alert.) ""If the Democrats take over Congress,"" we're told, ""they will raise taxes over $2.4 trillion to keep up with their reckless spending."" And that'll be the end of freedom. Apocalypse Rating: 1. Suburban America actually looks to be in great shape in these ads. And the Democrats never raised those taxes. 2000: How Do You Say, ""I'm Choking"" in Spanish? Pat Buchanan's 2000 presidential bid was arguably the most disastrous episode in a pretty successful career. He'd run for the Republican nomination twice, and won a couple of states, but in 2000 he bolted and ran for the Reform Party nomination. Whoever got their nod could, theoretically, run a serious, well-funded campaign, aided by federal matching funds. And then Buchanan wasted most of his time wresting the nomination away from the candidate of the Transcendental Meditation-focused Natural Law Party. Once he won, he bought this: an ad in which a frustrated white man learns that English is no longer the national language, then chokes to death because 911 doesn't have an English-speaking operator available. Apocalypse Rating: 3. As stupid as the ad was, there's still a constituency that fears this. 1984: The Day After Walter Mondale struggled, and failed, to turn President Ronald Reagan into the sort of character who could terrify voters. What were they scared of in the early 1980s? Nuclear war, obviously. In 1983, 100 million people tuned in for The Day After and watched Jason Robards and Steve Gutenberg crawl through the aftermath of WWIII. Mondale's credibility on the issue was iffy--the Carter-Mondale administration had negotiated SALT II, then rejected it--but that didn't stop him. This long ad showed adorable children frolicking to the sounds of Crosby, Stills, and Nash, until nuclear missiles start launching, and they get distracted by impending doom. Apocalypse Rating: 4. It's creepy enough until Mondale shows up and starts talking. 1968: Hubert Humphrey Will Destroy the World Roger Ailes, the future founder of Fox News, honed his craft on the Nixon campaign. His commercials tried to capture the angst and nausea that Americans felt about the late 1960s. They mostly succeeded. In ""Decision,"" Ailes moved on from hippy-bashing to show what the world would be like if yet another bumbling Democrat won the presidency. It's a collection of images: Nuclear missiles. Brezhnev. Mao. Castro. The Red Army. We cut to pictures of an undetermined war, then pictures of soldiers crying out in agony. We end on one of the all-time most apocalyptic campaign slogans: ""This time, vote like your whole world depended on it."" Apocalypse Rating: 6. This is legitimately disturbing. 1968: No, Richard Nixon Will Destroy the World! Nixon's ad showed; his Democratic rival's ad told. A narrator asked viewers: ""Do you want Castro to have the bomb? Now?"" Right then, a nuclear bomb exploded, scattering clouds, as the viewer learned that Nixon was in ""no hurry"" to sign--of all things--a  United Nations treaty. The scariest part of the ad was the slogan: ""Humphrey, there is no alternative."" Apocalypse Rating: 3, because we're just talking about a treaty. 1964: Daisy This is the problem. Everyone who runs a political campaign knows the ""Daisy"" ad. They know it ran only once, but it was so viral (there was probably another word for this in 1964) that it kneecapped Barry Goldwater. It's like ""Yesterday,"" or Game 6 of the Jazz-Bulls finals in 1998. You know it worked, but how do you repeat it? It most situations, you can't. You need a widespread sense that a candidate is crazy and an incipient sense that America could be doomed. Apocalypse Rating: 10. Johnson's ""these are the stakes"" bellow really ties the bow around it."	"A Look Back at the Candidates Who Said, ""Vote For Me or the World Will End!"""	['Buchanan', 'Obama', 'Castro', 'Nixon']	[]

It had been two years since they failed to stop passage of Obamacare. It had been one year since a repeal bill passed the House and croaked on the way to the Senate. And here they were, getting one more hearing from a court with a 5-4 majority of Republican appointees. If you didn't feel deja vu, you didn't have a memory. On Tuesday, the well-funded Americans for Prosperity led a coalition of Tea Party groups in a good-sized rally across the street from the Senate, a short walk from the court. (The plaza in front of the building itself makes Zuccotti Park look like the Field of Dreams; big rallies, naturally, are being moved elsewhere.) Several thousand activists filled up the space, some of them in lawn chairs, almost all of them with signs. AFP provided free T-shirts in the very same color--red--that was used for an impromptu 2009 rally against a different version of the bill before it passed in the House. One sign near the speakers' stage portrayed a hand sticking a knife in a fat sheaf of paper, with the legend, KILL THIS BILL. The word bill was scratched out, replaced by the word law. ""The Congress didn't listen to us,"" said Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who won in a 2010 squeaker. ""The president, unfortunately, signed the bill. Now, the last remaining branch of the government will have its say."" How often does a defeated political movement get this many bites at the apple? In speeches and interviews, over a couple of days, the activists outside the Supreme Court deployed multiple--sometimes contradictory--arguments as to why the mandate-based health care law needed to die. Congress didn't read it closely. The Congressional Budget Office had bungled the math. Ken Hoagland, the chairman of an ever-changing constellation of anti-tax and anti-Obamacare groups, said that the law had to be overturned because voters didn't want it. ""No law can be enacted without the permission of the people who will live in that law,"" he said at a Saturday rally. ""It's called the consent of the governed."" One wrinkle here: The hated, ousted Congress that passed the law had been elected, as had Barack Obama; mandate aside, they'd all pledged to reform health care. The governed had consented, at least for a while. Time for argument No. 2: Voters opposed the law as it stood. At a small Tuesday morning rally, over the din of Planned Parenthood volunteers bullhorning at them, conservatives told the crowd about polls that proved that the bill wasn't popular. ""We believe that this legislation is unconstitutional,"" said Ralph Reed, the former Christian Coalition leader who's mounted a comeback with his Faith & Freedom Coalition. ""If you look at the CBS/New York Times poll today""-- WE! LOVE! OBAMACARE! chanted the Planned Parenthood protesters. ""The CBS/New York Times poll shows that 67 percent of the American people--"" WE! LOVE! OBAMACARE! ""--want to see this legislation repealed outright--"" WE! LOVE! OBAMACARE! ""--or they want to see the individual mandate repealed."" After he wrapped, I asked Reed whether it would be preferable to take the law apart after an election, or to count on a court to toss it out. ""I always think it's far better for a law to be repealed by legislative action,"" said Reed. ""Unfortunately, given the fact that the Senate wouldn't even allow a vote on that, and that Obama would veto it, we're sort of agnostic about how it goes."" Spin like this is rooted in total confidence. It's two years since the bill became law, and it still isn't popular. One sign that popped up all over the conservative rallies, Zelig-like, reprinted a recent Gallup poll that had 72 percent of Americans--54 percent of people who like the law!--rating the Affordable Care Act ""unconstitutional."" Conservatives won a long, complicated argument in the court of public opinion. But that's not the court they're picketing right now. And they don't want to leave anything to chance. At Saturday's rally, before the oral arguments began, a number of speakers demanded a recusal from Justice Elena Kagan, who was Obama's first, less-tongue-tied solicitor general. Letting her hear the case, said the Judicial Group's James Christopherson, would be ""roughly similar to a football coach leaving the football game at halftime, then returning as a referee."" John Whitley, a congressional candidate who showed up in his medical coat, asserted confidently that ""Kagan should take a vacation, even though we know she will not."" At Monday's big rally, I spotted seven signs making some version of that same argument. IMPEACH KAGAN THE UNETHICAL. JUSTICE KAGAN: RECUSE YOURSELF. One sign quoted the statute that asks judges to ""disqualify themselves"" if they've worked on a case and added JUSTICE KAGAN: OBEY THE LAW! ""She helped set up Obamacare,"" explained Frank Ferguson, a realtor whose sign read KAGAN'S VOTE IS UNETHICAL. ""There might not be a controlling legal authority that can take her off the case, but I don't think her vote should count. I've got a high school education and even I know that."" Joe Figliola, a businessman based in Washington, D.C. proposed a compromise: Kagan should stay on the case but get only half a vote. Even if far-fetched, this idea, just like a full-on recusal, would up the likelihood of the law's repeal. ""It was obvious cronyism that put her on the court,"" reasoned Figliola. ""Her history requires recusal, to any fair-minded person."" It was fair to wish her off the case, and to imagine a glide path for victory over the law. ""It's the contrast between the public mood and the way the system works, right? You're down to the nine Supremes, when popular opinion is 70 percent against it."" Two years ago, when they rallied, conservatives were trying to sway public opinion and to spook the less freedom-loving members of Congress. They have far less sway over the nine members of the Supreme Court. If they overturn the law, it won't be because they defeated it legislatively; it may be because Republicans have appointed one more justice than Democrats have. That would mean victory. That would be good enough."	Will the Supreme Court Deliver the Victory Conservatives Have Long Craved?	['Obama']	[]

Breitbart.com world headquarters sits in an unincorporated part of Los Angeles. (It's not really part of any city. This is a selling point.) Ten of the website's editors filed out to the alley. They arranged themselves side by side in their best Reservoir Dogs poses. Click. Dana Loesch, the Tea Partier, CNN contributor, and editor of Breitbart's Big Journalism vertical, stood in the middle of the frame. She put the picture up on Instagram. The caption was a Twitter hashtag: #war. ""We took that picture to say, 'Hey! We're still here,' "" said Mike Flynn, the editor of Breitbart's Big Government vertical, when I talked to him this week. ""We're going to carry out Andrew's vision."" Left side of the photo: Joel Pollak, Breitbart.com's editor in chief, who slowly took over that role after coming in as a legal counsel. Right side: Ben Shapiro, a conservative columnist who'd become the site's editor at large. Larry Solov, Breitbart's best friend and business partner, thought the pairing was hilarious. ""You're looking at our two Orthodox Jewish, Harvard Law-grad bookends!"" he said when I showed him the photo. The bookends were not famous people. They were soft-spoken; Breitbart really, really wasn't. But the day after the photo was taken, they were on Fox News, promoting a scoop--a 1990 video of Harvard Law student Barack Obama embracing critical race theory pioneer Derrick Bell--that Breitbart had been readying before his death. Every time they upload a story or tweet, Breitbart.com's editors are answering a question: How do you keep this stuff going without your star? Can you keep getting on CNN and Fox and the Drudge Report? Does your inbox keep filling up with tips and video scoops? How do you replace Andrew Breitbart? You really don't. Breitbart's death was commemorated by memorials in L.A., New York, and--twice--in D.C. The admiring bloggers who put on the first D.C. memorial went on to start the Breitbart Scholarship. Ideally, board members like James O'Keefe will use it to dole out cash for enterprising student journalists. The second D.C. memorial, which I attended last night, was held at the Newseum in a theater a few steps away from a giant slab of the Berlin Wall. Four members of Congress gave speeches paying tribute. ""I don't know anyone who can, with clarity, articulate the left and what they've done over the last 100 years,"" said Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, after the memorial. ""I didn't think I was the only one who understood it, but when I read his book, I realized--wow, he really understood it. Marcuse, the Frankfurt School, all of that."" The tribute ended with a short video tribute by the makers of the upcoming documentary Hating Breitbart. The #war hashtag started with their original trailer. It ends with Breitbart closing a long rant with, ""Fuck you,"" staring at the camera for a few seconds, then saying, ""War"" like he was trying to spook somebody out of the hiccups. ""We didn't even push that hashtag,"" said Andrew Marcus, the director of the documentary. He rattled off some of the other Breitbart memes that have spread since the Web pioneer died. ""IAmBreitbart, BreitbartIsHere, the posters--that's all organic. Nobody's planning that."" Breitbart.com, though--this was very carefully planned. The site relaunched and ran the Derrick Bell/Obama story within days of its founder's passing. All of Breitbart's old sites--Big Hollywood, Big Government, Big Journalism, Big Peace, Breitbart.tv--were consolidated in one place. Scoops were put next to movie trailers, next to election analyses, next to a simple form to submit news tips, with this epigram. ""We have a sea of new media to capture the lies""
 - Andrew Breitbart, April 15, 2010
 Washington, DC Tea Party Rally The idea is to keep doing Breitbart-style work, split between a team of previously more-obscure apostles. Steve Bannon directed the Sarah Palin-friendly documentary The Undefeated and collaborated with Breitbart on a documentary about the 99 Percent movement titled Occupy Exposed. He's taken over Breitbart News Network, LLC as executive chairman; Solov has taken over as CEO. ""It was the investors' call,"" explained Bannon, talking to friends after the D.C. memorial service. (The day Breitbart died, Bannon was meeting with investors in New York.) Obviously, the chairman and CEO jobs had to be split, because Breitbart wasn't replaceable. ""He was a combination of Falstaff and Marshall McLuhan. A larger-than-life guy who understood the media. You can't replace that. In combat, you learn that most of the best guys are going to die first. They're going to run toward the gunfire. Those guys are leaders. The key is making the unit bind together after that, and push forward."" Watching ""the unit"" move is like watching a school of piranhas. It flits around quickly, randomly, until a hunk of meat hoves into view. That's when it attacks. Take the example of Twitter. Breitbart used it to retweet people who hated him, warn of upcoming scoops, and get into random insult-flinging contests. John Nolte, who edits Big Hollywood--he's the glasses-and-beard guy in the #war photo--cops the Breitbart style. Dana Loesch, whose CNN contract makes her the most prominent of the new Breitbartians, uses a lot of the same tricks, only harsher. She endlessly needles Media Matters senior fellow Eric Boehlert for employing M.J. Rosenberg, who slings the term ""Israel Firster"" even though it was coined by white supremacists. Boehlert, who'd carried on a Spy vs. Spy relationship with Breitbart for years, alternately blows her off or asks why CNN employs her. When I asked Boehlert how the new Breitbartians were doing, he laughed out loud. ""I don't think Breitbart hired very strong editors to work for him,"" he said. ""Take the Derrick Bell story. The only pick-up it got was in its own corner of the Internet."" He wasn't impressed at how Fox News covered the story? ""I don't count Fox. In the real world, no one paid attention."" The Daily Show covered the story, too, but we can move on. When Breitbart ran the shop, they scrambled to combat the ACORN tapes and pieces about the past of the openly gay ""education czar"" Kevin Jennings. The danger seems to have passed. ""They're having trouble sustaining it."" They've been at it for less than a month, though. Absolutely, they're in a stiffer competition now for the sort of stories the Breitbart sites excelled at. The Derrick Bell video was partially scooped by BuzzFeed, whose Andrew Kaczynski found a different version of the same tape. Breitbart.com wanted the video to launch its ""Vet the Prez"" campaign; BuzzFeed spoiled the punch. Part of the Breitbart.com response was a new scoop video of professor Charles Ogletree bragging about ""hiding"" the Bell/Obama tape in 2008. The rest of the response: a question-begging campaign against the other site, asking why they'd timed it this way, how much they paid, whether anything was clipped out. Would Breitbart have handled it that way, with so much umbrage? It doesn't matter. The new Breitbartians are the people he hired. They were already running most of the Breitbart network by the time he died. ""He took a year to assemble the best team and assemble the best technology,"" said Steve Bannon. ""When he got obsessed with something--you  know what he was like when he got obsessed with something."" Sure. It was thrilling to watch, and incredibly tough to copy."

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/mitt_romney_won_the_illinois_republican_primary_in_decisive_fashion_.html	"Illinois primary day was a laundry day for Mitt Romney. He washed his shirt in the sink and then took Rick Santorum to the cleaners. The former Massachusetts governor beat his closest rival handily, 47 percent to 35 percent. It was the first no-caveat, everyone-is-watching, takes-place-in-a-location-you've-heard of contest that Romney has dominated since his victory in Florida two months ago. The Republican nominating contest could take a long time. So it's probably wise not to clutch the dashboard every time there's a bend in the road. Still, there was something different about Romney's win in Illinois. On recent primary days, he has been able to claim he won the most delegates, but Santorum has emerged from those nights with the energy and excitement. Tonight Romney can crow about having the excitement and winning the most delegates in a state where he didn't have a home field advantage like Michigan or a regional connection like New Hampshire. Even when he has won, Romney has had to say unsatisfying things like ""a win is a win."" After Illinois, he can just smile. Everyone gets it. The Republican race will continue, but the conversation may change. Can Romney turn the victory into the last piece of data necessary to get the party to finally rally around him as the eventual nominee? Romney will argue that he is ""bringing the party together,"" a claim that rests on whether enough people believe that he is acceptable to conservatives. He got some evidence in Illinois to help him make his case. Romney won his usual constituencies--moderates, the wealthy, and the well-educated. But he also improved his performance among the 64 percent who identify themselves as ""conservatives."" Romney won 47 percent of that group to Santorum's 39 percent. He also won 47 percent of the vote from those who support the Tea Party to Santorum's 36 percent. Romney improved his standing in other areas, too. When voters were asked who best understands the concerns of regular Americans, he won that group with 36 percent. He dominated in the areas he does best in, scoring high among voters who are most concerned about beating Barack Obama and who say the economy is their primary concern. Will it be enough? Perhaps the win was decisive enough to get Republicans to fall in line, but the exit polls showed that Romney still has work to do. Forty-four percent of those who voted for him said they still had doubts. There are no party elders to finally call everyone in to dinner from their rumble in the back yard. But if Jeb Bush, Mitch Daniels, or Haley Barbour put their arm around Romney, it would generate some coverage in conservative circles and perhaps that would translate to even more lopsided wins in future states. The pressure is on the also-rans. At some point, argues one Romney adviser, Santorum and Gingrich have to worry about their future viability as Republicans. They don't want to become branded as spoilers. But the Republican Party has cracks in it and a loud minority wants leaders who never surrender, thumb their nose at the establishment, and battle for principle. If you want to be the favorite after-dinner speaker for that crowd, there's no reason not to take the fight to Tampa. Unless, of course, you start to look ridiculous. Newt Gingrich's theory is that he'll pull out a victory in a big convention fight in Tampa. But he has to actually win a contest in some place other than South Carolina and Georgia. Instead, he has launched a quixotic tour that includes zoos and fine-dining establishments, arguing that once he gets to Tampa he'll be able to convince delegates to pick him. He's a flawed candidate. That's why he's not winning. His flaws aren't going to suddenly evaporate, no matter how good a show he puts on for delegates. Gingrich has such a devastating and derisive wit it's a shame that we can't hear Gingrich on Gingrich's strategy. If Romney was able to expand his pool of voters in Illinois, Santorum was not. He won among those who consider themselves ""very conservative"" and those who ""strongly support"" the Tea Party. He owns the far-right wing of the party but showed no ability to grow out from that base. That may be due to the fact that Romney once again buried Santorum under a mountain of negative ads. Team Romney outspent Santorum 18-1. At $3 million in combined spending between Romney and his Super PAC, that's $7.50 for every Romney vote. Santorum won among the 43 percent who identified themselves as evangelicals, with 46 percent to Romney's 39 percent. Still, that was one of Romney's best performances with that group. We also learned something else about Santorum's support among religious voters. For the first time, the exit polls asked people how often they attend church. Santorum won among those who attend services more than once a week, but Romney won all other categories--those who attend weekly, a few times a month, a few times a year, and never. Santorum's base isn't so much religious as devoted to their faith. That was also true of Catholics. Santorum wins among those who attend mass more than once a week. Romney wins the cafeteria Catholics and all the rest. Again, Santorum has locked up the most intense part of the party but nothing else. The exit polls also gave some insight into whether Gingrich's departure would help or hurt the remaining candidates. It's a complicated question that relies on Gingrich being more than a candidate in name only, which was pretty much his role in Illinois, where he finished fourth. In the limited future states where he might be a factor, like Texas, North Carolina, or Arkansas, a strong showing could draw some at-large delegates from Romney, slightly slowing his march to 1,144 delegates. On the other hand, if he performs well in those states, he could take votes from Santorum and rob him of delegates and a win. The latter scenario rests on the theory that Gingrich takes a larger share of voters from Santorum. That was only slightly true in Illinois. When voters were asked who they would favor in a Santorum and Romney matchup, Gingrich voters made up 10 percent of Santorum's share and 8 percent of Romney's share. The landscape starts to look pretty good for Romney in the weeks ahead. Santorum will probably do well in Louisiana on Saturday, but then a slew of northeastern primaries look like almost-certain Romney wins: Maryland, Connecticut, New York, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Washington, D.C. Three of those states are winner-take-all states, which means Romney will take all the delegates on the table. Santorum will win Pennsylvania, but his struggling campaign needs more than a home-state win. And the Pennsylvania primary will not be all gravy, as it will offer the Romney campaign a chance to remind people how badly Santorum lost that state in his last Senate election. Mitt Romney won in Illinois the way front-runners are supposed to win. Still, if his opponents don't get out of the race, it could be two more months of slow, steady victories before he actually crosses the finish line with 1,144 delegates. He should buy a few more shirts."	Is Romney Finally Winning That Key Demographic? His Own Party.	['Haley', 'Romney', 'Obama']	[]

A week ago, Pelosi delivered a micro-documentary to Real Time With Bill Maher about angry, dentally challenged Mississippi Republicans who mistook Barack Obama for Satan. Maher's audience, which offers up Pavlovian applause to any joke about Republicans, ate it up. The pundit class reached for the sick bag. Pelosi, obviously taken aback, filmed a new documentary about arrogant, lazy black people outside a New York welfare office. That made people even sicker. ""I thought liberals were against the dehumanization of the powerless,"" wrote Ta-Nehisi Coates, the sharpest of the anti-Pelosis. ""Since when did shitting on poor and working people become worthy of self-congratulation?"" Since last week. After Pelosi and Maher's silly video came a much more serious study of the same question: a Politico article about, basically, voter stupidity. According to reporter Alexander Burns, voters believed in a ""litany of contradictory, irrational or simply silly opinions,"" and were ""wandering, confused and Forrest Gump-like"" through a campaign that was too complex for their tiny brain pans. ""A lot of times,"" explained Politico editor-in-chief John Harris, introducing and defending the piece, ""stories generate from the editors' rants."" Mea maxima culpa; they were angry, and they forgot to hold their breath and count to 10. Pelosi should probably say some rosaries for the idiotic fiddle music that played over her original video, an attempt to make the footage more Deliverance-ready. But she doesn't have much else to apologize for, and Burns has nothing to apologize for. Few or none of the Alexandra/Alexander critics have spent time in primary states, talking to voters. If they did, they would have to choose: Print what voters actually say, or edit out the ones who say stupid things. Because stupid voters exist. Stupid Democrats exist. Stupid Republicans exist. Go ahead, point it out! If you draw it out and study the whole electorate, the stupidity is--thankfully--not the kind of problem that distorts an election. We arrived at this current round of stupidity-skepticism because of where the Republican primary ended up. Last week's big contests were in Alabama, Mississippi, and Hawaii. The candidates, for unselfish reasons, opted to skip the last state and campaign in the Deep South. Pollsters and reporters, dutifully covering the race, discovered voters who believed that Barack Obama was a Muslim and that he was born in some foreign terrorist hotbed. Nobody should have been surprised. Mississippi's primary voters, some of the most conservative in the lower 48, are also some of the poorest. That wasn't new. Sixty-three years ago, in Southern Politics in State and Nation, V.O. Key observed that ""every other southern state finds some reason to fall back on the soul-satisfying exclamation, 'Thank God for Mississippi.' "" Public Policy Polling didn't goose its results. It pointed out that most Mississippi Republicans believed untrue things that confirmed their suspicions about Barack Obama. I trekked to Mississippi and Alabama last weekend for a few stories about the primaries. The only way I could have avoided hearing some confirmation biases was by locking myself in a leftover sensory depravation chamber from the Altered States set. While they were waiting for Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum or Jeff Foxworthy to start talking, I asked why they thought Barack Obama had won in 2008. Sometimes a voter would go on a tangent and talk about the president's unfamiliarity with John 3:16; sometimes they'd riff on how Mormonism wasn't really Christianity. Some of what they said wound up in a slide show. The rest of it informed how I read Tuesday's election results--Mitt Romney, who'd outspent everyone in both states, coming in third place. Voters aren't saints. When primaries get to certain parts of the country, they get disturbing, fast. In 2008, anybody with a digital camera could interview white Democrats who feared Barack Obama for the wrong reasons. One of the videos that went viral pitted a shocked reporter from the Real News against West Virginians who would have none of his logic. ""Why do you think he's Muslim?"" asked the reporter in one scene. ""He wasn't raised Muslim."" ""I don't agree with that,"" shrugged his subject. What are you supposed to do with quotes like that? Well, why not report them? There's a big difference between these random voter interviews and ""nutpicking,"" when only the craziest, most bigoted clowns at some event are photographed and quoted. Maybe Pelosi plays some tricks with editing that makes her subjects look stupider. Surely, the video gave Maher and his viewers some clip-and-save proof that ""Southerners"" are as bad as they think they are. We shouldn't read too much into what she found. But she found it. The question then becomes, ""How much should we worry about it?"" We're in luck: Worrying about it is futile. In his story, which was much better-reasoned than the critics admitted, Politico's Burns asked Republican strategists if voter ignorance actually mattered. He summarized their wisdom: ""As voters take stock of public events, there's often tension between their feelings about granular policy topics and the overarching principles that encompass those issues."" And there is. When I've dug in with voters who are convinced that Barack Obama is a Muslim, they respond in one of two ways. They might know that an Indonesian school form listed his religion as Muslim. (True, just not something you'd use to extrapolate the next 40 years of his life.) More often, they offer evidence of him doing something that they think a Muslim would do, like scolding Israel, or pulling out of Afghanistan too quickly. If we climb a little deeper, we inevitably get to a discussion of how, at heart, Obama hates America and wants to destroy it. It's not healthy for voters to think those things. It's just not new, either. Most voter ignorance, if it was cured by logic and reason and long sessions of NPR, would be replaced by the same voter preferences, justified in different ways. There are Mississippi Republicans who hate Obama because they think he's a Muslim. Take that away, and they'll hate him because they're conservatives and he isn't. Only 11 percent of Mississippi whites voted for Barack Obama, but only 14 percent voted for John Kerry. These aren't people who'll change their minds if they fully grokked the president's bio. That is why ignorant voters don't get to swing a presidential election. The conservative who rules out all new information, who has ""silo'ed"" himself with talk radio news, has a party he can vote for reliably. The Bill Maher TiVo-er has a party he can vote for, too. Voter ignorance, like a cold, can be controlled without being cured. There's no shame, no journalistic crime, in finding the ignorance and pointing it out."

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/rick_santorum_is_winning_republican_votes_despite_having_no_executive_experience_.html	"In 2008, Republicans argued that Barack Obama couldn't be an effective president because he had never run anything. Since his inauguration, they have never let go of this argument. In a typical exchange during the BP oil spill, Sean Hannity and GOP strategist Ed Gillespie agreed that the feeling America was on the wrong track could be traced ""back to the fact that [Obama] doesn't have executive experience."" Indeed, when Rick Santorum was praising Sarah Palin as a vice presidential pick in 2008 at a speech at Ave Maria (yes, the same speech where he talked about Satan), he cited her executive experience as Alaska's governor for why she was more qualified than Barack Obama. Parties out of power often nominate candidates who dominate in the areas where the incumbents are weak. So if you were a betting person, you'd put the college fund on Republicans nominating a candidate with executive experience. That was partially what made Mitt Romney such an attractive candidate for Republicans to run against Obama. He not only has executive experience, he has a lot of it. And he has executive experience in turning things around, a useful attribute when there is a large perception the country needed a change of direction. The passion for executive experience is also what makes the Santorum boomlet so unexpected. Like Barack Obama, he has no executive experience. George W. Bush famously called himself the ""decider,"" to a lot of snickering. But, to be fair, it did accurately sum up what a commander-in-chief does. A president faces few easy decisions; if a decision is easy, it gets made at lower levels. So it stands to reason that if we're looking for a person to fill a decision-making post, we might want to consider someone who has built an organization, made it work efficiently, and made tough decisions when the stakes are high. That's why when Fox News asked Republican voters in January whether executive experience was important, 88 percent said it was. Of course, this line of argument assumes that voters behave in a logical fashion, which they don't. Republican voters consistently say they want a candidate who can beat Obama and who understands the economy. By a large majority, they think Mitt Romney is that candidate. Still, large numbers of these very same people are voting for Santorum. This frustrates Romney, who at times struggles to remind voters what this election is all about. ""What do you want in your next president?"" Romney asked at a rally just before the Michigan primary. ""What do want him to be able to do? I believe you want him to create jobs and get this economy going again. ... I hope you recognize the best way to get this economy going is to have somebody who's actually had a job in the real economy to get it going, and I have."" I hope you recognize ... It's as if Romney was trying to focus the voters on first principles. This is an election about the economy, and you value executive experience--I know about the former and have a lot of the latter, so golly, what's the problem? That logic is the message of Romney's latest ad in Illinois attacking Rick Santorum. ""He's never run a business or a state,"" says the narrator who calls Santorum ""another economic lightweight,"" presumably referring to that other person who lacked executive experience, President Obama. Rick Santorum, not surprisingly, is no longer making as much of executive experience. When an Iowa voter asked him about his lack of executive experience ahead of that state's caucus, Santorum argued that legislative experience was what a president really needed. ""The experience Governor Romney keeps touting out there is not the experience you need to be president,"" he said. ""A CEO directs people to do what the CEO thinks is right to do and those people work in his chain of command. Senators and congressmen don't work for the president. You've got to work with people, not order people."" When Santorum cites his national security experience, he is referring to his eight years managing legislation on the Armed Services committee. The former Pennsylvania senator is making the best case he can, and voters may be buying it. Though he has none of the experience they once prized, in the latest CBS/New York Times poll of Republicans, Santorum scored close to his rivals when voters were asked whether the candidates could handle the duties of commander-in-chief. One reason that Santorum is doing well despite his lack of executive experience is that he does well with voters who want a president to share their values and take clear stands on social issues. Executive decision making isn't so important when it comes to these issues. While almost all presidents had some kind of executive background, our greatest president, Abraham Lincoln, was one of the few presidents who didn't have any. Santorum has compared himself to Ronald Reagan, but no candidate can get away with comparing himself to Lincoln without being laughed off the stage. (Candidate Obama once tried and was rightly mocked--and later, even mocked himself.) The best comparison Santorum can make for a senator who didn't have executive experience but was able to make decisions is Barack Obama. Since he's trying to run Obama out of office, that's obviously not a comparison he wants to make."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/rep_spencer_bachus_fights_off_the_anti_incumbent_forces_of_alabama_.html	"HOMEWOOD, Ala.--With zero percent of precincts reporting, Rep. Spencer Bachus' biggest boosters have nothing to do. They arrive at city hall in this suburb of Birmingham, three minutes south of downtown and three minutes north of the state Republican Party headquarters. Security waves them on through an unadorned lobby. They pick up nametags, which entitle them to anything from a table of sodas, Chick-fil-A products, fancy cheese cubes, and miniaturized cupcakes dressed with chocolate icing. Bachus had been challenged by the Campaign for Primary Accountability, a newish super PAC that blasts incumbents with six-figure ad buys. Why Baucus? Now chairman of the House financial services committee, Bachus had voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. According to 60 Minutes, he marked the occasion with some stock trades that protected his own money. Bachus and some Fourth Estate fact-checkers have blown off the story; the Office of Congressional Ethics hasn't. Here's the important part--the super PAC has a candidate. Sen. Scott Beason is one of those handsome up-and-coming types who can't stop squirming at the thought of a better job. (Beason stands a head and a half taller than Bachus.) He jumped into the race in January. He has ""a chance,"" according to the local columnist John Archibald, ""because Attila the Hun is not running."" Bachus has spent $1.6 million to stop him, which is 45 times more than Beason has spent, but only six times as much as the anti-incumbent super PAC. Drive through the district, turn on a TV, and you see its ad with a warning about the money Bachus took from ""the financial industry"" and a photo of the congressman looking like he's getting arraigned for setting a school bus on fire. If the Republican establishment is going the way of the Ottomans, it'll be proven at the Homewood City Hall. 7:09 p.m.: Only a dozen or so people have arrived in a room that comfortably holds 200. Dennis O'Brien and his daughter locate some jugs of sweet tea from Milo's. They're a little worried about Bachus. It's not fair that he has to hold off Armageddon. ""He opposes almost everything that the current administration supports,"" says O'Brien. ""Now, I don't think 60 Minutes is taking orders; it's after news. It's news when the Department of Justice goes after a 20-year congressman. I just think it's politically motivated."" 7:33 p.m.: A few votes have come in from the House race; statistical noise. The chatter is all about the issues that unfairly dogged Bachus. ""Immigration,"" says Rod Reiser, who volunteered for Bachus. ""Insider trading is not an issue to Alabamans. The illegal immigration bill is popular with Alabamans because they believe in rule of law, but it's wrong. Alabama, because of its history, doesn't really have much to teach people about how to go implement changes in civil rights laws."" That's off-message, and true. The immigration bill was probably Beason's sturdiest campaign plank. In 2011, after Republicans won total kung-fu-grip control of the state legislature, they pushed through a model ""self-deportation"" law that basically encouraged cops and citizens to become immigration officials. If you saw somebody engaging in a possible crime--a robbery, maybe, or a trip on a road where a checkpoint had been set up--you asked for proof of citizenship. If you didn't get it, the perp could be deported. The law was generally popular across Alabama, but in this district, it was campaign gold in a jewel-encrusted pouch. Bachus represents the most conservative district in America, a swath of central Alabama that votes, on average, 29 points more Republican than the rest of the country. Perhaps Beason can get enough support, and two also-rans can get enough support, to force a runoff? The thought of Scott Beason in an even more powerful role worries people in this room. ""I think he's done more to damage the state than anybody in recent times,"" says Alan Zeigler, an attorney friend who has lunch with Bachus ""a couple of times"" each month. ""Beason comes off, internationally, as a racist. The immigration bill comes off, as passed, as racist. It's mean-spirited. Having parents deported because their kids come to school and people ask about their citizenship? As passed, it's mean-spirited."" 8:10 p.m.: Three fridge-sized TVs play each local station. The networks are closer to calling the state for Rick Santorum than they are to calling Bachus' race. But Bachus is up by plenty, and the cameras need to be fed, so he walks out to talk to reporters. ""We're at 67 percent,"" he says. ""That's only from the first boxes of votes, but that doesn't count areas where we're strong. We had 200 volunteers, or more than that. We had over 100 donations, locally."" I ask Bachus why the super PAC went after him. ""They went after Fred Upton,"" he says, nodding at the chairman of the energy and commerce committee. ""They went after John Mica. They're going after all the chairmen."" He'd criticized the immigration bill, and he'd been weakened. ""My father, he hired black subcontractors. He was one of the first contractors in Alabama to really stand up for the rights of black citizens. I've been inspired by that."" What about the TARP and trading stories? ""Well, 60 Minutes--that turned out to be not true. They said I short-sold GE after they got into trouble. That's absolutely false. A lot of financial news--you might expect it from the mainstream--but a lot of financial news, they fell for it."" A mustachioed handler named Lamar Lavender crooks his finger; Bachus goes to talk to some well-wishers. 9:04 p.m.: Rep. Robert Aderholt, a congressman who represents the area just north of Bachus, arrives to start congratulating. He had endorsed Rick Santorum, but he didn't expect to walk into a hotel ballroom and see Santorum announced the winner in Alabama and Mississippi. ""It was the power of positive thinking!"" he says. He'd encourage Newt Gingrich to quit, but he didn't want to be too negative about it. A number of voters at the party had been saying they disliked TARP; they voted for him, they just hated the bill. Aderholt had voted against TARP. He didn't see any friction with his friend Spencer. ""We've compared notes,"" he says. ""It was a tough vote. It was one of those things--you  hear the scenarios, you hear the Treasury secretary come in and propose a doomsday scenario, it's tough. I respect people who voted the other way."" 10:00 p.m.: Bachus' handlers come to the middle of the room, bearing campaign signs. They hand them off to anyone who wants to be on TV. Two dozen or so Republicans volunteer for the human diorama. Bachus walks out quickly, flanked by a red, white, and blue balloon arch that could have come from Captain America's prom. Bachus gives one of the least inspiring victory speeches I've ever heard. ""It's very important that your congressman--congresswoman--represent, represent your views,"" he says, haltingly. ""Never has the anger in this country been so great. I can certainly identify with those who voted for someone else."" It's dull and gracious. Beason hasn't even called to concede. Bachus walked to the balloon arch only after an AP reporter called to say that Beason was breaking the bad news in his hotel ballroom. Local news has cut away from another Newt Gingrich concession in order to cover Bachus, now up 58-25 over Beason, as he bemoans money in politics. ""The people of Alabama rejected the special interest super PACs in a big way,"" he says. ""We sent a strong message to the super PACs that they can't come in and buy an election."" Stronger than a lot of Republicans wanted. Mitt Romney's aligned super PAC bought 65 percent of Alabama and Michigan ads. He lost. Judge Roy Moore, the man who was chief justice until he tried to display a Ten Commandments monument in his court, is beating an incumbent judge, taking his old job back. Everyone at Bachus' party has entered a time-distortion field, where the Republican establishment can hold off any challenge, where apologizing now and then for bad behavior can save you from voter anger. Bachus leaves the stage and runs through media interviews. He spots a black cameraman whose dreadlocks spill down his back. ""You look just like the new player from the university."" Is this a gaffe? No. The cameraman has a cousin who's been playing for the Crimson Tide. Bachus is surviving. He pauses between handshakes, and I ask him what he thinks about Judge Moore beating the establishment to win his old job and share a ballot with Bachus and the rest of the GOP. ""Hah!"" laughs Bachus. He puts a hand on my shoulder, encouraging me not to say anything stupider than this. Why did he blanche? In his wilderness years, Moore had backed an earlier, weaker challenger to Bachus. The congressman had put the pretender away without much angst. And then came the Tea Party; then came the super PAC. I'd just reminded Bachus, accidentally, that things were never again going to be so easy for the Republicans who win power, use it, and occasionally compromise."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/newt_gingrich_is_looking_to_connect_with_voters_in_mississippi_and_alabama_.html	"BRANDON, Miss.--""There's a show,"" says Newt Gingrich, ""that uses the word Christian in a deliberately hostile way."" There's no chance that anyone in Gingrich's crowd--several hundred people gathered in the chilly storage area of Brandon's city hall--will end up watching or DVRing the show in question. GCB, a midseason replacement on ABC the past two weeks, started life as a novel titled Good Christian Bitches. When the network adapted the book, it softened the name to Good Christian Belles, then to the acronym. Not good enough. ABC hadn't fooled Gingrich, and he wouldn't let the network fool his base. ""To show you how sick the system is,"" says Gingrich, ""try to put the word Muslim in, instead of Christian. It is inconceivable that anybody in our elites would tolerate a program that was that defiling of Islam. But it's fine to defile Christianity? That's how sick the system is."" You want more examples of how sick it is? Gingrich has got 'em. ""We have a president who apologizes to religious fanatics in Afghanistan, while he's attacking the Catholic Church and every pro-life group in America,"" he says. ""He says we're going to respect the sacred objects of every religion? Fine. Put up all the crosses the courts have torn down!"" In my section of the crowd, I hear ""Amens"" and shouts of ""Yes, yes, yes!"" Hearing a national politician talk about this stuff is exhilarating for the crowd. Rick Santorum emotes when he talks about a war on Christians. Mitt Romney doesn't talk about it at all. Gingrich just states it, with the same measured tone he'd bring to a talk about gas prices or (less frequently these days) some panel about education reform. And it works. Gingrich has appeared on the ballot in 20 states so far, and lost in all but two of them--both in the Deep South. The final pre-election polls in Mississippi and Alabama show Gingrich either winning or coming in second, with a pack of delegates in tow. Dig into the polls and you find Southern voters basically favorable toward Gingrich by a 2-1 margin. The campaign now says it erred in sending the candidate to campaign in Washington's caucuses, where Gingrich crawled into fourth place, instead of trying to win Oklahoma and Tennessee and clipping Rick Santorum's wings in the South. Gingrich has collapsed in other states. He's resilient here. Gingrich pulls it off with one of the acts he's honed since the 1970s--the happy culture warrior, offended by liberal bigotry, with no grand agenda of his own. Ask him about birth control and he'll say it's a distraction from a better question about why ""Barack Obama supported infanticide."" Gingrich doesn't get trapped in wedge issue cul de sacs. Rick Santorum will buy up acreage in those cul de sacs. Both men try to segue to an argument over first principles; Gingrich typically succeeds. Mississippi Republicans have an ear for this stuff. Brandon is one of the places where it works. It's a suburb of Jackson, a classic white-flight town with residents who don't mind talking about why they flew. ""I moved here in 1996 from Jackson,"" says Buddy Davis, a retired Army veteran who ""isn't crazy"" about his candidate choices, ""because the other race was taking over. It wasn't safe. There was a shooting just about every day."" Mississippi is 37 percent black, and Jackson is 79 percent black; in Brandon, it's only 17 percent. The black Republicans I meet in Brandon, like Newt supporter Keith Hall, still talk about Jackson as an example of how society stops working when the government's swollen and people lose their values. At his best, Gingrich can switch between optimistic politics and gut-check politics like he's flipping a circuit breaker. His city hall speech spends plenty of time on gas prices, congratulating the crowd when they're aware that the president has talked about developing fuel from algae. What an ideal choice: ""$10 a gallon gas with President Algae, or $2.50 a gallon gas with President Drilling."" (He says he's also bullish about algae-for-fuel research, but it wouldn't help right now.) But the speech goes into hotter places. Gingrich demands a resignation from Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, whom he worked with when he was speaker of the House and Panetta was President Clinton's chief of staff. Panetta's crime: Saying that the United States would seek U.N. approval before a strike on Iran. ""He's not the secretary of defense for the United Nations!"" says Gingrich. This is a killer line. Loss of sovereignty, attacks on faith, fear of people being lulled into poverty and crime by big government--all of that plays. Before Gingrich gave this speech, he'd attended late service at the First Baptist Church, four minutes down the road. It was brief, heavy on hymns, with a fairly succinct sermon from the Rev. Scott Thomas. He compared the contract signed in the Book of Nehemiah to the Declaration of Independence. He talked about personal morality and looked directly at Gingrich as he explained the origins of marriage. God had designed a contract; He had not merely told men and women to have sex. Nobody could have missed the hint. When Gingrich held the microphone after the sermon, he took his medicine. ""I was the kind of kid who got the book on Lucifer descending to Hell,"" said Gingrich. He'd sinned. ""I come to you as a citizen who has sought redemption. I know that you have to shelter under the cross to have any hope of having a full life."" Thomas respected the answer, and let Gingrich continue to talk about how ""the secularists"" were wrong about Jefferson. When I catch up with Thomas, in the hallway outside the city hall speech, he's ready to vote for Gingrich. ""I'll support someone who asks to come to our house--the church--and to speak honestly."" And Gingrich had spoken honestly about faith, in a way that impressed people. But Gingrich didn't go as far as Thomas. In his sermon, the pastor had compared the son of man to some unnamed nonsavior. ""Jesus is not just someone who had multiple wives and claimed he ascended into heaven!"" After the speech, I want to check in: Was he talking about Mohammed? ""No,"" he says, ""that was specifically about Joseph Smith. My point was that we're in election time. You need to know what people believe. Mitt Romney doesn't believe Jesus is God. From a spiritual perspective, he might as well be Muslim."" Gingrich, the happy culture warrior--the Fox News defender of the faith--would never say what Thomas is saying. He'll say enough."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/the_supreme_court_s_citizens_united_decision_has_led_to_an_explosion_of_campaign_spending_.html	"Most of what you hear about Citizens United v. FEC is negative. By opening the door for corporations to spend unlimited sums in elections and to allow for the creation of super PACs, the Supreme Court has made a campaign finance system that was already flooded with money much worse. But Citizens United obviously has its defenders, and they have advanced a number of arguments to try to blunt criticism of the Supreme Court's controversial decision: The public actually learns from the flood of negative advertising coming from these super PACs; super PACS increase competition; The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision didn't create super PACs, so stop blaming the court for the flood of dollars and the negative campaign ads they buy. This last argument has recently gained a lot of traction, and has been made by First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, his son the legal commentator Dan Abrams (who accused the media of ""shameful, inexcusable conduct"" in describing the Citizens United-super PAC connection), columnist George Will, and the Atlantic's Wendy Kaminer. The argument goes like this: The Supreme Court back in 1976 held that individuals had a constitutional right to spend unlimited sums on elections. And before Citizens United, rich individuals like George Soros gave large sums of money to so-called ""527 organizations"" (named after an obscure section of the tax code) with innocuous names like ""Americans Coming Together."" These 527 organizations were just like super PACs, so there's nothing new here. This line of attack is so strong and insistent that the New York Times public editor, Arthur Brisbane, felt it necessary to weigh in on whether the paper's stories tying Citizens United to super PACs were fair. (He concluded they were, but that the truth was complicated.) The purpose of the drumbeat appears to be to insulate the Supreme Court from further criticism of the Frankenstein's monster they've created.

It is true that before Citizens United people could spend unlimited sums on independent advertising directly supporting or opposing candidates. But that money had to be spent by the individual directly. It could not be given to a political action committee, which had an individual contribution cap of $5,000 and could not take corporate or union funding. In many cases, wealthy individuals did not want to spend their own money on advertising, which would say ""Paid for by Sheldon Adelson"" or ""Paid for by George Soros,"" so fewer of these ads were made. The only way to avoid having your name plastered across every ad was to give to the 527s, which claimed they could take unlimited money from individuals (including, sometimes, corporate and labor union money) on grounds that they were not PACs under the FEC's definition of PACs. These organizations were somewhat successful, but a legal cloud always hung over them. During the 2008 Democratic primary season, Bob Bauer, candidate Obama's lawyer, barged in on a pro-Hillary Clinton conference call to say that people giving to 527s to support Clinton could face criminal liability. After Citizens United, the courts (most importantly in Speechnow.org v. FEC) and the FEC provided a green light for super PACs to collect unlimited sums from individuals, labor unions, and corporations for unlimited independent spending. The theory was that, per Citizens United, if independent spending cannot corrupt, then contributions to fund independent spending cannot corrupt either. (I am quite critical of this theory about corruption, but that's besides the point here.) So what was once of questionable legality before the court's decision was fully blessed after Citizens United. But this logic has not stopped the Citizens United defenders from making their claims that there's no connection between the case and the emergence of super PACs. So let me try something different: a look at the numbers. The indispensable Center for Responsive Politics tracks all kinds of campaign finance and lobbying numbers at their Open Secrets website. One of the things they've followed is all the outside money spent in federal elections on election related ads. (To be technical, they include independent expenditures, electioneering communications, and member communications done by all groups aside from candidates and party committees.) Thanks to their work, we can compare all the outside spending so far in this election cycle to all the outside spending in previous election cycles up to March 8 of the election year; a real apples-to-apples comparison. Here's what we see: Let's focus only on presidential election years, to keep the comparisons as simple as possible. In the 1992 election season, when it was entirely possible (under that 1976 Supreme Court decision) for Sheldon Adelson or George Soros to spend unlimited sums independently on elections, total outside spending up to March 8 was about $1.5 million. In 2000, total outside spending up to March 8 was $2.6 million. In 2004 and 2008, with the explosion of 527 organizations, total spending to March 8 was $14 million and $37.5 million. What is the total for this election season through March 8? More than $88 million, 234 percent of 2008's numbers and 628 percent of 2004's.* If this was not caused by Citizens United, we have a mighty big coincidence on our hands. And, of course, this is only the total leading up to March 8, midway through the Republican primary. Wait until the super PACs and other organizations start raising their unlimited sums for the general election. Further, lots of groups are now using 501(c) organizations rather than super PACs for their campaign spending, in an effort to hide their donors. A Center for Responsive Politics study found that in 2010 the percentage of ""spending coming from groups that did not disclose their donors rose from 1 percent to 47 percent since the 2006 midterm elections,"" and ""501(c) non-profit spending increased from 0 percent of total spending by outside groups in 2006 to 42 percent in 2010."" The same report found that 72 percent ""of political advertising spending by outside groups in 2010 came from sources that were prohibited from spending money in 2006.""

With House and Senate seats also in play, and control of each chamber potentially up for grabs, we are likely to easily eclipse the total $301 million spent by outside groups in the entire 2008 election. How do I know? In 2010, a midterm congressional election year--when you would expect to see a dip in spending compared to a presidential year--total outside spending hit a record $304.6 million. It was an incredible number for a midterm election season.

Why did that happen? Citizens United was decided early in 2010. Correction, March 12, 2012: This article originally stated that total outside spending on elections as of March 8, 2012, was a 234 percent and 628 percent ""increase"" above total outside spending as of that date in 2008 and 2004, respectively. Spending as of that date this year was 234 percent and 628 percent of the figures for 2008 and 2004, not above. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

The number of KKK chapters dropped from 221 to 152 in just one year. Why is the Klan shrinking? Consolidation and defections. The Klan is not a stable organization. There's no real national leadership, and chapters are constantly appearing, disappearing, splitting, and merging. In 2010, to take one example, the True Invisible Empire Knights of Pulaski, Tenn., merged with the Traditional American Knights from Potosi, Mo. to form the True Invisible Empire Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. (Note: this link, like others in this article, leads to an extremist website.) Such mergers decrease the number of chapters without necessarily changing membership totals. Not all the Klan's losses are just on paper, though. Jeremy Parker, who led the Ohio-based Brotherhood of Klans, left the KKK for the Aryan Nations in 2010 and likely took a significant number of members with him. The Brotherhood of Klans was the second-largest Klan association in the country, with 38 chapters. Membership totals are hard to track, because the Klan doesn't willingly release member lists. Over the long term, the KKK is clearly contracting, since its rolls have shrunk from millions in the 1920s to between 3,000 and 5,000 today. But no one knows how membership has changed in the last few years. Klan-watchers, however, suspect that the nation's oldest domestic terrorist organization is indeed struggling to keep pace with other racist hate groups. Young racists tend to think of the Klan as their grandfathers' hate group, and of its members as rural, uneducated, and technologically unsophisticated. The Klan doesn't seem to have used the web and social media as well as its competitors. The group's failure to effectively deploy technology is a bit of an irony, since one of those newfangled motion pictures, The Birth of a Nation, launched the KKK's second era in 1915. The Klan's history of violence is another challenge to recruitment. The organization will always be associated with the lynching of innocent African-Americans in the 20th century, which puts off more moderate racists. The KKK is also suffering from a proliferation of competitors. People who wanted to join a white supremacist movement back in the 1920s didn't have a lot of choices. Today, there are countless options, enabling an extremist to find a group that matches his personal brand of intolerance. The more extreme groups in the burgeoning patriot movement cater to anti-Muslim, homophobic, and xenophobic sentiment, with less animosity toward African-Americans and Jews. Aryan Nations offers a heavy focus on Christian identity. Some groups preach more violence, while others offer a veneer of intellectualism. American Renaissance, for example, caters to ""suit-and-tie"" racists, offering pseudo-scientific papers on white supremacy. The group even holds conferences at a hotel near Dulles airport in Virginia. Many young racist activists aren't bothering to join groups at all anymore, further hampering the Klan's recruitment efforts. Former KKK Grand Wizard Don Black in 1995 launched the website Stormfront, which enables individuals in the white supremacist movement to share ideas and read news stories reported from a racist perspective. The community-building site, and others like it, lessens the need for racists to socialize at Klan barbecues or introduce their children to Klanta Klaus at the KKK Christmas rally.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/mitt_romney_narrowly_beats_rick_santorum_in_the_ohio_republican_primary_.html	"Who says Mitt Romney isn't exciting? He's making the Republican presidential campaign really exciting. Every time he seems within reach of locking down his gains and retaking his place as the inevitable nominee, his campaign hits a rocky patch. Romney won the Ohio primary by a prosciutto-thin margin, given that he out spent his rival Rick Santorum by 4-to-1. The victory in the most coveted Super Tuesday contest was the story of disaster narrowly averted. Santorum could tell a story of defying the odds and marvel at how far he'd come. He won three of the 10 races--with victories in Oklahoma, North Dakota, and Tennessee--and nearly claimed the big prize with a campaign operation held together by bailing wire and sturdy boards found at the roadside. The Republican presidential campaign is now a battle between a movement and mathematics. Santorum has the energy and support of the noisy part of the party--the Tea Party stalwarts and evangelicals for whom conviction and shared values are everything. Romney's ugly win in Ohio only continues to raise doubts about the soundness of his enterprise: Is he only ahead, eking out these victories, because he has an enormous advantage in money and organization, two things he won't have against Barack Obama? But let's not get carried away by the cinematic drama of the underdog story on the main stage. Romney won six states and a whole lot of delegates on Super Tuesday. What Romney has going for him is the math and that's what will ultimately determine the nominee. He leads in the delegates--more than twice as many as Santorum--and is likely to keep that lead even if his victory trophies require tweezers to hold them aloft. Before the Michigan primary last week, Romney said he wasn't willing to light his hair on fire to win the election. But in looking at Tuesday's exit polls, he must at least be ready to pull his hair out. Fifty-four percent of voters said the economy was the most important issue in determining their vote, and they voted for Romney by 41 percent to Santorum's 33 percent. Forty-two percent of voters in Ohio said they wanted a candidate who could beat Barack Obama. That was the top quality they sought in a candidate. Romney won in that group 52 percent to 27 percent. Voters also said they preferred a candidate with business experience over government experience by 64 percent to 27 percent. All of that would suggest a big Romney win, right? Nope. Voters want something else, too. In Ohio, the other half of the electorate cared about who was the true conservative, and Santorum crushed Romney 51 percent to 13 percent on that score. The 21 percent who cared about moral character likewise went for Santorum by 40 points over Romney, 60 percent to 19 percent. Ohio voters also felt like Santorum shares their concerns more than Romney, a big problem for Romney in a key bellwether state. The state has picked the president since 1964. The Republican candidate will have to beat Obama on that important economic question. That Romney can't convince members of his own party--particularly blue-collar voters he'll need in the general election--is not a good sign. If Romney couldn't claim roaring support in Ohio, it was hard to do so in the other places where he notched sure victories. He won in Virginia, where Ron Paul was his only competition. In Idaho, Mormons put him over the top. Massachusetts is his hometown and Vermont its neighbor. Good for the math but not momentum. Perhaps that's why Romney sounded more determined than elated Tuesday night. ""Tomorrow we wake up and we start again. And the next day we do the same,'' he said. ""And so it will go, day by day, step by step, door to door, heart to heart. There will be good days and bad days, always long hours, and never enough time.'' The Romney campaign is now going to start talking about Mitt Romney's favorite topic: numbers. They will argue that, after tonight's contests, the governor will have a lead in delegates too big for his opponents to overcome in future contests. The experts say this too, by the way. As well as Santorum may have performed, he is even more limited than Romney in his ability to reach outside the very conservative base of his support. Santorum will not be on the ballot in the District of Columbia and won't compete for a full slate of delegates in Illinois. In the future states that are winner-take-all, like Utah, Delaware, and New Jersey, Romney has strong organizations, and the electorates are more favorable to him. Even in states like Tennessee and Georgia where Romney lost, he was able to draw some delegates, making it harder for his opponents to overtake him. Santorum is going to start feeling the pressure from Republicans who say he should hang it up to keep from damaging Romney too much. The math is inevitable, so all he'll do is weaken Romney in his ultimate contest against Obama. Romney is already suffering from the bruising primary battle. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Romney's unfavorable rating has grown to 39 percent. His favorable rating is only 28 percent. The longer the battle drags on, the less time Romney will have to raise money and repair the damage done by the primaries. The Romney campaign never wanted to be seen arguing that Romney was inevitable. Now they're doing just that. It's a version of the argument that the Obama campaign made in 2008 when it tried to get Hillary Clinton to turn around her campaign bus. The key difference is that Barack Obama was filling stadiums of rabid supporters at the time. Mitt Romney is not burdened with this problem. ""That's not a very inspiring message,"" said Santorum spokesman Hogan Gidley of Romney's claim of mathematical certitude. Santorum's aides argued after the close call that if it were a head-to-head contest (i.e., no Newt Gingrich), Santorum would have won in Ohio and would go on to win future states. Regardless of Gingrich's decision, Santorum's aides say he will stay in the race to be a voice for conservatives who they say are still suspicious of Romney. Thirty-eight percent of voters said Romney's positions were not conservative enough, the highest of any of the candidates. (Only 17 percent said that of Santorum.) Forty-one percent of Ohio voters said they had reservations about the candidate they supported. Of that group, 42 percent felt that way about Romney. Of course, Santorum can't go too far with this. Thirty-eight percent of those voters have doubts about him, too. Santorum tried to give new reasons to be suspicious of the front-runner on Super Tuesday. He highlighted newly discovered videos in which Romney said he supported the individual health care mandate that is the central horrid element for Republicans in Obama's health care plan. Romney has said he never advocated for an individual mandate at the national level. Not once. Not even in a joke alone before bedtime. But the videos suggest otherwise. ""We need a candidate who can be honest with the American people,"" says Santorum. The Pennsylvania senator has long claimed that Romney's support of the individual mandate made him an imperfect messenger in a battle with Barack Obama over his health care plan. Now he's turning up the attack: He's saying Romney is dishonest. Santorum will press this case all the way to the convention, say aides. The hope is that the senator will be able to win enough contests to deny Romney the 1,144 delegates he needs to win the nomination. If they can make it to the convention, they'll fight it out there, trying to persuade unpledged delegates. The next set of contests in Kansas, Mississippi, and Alabama have lots of socially conservative and evangelical voters who have been cool if not hostile to Romney. Romney will have to endure a stretch where movement conservatives may appear stronger than the party regulars who rally around his mathematical candidacy of inevitability. On Super Tuesday, Romney won the second hard-fought primary in a row, a first for this Chutes and Ladders campaign where every time a candidate skips his way out of the winner circle, he falls in the next contest. But the games aren't over. And, unfortunately for Romney, neither is the excitement."	Even As He Wins, Can Romney Afford More Victories Like Ohio?	['Romney', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Hogan', 'Obama']	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/rick_santorum_is_trying_to_win_super_tuesday_by_playing_the_underdog_.html	"Zanesville, Ohio--I am my campaign. That was Rick Santorum's message at the Dayton Christian School in Miamisburg, Ohio, the day before Super Tuesday. The former Pennsylvania senator recounted how pundits had sniffed at him and how he'd been down in the polls for so long. But he slogged on, as he does today, even though he says he's being outspent 12-to-1 in this key battleground state. Only someone who could muscle through so much adversity can beat Barack Obama, he tells the crowds. As another sign of his determination, Santorum says he has turned down job offers and spent his life savings to run this race. ""I come to the people of Ohio as a candidate who shouldn't be here,"" he said. ""But we're here for a reason, because of ... enthusiasm and grit. Growing up in a steel worker town, growing up having to fight for everything you got is exactly the kind of person we need to have not just in the White House ... but in this election. Not someone who can buy it, but someone who knows you have to earn it. You have to fight for America."" It's a good story. This is what Americans want in their politics and their movie heroes. We root for truth triumphing against all odds. We want Rocky Balboa to win the fight. It is the story of America, as Santorum points out at an American Legion hall in Westerville later in the day--the story of his grandfather who worked in the coal mines to build a better life. The question going into Super Tuesday is whether Republicans will back the plucky underdog with the good story or Mitt Romney, the polished, well-financed much-anticipated champion who is pounding him at every commercial break on television. The answer will determine whether Santorum leaves Ohio with a new shot at the presidency or a steak on his eye and an A for effort. Right now the polls show a tight race. On Monday, four new ones came out--NBC Quinnipiac, CNN, and Suffolk University--and each one showed a tie or a tie within the margin of error. Still, pollsters and GOP insiders seem to think Romney has the momentum, as Santorum's lead has shrunk in recent days. Then again, momentum has meant very little in this campaign. Santorum gives a rousing speech that's much better than the one Mitt Romney offers. He meanders sometimes, as if he's trying to check every Obama outrage off his list. But his talks have an appealing structure and rhythm. Here's the short version, delivered using Santorum's favorite speaking tic: I shouldn't have made it so far, but I have. Why? Because I speak the truth about Obama's government overreach. Why? Because I am the true conservative in this race. Why? Because I'm one of you. Why? Because I am the grandson of a coal miner who came to America and made a better life for himself. Why? Because America is the beacon of freedom and opportunity on the earth. Why? Because people who held convictions tight and didn't let go fought despite all the odds--the way I am now in this campaign. At his packed Ohio rallies, voters in winter coats whistle as they applaud this tale of principle, faith, and truth against identifiable foes: the media, the establishment, and the timid. He's got the rank-and-file conservatives, evangelical voters, and Tea Party stalwarts. For these voters, his candidacy is exciting. But Santorum's challenge in Ohio is to reach beyond his base. What's hard to divine is whether he is lighting a brushfire or simply preaching to the choir? Is he reaching voters concerned about the economy? Can he win over voters who care most about beating Barack Obama? At these final rallies before Super Tuesday, Santorum tries to answer those questions. He will draw the starkest contrast with Barack Obama on the issue of health care and government overreach. Only with a Republican candidate who offers clear contrasts will general election voters be tempted to turn away from Obama. But it's a bank shot. Santorum has an economic plan centered around lower taxes and a zero percent tax rate for manufacturers, but the rhetoric and passion that gets his crowds worked up isn't about the economy. The enthusiasm and energy at his rallies is for his rock-solid social conservatism, which may be why he has had trouble reaching those voters for whom the economy is the central issue. On the eve of the vote, Santorum seemed to be feeling the limitations of his own reach, redefining victory for ABC's Jonathan Karl. ""We're winning,"" Santorum said. ""Whether we end up with the most votes or not [in Ohio], we're winning."" To fight through the current wave of negative attacks, Santorum could use Mitt Romney's focus. The former governor rarely wavers from making his central case that his private sector experience gives him a special insight into the economic problems of the day. For Romney, focus is both a tactic and his message: ""Sometimes we got involved in businesses that were in trouble. We used to have ... three rules for turning around an enterprise in trouble, and the rules were these: focus, focus, and focus. Focus your energy on those things that are most important, focus on your key customers, get your best products out to the people who need those products. Make those products the best in the world: focus."" Romney gets to values issues through his economic pitch. Santorum does the reverse. It certainly doesn't make Romney's audiences as emotionally invested as Santorum's Rocky Balboa underdog story makes his. But for an electorate that has consistently listed beating Barack Obama as its top priority, it's worth remembering that in the end, Rocky lost and Apollo Creed won."	Will Super Tuesday Voters Buy Santorum's Underdog Routine?	['Obama', 'Romney', 'Dayton']	[]
29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/the_definition_of_a_winner_has_become_elusive_in_this_year_s_republican_primary_.html	"A win is a win. Mitt Romney's advisers reminded us of this after his Michigan victory. They had to resort to this tautology because there was some doubt. Romney received more votes than anyone else, but the question was whether he won by enough and in the right way. Then, along came Rick Santorum a day after the vote to claim that no, he had won in Michigan because he'd received as many delegates as Romney had.* The definition of winning in politics has always been a little slippery. In 1968, Sen. Eugene McCarthy lost to Lyndon Johnson in the New Hampshire primary. But he did so well against an incumbent president, he was considered the winner. Lamar Alexander came in third in the Iowa caucus in 1996--but he won the lion's share of the political coverage for coming out of nowhere. The definition of winning in this year's Republican primary has become more elusive than ever, in part because there is no dominant front-runner and the GOP is so sharply divided. Super Tuesday on March 6 will really stretch our definition of winning. Voters will cast ballots in 10 states across the country. It's the closest thing we have to a national primary. But it will present at least two fundamental contests: the battle between Mitt Romney and his rivals as well as the battle between Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich to be crowned the sole conservative alternative to Romney. When the votes are totaled, it's possible that each candidate will have done well enough that after they boast about their victories, it will seem like a children's soccer league where everyone is a winner. The key variable in determining whether a ""win is a win"" is expectations. If a candidate does well where he is not supposed to do well, that's a win. If he doesn't do well where he's supposed to do well, that's a loss. Meanwhile, delegates are won and lost. That's the rock solid number that will determine the nominee. That is the only number that matters, and yet sometimes it seems it doesn't matter at all. If you're confused, here's a short guide to the different kinds of winning and why some are held in higher favor than others: States you're supposed to win: On Super Tuesday, Mitt Romney will win in Massachusetts and probably in Vermont. Because these are not considered competitive states, he will get very little credit for these wins. Romney is in competition with himself in the eyes of analysts, reporters, and pundits: He must overcome his weakness with conservatives. Beating Santorum like a drum in Arizona for some reason doesn't matter if the lack of competition doesn't tell us anything about Romney's chances to go the distance. States where you have limited competition: On Tuesday, Mitt Romney will almost certainly win in Virginia. That's because Ron Paul is the only other name on the ballot. Everyone expects this. So, when Romney's victory is announced, it won't seem like a big deal because it won't tell us anything about Romney's ability to compete head-to-head with his opponents for the votes of persuadable voters. Also, Romney is ""winning"" merely because he had his act together and could get on the ballot. But presidents should have their act together. It's an attribute to be prized in the Oval Office. Just because the other candidates couldn't manage the process doesn't mean Romney should be stripped of credit for winning in a key swing state. Home state wins: Losing your home state is deadly, but winning doesn't get you a big bounce because local advantages limit the ability to use the electorate in the state as a fair test of a candidate's broader appeal. Newt Gingrich is going to run into this problem if all he does is win Georgia on Tuesday. That's not going to relaunch him.  The home state snooze is why when Mitt Romney came back to life by winning Michigan it didn't fully eliminate doubts about his ability to rally his party. So, by this logic, shouldn't Rick Santorum get some credit for coming so close because Romney had so many advantages? Time for another election cliche: Coming close only matters in hand grenades and horseshoes. Winning ugly: That was the headline of at least two stories describing Romney's victory in Michigan. This condition is achieved when you are victorious but you look so ghoulish in doing so you diminish the glory of the prize. Romney aired a ton of negative ads which underlined the fact that Romney has trouble with his party--he can only build himself up by tearing others down. Also, winning ugly can have far-reaching consequences if a candidate's tactics in close-quarters combat tarnish his image with independent voters who will help determine who wins in the fall. Momentum wins: If McCarthy only came close in 1968 and was considered a winner, why not Santorum in Michigan? Because Santorum needed something to boost his campaign beyond being a nagging threat to Romney. Only a win could have done that. Santorum benefited from momentum wins in Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri, but once he'd shown he could hit solid singles, the donors, media, and voters wanted to see him hit a home run. Delegate wins: In the end, this is the only number that really matters. But until a candidate gets within range of the 1,144 delegates needed to get the nomination, the number isn't that important. That's why Santorum's claim that he'd won Michigan because he'd tied Romney in delegates wasn't convincing to many people. It certainly didn't convince Joe Scarborough and Charles Krauthammer, not exactly well-known liberals. It was unconvincing because Santorum is never going to get the big dose of delegates if he can't prove that he's a viable long-term candidate. He didn't show that he could expand his appeal beyond strong conservatives in Michigan. That's a threat to his future that no ""delegate win"" can paper over. Also, a few weeks before Santorum had upended the race by winning in Colorado, Minnesota, and Minnesota, states that weren't handing out delegates. After those wins, the Romney team tried unconvincingly to say Santorum's wins were meaningless because they didn't affect the final delegate count. Few bought that logic, either. The promised land for Romney is when he wins enough delegates that it becomes impossible for an opponent to accumulate enough delegates even if they win the popular vote in future states. You may remember this formula from the Democratic race in 2008. Hillary Clinton kept winning, but because Obama had won enough delegates, those wins didn't count for much. Demographic wins: One of the reasons some consider Romney the legitimate Michigan winner is that he won among those voters who identify themselves as Republicans. Romney has had a problem with his party regulars who don't think he is conservative enough so besting Santorum by ten points with this group counteracted the storyline. Gaining the support of the rank-and-file was a sign that he knows how to fix that problem and that he won't be hurt in the general election by an unenthusiastic base. Santorum lost Michigan, by contrast, because he couldn't build support outside of his clubhouse, those voters who identify themselves as strong supporters of the Tea Party or as ""strongly conservative."" Of all the candidates competing on Super Tuesday, Rick Santorum may have the hardest task. He is fighting a two-front war in Ohio against Romney and in Tennessee and Oklahoma against Gingrich. In part that's because Romney isn't expected to win in the South, the same way Gingrich and Santorum aren't expected to win in the Northeast. Though, if Romney doesn't win in Ohio--even if he does well elsewhere--nothing will beat back another round  of stories saying that he's just too weak to be the Republican front-runner. He'll have to point to his previous victories and explain why a loss isn't a loss. Footnote: Santorum made the claim that he won when the Michigan delegate count was 15-15. The Michigan Republican Party said they were incorrect in their initial interpretation of the rules on allocation of delegates, and the final tally should be Romney 16 and Santorum 14. Santorum, deprived of this ""win,"" is hopping mad about it. (Return to sentence.)"	In the GOP Primary, how do you define a winner?	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'McCarthy', 'Paul', 'Obama', 'Alexander']	[]
