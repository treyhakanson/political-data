Barack Obama's acceptance speech Thursday at the Democratic National Convention didn't have any fireworks. But viewers were clearly persuaded by the new, slightly battle-worn Obama: Last night our Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll registered its most decisive results yet. When we asked, ""Did President Barack Obama's speech make you more or less likely to vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden in the upcoming election,"" a record 45.4 percent noted they were ""much more likely"" to vote for 4 four more years. Combined with the 13.1 percent who chose ""slightly more likely,"" that pushes the number of Americans encouraged by Obama's words to 58.5 percent--two points higher than Bill Clinton's score from Wednesday. Just over more than 17 percent remained undecided, and around 24 percent reported that the president's speech had pushed them away from the Democratic ticket. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) As the last pieces of confetti are vacuumed from the floor of Time Warner Arena in Charlotte, N.C., conversation will turn to what (if any) boost the convention gave Democrats. Our results indicate that the DNC left 45.1 percent of viewers far more likely to support Obama and Biden in November and 12.7 percent slightly more likely. Another 15.7 percent was unmoved by the proceedings, and around 26 percent were repelled. These numbers represent a victory over the Republicans, who in Tampa inspired only 33.9 percent of respondents to cast their ballots for Romney and Ryan. A nearly identical number, 32.8 percent,  felt alienated by the proceedings. Over the past two weeks, a parade of speakers have come forward to try to win us over. Teleprompters were fired up (and sometimes ignored)  as a mesmerizing rain of truths and half-truths were heard by anyone willing to listen. So who said it best? Which of the marquee speakers moved the needle furthest? To calculate our convention speaker rankings, we totaled the number of positive responses to each address, adding together the survey takers who were either ""much more likely"" or ""slightly more likely"" to support the ticket after hearing the pols talk. Here's what we found: The POTUSObama led the pack with the aforementioned 58.5 percent enthusiasm rating. Next came the Cicero of the South, Bill Clinton, with 56.8 percent. Completing the Democratic sweep, Michelle Obama won 49.4 percent of respondents to her husband's side. Among Republicans, Mitt Romney persuaded 43.4 percent of survey takers to support his candidacy. Paul Ryan charmed 42.5 percent with a gutsy blend of fact and fiction. Ann Romney loved women and snagged 41.1 percent of viewers. GOP keynote speaker Chris Christie came in last, motivating only 40.6 percent of respondents to his party's ticket. But there was still one more question to be asked: ""Who do you believe delivered the better speech--Bill Clinton or Barack Obama?"" It wasn't close. Nearly 45 percent chose Bubba, while 24.8 percent opted for Barack and 30.4 percent sat on the fence. Say what you will, but there's still nothing like a Bill Clinton speech."	Who Were the Best Speakers--In Either Convention?

When he was denied the chance to speak in the elements at Bank of America stadium this week, the closed venue seemed fitting. Obama's speech to the 2012 Democratic National Convention, like his presidency, has a lid on it. It was workmanlike from a president who had to strain with the reality of being in office. ""The times have changed,"" he said, ""and so have I."" At his 2008 address in Denver, audience members cried at the end of his speech. Tonight, one delegate said Biden had been more inspiring. Another said Bill Clinton's speech was the one she would be sending around to barber shops and beauty parlors. Speaking from behind a lectern that looked like the protective cardboard sleeve on a coffee cup, the president arrived to thunderous applause. A sea of blue signs that read ""Forward"" rose in the crowd. That was the task of the night, to explain how he would move the country forward. It was the president's intention to outsource the job to the audience. ""You can choose that future,"" he said repeatedly to the audience. It was the logical extension of slogans that started with ""Win the Future"" and ""Forward."" The president gave a Robert Frost address, a choice for voters to pick between one of two roads: ""On every issue, the choice you face won't be just between two candidates or two parties. It will be a choice between two different paths for America. A choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future."" The vision the president outlined was formed around five goals in manufacturing, energy, education, national security, and the deficit. After his campaign criticized Romney for not being specific, Obama was not much more so. He talked a lot about the goals, just as Romney had (he had five goals, too), but there wasn't a lot of specificity about how those goals would be achieved. (Let us pause here to note that Sen. Obama was no paragon of white papers either; his campaign of hope and change was not founded on gritty specifics.) 

If the Obama team hadn't made such a big deal about specificity, this wouldn't be a big deal. Convention speeches aren't bullet point affairs, but while this speech was more specific than Romney's plan (not hard, that), it wasn't a clear path out of the woods. Being specific about how great your goals are is not the same as being specific about the hard road required to get there. But if talking straight with the voters is the measure of a president, then Obama was far straighter than his Republican rival. Romney and Ryan talked about hard choices, but only in the abstract, never really pointing out that it was the people who would have to endure the hard results of those choices. Obama was more up front. Restoring the middle-class dream would require sacrifice and struggle from everyone, the president said. ""The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place."" This speech was more like the one he gave on election night in Chicago: hard, clear-eyed, and earthbound. Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney wanted points at their convention for the promise that they would tackle hard truths once they got into office. Obama wanted points for already having embraced hard truths. ""I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy. I never have. You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth."" Of course, he had to say this. People are already struggling. Obama was wrapping their current condition in a noble struggle. That's better than seeing their current struggle as the result of his failed policies. The president was asking for patience. In that context, hardship is proof that progress is being made. The long slog to a better place is underway. For Republicans, the frustration people feel should be the verdict. But if the president didn't sketch a clear road map, it might not matter. The future is on its way. The budget deficits are unsustainable, entitlement programs and the inneficient tax code have to be reformed. Lawmakers are either going to do it or reality is going to do it for them. That means even if you don't put much stock in either man's plan for the future, one of them is going to be on the job when the hard choices are made about what to fund and how to reform taxes. If that's the case, then voters will need to pick the president they think will protect their way of life. ""Over the next few years, big decisions will be made in Washington, on jobs and the economy; taxes and deficits; energy and education; war and peace,"" the president said. ""Decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our children's lives for decades to come."" In that world, voters may pick Barack Obama not because they believe in his specific path, but because they trust his instincts to find a path in the messy future to come. After all the talk about choices, the president did reach for an inspirational argument when he talked about the responsibilities of ""citizenship."" There is a battle going on with Mitt Romney to define the race in the most fundamental themes of the American experience. Romney picks freedom. Obama chose citizenship. That's what was at the heart of his ""you didn't build that claim,"" which he tried to wash away with plenty of references to entrepreneurship, small business, and companies that make goods in America. The president also nodded several times to independent votes by saying that government was not the answer to all of life's problems. ""We, the people, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me, a freedom without commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense."" Stirring, but also harsh. He's essentially saying that Republicans aren't patriots. At another point in the speech he used the same construction to lump those who want limited government in with bigots. The most amusing was his claim that Republicans are so wedded to tax cuts that if you have a cold they would prescribe ""two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning."" He used a lot of humor when pinging Romney, mocking his foreign policy experience. ""My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy,"" he said, before dressing them in short pants. ""You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally."" I thought it was Mitt Romney's argument that lack of experience in a field was disqualifying? If both men agree on that, then Romney would seem to be in the better position, since his business experience out-paces Obama's complete lack of the same. The sluggish recovery over which the president has presided is far more serious to voters than a few gaffes on a trip abroad. Earlier in the evening, when a video played telling the origin story of the ""fired up ready to go"" chant, the hall stood and responded in a roar. It was a crowd ready to be moved, but the president's speech only approached lift-off at the end, when he talked about the hope he had found in Americans keeping up their struggle. ""I'm hopeful because of you,"" he said. I thought he might conclude his list of people who gave him hope with a nod to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Earlier, the gunshot victim had appeared on stage to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. After two conventions full of talk of hard choices and bravery, here was an example of it in living color. In the middle of weeks of deception, bloviating, and Grade A hokum, it was one true thing. Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention."

 conversation: The Democrats know how to put on a better convention.
 And I'll cite an unexpected piece of evidence: Charlie Crist's speech. Last week I asked if there was any way for anyone to successfully play
 the convention apostate without exposing the opportunist inevitably
 hiding beneath the surface. Artur Davis clearly failed the test in 
Tampa: He attacked Obama and Democrats with the zeal of the most
 craven convert. He sounded like any angry Obama-hating Republican. He didn't tell a story of how he got from there to here, even though
 the fact that he had made that migration was the only reason he was on 
stage at all. Crist began with the tiresome ""the party left me"" bit, but actually
 told it as a story. He explained why he supported the stimulus when
 others in his party didn't. (It wasn't necessarily a moment of great
 courage, just that Crist was oblivious to the opprobrium that would 
come, to him and the bill he endorsed.) He talked about the hug with
 which he greeted Obama when the new president came to the state, an
 image that became conservative critics' favorite symbol of Crist's
 accommodationism. ""That hug caused me more grief from my former party 
than you can ever imagine,"" he said. The speech was dour by the standards of the usually sunny Crist. There
 was none of the fury that has become the signature of Davis' attacks 
on his former party.  And he started off with a necessary concession,
 but one that made him a plausible narrator: ""I'll be honest with you,
 I don't agree with President Obama about everything."" The speech was unremarkable but dutiful. Here was a liberal former
 Republican testifying to his personal experience with what Bill
 Clinton and other speakers have argued throughout the week: that
 Republicans had lost their way. Nothing he said is likely to make
 news on its own, but it offered detail and example to buttress one of
 the week's recurring secondary themes. Its speaker made one point for
 which he was uniquely qualified, and he nailed the tone. I speculated earlier in the week that the incoherence of Tampa may 
have been tactical. If breaking a convention into a lot of
 unconnected nuggets is the tactic, Democrats aren't going along.
 They've tried to tell a story, and the secondary characters played
 their roles. Sasha Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention."	Dispatches From the Democratic National Convention

There's no scientifically valid way of figuring out, in real time, whether people pay much attention to the Twitter Track news cycle. If they did, the stories today were 1) the controlled disaster of the Bank of America stadium cancelation, 2) the timing of Joe Biden's speech (after 9 o'clock, which means two of the networks will skip it), and 3) whether or not it would rain. The weather issues have cut down mightily on the advantage of being here. Instead of gossiping about the speeches and parties, first, strangers talk about the weather. I have spilled forth before, on this very table, about the pointlessness of the ""optics"" discussion. Four years after the 2008 DNC, Republicans are still joking about Obama's ""greek columns."" They tried to flip that conversation this time by speculating that Democrats were never going to fill BOA stadium. It's great for partisans, but who really cares? We're not going to remember staging, and we may only remember a couple of zingers. What matters is whether Obama makes the sustained ""Romney's horrible, and we've dug out of the crisis while killing a bunch of terrorists"" case. Go back to that 2008 Obama speech. Reading it now, I still like the poetry of the close--""in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess."" But the rest of the memorable lines were all campaign shells and missiles. ""The same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third."" He evoked Phil Gramm's Washington Times roundtable--the ""nation of whiners"" comment. This was all bound up in a biographical story that seemed like the only thing possibly keeping Obama from victory. His grandfather in ""Patton's army,"" his intermittently single mom, the unfairness of the ""celebrity"" ad. I'd guess that we'll hear the first material and little of the second. Bill Clinton's success proved that you can sell the Obama record if you present it as a secret kept from voters by a bunch of pomaded liars. Make the fact-checkers explain whether the job creation numbers are true. (They will be, mostly.) Remind people that you couldn't do anything to stop the recession until January 2009--or maybe start the clock even later, after the stimulus passed. Any economic proposal will be received as new, because Romney's been making fun of the guy for having no ideas whatsoever. OK, fine, one more thing about optics. Democrats won't have to worry about bored delegates or empty seats. The floor was shut down to reporters at 6 p.m., more than four hours before Obama was set to speak. On the way into the arena, I passed by half a dozen people (all African-American) asking for tickets. One of them used a white board to tell us she was appealing to God to rescue those left outside. And once I let five security guards finger my press pass (the image is raised, like the cover of a special edition mid-'90s Image comic), a colleague told me that, if I looked harder, I'd see a ridiculous number of people swapping passes for better access. Anyway, don't get rid of the hash and incense. Save it for a few hours. Slip it to some governors at an after-party. Let Americans Come Together, for the sake of hilarity.

Michelle Obama may have dazzled the DNC on Tuesday, but Wednesday night a maestro took to the podium. Bill Clinton spoke for 49 minutes--and left Democrats wanting more. As John Dickerson pointed out, Bubba managed to convince Americans they are better off, extol the forgotten art of cooperation, and demonstrate how the president's homegrown values shape his policies. All the while, he bathed the crowd in his signature charisma, handing them one ad-libbed line after another. (That takes some brass!) It's a good thing our polling equipment can withstand large outpourings of enthusiasm. For Wednesday night's Slate/SurveyMonkey's snap poll, we asked, ""Did Bill Clinton's speech make you more or less likely to vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden in the upcoming election?"" An astounding 39.2 percent of respondents reported that they were ""much more likely"" to support the incumbents. If you add the 17.6 percent who felt ""slightly more likely"" to support the Democratic ticket, Bubba's words made 56.8 percent of viewers inclined to vote for Obama and Biden in November. By any measure, a command performance. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Of course, Clinton had most of the crowd eating out of his hand before he even got to the microphone. More than 46 percent of respondents believe that Clinton was a better president than Obama. (Roughly a third hold the opposite opinion, and 21 percent aren't sure.) Perhaps this is slightly unfair: The former POTUS, who enjoys a 69 percent favorability rating, shines bright for the era of economic prosperity over which he presided. (In a self-aware moment, Clinton told the audience: ""No president--not me, not any of my predecessors--could have fully repaired all the damage that [Obama] found in just four years."") On Wednesday we hailed a radiant, genuine performance by Michelle Obama--one that inspired 49.4 percent of survey takers to join Team Barack. The first lady's speech scored better than any speech we had heard from either convention. So our third question aimed to assess how she did against a certified master of the art. We asked: ""First Lady Michelle Obama spoke on Tuesday night of the DNC. Former President Bill Clinton spoke on Wednesday night. Who do you believe delivered the better speech--Michelle Obama or Bill Clinton?"" Here, the silver-tongued fella from Arkansas won the day, as 49.8 percent of survey takers chose his address over the first lady's. Another 24.6 percent remained undecided, and 26 percent thought Michelle, the underdog, prevailed. But Thursday night is the main event. It will answer the question now looming over Charlotte: Is Obama as good at talking about his record as Bill Clinton?"	Who Was Better--Bill Clinton or Michelle Obama?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/democratic_national_convention_gay_is_good_for_america_.html	"Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention. More than a dozen speakers mentioned LGBT equality on the first two nights of the Democratic convention, including Michelle Obama, who positioned marriage equality as a new ingredient of American greatness: ""If proud Americans can be who they are and boldly stand at the altar with who they love, then surely, surely we can give everyone in this country a fair chance at that great American Dream."" Openly gay speakers are getting primetime billing. A record-setting 8 percent of delegates are LGBT. The party's unprecedented embrace of gay equality comes a week after Joe Biden thanked gay rights advocates in Provincetown for ""freeing the soul of the American people."" The gay rights movement, said the vice president, was advancing the ""civil rights of every straight American."" For gay people's ""courage,"" he said, ""We owe you."" There you have it: For the first time ever, Democrats at their most public, high-profile moment are treating gay rights as a political winner. They're moving along with public opinion: In the latest Harris Interactive poll, 52 percent of likely voters favored same-sex marriage, including 70 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of independents. If the gay love affair is part political calculation, it also reflects a lesson from both American history and queer theory: minorities need not always conform to the majority, and their advances can actually make things better for everyone. This message helps rewrite the false script conservatives have created (with too much help from liberals) that representing the needs of minorities is mere interest-group politics, the doling out of goodies in exchange for votes. Instead, equality is increasingly--and correctly--cast as a means of improving not only the lot of minorities, but the country for us all. New York magazine recently reported the trend of a growing number of straight couples quoting gay marriage court decisions in their own wedding ceremonies. Expanding access appears to be rejuvenating rather than destroying the institution. As Slate reported earlier this year, statistics bear this out. The marriage rate in Massachusetts, the first state to allow gay couples to wed, actually went up in the years same-sex marriage became legal, even adjusting for the initial 16 percent increase caused by pent-up demand by gay couples waiting to wed. What's more, in each of the five states that legalized same-sex marriage starting in 2004, divorce rates dropped even while the average rate across the country rose. These figures give the lie to breathless warnings that same-sex marriage will harm marriage. Also, an estimated 2 million kids have a parent who is LGBT, and a subset of them have two gay parents who are raising them together--for all the reasons conservatives praise marriage, these kids benefit when their parents can make their commitments legal, another benefit to LGBT equality that goes beyond the rights of gays themselves. Add to the list the end of ""don't ask, don't tell."" The policy deprived the nation of thousands of capable service members across its 17 years--on average, two were kicked out every day, at a taxpayer cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Many were mission-critical specialists with skills like Arabic translation and counterterrorism expertise. Today our military can harness that talent. And now that the controversy has been resolved, elite colleges that used to supply our military with top talent are again welcoming recruiters whom they'd moved off campus due to their discriminatory policy. Equal rights fosters openness, which has positive fallout of its own. There are no doubt fewer sham marriages than there were in the 1950s. Gay-straight friendships are more authentic without a lifelong secret blocking discussion about love and intimacy. Straight men are likely more forgiving of their own nonconformist impulses--perhaps including passing same-sex desires. Parents have fewer estranged relations with sons and daughters whose deepest secrets and fears they once could never know, and whose struggles with depression and loneliness they sought in vain to understand. And the nation has embarked on an important discussion about bullying and youth suicide that stands to have real benefits for all young people, not just LGBT ones, who feel despair because they sense they are different or alone. The principle that minority equality helps the majority was one of Martin Luther King Jr.'s most important insights during the black civil rights movement. ""The stirring lesson of this age,"" King declared, ""is that mass nonviolent direct action is not a peculiar device for Negro agitation,"" but a ""method for defending freedom and democracy, and for enlarging these values for the benefit of the whole society."" As the historian, Taylor Branch has explained, ""The civil rights movement liberated segregationists themselves,"" just as King had theorized. Racial terrorism dropped and integration led to business growth and a decline in poverty. Enfranchised black voters helped revive a genuine two-party political system in the South as the politics of white supremacy faded. Meritocracy replaced arbitrary exclusion. In 2009, Brent Childers, a Southern Baptist and onetime anti-gay bigot, wrote movingly in Newsweek of the kind of personal liberation that both King and Biden described: ""Once I walked away from the Church's teachings of rejection and condemnation [of gay people], my relationship with God transcended to a higher spiritual plateau."" Childers' religious transformation is a secular experience for many others. But the point is the same. Americans suffer for holding prejudices that we know enough to shed. The souls of Americans really do need freeing. And the battle for gay rights is helping. It's good for the Democrats that they've figured this out. More importantly, it's good for the country."

Nobody had one. Re-reading Sandra Fluke's address (in prime time, why, again?) did not cut it. Luckily for us, the prepared text was almost useless. Clinton rewrote it in real time. The most common addition was now, as a little rev-up before the wordy paragraphs. ""That brings me to health care"" became ""Now, that brings me to health care,"" and so on. If there was a stock phrase, Clinton reached for Mark Twain's Book of Overstatements, and replaced the boring stuff. The text: ""I believe that with all my heart."" The speech: ""Whether you believe it or not, I just want you to know, with all my heart, that I believe it. I believe it. Let me tell you why I believe it."" Text: ""It gets worse."" Speech: ""Folks, this is serious, because it gets worse. And you won't be laughing when I finish with this."" From the Issenberg-Weigel seats in the press box, you could see the teleprompter stop short every time Clinton went off on a tangent. Eventually, we got pages, too--the four of them took 49 minutes to read. Clinton never lost the audience. No surprise, obviously, even though no one will let Clinton forget the time he gave a speech for Michael Dukakis and rambled past the ""wrap it up"" lights. (Actual AP headline: ""Clinton's boring speech in 1988 hurt his image."") What was a 3,136-word speech became at least 5,600 words. What did Clinton do with all the extra verbiage? He served up policy-wonking with cornpone. Democrats badly needed this. I wrote earlier today about how they've completely given up on name-checking the stimulus and instead tried to tell little stories about the stuff Republicans haven't scandalized. This, they believe, is because Republicans are better at framing up government programs than they are--conservatives make the initiatives sound wasteful before those programs can sound like anything else. Clinton has the same skill. He was given a pretty dense line about Medicare, explaining that the $712 billion allegedly ""stolen from Medicare"" by Democrats actually cut payments to providers. He added: ""That's the same attack they leveled against the Congress in 2010. And they got a lot of votes on it. But it's not true."" And when he was done explaining that Paul Ryan's budget included the same cuts, he added: ""You gotta give 'em one thing, it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did."" Rahm Emanuel, front and center for the speech, bent over laughing at this. Has any Democrat previously made that point and not sounded wimpy? The most effective use of cornpone came with the welfare lines. Again, liberals had been waiting for this. They have trouble getting voters to believe that the black president would never ever weaken welfare-to-work. Clinton explained that the reform was tied to employment increases, then ad-libbed: So this is personal to me. We moved millions of people off welfare. It was one of the reasons that in the eight years I was president, we had a hundred times as many people move out of poverty into the middle class than happened under the previous 12 years, a hundred times as many. It's a big deal.  That ""personal"" touch--in a time when a documentary about his alleged anti-colonialism can be a hit, that's what Obama's been missing.

The proud references to gay rights and contraception are a big move away from the post-1988, DLC'd Democratic Conventions, aren't they? The difference seems to be that Democrats now think they win when they needle Republicans on gay marriage or abortion. When I ran into Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick earlier today, another reporter asked him where the pride had come from. ""I didn't mention it because it's a political winner,"" he said. ""I mentioned it because it's commensurate with our values in this country."" In other words, yes--it's good politics. I think the conventioneers are loving it. The ""big"" news this morning was that the final night of events would be crammed into the too-small Time Warner Center instead of the too-large Bank of America Stadium. Those months of jokes about the stadium's name, hundreds of thousands of dollars in prep, tens of thousands of ""community"" tickets, probably some fireworks--all wasted. The ""optics"" of this are terrible. The word optics makes me want to climb a rusty ladder and jump off into a bag of in-heat tarantulas--but I agree. Still, the delegates are awfully brave-faced about it. A lot of it has to do with those social issue rah-rahs that Sasha was talking about. There are other reasons. One delegate told me he'd be happy to avoid yet more of the humidity he's had to endure all week, from security gate to bus to security gate. DuBose Porter, the former Georgia House minority leader, told me he ""felt bad for the president"" and bad for people in his own state who were hoping to bus up and watch it. ""They'd come even if there's some way for them to view it nearby, in different rooms. We've got hotel ballrooms, right?"" We do. The weather-change story is just one of today's perfect, frothy convention distractions. The other one is the ongoing epic battle over how the wording on the platform's Israel sections changed from 2008--how it has been watered down and no longer mentions Hamas or Jerusalem. Neither story will affect more than a few thousand people. But here's what amazes me. Both came as total surprises in a city currently occupied by thousands of reporters. There was no great scramble for either story. The Weekly Standard's Daniel Halper noticed the platform story, and CNN's Jessica Yellin got the drop on the news that delegates would return to vote on new language. Like I said, neither story is going to win a Pulitzer. But what a news wormhole we're working in. Dave Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention."

CHARLOTTE--The low point of the Democratic convention--the worst moment until today's surprise spat over platform language--came when ABC News caught Stephen J. Spinner on tape. The network's investigative team, which exposes and ambushes big donors at conventions, saw Spinner taking a VIP tour of the Time Warner Center. Spinner, a donor-turned-Department of Energy hack, had urged the Obama administration to give a $535 million loan guarantee to Solyndra, even though he'd signed a waiver and promised not to get involved. ABC News found him. Spinner trotted away as a pleasant-seeming party goon blocked the camera. And as Politico noticed, Steve Westly, another Democrat bearing the Mark of Solyndra, will speak tonight to the DNC--""undoubtedly something Democrats will get hit for by Republicans."" Wouldn't it be easier for everybody if the Solyndrans were banished to an island? Yes. One of the goals of any convention is to obscure and magic away a party's mistakes. At the Republicans' convention, there was only a little cringing talk about George W. Bush. In Charlotte there is no mention of the word ""stimulus,"" and very little talk about the $787 billion package that Democrats worked like pack mules to get over the 60-vote Senate margin. Not even the tables of homespun Obama knick-knackery on College and Tryon streets mention the stimulus. One T-shirt lists the president's accomplishments on the back: ""CHANGE IS ..."" and skips from ""1/29/2009: Equal Pay for Equal Work"" to ""3/30/2009: Saving the U.S. Auto Industry."" When the stimulus passed, in February 2009, no Democrat thought that it'd be forgotten. No Democratic president had spent so much in one go since FDR. Its $145 billion ""Making Work Pay"" tax cut was part of Obama's 2008 campaign platform, and generally, presidents like to brag when they enact something they burned jet fuel to talk about. The money that states received to plug budget gaps became really obvious once it stopped coming. If you stop a Democrat in the street and ask him what the stimulus did for his state--and you don't mention Solyndra or something--he will praise it. ""It kept this whole country out of a deep depression,"" says Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, as he steps out of a lecture-heavy Democratic Governors Association event about setting the private sector free. (The gist: We need to invest in education, and cut taxes.) ""In Kentucky it helped us keep our heads above water and created enough jobs to get us through the worst part of the downtown. We wouldn't have made it without the stimulus package."" Nobody uses the S-word until they're prompted--after that, they use it freely. ""I talk about the stimulus all the time in my district,"" says Rep. John Yarmuth, who represents Louisville. ""I referred to it last night,"" says Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who gave one of Tuesday's best-received speeches. ""I don't usually spend time on the name of the act. But the fact that we have, for example, created some new tools that enabled the Orchard Garden school to turn itself around, was due to Race to the Top, which as you know was part of the stimulus. There are nearly 100,000 people at home in Massachusetts who can trace a paycheck to the stimulus bill. Roads, infrastructure--it's incredibly important."" This isn't a new story, but it comes into relief at a three-day convention. This is the last chance Democrats will get to give an unvarnished, cable-TV-swallowed argument for the early Obama years. They're using it, generally, to strip the bark off Mitt Romney and to remind their best demographic groups why they need another term. Why not talk about the stimulus, though? It's a toxic word. There is no way to clean it up. In The New New Deal, his very boosterish history of the stimulus, Michael Grunwald gets victorious Republicans to explain how they pulled that off. It was obvious even at the time. They talked up the lamest-sounding parts of the bill--""hybrid vehicles for the military""--to portray it as a tottering heap of wasteful junk. ""We were in full kill-the-bill, let's-make-everything-famous mode,"" Republican adviser Derek Kan tells Grunwald. ""The idea was to create an echo chamber about the wastefulness."" Republicans outnumbered Democrats 2-1 in TV segments about the stimulus, at a time when their influence in Washington was limited to getting Olympia Snowe to mount a filibuster. ""You can't un-ring that bell,"" says Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, one of the convention's omnipresent pundits. ""There are a few things that Democrats didn't take the time to explain in the early days of this presidency."" Trippi preceded to free-verse a few lines of an ideal Obama speech, in which he could have better explained how doomed the country would be unless it got real Keynesian real fast. This is more common around the convention floors than any talk of ""stimulus."" But it doesn't matter. Solyndra is more famous as ""stimulus"" than any effective component of the law. Democrats lost the spin wars, and made peace with it. I mention to former Rep. Tom Perriello (he's now at the Center for American Progress) that some voters confused the stimulus with TARP. He laughs. ""Only some?"" Yarmuth, who's waiting for a radio interview, offers another theory. ""In September 2008, the American people already thought Barack Obama was president."" ""That would explain why Paul Ryan blames him for shutting the Janesville GM plant down,"" says Perriello. ""TARP became part of [Obama's] agenda."" He can sell plenty of things at his convention. But some of his agenda's been forced on him. And some of it's been erased."	Why Isn't Anyone in Charlotte Mentioning the Stimulus?

A year ago, President Obama's political advisers set out to copy President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. They would mobilize their base. They would pummel and discredit the challenger. And they would exploit patriotism and national security to compensate for the president's weak economic record. The strategy is working. In fact, it's working too well. Obama's campaign is embracing Bush's worst tactics. It's attacking the opposition as un-American. The 2004 Republican National Convention was a McCarthyite orgy. Its speakers impugned the loyalty of anyone who dared criticize Bush. Rudy Giuliani branded Democratic nominee John Kerry ""the anti-war candidate"" and accused him of claiming ""that certain foreign leaders who opposed our removal of Saddam Hussein prefer"" Kerry to Bush. John McCain brushed aside concerns about Bush's domestic policies, insisting, ""We are not enemies, but comrades in a war against a real enemy. ... Stand up with our president and fight."" The convention's keynoter, Zell Miller, charged, ""While young Americans are dying in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, our nation is being torn apart and made weaker because of the Democrats' manic obsession to bring down our commander in chief."" Republicans in 2012 have partially replicated these tactics. Mitt Romney has repeatedly called Obama's ideas ""foreign."" Romney and his surrogates said Obama doesn't understand America. Democrats countered these attacks with economic nationalism. They blasted Romney for outsourcing jobs and mocked his rendition of ""America the Beautiful."" But last night, they turned up the heat, ruthlessly challenging Romney's patriotism. The offensive began at 6 p.m. in remarks by Newark Mayor Cory Booker: ""When your country is in a costly war, with our soldiers sacrificing abroad and our nation facing a debt crisis at home, being asked to pay your fair share isn't class warfare. It's patriotism."" Booker's statement seemed benign. But it signaled the Democrats' line of attack, casting a shadow of dishonor over anyone who opposed tax increases. An hour later, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid escalated the assault. He alleged that Romney ""chose Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island tax shelters over American institutions. And we can only imagine what new secrets would be revealed if he showed the American people a dozen years of tax returns, like his father did."" Reid's speech sharpened the economic nationalism theme into an indictment of Romney's patriotism. In doing so, Reid exaggerated the extent of the cited accounts and their conflict with U.S. investment. While the value of Romney's Swiss account (which was closed two years ago) and his Cayman investments fluctuated, the average seems to have been possibly $25 million--about 10 percent of Romney's assets--of which $3 million was in the Swiss account. But why sweat the details or stick to the facts? Reid's hint at other shady entanglements ""we can only imagine"" was the perfect McCarthyite touch. At 9 p.m., former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland abandoned all restraint. He declared: Mitt Romney has so little economic patriotism that even his money needs a passport. It summers on the beaches of the Cayman Islands and winters on the slopes of the Swiss Alps. In Matthew, chapter 6, verse 21, the scriptures teach us that where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. My friends, any man who aspires to be our president should keep both his treasure and his heart in the United States of America. ... Barack Obama is betting on the American worker. Mitt Romney is betting on a Bermuda shell corporation. Barack Obama saved the American auto industry. Mitt Romney saved on his taxes. Barack Obama is an economic patriot. Mitt Romney is an outsourcing pioneer. That's worse than anything I can recall from the 2004 Republican convention. If a Republican speaker had used the New Testament to charge that Obama lacked patriotism and that his heart wasn't in this country, based on peripheral investments made by a blind trust, liberals would have gone insane with outrage. But when Strickland did it to Romney, Democratic delegates roared their approval. Forty minute later, Lilly Ledbetter, the former tire-plant manager who was infamously paid less than male colleagues for the same work, piled on. ""Women still earn just 77 cents for every dollar men make,"" she told the delegates. ""Maybe 23 cents doesn't sound like a lot to someone with a Swiss bank account, Cayman Island Investments, and an IRA worth tens of millions of dollars."" Again, the crowd roared. At 10 p.m., Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley went nuclear. He said of Romney and Paul Ryan: Instead of investing in America, they hide their money in Swiss bank accounts and ship our jobs to China. Swiss bank accounts never built an American bridge. Swiss bank accounts never put cops on the streets or teachers in our classrooms. Swiss bank accounts never created American jobs. Governor Romney, just because you bank against the United States of America doesn't mean the rest of us are willing to sell her out. We are Americans. We must act like Americans. O'Malley is wrong on the facts. Banks lend money, and the top foreign recipient of Swiss investment is the United States. The $3 million Romney's blind-trust managers put into his Swiss account is a pittance compared to the $165 billion Switzerland invests in the U.S., supporting some 300,000 American jobs. It's a global economy, stupid. You can fault Romney for laying off workers. You can fault him for exploiting tax havens. You can fault him for withholding his tax returns. But when you depict overseas investment per se as evidence of a candidate's national disloyalty--when you quote the Bible at him, deny that he's a patriot, and accuse him of selling out his homeland--you've crossed the line. You might win an election that way. But it won't be worth what you've done to yourself and to this country."	Is Romney a Traitor for Investing Abroad?

I've been obsessing about ""you didn't build that,"" and I've gone from taking umbrage to recognizing that there was a whiff of hectoring impatience in the president's unedited words. Michelle, after weaving the facts of her and her husband's family history into a tapestry of striving, offered this perfect gloss: ""Like so many American families, our families weren't asking for much. They didn't begrudge anyone else's success or care that others had much more than they did ... in fact, they admired it."" Right, achieve and aspire your heart out, America. The words family and sacrifice showed up over and over again in Michelle's text. The words career and breadwinner didn't. Noreen Malone points out that Michelle didn't even make the general nod to mothers who ""work a little harder during the day to earn the respect you deserve at work"" that Ann Romney did. Much less mention her own years of paid work--pay that was higher than her husband's. She did, though, make time for the struggles with workplace discrimination of Barack Obama's grandmother and Lilly Ledbetter, another top speaker last night. ""Barack's grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank, and she moved quickly up the ranks, but like so many women, she hit a glass ceiling,"" Michelle said. And she singled out the signing of the law that's named after Ledbetter as one of her husband's proud accomplishments. Maybe that's all the signaling that feminists like me can ask for. I wonder, though. What about all those single-mom voters--the swingles--who are tilting Obama's way but include some undecideds. I wish Michelle had spared a sentence or two for them. That would have updated her recognition of the more traditional problem of earning as much as the man working beside you. I am still trying to make my peace with Michelle's culminating ""mom-in-chief"" line. The underlying sentiment is unassailable: ""My daughters are still the heart of my heart and the center of my world."" But why does mom-in-chief have to be the most important thing this strong, vibrant woman tells us about herself as she flexes the strange but considerable power of the office of first lady? Don't tell me that Michelle isn't a working woman, past or present: I'm with Alyssa Rosenberg, let's recognize that first lady comes with real responsibilities and allocate a salary for it. I'm not expecting Michelle to say that, but I do wish she could put a bit of her political capital into making her own glittering professional resume part of the story she tells about herself and her family. Doesn't she want Malia and Sasha to know that she stands behind her own professional achievement as well as their father's? I like Noreen's idea that Michelle, with her push-ups montage, stands for ""muscular mom-ism."" But I don't think that has to be all she's about, not in light of the realities of work in this country or the demographics of this election. Maybe that's her next big speech--or maybe it's what we'd get to hear from her if the Obamas stay in the White House. I can keep hoping.

The Tampa convention setup was busy, but navigable. The Charlotte convention floor is a mess, even on Night 1. Your short conversation with a delegate will be cut short by a well-meaning, tired-eyed delegate who NEEDS TO CLEAR THE AISLE! CLEAR THE AISLE! The effect of all this is that people seem to be hyped up constantly, jumping to grab hunks of bloody meat with their back teeth. I got to the floor right after the Ted Kennedy tribute video. It was a little jarring. We've seen Kennedy/Camelot videos before, but we've never seen them change up halfway through and turn into attacks on the guy the Democrats are running against. Delegates lit up when the spectral Ted debated Romney, and laughed when the 1994 version of Romney defended Roe v. Wade. ""The ghost of Ted Kennedy really brought it all together,"" said Nathan Wilkes, a Colorado delegate. (We would have talked more, but he started pumping his fist when openly gay Rep. Jared Polis came onstage, and a very nice floor guide encouraged me to KEEP MOVING.) It all started to remind me of the 2004 Republican National Convention. Every important moment from that week was brutal on John Kerry. The memorable stuff from tonight--pre-Michelle--was aimed right at Mitt Romney's groin. The Kennedy video was the most surprising, but the tone was there even during the softer-focus segments on Barack Obama's domestic record. Republicans, said Rep. Gwen Moore, ""have even tried to change the definition of rape."" Romney had, apparently, personally insulted Tammy Duckworth--the icon of Dems' veteran outreach efforts--by failing to mention Afghanistan. This was before the Assault on Switzerland. Harry Reid: ""We learned he chose Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island tax shelters over American institutions."" Martin O'Malley: ""Swiss bank accounts never built an American bridge."" Ted Strickland: ""Mitt Romney has so little economic patriotism that even his money needs a passport."" There was policy buried in there, kind of (it's about tax rates), but it was more about repainting Mitt Romney as a gormless, passionless, arrogant rich jerk. Even the Julian Castro speech went after Romney with that ""Gee, why didn't I try that?"" line about borrowing money from your parents. If Castro's keynote was meant to evoke Obama's 2004 speech, well, that Obama speech was representative of the whole post-9/11 ""you can trust us, we're nice"" Democratic theme. Obama never even mentioned George W. Bush in that speech. None of that nicety this time. Dave Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention."

Once again, I'm near the New Mexico delegation. To get here, I enjoyed a series of rain showers and the strange, constantly changing set of requirements to get into the hall. In the half a dozen trips I've made to the Time Warner Center, the rules have never been the same way twice. This matters when you're adding an extra mile to your walk. I think the Secret Service code name for this operation is switchback. Doing all this walking, I ran into a former senior Obama administration official (I don't mean he was demoted; he's a civilian now). I asked him how Obama was going to convince people that his promises for a second term were ever going to come true given the level of partisanship. He didn't have an answer for me. He tried to find one, outlining how the president would be able to go to Congress in 2013 and say that the people have spoken and that he has their mandate. But then he paused and said, ""Of course, that was his message in 2008, too."" Any incumbent faces this question, but there's a large distance between promise and reality with Obama because his big promise was to change politics and even he admits that the atmosphere in Washington is as bad as it has ever been. So when voters hear the president, won't they just ignore his promises because Washington is clotted with hairballs, frustration, and despair? The president's campaign says that if Obama wins, the fever will break and Republicans will be forced to bend a little. But might it not be the case that Republicans will conclude that they lost because Romney was a weak candidate who didn't really run on their issues? Republicans could reasonably conclude, in this scenario, that they lost because they weren't conservative enough. Plus, the off-year energy in 2014 will be in that part of the party that will demand constancy to conservative ideas; so no wobbling or you'll face a primary. Sasha, your campaign versus election construction is the right one. The campaign is lame, but the election is for real. So perhaps we should spread that word near and far. I'm going to stop people in the street and tell them. John"	Dispatches From the Democratic National Convention
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/are_you_better_off_than_you_were_four_years_ago_how_democrats_will_frame_the_question_.html	"Are you better off than you were four years ago? As Republicans press that question, Democrats are fumbling for answers. The Democrats want to say yes, but they don't want to offend voters who are unhappy or angry about the economy. The trick is to frame the question and answer it in a way that fits public opinion. Here's a guide to what the polls say. 1. Remind them that things could have been worse. Gallup, CBS/New York Times, and AP-GfK surveyed Americans in the two weeks before the Republican convention. Gallup offered respondents two choices: ""Would you say you and your family are better off than you were four years ago, or not?"" Forty-two percent said they were better off; 55 percent said they weren't. The CBS/Times poll offered a middle option: ""Is your family financially better off today than it was four years ago, worse off financially, or is it about the same as it was four years ago?"" Forty percent said they were the same, leaving 20 percent saying they were better off and 39 percent saying they were worse off. In the AP-GfK poll, 36 percent chose ""about the same,"" leaving 28 percent saying they were better off and 36 percent saying they were worse off. Getting a ""worse"" rating from 36 to 39 percent of adults isn't good for a president. But it isn't nearly as bad as getting a ""worse"" rating from 55 percent. Clearly, it's important to let people say that their economic circumstances are the same, not just better or worse--and to convince them that this middle grade is tolerable. This is why you see Joe Biden crowing that ""General Motors is alive."" GM's survival doesn't show things getting better. It shows things staying the same when they could have gotten worse. Biden is trying to coax the 40 percent of Americans who see things as unchanged to be grateful for that state of affairs. In an exchange on Sunday, Meet the Press host David Gregory told Rahm Emanuel, ""Look at our poll: 69 percent, nearly seven in 10, saying things are either the same or worse than when the president came into office."" Really? In that August NBC/Wall Street Journal survey, 42 percent said the country was worse off, 27 percent said it was the same, and 31 percent said it was better off. The findings could just as easily have been aggregated the other way: 58 percent saying things are the same or better. 2. Adjust the start date.  In June, Bloomberg and AP-GfK conducted simultaneous surveys of U.S. adults. AP-GfK asked, ""Compared to four years ago, is your family's financial situation better today, worse today or about the same as it was four years ago?"" Bloomberg asked a slightly different question: ""Are you better off or worse off than you were at the beginning of 2009?"" You'd expect Bloomberg to get lower numbers for ""better off"" and ""worse off,"" since AP-GfK offered a third alternative (""about the same""), while Bloomberg didn't. But that didn't happen. While the number who said they were worse off was similar in the two polls (38 percent in AP-GfK, 36 percent in Bloomberg), the percentage who said they were better off was much higher in the Bloomberg poll (45 percent) than in the AP-GfK poll (27 percent). That's a huge difference. What could explain it? If you look at the questions, the obvious discrepancy is between ""four years ago"" and ""the beginning of 2009."" That's not a piddling distinction. From the summer of 2008 to the spring of 2009, the economy nosedived. Millions of people lost their jobs. That's why the Obama campaign is laboring so hard to remind voters that Obama's economic policies didn't take effect until well into 2009. They don't want to start the clock four years ago. They want to start it three years ago, after the worst of the plunge was over. 3. Mention Bush. Many polls indicate that while Americans hold Obama somewhat responsible for the economy's troubles, they blame Bush more. In Gallup's June survey, 52 percent of adults blamed Obama for the country's economic problems, but 68 percent blamed Bush. In the July CBS/Times poll, 64 percent said Obama's policies contributed at least somewhat to the economic downturn, but 81 percent said the same about Bush. In the April ABC/Washington Post sample, when adults were asked which president was ""more responsible for the country's current economic problems,"" only 32 percent picked Obama. Fifty-four percent picked Bush. That doesn't mean Obama gets a pass on the ""Are you better off"" question. But it does affect the numbers. For proof, look at the survey CNN/ORC took in late May. As CNN's political unit noted at the time: When asked in the survey whether they are better or worse off than they were four years ago, Americans are split, 44% to 43%. But when asked whether they are better or worse off than they were four years ago ""when Bush was president,"" a small gap opens--47% say they are better off compared to 41% who say they are worse off. In a neck-and-neck race, a shift of that magnitude--evidenced by two versions of a split-sample query in a single poll--can be the difference between defeat and reelection. ""Are you better off"" isn't a simple question after all. The outcome hangs not just on how it's answered, but how it's asked.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/romney_s_ads_against_defense_cuts_treat_military_spending_as_a_jobs_program_.html	"Mitt Romney has launched a flurry of new TV ads explaining how he'll protect and create jobs: more government spending. The ads, available on Romney's YouTube channel, are tailored to eight swing states. The one running in Virginia, near me, says: ""Here in Virginia, we're not better off under President Obama. His defense cuts threaten over 130,000 jobs--lowering home values, putting families at risk."" Similar ads in other states complain that Obama's reductions in military spending threaten 20,000 jobs in Colorado, 20,000 in Ohio, and ""thousands more"" in Florida and North Carolina. Romney promises to save these jobs by shielding the Pentagon budget. Here's his pitch in Virginia: ""Romney's plan? Reverse Obama defense cuts. Strengthen our military, and create over 340,000 new jobs for Virginia."" The ad in North Carolina is identical, except that it adds 10,000 jobs to the offer. The ad in Colorado promises 200,000 jobs. The ad in Ohio promises 450,000. The ad in Florida promises 700,000. The jobs won't all come from defense spending, of course. Romney also promises to ""improve education and job training,"" ""provide alternatives to foreclosure,"" and ""stand up to China."" He doesn't say how a trade war and more job training will solve the nation's economic problems. Nor does he explain how these ideas square with his rhetoric about free enterprise, much less with his simultaneous pledges to cut taxes, repeal regulations, and eliminate the deficit. But he does assert that all of this will create millions of jobs. Romney has been talking up the military and the defense industry as an employment haven for weeks. On Aug. 14, he warned that looming defense cuts would ""threaten 150,000 defense-related jobs"" in Virginia. A week later, his new running mate, Paul Ryan, declared that the cuts ""could put almost 44,000 jobs at stake right here in Pennsylvania. We're not going to let that happen."" In North Carolina, Ryan said he and Romney opposed the cuts because ""we don't want to trade small-business jobs for military jobs. We want more jobs across the board."" And last week, Romney protested that under the cuts, ""up to 1.5 million jobs could be lost. GDP growth could fall significantly."" For the most part, the cuts to which Romney has objected are automatic. It's perfectly sensible to argue that military spending should be reduced instead in a more targeted, deliberate way. But Romney doesn't propose such targeted reduction. He rejects it. In last week's speech, he pledged: The Obama administration is set to cut defense spending by nearly a trillion dollars. My administration will not. Working together with my running mate, Paul Ryan, I will make reductions in other areas and install pro-growth policies to make sure that our country remains safe and secure. There are plenty of places to cut in a federal budget that now totals well over $3 trillion a year, but defense is not one of them. In an interview with Fortune last month, Romney said he would use any savings in the Pentagon budget not to reduce the deficit but ""to increase the number of active-duty personnel by approximately 100,000, to restore our military equipment which has been destroyed in conflict, and to invest in the coming technologies of warfare."" What's more, in his 2012 budget proposal, Ryan allocated more money for defense than the Pentagon requested, arguing, ""We don't think the generals are giving us their true advice."" Romney wouldn't just protect the military budget. He would radically increase it. He explicitly vows to set ""core defense spending ... at a floor of 4 percent of GDP."" This would require more government spending, regardless of need, just because the economy is growing. It's hard to imagine a more socialist policy. The cost to our country over the next decade has been estimated at up to $2 trillion. Throwing $2 trillion at the Pentagon and its contractors certainly would create jobs. And setting GDP growth as a floor for future spending hikes would guarantee a perpetual boom in public-sector employment. But we already have a party that advocates that kind of stimulus. We don't need another."	 To Romney, the Military Isn't Just a Job. It's a Jobs Program.

Bush. And that was wrong. ""Republicans have run out of excuses for blowing the economy, blowing the surplus, and blowing our military resources and moral capital in the wrong country,"" wrote our pal Will Saletan. ""So they're going after the patriotism of their opponents."" This week was Democratic revenge. John Kerry's speech made it obvious, because he took such radiating joy in balling up the 2004 attack lines and spitting them back at Republicans. ""It isn't fair to say Mitt Romney doesn't have a position on Afghanistan. He has every position."" ""Talk about being for it before you were against it!""--and a room full of Democrats who had seen those words in Progress for America 527 ads cheered. And then: ""Mr. Romney--here's a little advice: Before you debate Barack Obama on foreign policy, you better finish the debate with yourself!"" That's what you get, Republicans! And that was mild. Again and again, from other speakers, we were told that Mitt Romney's lack of faith in America, and lack of confidence in killin' terrorists, were character flaws that no one could heal. The president himself only hinted at it when he said ""a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals."" It was a deep groove. To connect it to Romney, you had to believe that the Republican really didn't believe that people could team up and build bridges. Vengeance for the ""we didn't build it"" horsefeathers, I guess. I'm not sure how much the TV audience saw, but the run-up to the Biden/Obama finish was bracketed by multiple mentions of the Osama bin Laden killing. We heard it from a canned video, and we heard echoes of it from a phalanx of high-ranking veterans who now backed Obama. The Obama campaign warned months ago--May at the latest--that it was going to do this. Still jarring. The last time a Democrat could run, and wanted to run, on foreign policy was in 1996, and Bill Clinton's ability to do that was still limited by Bob Dole's war heroism. (""The better man for a better America"" remains one of the great pissy campaign slogans.) This theme worked. I don't think Obama's speech worked as well on its own. I'd avoided Twitter during the speech, mostly, so the only feedback I heard was from fellow hacks afterward. General agreement: Biden out-talked Obama. Before he was president, Obama had to work so manfully to prove that he was patriotic, and to tie John McCain to George W. Bush. It was exciting. But Obama's Democrats spent all week mocking Romney. The president batted clean-up. He even accepted the credit for ""a new tower rising over the New York skyline,"" because as the president, he can take credit for any nationalist, jingoist feelings that he likes. Can he do much more of that after tonight? Sometimes. With that final ""you did it"" refrain, he suggested that government works and fair taxation will do for him what the war on terror did for Bush. Criticize his vision for America and you're criticizing America itself. Dave Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention."

Before Obama's speeches we always seem to ask whether he can avoid being too aloof or professorial or pedantic or whatever term we used to describe the widely held view--and it's been ratified by the New York Times!--that our president thinks he's smarter than us. That's been not only a problem with Obama's tone, but a Democratic messaging conundrum since the emergence of George W. Bush as the GOP's standard-bearer. Democrats think they're smarter than Republicans: more serious about issues, more intellectually honest, more committed to science and empiricism. This assumption informs nearly every judgment the party makes about its opposition. (The only area where Democrats don't always think they're better is the one I cover most of the time: Each side perpetually thinks the other side is more tactically savvy.) Basically Democrats have spent 12 years trying to find out how to call their opponents idiots without sounding like snobs. The solution, of course, is Clinton. (It seems like he's the magical stranger who solves all the Democrats' problems, no?) He managed to judge the Republicans on intellectual terms: caricatured them as unserious, intellectually unsophisticated--quite literally, know-nothings. He explained to the country that Republicans simply didn't understand arithmetic, and didn't look snobby about it. Doesn't this relieve Obama of a major burden? He doesn't need to explain, avoiding a lapse into the professorial, and he can judge his opponents' proposals in terms that project empathy and not intellectual superiority.

He's had some practice. ""Win the Future!"" was the slogan he unveiled at the 2011 State of the Union. That was then discarded for ""Forward."" I wonder if we'll get a new phrase tonight. The future is ahead of us? 

Before Mitt Romney spoke in Tampa, I thought the Republican nominee's biggest task of the night was to offer a single sentence that would live on. I don't think he found one. The line comparing Obama's lofty talk about the oceans to his concern for peoples' families might be the best thing he offered, but it wasn't stunning. (It may live on in climate change textbooks 100 years from now.) We've talked a lot about how conventions get sent through the chop shop, where bits and pieces are shipped out to the various constituencies over time. I talked to Obama adviser David Plouffe this morning, and he said the real impact of the Clinton speech will be based on the press coverage, the parts we choose to highlight and what lives on through Twitter and Facebook. So what is Obama going to say that fits into 140 characters? I think the Democratic base has already been worked up into pretty good shape for the president. Democratic voters who missed last night will still take the time to listen to what Bill Clinton said when their friend tells them to watch the YouTube clip. The Obama campaign will find ways to chop up what he said and get it out, and Democrats will be in a mood to listen. The campaign tells me it is planning to farm out Clinton content quite a lot in the coming weeks. So tonight, for the president, it's all about the swing voters. Are they watching? I don't think many of them are. Or, if they are watching, they might like what they see but then change their mind again in a few weeks. We've seen that this race is impervious to events. The polls just stay stuck. So will anything live on from tonight? Will there be something that can be recycled in four weeks to bring people back to Obama? In that sense, these conventions are vast focusing exercises, which force the campaign to hone their thinking. Another thought. What if I'm wrong, and what Obama needs is not 140 characters but a feeling that people can translate into their own 140 character expressions? (I know, you're thinking that I should probably extinguish the incense and put down the hemp snacks.) What I wonder, though, is whether there is a modern equivalent of the Mandela quote about people not remembering what a politician says but remembering how he made them feel. The problem for Obama, of course, is that some voters might not trust that feeling this time around. They think that all Obama did in 2008 was make them feel good, but he couldn't deliver on that feeling when he came to office. (All good intentions and poor execution.) In that way, Obama is squaring off against himself tonight. If he's great, he'll recapture the magic and remind people why they liked him and why he deserves a second chance. But it's also true that if he's great, he'll remind people of why they liked him, and that will highlight their disappointment. He's the suitor who can muster up the right words on the anniversaries but who disappoints all the other days of the year. That makes those anniversaries ultimately unsatisfying, no matter how nice they may seem when the candles are burning and the flowers are still fresh. So I'm looking for something that lives on--past the disappointment, past the audience's conditioning to pretty words, and past tomorrow's job numbers. Obama will know those numbers ahead of his speech. One of the tasks for a president is being able to compartmentalize. Even if those numbers are bad, he'll have to forget that and plow ahead. He'll hope the country is able to do a version of the same thing and hear what he has to say in a way that lasts beyond the 10 hours between the end of his speech and the release of the newest economic data.

One thing is definitely changing: President Obama's deadline for fixing the economy. In February 2009, two weeks after he was sworn in, Obama sat for an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer. Lauer asked him about the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Here's part of their exchange: Lauer: At some point, will you say, ""Wait a minute. We've spent this amount of money. We're not seeing the results. We've got to change course dramatically""? Obama: Look, I'm at the start of my administration. One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years. And ... a year from now, I think people are gonna see that we're starting to make some progress. But there's still gonna be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's gonna be a one-term proposition. A year later, many indicators did show progress. But people didn't think it was adequate, and Democrats were headed for a shellacking in the midterm election. In September 2010, speaking at Cuyahoga Community College in Ohio, Bill Clinton pleaded for patience: [Republicans] say: ""They had 21 months. Put us back in."" The Democrats are saying something like this: ""Look, we found a big hole that we did not dig. And we didn't get out of it in 21 months, but at least we quit digging. So, don't go back in reverse. Give us two more years. If it doesn't work, you have another election in just two years. You can vote us all out then. But for goodness sakes, we quit digging. Don't bring back the shovel brigade."" Well, it's two years later now. We're three and a half years into Obama's term. The digging has indeed stopped. The unemployment rate has held steady, and monthly job reports have shown positive numbers, though on balance, they're just treading water. But we certainly aren't out of the hole. TARP limited the recession's damage, but nobody thinks that in terms of economic progress or pain relief, Obama can claim to have gotten it ""done"" in the three years he gave himself. So Democrats are doing what people do when they miss a deadline. They're rolling it back. On June 14, Obama went to Cuyahoga Community College--the same place where Clinton had offered his two-year timetable in 2010--and picked up the metaphor about digging out of a hole: From 2001 to 2008, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. The typical family saw their incomes fall. ... Not only are we digging out of a hole that is nine million jobs deep, we're digging out from an entire decade where six million manufacturing jobs left our shores, where costs rose but incomes and wages didn't, and where the middle class fell further and further behind. I'm sympathetic to this critique of the Bush years. But what's striking in Obama's plea is his extension of the time horizon for judging performance. In the June 14 speech, he pushed back the baseline from 2008 to 2001, implying that he should be judged not by whether people feel better off after Obama's four years in office, but by comparing economic trends during Bush's eight years with trends during a similar period under Obama. Then, on July 5, Obama explicitly extended his accountability date beyond 2012: ""We knew it would take more than one year or one term or maybe even one president."" Obama now repeats this caveat in nearly every speech. Last night in his address at the Democratic convention, Clinton joined the effort to ratchet back expectations. He said Obama had ""stopped the slide into depression and put us on the long road to recovery, knowing all the while that no matter how many jobs that he saved or created, there'd still be millions more waiting."" Minutes later, Clinton added: He put a floor under the crash. He began the long, hard road to recovery. ... When President Barack Obama took office, the economy was in free fall. It had just shrunk 9 full percent of GDP. We were losing 750,000 jobs a month. Are we doing better than that today? The answer is yes. ... No president--not me, not any of my predecessors, no one--could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years. Fair enough. But where was that stipulation in 2009 and 2010? Why did Obama say he'd ""have this done in three years""? Why did Clinton ask, a year later, for just ""two more years""? Where was all this putative foresight about the millions of job seekers who would still be waiting? Where were the warnings about the long, hard road to recovery? Let's be honest. Obama was overconfident. So was Clinton, even halfway through Obama's term. Like most of us, these guys underestimate and overpromise. We shouldn't believe what they're telling us now any more than we should have believed, in retrospect, what they told us then. They've rolled back their deadline. And if necessary, they'll roll it back again. If Obama's 10-year horizon isn't long enough for you, try Clinton's. Here's what the former president said last night: Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years. The Democrats [have held it for] 24. In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private sector jobs. So what's the job score? Republicans, 24 million. Democrats, 42 [million]. ... Republican economic policies quadrupled the national debt ...in the 12 years before I took office, and doubled the debt in the eight years after I left. I'm skeptical of numbers like these, since the effects of one president's policies often don't show up till the next president's term. But what's mind-boggling in Clinton's argument is its sheer historical scope. Forget whether you're better off than you were four years ago, or even 10 years ago. The real report card, by Clinton's reckoning, takes 50 years. Half a century from now, will the country be better off than it is today? Who knows? The only thing we know for sure is that if it isn't, politicians will still be playing for time."	Does Obama Need More Time To Fix the Economy?

Barack Obama arrived a day early to hug Bill Clinton. The Obama campaign got the picture of continuity it wanted for the front pages of the newspapers. If all campaigns are about the future, bringing in the popular former president was an attempt to use an envoy from past prosperity to explain why brighter days were just around the corner. Clinton has now spoken for a total of more than five hours at Democratic conventions. It seemed at times that he was in the middle of a five-hour speech Wednesday night. The crowd of delegates and party stalwarts didn't seem to mind. For the last five minutes of the speech, everyone in the auditorium stood to let his words fall on their faces. Clinton seemed to delight in the whole event, luxuriating in the speech like it was a vast terrycloth robe. By the time Barack Obama arrived on the stage to receive a bow from the 42nd president, it seemed like it should have been Obama doing the bowing. He owed at least that to the man he once criticized as a middling historical figure but whose aura his campaign considered so powerful it was enough just to have Obama in the same picture frame with him. Clinton's speech had several parts: an answer to the question ""Are you better off?,"" a shaming of the modern GOP with the example set by past Republican presidents, and a deeper attempt to tie Obama's policies to bedrock American values, a job Michelle Obama had begun the night before. Paul Ryan said the Democrats have tried to duck the question ""Are you better off?"" Bill Clinton took the question on directly and at length. ""Are we better off than we were when he took office, with an economy in free fall, losing 750,000 jobs a month? The answer is yes!"" Clinton talked at length about the Recovery Act, the Affordable Care Act, and the auto-industry bailout. He linked Obama's policies for education and job retraining to people's anxieties about how they could get a job in an economy where the remaining jobs required more skill. If Clinton was building a bridge between the two presidencies, he spent a lot of time on the Obama side. The message of Bill Clinton's speech wasn't just continuity; it was a foreshadowing of what was to come. He said he knew what Obama was going through because he had gone through it, too. ""Our policies were working and the economy was growing but most people didn't feel it yet."" He asked for patience. ""If you'll renew the president's contract you will feel it."" As Clinton explained how Obama's student-loan policies would help people, he nodded to an argument I've heard a lot over the last few days. ""Mitt Romney's convention was all about success that was determined by what you earned,"" said Tony Coelho, the former congressman and chairman of the Gore campaign.* ""What about the success you can have as a teacher or a journalist or a fireman?"" Clinton appealed to this sentiment when he said, ""No one will have to turn down a job, as a teacher, a police officer, or a small town doctor because it doesn't pay enough to make the debt payments."" This is a subtle but clever way to weave Obama's policies right into the fabric of the middle-class sense of aspiration. Clinton changed the metrics for this speech from the ones he used in 2008 at the Democratic convention. In that speech, he talked about declining incomes, poverty, inequality, and foreclosures, areas that have either gotten worse or not gotten much better under Obama. Clinton also launched full defenses against Republican attacks on Obama's Medicare plans and the welfare waivers his administration has approved. ""I didn't know whether to laugh or cry,"" he said in one of the few asides that wasn't ad-libbed. (As you noted, Dave, Clinton spread ad-libbed material like grout throughout his remarks.) He also made a broader critique of the modern Republican Party, arguing that it was in the thrall of its most conservative elements. He lauded both Bush presidents and President Eisenhower in an attempt to shame current Republicans for their obstructionism and in a political bid to woo swing voters. He seemed to be trying to stir some life in the post-partisan pragmatic vision that Barack Obama had offered in 2008 by saying that despite all of the recent bitterness, Barack Obama was still committed to trying to work with Republicans who practiced that old strain of cooperative lawmaking. There is a big debate in political circles about whether presidents can really persuade. Clinton gave a classic persuasion speech, treating his audience like it was listening, laying out the case with an argument behind it. Will it work? Do people listen to long-reasoned arguments anymore? Clinton certainly thinks so: ""Folks, whether the American people believe what I just said or not may be the whole election. I just want you to know that I believe it. With all my heart, I believe it."" In elections it's easier to persuade than when you're president. The choice is binary, but in the modern world of communication, what will live on in future news cycles? In 2008, the tension between Barack Obama and President Clinton wasn't just that Obama beat Clinton's wife in the primaries. Obama downplayed President Clinton's achievements as president. He famously said Ronald Reagan was a more transformational president and blamed ""Clintonism"" for selling out Democratic principles in an orgy of what Obama called ""triangulation and poll-driven politics."" Now he is hoping that voters will see himself in line with that Clinton record. What he once cast away is now his life raft. Tomorrow night President Obama will take the same stage and deliver his speech behind the same podium. He might be up a little late tonight tweaking his remarks. Clinton is a tough act to follow. It wasn't supposed to be that way. Obama was going to speak in the vast Bank of America stadium outdoors, but the bad weather changed things. The sweeping plans to follow Bill Clinton were not to be. Obama will have to settle with a less grand result than he'd once envisioned. It's an outcome not unlike the Obama presidency itself.

These are Americans who live overseas, but are mostly registered to vote at their last domestic address. They are expats but renounce the term because some people think it means they used to be patriotic. The Democratic National Committee, unlike Republicans, treats them like a state or territory. This year, the Democrats Abroad delegation represents Americans living on five continents. ""Like many of us, we can see more than anyone how Barack Obama has improved our reputation abroad. It's a particular difference between 2008 and now,"" says Vicki Hansen Thackray, an Iowa native who lives in Luxembourg and serves as Democrats Abroad's international vice chair. ""It's part of the reason we're so ardent."" Democrats Abroad made a surprisingly high-profile cameo in American domestic politics during the 2008 primary season when Obama emerged with a net gain of two delegates over Hillary Clinton from the group's virtual seven-delegate primary. This year the delegation's votes are a formality, but they say they are able to share ground-level testimony to Obama's ability to deliver change. ""Before 2008, when we traveled abroad we wouldn't tell people we were American,"" said Kenneth E. Sherman, a former Democratic committee man in Buffalo who now lives in Ontario with dual citizenship. He was elected Democrats Abroad's international chair in 2008, propelled by a campaign speech in which he waved his American passport. The point, Sherman recalled, was that during the Bush years he had been ashamed to show it to border authorities, presenting a Canadian document instead. Now, he said, ""I am proud to carry my US passport again."" Thackray expressed modest disapproval of her fellow delegate. She had never felt ashamed to be American, she said, but the four years of Obama had indeed brought an appreciable improvement to her quality of life in Luxembourg. ""People want to sit next to me at the dinner table again,"" she said. Sasha Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention."

Obama. ""If you have any doubt about Senator Obama's ability to be the chief executive,"" Clinton said at a rally in Kissimmee, Fla., ""just look at all of you .... He has executed this campaign. He can be the chief executor of good intentions."" That was from the first Obama/Clinton rally after the Democratic Unpleasantness in the 2008 primaries. Obama needed validation from the man who had held the office that the one-term senator with no executive experience could do the job. Now Clinton comes to Charlotte, N.C., tonight to make a similar case: that Obama has been doing the job. The problem is that this time there's evidence. In fact, the Clinton boast about Obama in that rally in 2008 is the Romney critique. He was the candidate of good intentions and let us all praise those intentions and give ourselves a break for believing in them, but he has been a bad executor. Last night the story was about struggle. Americans don't give up, and people in the middle class don't give up, Michelle Obama seemed to say. So don't give up on Barack Obama. Tonight we'll get a variant on that. The Obama campaign has seized on Paul Ryan's claim that ""America is in decline."" What a pessimist! Don't count America out, the Obama forces will say. We can do anything. (Well, except hold a rally in a 65,000-person stadium in the thunder and lightning, which is why the Obama fest tomorrow night has been moved indoors.) This attack on Ryan seeks to use the Optimism spell (+5 attack against Trolls) that has, at various times been so effective in American politics. Ronald Reagan was the key wizard of optimism, and no candidate wants to be caught seeming like he's not optimistic. That's why George W. Bush's 2000 convention speech--which included a critique of the Clinton administration--was a critique wrapped in a cushion of optimism. That the Obama team is playing the optimism card is another way--like the national security emphasis I wrote about last night--in which a Democratic incumbent uses Republican tropes against the GOP. But mere optimism isn't enough. The election is an argument over the ability to actually get things done. It's the gap between good intentions and execution.

Michelle Obama owned the first night of the Democratic National Convention. The first lady deftly wove together two strands of campaign messaging: that Barack Obama is an empathetic, worthy guy and that his personal qualities spill over into his policies. So we weren't all that surprised when respondents used the Slate/SurveyMonkey insta-poll from last night as an opportunity to write a love letter to Michelle. We posted our FLOTUS-themed questions directly after her speech and gathered the responses until 9:30 this morning. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Here's what people said: First we asked, ""Did First Lady Michelle Obama's speech make you more or less likely to vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden?"" The largest group of survey takers, 35 percent, described themselves as ""much more likely"" to support the Democratic ticket after hearing the First Lady. That number climbed to 49.4 percent when we factored in respondents who were ""slightly more likely"" to vote Obama-Biden. While Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, and Chris Christie all failed to move the needle one way or the other at the Republican National Convention, almost half of the SurveyMonkey audience said Michelle Obama's speech would positively affect their voting booth behavior.  By contrast, 28 percent reported that they were ""neither more likely nor unlikely"" to cast a ballot for the Democrats, and 22.6 percent found themselves less likely to support Obama. Like it or not, the presidential spouse-off has become a part of the race to the White House, and many viewers were implicitly comparing Michelle Obama's address with Ann Romney's from the previous week. We wanted to drag their impressions into the daylight with a second question: ""Which candidate's spouse do you believe delivered the better speech--Michelle Obama or Ann Romney?"" In the head-to-head matchup, Michelle could not be beat: Just over 55 percent of respondents handed the speechifying laurels to Obama, while around 30 percent chose Romney and 14.6 percent were undecided. So far no one--from either convention--has performed as well from the podium as Michelle Obama. Next up: Bill Clinton. "	Who Was Better: Michelle Obama or Ann Romney?

I use that term advisedly, because it wasn't just speakers mentioning Obama stands for gay marriage and against ""don't ask, don't tell,"" which they did plenty--but speakers treating these policies as signal accomplishments of his term alongside the auto bailout, health care reform, and bin Laden killing. Michelle notably put gay marriage in a particularly august civil-rights pantheon as part of a crescendo late in her speech: ""If a young preacher could lift us to the mountain top with his righteous dream, and if proud Americans can be who they are and boldly stand at the altar with who they love, then surely, surely, we can give everyone in this country a fair chance at that great American dream."" And particularly notable given the fear that gripped Democrats over this issue in 2004 and the reticence with which they approached it in 2008, Rahm Emanuel even auditioned marriage as a wedge issue: ""Whose leadership, whose judgment, whose values do you want in the White House when that crisis lands like a thud on the Oval Office desk? ... A person who wanted to keep ``don't ask, don't tell'' or a president who believes that who you love should not keep you from serving the country you love?"" Each time a speaker mentioned gay issues, the term of art was no longer the scientific ""sexual orientation"" but ""who you love"" or something along those lines. At least as it plays out in Charlotte, N.C. this week, the gay-rights debate is now about marriage and not equal protection or nondiscrimination statutes. It's no longer about who you are, but what you want to do (in this case, the harmless word ""love""). On a stage where identity politics once ruled the day, we're seeing a shift to what we might call behavioral politics. Sasha Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention."

Maybe he should have let his wife tell it. First lady Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and deft defense of her husband, wrapping him in biography and the American story. She also started the process of rebutting the previous week's attacks. At the heart of her speech Tuesday night was an effort to stretch the timeline beyond the four years of a single term. For the last two days, Democrats have been trying to answer the question, ""Are you better off than you were four years ago?"" Michelle Obama said this struggle to restore the middle class--her husband's struggle--is bigger than a single election. To make her case, the first lady started with family history. She told the story of her father who had multiple sclerosis but buttoned the buttons on his uniform each morning and lifted one leg, and then the other, to climb the stairs home at night. She talked about the president's grandmother who worked every day despite the frustrations of the glass ceiling. The message was that Obama comes from struggle. He understands what you're going through. Ann Romney talked about tuna fish. Michelle Obama took her details further. The car that was rusted out, the coffee table rescued from the dumpster, and the pair of decent shoes that were a half size too small. ""For Barack, these issues aren't political-they're personal. Because Barack knows what it means when a family struggles. He knows what it means to want something more for your kids and grandkids."" At the heart of the ""you didn't build that"" charge from Republicans is that Obama is disconnected from something fundamental about the country. Michelle Obama's biographical tour was a push against that. It was a celebration of the ethic of hard work for the dignity of a paycheck. She took a tour through those values instilled by this example--""dignity and decency,"" ""honesty and integrity,"" ""gratitude and humility."" That ethic was in keeping with a collage of American icons--the patriots who founded the country, the suffragettes, and those who struggled through the Depression. ""Doing the impossible is in the history of this nation,"" she said, in an attempt to make Obama seem so grand and so mightily engaged in the central struggles of the age that to measure his progress so early would be wrong. The first lady's task was to reflect what she sees in the nation and then show how that vision is reflected in her husband. This is what Ann Romney also did as she told the stories of those who struggled with high gas prices and extra jobs. Michelle Obama ran through the same kinds of stories, about the teacher who had to buy the school supplies and the blinded soldier who would have done it all again. It was striking on this first night how completely the national security issue has flipped between the parties. As conservative commentator Bill Kristol remarked after Mitt Romney's speech last week, it was a glaring omission that the Republican candidate didn't celebrate the men and women fighting for the country. The Democrats would make no such mistake. We saw veterans, tributes to military families, and repeated references to their sacrifice. Michelle Obama was introduced by Elaine Brye, a mother who has four children on active duty. ""If someone is there for my family then I'll be there for them,"" she said of the first lady. If the speech is effective beyond the power of well delivered rhetoric, it will be because the first lady took this description of Obama's core self and linked it to policy. This is what Ann Romney and Mitt Romney never did. The message of the GOP convention was ""Trust Mitt."" That was Michelle Obama's message too: Her husband could be trusted because he came from a humble background and has lived a middle class life. But then she started connecting the biography to the policy. This was always Bill Clinton's great gift. If this connection is successfully made, then that's what will make this pitch worth more politically than just a pretty speech by a loving wife who thinks her husband deserves an A for effort. ""We were so young, so in love, and so in debt,"" she joked about their early student loan debt, which was higher than their mortgage. ""That's why Barack has fought so hard to increase student aid."" She made the same connection between Obama's grandmother and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help women get equal pay for equal work. Tax cuts, the auto bailout, and every other policy, she argued, grew out of his biography. Michelle Obama's message at the Democratic convention was that her husband has not given up on the country, so the country shouldn't give up on her husband. ""You see, I've gotten to see up close and personal what being president really looks like. And I've seen how the issues that come across a president's desk are always the hard ones. ... At the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision, as president, all you have to guide you are your values, and your vision, and the life experiences that make you who you are."" At the GOP convention Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan said they would make hard choices. Michelle Obama's argument was that her husband should be kept in office because he already had.

""Is it bad that I don't like Mexican food?"" Kitty Dukakis asked. Her husband stacked some food on a disposable plate and came over. ""But Kitty, when I first met you loved Mexican food!"" Mike Dukakis knows a thing or two about conventions: He went to Los Angeles as a recent law-school grad in 1960, to Chicago a Eugene McCarthy delegate in 1968, and eight years later was in New York City as the governor of Massachusetts. ""It's good to be back--lots of familiar faces,"" he said. Dukakis recalled that he spent the week he became the party's nominee visiting an Atlanta-area relative's restaurants, negotiating a detente with Jesse Jackson, and preparing to formally accept the honor. Dukakis still feels pretty good about that speech, although it chastened him to appreciate how ephemeral the impact of a good convention speech can be. ""Atlanta was our high point,"" he said. He had 20 minutes before he was scheduled, inexplicably, to be interviewed by the Fox News Channel's Neal Cavuto. There was one thing Mike said he didn't understand about the 2012 campaign: Why hadn't more attention been paid to Mitt Romney's economic record as governor? He dwelled on one statistic he thought should be more familiar by now: that his home state's job growth had ranked 46th in the country during Romney's term. It was, he said, one of the reasons he was doing the interview on Fox. ""I just want to make sure people understand the Romney story in Massachusetts,"" he said. He looked around. ""Where'd Kitty go?"" he asked. She had already wandered off toward the hall, where anonymous speakers were occupying the early-evening podium. He had finished his quesadillas and was ready to move on. ""Should we join the former first lady?"" he asked."	Dispatches From the Democratic National Convention

But then the hour comes for the Big Speech, the most important moment of the campaign, and they walk behind a podium, stare into a TV camera, and read (and read and read) a prepared text from a teleprompter. We live in a golden age of public events, a time when speakers are inventing all kinds of wonderful new ways to connect with audiences. From TED talks to Apple product rollouts to televangelical sermons, speakers are exploiting all media--music, video, photographs, PowerPoint presentations, social networks, live feedback--to give their message visual bang and intellectual clarity. Better wireless microphones liberate speakers to move, to walk up to--even mingle with--their audience. Yet political speeches remain frozen in amber, as dull as Franklin Pierce. The political speech--especially the major political address like the State of the Union or the nomination acceptance--is a form that hasn't progressed since the dawn of TV and has barely evolved since 19th-century candidates stumped on front porches. This year's campaign has, if anything, been worse than ever. The full extent of oratorical experimentation: Mitt Romney has used a whiteboard to explain Medicare. It doesn't have to be this way. A case study: When he was vice president and a presidential candidate, Al Gore was as dreary a speaker as they come--wooden, static, a lock box. But after his defeat in 2000, Gore delivered what is arguably the most famous and effective political speech of our age, An Inconvenient Truth. Gore didn't suddenly become a better orator. Rather, he embraced modern media. He created a Keynote presentation incorporating charts, TV clips, animation, and then gave it casually and without a podium. TED has advanced the form even more. Hans Rosling's TED talk is a perfect marriage of speech and visual statistics. Lior Zoref brought a live ox onstage for his TED talk, then conducted an experiment in the wisdom of crowds by having the entire audience guess its weight. Even Bill Gates, a legendarily bad speaker, dazzled a TED crowd with a casually delivered speech featuring a couple of photos, a few charts, and one superb prop--a jar of mosquitoes. This rhetorical creativity appears to be everywhere but in politics. Andy Stanley, the boyish megachurch pastor, does wonders walking around a stage, talking informally, and pointing occasionally to relevant quotes flashed on the TV next to him. Steve Jobs' product launches married technology, enthusiasm, and informality to create transcendent experiences for his audiences. Watch his legendary 2007 introduction of the iPhone, in which Jobs travels the stage, demonstrates the product, explains a few charts, and uses a huge video screen to illustrate what he's talking about. It's not magic. Jobs merely used the media we already have to create a rich, emotional experience for the audience. It's easy to apply these principles to a convention acceptance speech or a State of the Union. On Thursday night, for example, President Obama should move around the grand stage in Charlotte, not imprison himself at the podium. When he talks about a voter he met on the trail, convention-goers and TV viewers should see a huge picture of her displayed behind him, or--better yet--a brief video about her. When Obama runs through his accomplishments as president, the DNC should show us a montage of images (split screen for the viewers at home): the situation room photo on the day Osama Bin Laden was killed, a reopened auto plant, a confirmed Justice Sonia Sotomayor. And if the campaign is feeling really frisky, they could even try scoring his speech with heart-swelling music. (It sure worked in The American President.) In late October, if one campaign or the other is desperate and all seems lost, they should remember the most effective rhetorical strategy of all: Give a speech while riding back and forth on a horse. (Romney could even borrow Rafalca from Ann.)	Convention Speeches Are Boring. They Should Be More Like TED Talks.

During these convention weeks, I sense my normally fine-tuned culinary preferences shifting because of logistical exigency. At the moment, my three favorite cuisines are Tex-Mex, sushi, and CNN. John, I'm glad you invited us to litigate whether this election does, in fact, suck as much as all the meta-coverage seems to have now concluded. I wonder if part of this may be a good time to disassociate the words election and campaign, two words that we often use interchangeably but that political scientists have been wise enough to separate. I think you both have been right to note the ways in which this is a big, important, interesting election: real differences, high stakes. But the campaigns are really dreary in all the ways you and others have itemized. I think what you're suggesting, John, is effectively that we go ahead and cover the election and not the campaigns. Your hope is that if we cover the election, campaigns will be forced to come around and talk about the stuff we think they ought to address. But we have a hard enough time as it is getting basic answers out of these candidates or their staffs. Romney, in particular, has blithely disregarded the widely accepted standard that campaigns at least go through the motions of presenting an agenda with some detail. Our only leverage is to effectively stop covering the vapid speeches and dishonest ads and silly Twitter spats until the campaigns give us the election we deserve. Can we really stick to a tough-love approach if it means withholding coverage of someone who stands a good shot of becoming president of the United States in a few months? More from me on campaign data-gathering on the streets of Charlotte later. Sasha 	Dispatches From the Democratic National Convention
