Today, these founders admitted that it wouldn't work. No presidential candidate had survived the first round of the online primary. At least $35 million had been spent on absolutely nothing. Well, not quite nothing. We have three new tips for the next coalition of enlightened people who want to save American democracy. 1) Do not launch by telling the New York Times you've got ""serious hedge fund"" money. 2 ) Do not rent ""swank offices a stone's throw from the White House."" (Avoiding the serious hedge fund money could probably help with this.)

3 ) Don't confuse the good intentions of Tom Friedman with an idea that makes sense. Just how badly have they failed? To survive the primary, a candidate needed at least 10,000 supporters, 1,000 each from 10 states. Americans Elect claimed to have 420,000 or so such supporters. But Buddy Roemer, the former Louisiana governor turned Occupy sympathizer, had surged to the top of the pack with around 6,000 declared supporters--total. When I reached him on Tuesday, Roemer was doing his clap-for-Tinkerbell best for Americans Elect. ""They aren't giving up,"" he told me. ""They will decide Thursday from what I'm told. They can't get rid of me that easily, man!"" Sure, but what if they disappear? The Americans Elect die-off comes just over four years after the great Unity08 collapse. Both organizations promised red-blue bipartisan-detente tickets. Both offered the chance to be ""founding delegates"" from the comfort of your home. Peter Ackerman, a Unity08 veteran, attempted to correct the funding problems that plagued Unity08 by putting $8 million into Americans Elect. The results: ballot access in 26 states, a South by Southwest Interactive award, and bupkis. Americans Elect can spin and prep for its latest delay (the May 15 candidate deadline used to be an April deadline), but we know that it's failed, and we know why. Pointless secrecy: Our two dominant political parties are easy to hate, but we know certain things about them. We know their donors. We know their local leaders. If we spend the time, we can meet their local precinct captains and delegates. They're awful, but at least they're obvious. Americans Elect wasn't. They would tell you that they were well-funded--rich enough to support more than 140 staffers in the D.C. office. But they wouldn't tell you where the non-Ackerman money came from to fund this 501(c)(4). In a December conference call, Americans Elect strategist Darry Sragow explained that donors had to stay secret or they wouldn't be safe.* ""In this country, we don't use Molotov cocktails literally,"" he said. ""We use them figuratively."" The donors would reveal themselves after they won the election. Really, this was what he said. Jim Cook, a reporter for Irregular Times, signed up as an Americans Elect delegate early on and published item after item about how the group bent its own rules by keeping them obscure. When I first encountered an Americans Elect petitioner, on primary day in New Hampshire, she politely rebuffed my questions--such as, ""Who are you?""--and told voters only that she was putting ""more choice"" on the ballot. Idealism is tough enough already--tougher if you're not an idealist. The imaginary center: Americans Elect hyped a 2011 Pew study in which 37 percent of voters--enough to win a three-way election!--called themselves independent. They hyped a Reason Foundation poll that found 89 percent of independents ready to vote third party. Do the math. Their time had come. But electoral politics run on a different kind of math, a kind that makes no sense. As John Sides has been pointing out for years, the vast, vast majority of people who tell pollsters or voting registrars that they're ""independent"" are actually deeply partisan. Historically, when a third party's won double-digit support, it's been explicitly right-wing (George Wallace 1968) or explicitly left-wing (Eugene Debs 1912). Ross Perot's 1992 campaign, the one that every modern third party promises to copy, was ideological as all hell on a few issues--deficit reduction and trade, mostly. Americans Elect's ideology was goopier than week-old pudding. Take a gander at the questionnaire filled out by Michealene Risley, currently running third in the A.E. ""primary."" She picked most of the mushy-middle options allowed by A.E. On foreign policy: ""The US should listen to other countries more often than not."" On immigration: ""Most illegal immigrants should be able to stay in the US, with some exceptions."" These are arguments you actually have out, not points you concede at the start of an election. The wrong problem: Sure, Americans Elect had a point: Washington isn't working terribly well. This is what Mitt Romney says. This is also what Barack Obama says. A.E.'s leadership got attention by floating the names of popular politicians (Hillary Clinton) and popular-among-the-media politicians (Jon Huntsman) and implying that they could fix it. ""[Obama] can't govern with control of the House and control of the Senate,"" groaned Ackerman in an interview with the New Republic's skeptical Alec MacGillis.* Sometimes a wealthy person says something that makes you wonder how people ever trusted him with money. Obama had ""control"" of the Senate--the 60 votes needed to beat a filibuster--from September 2009 to January 2010. If you don't realize how the delayed seating of Al Franken or the illness of Ted Kennedy or the victory of Scott Brown changed things, you don't know how the government works. You don't break the power of the parties by running in a presidential election. You start with Congress. That's what the conservative movement has done over 20-odd years, making it untenable to face primary voters if you cast moderate votes. So, why not take that ""serious hedge fund money"" and go after House seats? ""Americans Elect will be on the ballot in 2014,"" said Kahlil Byrd in a December Meet the Press interview.* ""It will be on the ballot in 2016."" Yes, they screwed up by pegging this to a presidential race-- they'll gain none of the automatic ballot-access benefits you get if you field a candidate--but what could $35 million do in a few House races? What could it do for a group like FairVote, with an annual budget about one-70th the size of Americans Elect's? Will it take another $8 million of Peter Ackerman's money to smother the ""third party president"" fantasy? Hedge fund fortunes have been spent on stupider things.

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/massachusetts_is_the_best_state_in_the_union_.html	"Check out our Magnum Photos gallery on Boston. Massachusetts, in today's political culture, is more epithet than state. The People's Republic, Taxachusetts, ""Sweden""--this is America's arugula-munching, maple syrup-swigging, receding-ponytail hippy uncle, exiled to its cold, lonely corner of American geography by Sunbelt population growth and a rightward-leaning national discourse. That ""Spirit of America"" license plate doth protest too much. For much of the country, Massachusetts, if not actually un-American, is the suspicious redoubt of the American left. As a native, I'm willing to take it on the chin for the state's crimes against the republic:  certain unfortunate regional accents, the term wicked, and that image of Michael Dukakis in a tank . For the state's affection for happy-clappy bumper stickers (""no one is free when others are oppressed"") and the drivers my brother calls ""Massholes""--I apologize. Still, all the Bay State-baiting can get depressing. Especially in the recent primary season, as Mitt Romney, pummeled by charges of ""Massachusetts moderate,"" has run far from the state he once governed. Et tu, Mitt? On the brighter side, though, Gov. Romney's candidacy is an opportunity to take a closer look at the state that dare not speak its name. Through all the red mist and flying blue fur this election year, it's worth reminding voters of a truth Romney probably won't be emphasizing: The nation's favorite punching bag is an exceptionally successful state. Let's compare Massachusetts to its peers on three basic measures of success: education, social well-being, and economic strength. Some Americans believe good results on these metrics are the goals of responsible government, and others believe they're the happy consequences of free markets. But however we get there, these are desirable outcomes for all Americans. First up is education, the foundation of America's meritocratic values and the key to whatever success the country will find in a globalized, knowledge-based economy. Massachusetts is renowned for its higher-education institutions. Less well known, though, is that the home of the original Tea Party also has the best schools in the country. On the most basic measures of educational achievement--fourth- and eighth-grade math and reading skills--Massachusetts tops the nation. Education Week's Quality Counts 2012 report expands on this success. On their overall index, Massachusetts ranks second, to Maryland. But on two of the index's most important measures of results--a lifetime educational Chance for Success index, and a K-12 Achievement index that bundles metrics such as test results, year-on-year improvement, and the gap between poor and wealthier kids (perhaps the truest test of our fabled meritocracy)--the Bay State again leads the nation. And most of the world. According to a 2011 Harvard study, while reading proficiency in Mississippi is comparable to Russia or Bulgaria, Massachusetts performs more like Singapore, Japan, or South Korea. Often better: Massachusetts students rank fifth in the world in reading, lapping Singapore and Japan, and needless to say, every state in the union. In math, Massachusetts slots in a global ninth, ahead of Japan and Germany. (Some international educational studies rank Shanghai and Hong Kong as separate countries; if this wasn't done, Massachusetts would likely rank two places higher.) What about social well-being? Above all, we want kids to have a healthy start in life. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Massachusetts has the nation's highest level of first-trimester prenatal care, and the third-lowest infant mortality rate (Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Missouri are about 50 percent higher). It also has the second-highest rate of child access to both medical and dental care, the nation's lowest child mortality rate, and the lowest teen death rate. It goes without saying that Massachusetts has the lowest percentage of uninsured residents--5 percent (Thanks Mitt! Mitt? You there, Mitt?), compared to 16 percent nationally, and a whopping 25 percent in Texas. On life expectancy, Massachusetts ties for sixth-highest, about five years longer than the worst-performing states. In another political universe far, far away, you might describe a place like this as pro-life. A few other metrics of social well-being: The Bay State has the second-lowest teen birth rate, the fourth-lowest suicide rate, and the lowest traffic fatality rate. The birthplace of Dunkin' Donuts has the sixth-lowest obesity rate. And depending on the source, the first state to legalize gay marriage has either the lowest or one of the very lowest divorce rates in the country. Finally, let's take a purely dollars-and-cents look at Massachusetts. No matter where you start on the political spectrum, this is the most important question, because many Americans believe we must choose between social investments and a competitive economy. So what economic sacrifices is Massachusetts making to achieve such extraordinary educational and social outcomes? None, apparently. Massachusetts has the second-highest per capita personal income among the states. Unemployment in March was 6.5 percent, well below the national 8.2 percent. Its state per-capita GDP ranks sixth-highest. Its median household income (a measure of widely-distributed income) is fifth. Massachusetts is looking particularly sharp when it comes to the globalized, tech-driven economy on which America's superpower standing hinges. According to a 2011 report, Massachusetts has the highest per-capita venture capital, patents, and technology licensing of 10 leading high-tech states. Worker productivity in Massachusetts (GDP per employed person) is the third-highest in the world. And research and development spending as a share of GDP in Massachusetts is higher than any country anywhere. Massachusetts is as green as it is high-tech, and recently displaced California as the nation's most energy-efficient state. No surprise, then, that the Kauffman Foundation put Massachusetts at the top of its New Economy Index. More surprising, perhaps, is CNBC's index of America's top states for business. This is a calculus so ruthlessly focused on corporate competitiveness that it marked states down for high union membership. Massachusetts came in sixth. Not bad for the People's Republic. All this isn't to suggest that the Bay State doesn't have problems. While the state is among the lowest for property crime, it ranks considerably worse on violent crime. On a recent corruption index, it ranked 13th--nice, but not A-list. Its unemployment figure handily beats the national number, but 14 states do better. And, what you've all been wondering about: Massachusetts has high taxes, though perhaps not as lofty as reputed. It ranks 11th-highest (and at 10 percent, only barely above the national average of 9.8 percent). It's also worth noting that there are many ways to cut the statistical cake. Massachusetts' second-lowest teen birth rate, for example, may reflect a higher abortion rate (though one that's still below the national figure). The low traffic deaths may be due to the molasses-like flow of traffic on the state's notorious roadways. And the marvelously low divorce rate is paired with a below-average marriage rate. The most compelling retort, though, is that Massachusetts is simply a rich state, so of course it has good schools and health care. To address this, I contacted Kristen Lewis, co-director of Measure of America, a project of the Social Science Research Council. Their American Human Development Index weaves health, education, and income metrics into a quick summary of a state's well-being. Connecticut ranks first and Massachusetts second. (Anyone interested in exploring the state of their state will love these beautiful interactive maps.) So, what of the charge that good outcomes result from high incomes? Lewis says ""you might turn the question on its head"" and ask, instead, why is Massachusetts so rich? ""Massachusetts and others at top of the index tend to make significant public and private investments in the ingredients of well-being,"" explains Lewis. Ultimately, these investments pay off both socially and economically. She points out that Maryland is third on Measure of America's income index, but 33rd in life expectancy. Virginia comes in 6th on income (right behind Massachusetts), but 11th on education, and 25th on health. So high income is no guarantee of good social outcomes and strong investments in people clearly haven't punished one of our wealthiest and most globally competitive state economies. In fact, if America wants to be a healthy, smart, rich, globalized, high-tech powerhouse, we arguably have no better model than Massachusetts. For many, a steady drizzle of mockery for the state and its ""moderates"" is the only response to that uncomfortable truth. Still, it's hard not to dream of a presidential campaign in which a former governor would run on, not from, his associations with Massachusetts. Dukakis, of course, ran on a ""Massachusetts Miracle."" But Gov. Romney is already too far from home for that, and probably knows better than to try."

Drive a few miles through any neighborhood. Count the signs that read ""We Stand With Scott Walker,"" or ""I Stand With Scott Walker,"" or ""Scott Walker: Believe in Wisconsin."" Try and figure out what the houses have in common. You won't. There are pieces of Walkerian flair outside of barns on Highway 41, near working-class ranch homes in Appleton, and in the tony part of Oshkosh that Sen. Ron Johnson calls home. On one stretch of Highway 26, somebody's propped up an unused toilet with a sign reading, ""Deposit recall petitions here."" Next to that, a Walker sign that crosses out half of the phrase ""for governor"" and adds ""president."" The public displays of affection for Walker can put you in mind of October 2008, when placing a HOPE poster or Shepard Fairey print in your window told neighbors about your politics and taste. The Walker gear is easily attained at one of the 20 ""victory centers"" promoted by the campaign. I stopped by half a dozen of them--local Republican offices temporarily converted to the cause. In the front of the Winnebago County office, a digital sign counted down the days to the June 5 recall. A cardboard Walker stand-up faced visitors from behind a podium. A handmade sign portrayed two cartoon burglars looking around as they hauled bags of pilfered goods. Your Governor Walker Vote Was STOLEN
 Reclaim Your Property! Inside, a 61-year-old grandmother named Diane Malecki was putting pro-Walker buttons in a tackle box. She would sell the gear at this weekend's Republican conference in Green Bay. While we talked, a supporter bought one of the buttons Malecki had designed: A sheriff's star with the legend, Walker, Taxes Ranger. ""The table and chair in this office--this came from my mom's house,"" said Malecki. ""We had to rehab it. She wore down the wood, writing and reading and writing to Congress. She was like a one-person Tea Party! She'd even write on the backs of the envelopes. I'd ask her: 'Why are you writing on there?' And she'd say, 'It doesn't hurt the postman to learn something.'"" The Walker campaign--the one currently leading in polls--is what every Republican presidential candidate tried and failed to build. There's a perfect link-up here between Tea Party, Republican Party, and megadonor. Walker's TV ads run constantly; the Democratic ads don't. Walker's swag is everywhere, paid for by $25 million in donations, two-thirds of which dropped in from outside Wisconsin. Tom Barrett, Walker's Democratic competition, has raised less than $1 million. The yawning money gap grew out of a loophole in campaign finance law. From the start of the recall process until the date the election was official--five full months--Walker's campaign was able to raise unlimited money from any source. Sheldon Adelson cut him a $500,000 check. Diane Hendricks, one of the state's richest women, gave Walker $510,000, becoming the biggest donor to a single candidate in state history. Democrats have responded the way that massively out-spent people must respond: They've made a vice out of it. On Thursday, they shot up flares about a video, from 2011, in which Walker confidently told Hendricks about his ""divide and conquer"" strategy. Walker's been answering that sort of attack with the script he wrote back during the union-led Capitol coup. ""The reason we had to raise the kind of money we raised was because of the tens of millions of dollars that have come in from outside of the state from special interests in Washington,"" said Walker at his Tuesday night primary victory speech, inside a packed Waukesha victory center. ""They funded the protests to begin with. They funded the attacks in the Supreme Court race. [A 2011 retention election became a proxy fight over Walker's labor and tax reforms.] You guys all know it well here--they spent tens of millions of dollars in the Senate recall election, and they're going to spend tens and tens of millions of dollars trying to take me out."" The ""they"" in any given Walker sentence is the labor movement. Labor isn't shy about this: It beats Walker or it's hobbled, probably for good, in power and in reputation. So Republicans aim to divide them. They point to the post-primary unity rally--labor locking arms with the victorious and defeated Democrats--that these guys were supposed to hold in Madison. Forty-eight hours before the election, Democrats scrapped the rally, announcing that their candidates would have breakfast at the winner's house instead. Labor would go ahead and rally at the Capitol. ""That's our big ace in the hole,"" said Ben Sparks, spokesman for the Wisconsin GOP. ""If you look at the Democrats, their ground game is normally a loose aggregation of outside groups. They've got a bunch of labor unions who have their own, little bitty grassroots run by each--We Are Wisconsin, United Wisconsin, and so on, and then the campaign itself. They're chopped up into little groups."" On the ground, there isn't any real Democratic division. Organizing for America is pushing its staff and activists to work on the recall. But labor-backed Kathleen Falk blew $4 million on a campaign that lost to Barrett. The outside groups helping Walker haven't wasted a cent. Americans for Prosperity, the national Tea Party group chaired by David Koch, has spent $3 million on ads bucking up Walker; it's got grassroots organizers across the state. Its last campaign ad went on air in conjunction with the MacIver Institute, a think tank that opened its offices in a Capitol Square high-rise just three years ago. MacIver sends video reporters to protests, often coming away with Breitbart-friendly proof of labor or Democrats behaving badly. One example from 2011: footage of pro-labor doctors offering bogus notes to protesters who wanted to take sick days. On Thursday, MacIver President Brett Healy met me for iced coffee on the square. The conversation was interrupted, occasionally, by the small-but-loud anti-Walker rally that happens every weekday at noon. ""It's fascinating,"" he said. ""What kicked this all off, what kicked off all the turmoil and recalls, was Act 10 and the changes to collective bargaining. And those issues were largely absent from the Senate recalls in 2011. They're largely absent from Gov. Walker's recall. I must assume that the left has done some polling and their data shows that the public isn't with them on those issues. So, they have a big question: Is their enthusiasm waning?"" The Walker campaign and the supportive 501c3s don't campaign on the reforms, specifically. Walker's ads repeat a few friendly numbers--the jobs added in Wisconsin this year (he rounds up), the jobs that Barrett's Milwaukee has lost (Walker no longer has to defend a record as Milwaukee County executive)--and sum up the Democratic record as ""double-digit tax increases and record job loss."" Barrett attacks Walker for starting an ""ideological civil war."" Walker just says that the war is over. ""Do we want to go back and rehash the debates we had last year?"" he asked at a campaign rally in La Crosse this week. ""Or do we want to take the positive reforms we made and move this state forward?"" Walker's supporters agree with a vehemence you rarely find in state elections. On Tuesday, as Walker--surprisingly--got nearly as many votes as the Democrats running against him, I visited a few polling places and met the people toting the free signs. Scott Perzentka, who runs a pier-building business, voted for Walker in Oshkosh, then headed back to his truck with Walker and biker's-rights signs. Perzentka survived a horrific motorcycle crash in 2003. The experience made him a kind of activist. As he rebuilt his life, it also reinforced his belief that people had to earn what they had, and that unions existed to puff up the salaries of people who didn't work. ""Seventy-five years ago they were out for the little guy,"" he said, ""and now they're out for themselves."""	Why No One Can Stop Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker	[]	[]
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/mitt_romney_bullied_in_prep_school_according_to_the_washington_post_.html	"One of the many tensions in evaluating presidential candidates is that we don't want to disqualify them based on the stupidity of their youth. George W. Bush's blanket denial that ""when I was young and irresponsible I was young and irresponsible"" seems like a good rule. On the other hand, we want to know who these candidates are who seek to lead us (especially when they spend so much time offering us synthetic versions of themselves). We are looking for some piece of evidence, some sign of what makes them who they are. Many of us prize ""character above all"" in a president and a lot of those hints about presidential character are located in the stories of youth. If you want to be president, your resume, accomplishments, and experience are not enough. Your origins matter. Mitt Romney faces a new challenge today. At a time when he is not well defined and seeking to introduce himself to general-election voters, the Washington Post has published a deeply reported and richly told story about the Republican nominee's youth that is extremely unflattering. According to five of Romney's prep-school classmates, when Romney was 18 years old he rounded up a group of friends to pin down another student and cut his hair. Romney says he doesn't remember the incident but apologizes for any hurt he may have caused. With all the challenges facing the country, why does this matter? It may not. The election will probably be decided on which candidate people think will do the best job helping the economy create jobs. Some might make a judgment about whether a candidate cares about them, so stories about uncaring or intolerant behavior certainly aren't helpful but not enough to swing a race. The story is interesting though because voters--and how people choose to cast their ballots in presidential elections--aren't entirely rational. A lot of the stories we tell ourselves about our leaders and ourselves surround the myths we attach to the presidency. Even if we know kids do stupid things, we gravitate to stories from a president's youth that validate our decision to choose him as our leader. Most people would agree that it is unfair to hold a person accountable for everything he did when he was in high school. But still we look, hoping to find evidence that a person was always meant to go on to do great things. The history is as old as the republic--and sometimes not even true. George Washington chopped down a cherry tree and, unable to contain the lie, outed himself to his father. ""I cannot tell a lie,"" he famously said. Or, rather, didn't say. The story is a complete myth. But it has power over our political conversation. When Haley Barbour was considering running for president he offered an opinion about why there were so many rumors about President Obama. ""There's not much known about him, in college, or growing up. ... We don't know any of the childhood things,"" Barbour said. By comparison, he said we all knew that Washington ""chopped down a cherry tree."" The story of Abe Lincoln, the American self-made man, starts in his youth by the fireside, reading and writing with chalk on a blackened shovel. When Bill Clinton needed to introduce himself to voters at his first Democratic convention, the footage of a teenage Clinton meeting John F. Kennedy was an iconic part of that process. When Democrats leaked a story about George W. Bush getting arrested for drunk driving as a young man, it cost the Republican 4 million votes, according to his top strategist Karl Rove. It may not have cost him the election, but you can't say 4 million votes don't matter. Or, put differently, Romney does not have 4 million votes to spare. Barack Obama wrote his origin story at great length in Dreams From My Father. This was not new: Candidates now run having published at least one book that puts their past in the most favorable light. What was new was that Obama's came out before he was a presidential contender. It was more frank about past drug use than he might have been had he written it later, but that frankness may have helped dampen the issue. Despite the book, it was the unfamiliarity and winding nature of Obama's origin story that his opponents tried to use against him, as Hillary Clinton's strategist Mark Penn wrote that Obama's story of his roots in Indonesia and Hawaii exposed ""a very strong weakness for him--his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values."" Obama was disqualified by his origin story.* Mitt Romney needs a new origin story. Right now he is on the very wrong side of the famous Charles Atlas advertisement. Today's revelation, when it comes to high-school antics, couldn't be much worse. Romney didn't just bully another kid, who by accounts was new to the school, soft-spoken, and the target of ridicule; he organized a mob of other kids to do it. The Post story indicates that the young man may have been the object of abuse because of rumors he was gay. A story that casts a young Romney as intolerant and without basic empathy for someone who may have been gay is unfortunate the day after Barack Obama made the most empathetic statement in support of gay rights ever made by a sitting president. Right now Romney is the bully who gangs up on another student in an unfair fight. He is Biff, and as parents we teach our kids to root for McFly. But Romney could take back his origins. A transformative moment in a person's life or personal history can clean one's slate and let one emerge as a different person. And Romney may have one. A year later, at 19, Romney was a missionary in France. He was involved in a searing car crash that by his own admission deepened his faith and changed his outlook on life. A near-death experience and a coma will do that to you. It would explain why there is no analog for the behavior described in the Post story. Romney and his team might consider having him tell that story again soon. *Update, 7:53 a.m., May 11, 2011: This paragraph was added to the article after publication."	Does It Matter if Romney Was a High-School Jerk?	['Romney', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Haley', 'Kennedy']	['gay']
4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/why_obama_s_approval_matters_so_much_to_gay_people_.html	"As president, Barack Obama has supported repealing ""don't ask, don't tell,"" adding sexual orientation and gender identity to the federal hate-crimes law, passing a federal law to ban anti-gay employment discrimination, and repealing the Defense of Marriage Act. Why does it matter so much, then, that on Wednesday he told ABC News that he supports the freedom of same-sex couples to marry? Why is this the all-important seal of approval gay people have been waiting for? Obama's previous demurral on whether marriage ought to encompass same-sex unions, as a moral proposition, was immaterial as a matter of policy. Marriage law is generally the province of the states, not Washington, and the president had already called his lawyers off defending DOMA. His personal beliefs about marriage did not directly affect the rights and lives of gay people wishing to marry. But of course, in the end, this was all a giant technicality. The moral power of the presidency may be its most important dimension: What the president believes and says influences how ordinary Americans think and behave and what laws they are willing to pass. It was Obama's few clear words today that prompted a number of LGBT advocates to announce they'd immediately max out their contributions to his re-election campaign. (My boyfriend and I chipped in a smaller but symbolically significant amount.) Maybe they're pleased because they think Obama's announcement will speed legal equality, but equally or more important, Obama's announcement is a form of affirmation in and of itself. And perhaps to our own surprise, that's become increasingly important to the LGBT community. For decades, the gay rights movement fought to create and protect a zone of privacy, where the government would leave us alone to engage in behavior many despised. We asked only for tolerance. Who cared about the imprimatur of the state anyway? ""Since When is Marriage a Path to Liberation?"" was the title of an influential 1989 essay by the late lesbian lawyer Paula Ettelbrick. Scorned as immoral, shunned as infectious, dismissed as unserious, our legal claims to equality were called ""facetious"" by the Supreme Court as recently as 1986. It's no wonder we set our sights on being simply left alone. But the zone of privacy was never enough, and it was never going to be enough. Just as African-Americans boycotted buses to protest laws that spurned their dignity, LGBT Americans have come to see that anything that holds them apart from the space occupied by other Americans is a separation that is inherently unequal. That's why the president's evolution is important. Sharing the word marriage has sometimes been dismissed as symbolism, but it's in fact about equality at its most basic. When Obama used to say he supported giving same-sex couples all the same rights as heterosexuals but not calling their unions ""marriage,"" the position was literally nonsensical. Sharing the word is the right. We cannot share in the benefits and responsibilities of marriage without occupying the same space as the rest of America. We've been impatient for Obama to ""evolve already,"" but it's worth remembering that the president's evolution is in many ways an echo of the LGBT movement's. And some of us are still moving, too: We're not all clear on why we should be keen, in light of history, to value the moral approval of others. But check it out: President Obama took a political risk. For us, and for what he thinks is right. He showed moral courage. Yes, he did it with plenty of calculation, at a time of his (or Joe Biden's) choosing. And maybe he was thinking as much about helping himself with moderates who warm to the idea of standing up for principle as he was about doing the right thing. It will be easier for Obama to cast Mitt Romney as lacking a moral core when he's not twisting in the wind himself. And embodying the future instead of the past is an asset in any campaign. All of a sudden, Mitt Romney's support for a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage seems Neanderthal. How different it might have been had Obama started out where he ended up--a full supporter of genuine equality, affirming gays instead of merely tolerating them. Then again, the same goes for LGBT people themselves. Which might help explain why gay people care so much about the president's approval--it mirrors our own. In him, we see ourselves."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/tom_barrett_won_the_democratic_primary_and_now_must_face_gov_scott_walker_.html	"MILWAUKEE--Please don't ask a Wisconsin Democrat if he's excited about his new candidate for governor, Tom Barrett. Don't ask if he thinks Democrats can win next month's recall election and expel/martyr Gov. Scott Walker. The second question makes folks nervous. The first is just unfair. Barrett's victory party, at a spiffy Hyatt Regency in the town he's governed since 2004, brings together the kind of desperate, whoever-can-win activists that you usually have to hit a Mitt Romney rally to meet. ""Look at the alternative,"" explained Phil Sanborn, an AP history/government teacher relaxing in the hotel ballroom with a Miller beer. ""They don't have any choice to be unified behind this guy. Scott Walker's the best unifying force the Democratic Party's ever had in my estimation. All he has to do is get up and talk."" Not to dump on the victor, anyway. ""It's not like Barrett's a bad candidate. He's a great candidate."" The Barrett campaign is the final political stage of a protest movement that began 15 months ago. Walking through his victory party is like touring an interactive Disney World ride about the Scott Walker backlash. Outside the ballroom--a bluegrass band called Mudriver Lee, singing the labor movement songs that once rang out in the occupied Capitol dome. Near the door--state legislators and aides for other Democratic campaigns, talking about how Walker's tax and labor reforms could be undone. Near the bar--a full-time, Russian-born protester who prefers to be called ""Chilly Chill"" swapped stories with an old UAW activist named John Stokes. Chill is wearing a ""Mr. Bubbles"" T-shirt. Stokes is missing the tips of two fingers, lost in a work accident years ago. These are the sorts of people who populated the pro-collective bargaining, anti-Walker movement at the beginning, when it was more fun. ""There was such a big movement,"" muttered Chill, ""and then it accomplished nothing. America stopped working. Hundreds of thousands come to the Capitol, they protest, and all their effort is fruitless?"" ""No, no,"" said Stokes. ""All of that made people aware."" The protests turned into recalls against Republican state senators, which turned into a recall of Gov. Walker. ""He promised 250,000 jobs, right? We don't have that. He's not sharing revenue with the schools. He screwed a lot of people. He screwed people that voted for him, man!"" The dreamy movement stage of the Wisconsin battle is over. The raw political stage--a  four-week campaign between Barrett and Walker--has begun. It's a rematch of the campaign Barrett lost two years ago. This primary was a rematch of the campaign Barrett lost 10 years ago, a fight for the Democratic nomination with the Madison-based Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk. (Both of them lost to Jim Doyle, who went on to actually become governor.) This was not the campaign that the left dreamed of. Sure, it'll do. Walker's Act 10 has to be repealed. But when I covered the Capitol protests, the first inklings I saw of a recall campaign were handmade signs begging recently-defeated Sen. Russ Feingold to run against Walker. After Democrats won two state Senate recalls--they'd needed three to take over the chamber--Feingold demurred, and said that ""28 continuous years as an elected official"" was enough. As soon as the Walker recall was certified, Falk rushed in to fill the Feingold-shaped void. She had the cred: In her final months as Dane County executive, she'd filed the first lawsuit against the Walker ""Budget Repair Bill"" that started the backlash. She reeled in support from the state's alphabet soup of anti-Walker unions--AFSCME, AFL-CIO, AFT, SEIU. And then, on March 30--right before the deadline--Barrett entered the race. This wasn't ideal. Unions didn't just endorse Falk because she put her hand up first. They did not trust Barrett the way they trusted her. As mayor, Barrett had attempted to take more control of Milwaukee schools away from the unions. After Walker's Act 10 passed, unions thought they saw Barrett taking advantage of the new powers it granted municipalities to scrap and renegotiate union contracts. Falk said she would veto any budget that left Act 10 intact. Barrett wouldn't say that. ""If there is no budget,"" he explained in an April debate, ""we will have a permanent Scott Walker budget."" On Election Day I drove to Green Bay, where the AFL-CIO was going door to door for Falk. There was a polling place right inside the labor hall--no relationship to the campaign, obviously--and a wall of trinkets from previous lost causes. (An editorial attacking the nascent NAFTA agreement in 1993. Wisconsin-shaped ""blue fists,"" the logos of the 2011 protest campaign.) When volunteers arrived at the Election Day nerve center, they grabbed walk lists, data about the doors they needed to knock in the suburbs. If the voters weren't home, they'd leave door-hangers informing them of Falk's ""true progressive"" record. ""She's been a straight shooter with unions,"" explained Donovan Juss, a supporter manning the volunteer station. ""Barrett's been all over the place."" Heck, Falk was just better at the job than Barrett was. She understood why collective bargaining needed to be restored to state employees. ""She saved thousands of jobs,"" explained Julie Jansch, who'd retired from the police department after Walker's reforms took away the incentive of staying longer to increase retirement benefits. ""You don't do that unless you actually sit down and talk to people."" It felt a little rote. I tagged along with one canvasser as she dropped off signs. Her jeep wore two stickers with the ""RECLAIM WISCONSIN"" slogan--one with the blue fist, one for Falk. After that, I drove down to Madison to catch Falk at her final campaign rally. At 4:30, three and a half hours before polls closed, 10 volunteers were waiting and waving Falk signs outside the Willy Street Co-Op. One sign displayed the digits Falk had been given when she joined the co-op in the 1970s--member number 368. Falk herself was a few minutes late. ""She went home for a second, to drop something off,"" explained a volunteer from the Sierra Club--another Falk-not-Barrett group. Falk arrived moments later, wearing a green blazer to match her campaign signs. Music blasted out of Jamerica, a business across the street, as she waved at cars and chatted up old friends. ""He was my son's soccer coach!"" she said, pointing at a man wearing a blue-fist/red background T-shirt. A cyclist slowed down to say hello. ""I ride, too!"" said Falk. ""I ride a hybrid Trek, built right here in Wisconsin."" The candidate put her best spin on a race that she was about to lose badly. ""It's been a positive campaign,"" she said, ""and we worked hard to keep it that way. But I'm the only candidate who's offered a plan to undo Act 10--a special session of the legislature."" I asked her why polls showed Barrett running slightly stronger against Walker than her. ""We've both run statewide, and I got more votes the last time I ran than he got in 2010."" The electability case was coming ""from politicians, and he's one of them. We've got the grassroots on our side. Right here, you can see--we've got great people from the Sierra Club, from AFSCME."" As the event slowed down, Falk met a mother who wanted a special poster--images of every governor of Wisconsin, all male, all black-and-white, with a full-color Falk at the bottom. She scrawled ""it's about time"" on the back of it, and walked back to make the delivery. I left in order to make it to Barrett's party. The crowded ballroom didn't even murmur when the AP called it for their man--it was too early to pay attention. Barrett held off his speech until 10 p.m., right after TV had cut to Falk and right before it would cut to Walker. The Democratic victor milked this for all he could. He waded slowly through the crowd--only a couple hundred people--as a symphonic anthem played and cameras snapped his photo. When he reached the stage, he high-fived his children, turned toward the cameras, and spoke with loose notes for eight minutes. ""We cannot fix Wisconsin as long as Scott Walker is the governor,"" he said. ""Scott Walker started an ideological civil war in this state that's divided this state like it's never been divided before."" He would use the phrase ""ideological civil war"" three more times. ""Family members shy away from talking to family members because it's become too bitter. It does not have to be that way!"" Barrett didn't actually mention Act 10, the ostensible reason why Walker was facing recall. He didn't mention ""collective bargaining,"" either. His message, to a national audience, was that Scott Walker was too divisive and ""decided he's got to be the right wing's rock star."" And the left wasn't going to try and beat him with a rock star of its own."	Are Wisconsin Democrats Capable of Stopping Gov. Scott Walker?	['Donovan', 'Romney']	[]

So while I'm thrilled to celebrate his support for gay marriage, as little as it means legally, I'm irked by his all-too-eloquent conversion story. In his interview with ABC News, the president recounted a change of heart on gay marriage. He said his thinking had evolved ""over the course of several years as I have talked to friends and family and neighbors."" He talked of having observed members of his own staff ""in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together."" He referenced conversations with his wife, who agrees with him. And of course he invoked the troops: ""those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that Don't Ask Don't Tell is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage."" Do you believe that--through exposure to these people--the president has actually changed his mind on gay marriage? I don't. He has always supported it. Everything about his history--his progressive politics, his civil rights activism, his own heritage--strongly indicates that he would favor gay marriage. Oh, and then there is the fact that he said he supported gay marriage, unequivocally. In 1996, as a state senate candidate, Obama wrote and signed a survey declaring: ""I favor legalizing same sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages."" When he ran for president, Obama denied support for gay marriage while endorsing civil unions, and circulated an obviously bushwah story disavowing the 1996 survey, claiming someone else had filled it out. (No matter that Obama signed it.) Liberal Democrats accepted his cover story--and his obvious hypocrisy--because they knew that supporting gay marriage would have been politically fatal to his 2008 prospects. Nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more. There is no elegant way to own up to past hypocrisy. But perhaps we shouldn't spend too much time congratulating the president on his ""evolution."" When he decided to pursue higher office, he made the wrong decision on gay marriage for political convenience. Now, he is making the right decision on gay marriage, and also for political convenience. He has known that gay marriage was right for at least 16 years--a lot longer than most Americans, including me. Let's not praise him too much for finally speaking out about it today."

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/thomas_mann_and_norman_ornstein_s_ideas_won_t_solve_washington_s_gridlock_.html	"The politician's words captured the moment. ""This is a historic time ... and one side simply has to win out over the other."" It wasn't Roosevelt describing the need to vanquish the Germans or Bush echoing his call for a ""war on terror."" It was Richard Mourdock, the Tea Party favorite who yesterday ended the career of moderate Republican Sen. Richard Lugar in the Indiana Republican primary, explaining how he sees his new job. Lugar was the most recent moderate legislator to be shown the exit. But moderates of both parties are disappearing from the Senate and House at a rapid clip. According to Nate Silver, of 27 moderate Republican senators in office in 2007, only six of them--at most--will return to Congress next year. And a new wave of Tea Party-backed candidates are leaving no question about where they stand. As Mourdock told Fox News, ""I have a mind-set that says bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view."" In their new book, It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism, Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein offer both an insightful diagnosis of the problem of a broken Washington and a set of proposed solutions. Their diagnosis is mostly right--there's a mismatch between our form of government and our new, fiercely ideological political parties. But their proposed solutions won't get us very far thanks to the very pathologies they identify. The cliche is true: Washington is broken. But it's even worse than Mann and Ornstein say: It can't be fixed. Think of the most pressing domestic problem facing the country today. Whether you choose persistent unemployment, the struggling economic recovery, the housing market, health care, the social security fund crisis, or the ballooning national debt, chances are good that there is consensus that the problem is real and that the president, a blue ribbon commission, or someone in Congress already has proposed some solution. And chances are even better that the proposed solution has no realistic chance of being enacted into law. The problem, Mann and Ornstein tell us, is that we have increasingly ideological parties working in a constitutional system premised on the need for continued compromise to get things done. Thanks to our Constitution and the rules of the House and Senate, any piece of legislation must run through a series of ""vetogates"" to get passed, from congressional committees to the Senate filibuster. (Schoolhouse Rock's take is a bit quaint. Try the Daily Show instead.) Without supermajority support for proposed legislation, it is next to impossible to get anything through Congress these days. There is no question that parties have become more ideological, with the most conservative Democrat more liberal than the most liberal Republican in the Senate. (The causes are complex, but come in large part from the movement of Southern conservatives from the Democratic to Republican Party with the passage of civil rights legislation.) Partisan competition is so intense these days that the minority party does what it can to block even the good ideas of the other party, in order to gain electoral advantage in the next election. And just wait for the next Supreme Court nomination. Mann and Ornstein have gained the most attention for their claim that Republicans are more to blame than Democrats, a charge which seems unfair. As Chris Cillizza explained, many of the extreme ideological Republicans in the House are doing exactly what other members of the House are doing: representing the interests of the constituents who elected them. The Tea Party crowds who pushed for more extreme legislators got just what they hoped for. It is not only the legislators who have a strong ideological, no compromise attitude: The voters who elected them do, too. And Democratic legislators have shown they can throw up roadblocks as well as Republicans. The focus on whether Republicans are more to blame has distracted from the fundamental truth in Mann and Ornstein's book: If such ideological polarization persists, we would be much better off with a British-style parliamentary system rather than our traditional ""separation of powers"" approach to government. In a well-designed parliamentary democracy, the majority party can actually govern, and voters can punish that party when it governs badly or things go wrong. Voters hold politicians accountable. Mann and Ornstein don't propose an actual move to parliamentary democracy, which would require major amendments to the Constitution along the lines we are unlikely to see in our lifetimes. And they reject a number of reform proposals which they call ""bromides to avoid,"" including waiting for the system to correct itself, a third party (such as Americans Elect), a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, term limits, or full public financing of elections. Among the changes they want to see to our political system are voter registration modernization (making it easier for people to register to vote); compulsory voting (or at least efforts to end state restrictions on voting); moving election day from Tuesday to a weekend; putting congressional redistricting into the hands of citizen commissions, as was recently done in California; allowing more open primaries whereby non-party voters can vote for party nominees; the use of alternative voting systems (such as instant runoff voting), whereby people who vote for less popular candidates have their votes reallocated to higher vote-getters to produce majority winners; and revamped campaign finance laws to improve disclosure, take lobbyists out of the fundraising business, and prevent candidates from coordinating with Super PACs. Of course, most of these reforms would never clear the hurdles of our hyper-partisan atmosphere. More importantly, they hardly seem likely to fix Washington and end polarization. The basic gist of these reforms is to increase the number of voters in both primary and general elections. Mann and Ornstein expect these voters to be more moderate, and in turn they will choose less ideological senators and representatives. These new members will then agree to pass legislation in the spirit of compromise. But why would these nonvoters-made-voters necessarily be any more moderate than the voters we already have? If parties did not have to worry about getting out the vote, they might do a lot more to get their base excited about their candidates, and politics could get even nastier. We just don't know. Mann and Ornstein also offer a second set of reforms, including making it harder to filibuster bills in the Senate, strengthening executive power (so that voters would hold the president more accountable), and having the media and others with clout in society shame extreme members of Congress into moderation. Some of these are nonstarters. Republican House members will wear excoriation by the New York Times editorial board--or nowadays almost any media outlet--as a badge of honor. Making it harder to filibuster legislation would move the Senate toward a more majoritarian institution (although not really majoritarian, since each state gets the same two Senators regardless of state population). While filibuster reform might be helpful to end gridlock, it would not solve the problem of polarized parties, separation of powers, and lack of accountability. Imagine if Mitt Romney is elected president, Republicans maintain control of the House and Democrats (barely) keep the Senate, with a weakened filibuster rule. If things go poorly, would voters be inclined to blame Republicans or Democrats? The answer again is unclear. Mann and Ornstein have done a great public service in opening a dialogue on how to fix the mismatch between our political and constitutional systems of government. But we need to go back to the drawing board on how to fix Washington. And if no-compromise candidates like Richard Mourdock are our future, things will have to get much worse before they get better."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/north_carolina_s_gay_marriage_amendment_a_right_wing_christian_scare_campaign_.html	"North Carolina is voting today on a state constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage. Actually, the amendment goes much further. By establishing that ""marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this State,"" it would invalidate all civil unions and domestic partnerships, regardless of orientation. If that's not enough to worry you, opponents of the amendment are using this recorded phone message from Bill Clinton to turn voters against it: What it will change is North Carolina's ability to keep good businesses, attract new jobs, and attract and keep talented entrepreneurs.  If it passes, your ability to keep those businesses, get those jobs, and get those talented entrepreneurs will be weakened. ... Its passage will also take away health insurance from children and could even take away domestic violence protections from women. The coalition backing the amendment, Vote FOR Marriage NC, is denouncing this scare campaign. The coalition tells voters: ""Make your decision on fact and not fear."" But just in case, the coalition and its allies are delivering a scarier message: Vote for the amendment, or you and your state will go to hell. Here's a rundown of the campaign's talking points. 1. Gay marriage will eliminate concern for children. ""Every child born into a same-sex relationship is intentionally denied the love and affection of one of her biological parents,"" the coalition argues. ""Under a definition of marriage that is genderless, the interests of children ... [are] eliminated entirely. Only the wishes of the two adults in question matter."" 2. Gay marriage will reduce procreation by heterosexual married couples. At a March 28 forum, coalition chairwoman Tami Fitzgerald alleged, ""What gay marriage means is that fewer and fewer children are going to be raised by a married mother and father."" Fitzgerald didn't explain the math or the mechanism. Perhaps some sort of distraction is involved. 3. Gay marriage will impoverish women and kids. According to the coalition, ""When marriage ceases to have its historic meaning and understanding, over time fewer and fewer people will marry. We will have an inevitable increase in children born out of wedlock, an increase in fatherlessness, [and] a resulting increase in female and child poverty ..."" Apparently this is the causal sequence Fitzgerald has in mind: more marriages, therefore fewer marriages, and therefore, more starving children. 4. Gay marriage will destroy freedom. ""Gay marriage means the beginning of the end of religious freedom,"" Fitzgerald predicted at the March 28 forum. The coalition elaborates: Those who do not agree with this new definition of marriage ... will be punished for their beliefs.  ... Wedding professionals have been fined for refusing to participate in a same-sex ceremony. Christian innkeepers in Vermont and Illinois are being sued over their refusal to make their facilities available for same-sex weddings ... A counselor, for example, could not refuse ""marriage therapy"" to a same-sex couple because she doesn't believe in gay marriage. She'd put her licensure at risk. The coalition offers no evidence or details for these allegations. The two stories I tracked down--the complaints in Vermont and Illinois--are based on public accommodations law, not on marriage law. So I wouldn't put much stock in the rest of the coalition's claims. 5. Gay marriage will weaken the economy. In support of the amendment, Mark Creech, executive director of the Christian Action League, says ""mountains of social science research"" show that ""the well-being of children, the emotional and physical health of adults, and even the state of our workforce are all tethered in some way to the existence of stable one-man-and-one-woman marriages."" Somehow, gay marriage would undermine this foundation of productivity. The coalition contends: ""If anything, the amendment will help our economy. States with a marriage protection amendment in their state constitution are some of our country's top performing economic states."" 6. Gay marriage will lead to man-on-dog marriage. Daniel Heimbach, a professor of Christian ethics at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, says voters should approve the amendment because ""if marriage is radically redefined as being just a way of affirming private feelings of loving attraction, then equality will require allowing people who love dogs to marry dogs, and people who love ice cream to marry ice cream."" (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) 7. Failure to pass the amendment would be treason against God. At an April 20 rally, David Gibbs, president of the Christian Law Association, told the crowd: ""The highest crime that our country has is murder. And the second highest crime is treason. For us not to pass this amendment is treason in God's court."" Gibbs went on: ""If we don't raise our voice at a moment like this, it is treason in heaven. ... We're betraying the savior who called us."" 8. If we don't pass the amendment, we'll lose God's protection from economic, environmental, and racial disaster. The coalition issues this threat in video featuring a statement from Billy Graham's daughter, Anne Graham Lotz. ""I support an amendment to our constitution that would define marriage exclusively as the union of a man and a woman,"" Lotz tells voters. ""Because we live in such perilous, unstable times economically, environmentally, politically, globally, racially and even religiously, we need the security that comes from God's protection and blessing.  This is not the time to defy Him by flaunting an institution He has clearly ordained, thus provoking His displeasure."" A homemade video for the amendment delivers a similar message: ""People ask me, two gay people getting married, how does it affect me personally? It doesn't affect me at all. What does affect me as a society [is] losing God's grace upon this great nation, our state, and our local churches. ... I will not take a chance of losing God's grace upon this great state."" 9. If we don't pass the amendment, God will strike us down like Sodom. ""Several times in the Old Testament, God said to destroy the Sodomites,"" Ron Baity, president of Return to America, reminded pastors at a March dinner for the amendment. ""I'm not asking us to do that. I'm just telling you what God said."" At the April 20 rally, another minister added: ""God told us. If He judged Sodom and Gomorrah, He will judge this nation if we continue on the pathway we are on."" So get out there and vote, people of North Carolina. Make your decision on fact, not fear. Just don't undermine our productivity, impoverish our children, sanction bestiality, or risk God's wrath. You'll be sorry if you do.

In that article, Rubio defends himself against an argument I made a few weeks ago about his lack of executive experience: I chuckled when I read an article yesterday. The guy wrote that the only experience I have is being on the city commission. I mean, I'm not telling you that I'm the most experienced guy in the Capitol, but I served nine years in one of the largest legislatures in the country. I was in leadership eight of my nine years. I was majority whip, majority leader, and speaker of the house. We had a $72 billion budget--which is larger than most states. I wasn't part of the landscaping crew until last week, either. Great point, senator! Indeed, as the guy wrote in the article, you've got more experience than Abe Lincoln had when he became president. The question isn't whether you've got experience--you've arguably faced more political challenges than Barack Obama had in political life when he ran for president in 2008. The question is whether you've got the kind of experience the man who might be your boss thinks is crucial for the job. How important does Mitt Romney think it is to have executive and not legislative experience? While I was looking through old Romney ads, I came upon this one which is about the centrality of executive experience. Talking about why Hillary Clinton would make such a terrible president, he said: ""She hasn't run a corner store; she hasn't run a state; she hasn't run a city. She has never run anything."" If you've never run anything, Gov. Romney thinks you are disqualified from office. Marco Rubio falls short of the Romney standard. Does that matter? As Hayes points out, Rubio is a talented politician. What independent voter is going to think even for a second about the academic question of whether politicians have a certain kind of experience? Voters make their choice based on their gut and Rubio has a lot that appeals to that gut. Plus, nominees have picked running mates that contradict things they've said before. Heck, Ronald Reagan picked his opponent, George Bush. President Obama picked Joe Biden, who once said Obama wasn't qualified for the office. So no big deal. But is there a different standard for Romney, since one of his weaknesses is that he's regularly reversed positions that he previously suggested were iron-clad. Romney has been attacked for this, but he's been talented enough at showing malleability and at shifting his emphasis on things to get himself the GOP nomination. Anyone who is so sensitive to these kinds of flip-flops that they would disqualify Romney has already done so. That means the political downside to choosing Rubio--and appearing to flip-flop once again--might be zero. Independent voters don't like rigidity. So, if you really wanted to push it, you could argue that by picking Rubio (who does not come across as doctrinaire) Romney might send signals to independent voters that he's not as ""severely conservative"" as he tried so hard to prove during the primaries. It is a cliche of campaigns that a nominee's vice presidential pick is the first presidential-level decision he makes. Usually that is supposed to mean it's a furrowed-brow business,  nonpolitical and all about the attributes required for office--like executive experience. But contradicting what you once prized with a straight face is also a necessary requirement of the presidency. So even if Romney picks Rubio, his staff can still claim he passed the first presidential test with flying colors."	Rubio Wants You to Know He's Experienced.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/the_libertarian_party_is_expected_to_nominate_gary_johnson_for_president_.html	"Gary Johnson is late. He's pretty happy about the reason: too many interviews on the schedule today. That was never a problem when he was running for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. Now that he's the front-runner for the less-exclusive Libertarian Party nod, people want to talk to him. ""We started out at Grover Norquist's meeting,"" says Johnson, putting down his iPad to join me at a Dupont circle coffee shop. Norquist's meeting of conservatives is off the record, but attendees can confirm that they crossed the threshold. ""I thought it was a really good reception. Part of being out there, campaigning, talking to people, is being able to read body language. And it was all good. Nobody was dozing off. Nobody was shaking their heads. They were actually shaking their head this way."" He nods vigorously. We're talking on the day that Newt Gingrich announced the end of his profound presidential bid, when the Republican Party, supposedly, was learning to love Mitt Romney. It's a few days before Johnson will claim the Libertarian Party's nomination, potentially becoming a spoiler for Romney. The heads really nodded this way? No heads shaking that way? ""No, none, zero,"" says Johnson. ""I really believe I'm gonna take it from Obama rather than Romney. I joke, you know--maybe all those pot-smoking, marriage equality, get out of Afghanistan voters for Romney are going to switch to me. Then, boy, he'll be in trouble!"" In its 36 years of fielding presidential candidates, the Libertarian Party has settled on two types. The first: obscure activists who hew to the Ayn Rand Bible. The second: semi-famous politicians who might, finally, give the party an electoral media breakthrough. In 2004, the party went that first route and nominated Michael Badnarik, an affable computer programmer and freelance Constitution teacher. In 2008, the party convinced itself that former Rep. Bob Barr, a drug warrior turned leave-the-kids-alone activist, could ride the jetstreams of Ron Paul's presidential campaign. Badnarik got 0.3 percent of the vote. Barr got 0.4 percent. Johnson makes Libertarians a little more hopeful. Party leaders had courted Johnson ever since 2000, when he was still governor of New Mexico, and nationally famous for his support of drugs decriminalization. In 2011, when Johnson started missing the cut for Republican debates, the party begged him to come over. ""From the beginning,"" recalls Johnson, ""they were saying 'If this doesn't work out, we have a place for you.' "" On Friday night in Las Vegas, Johnson will join lesser known activists like R. Lee Wrights (slogan: ""Stop All War"") and Roger Gary (slogan: ""Rock Solid"") for a presidential debate. On Saturday, he expects to win the nomination and pick former California Judge Jim Gray as his running mate. He will give a victory speech, then focus on the states he thinks he can win. ""I think at this point there are a few libertarian states,"" says Johnson. ""New Mexico might actually be in play. That's a possibility. Wyoming. Montana. Nevada. Alaska. I'm thinking in terms of electoral votes. Those are states where we might actually win a three-way race."" This is what every third party candidate says. Why would 2012 be different? ""Well, if you go back to 2008, Obama was the messiah to a lot of people,"" says Johnson ""Now you've got 80 percent of people saying they'd vote for a third party candidate. Do I make a difference? I don't know, I don't know. But being on the ballot in all 50 states, being in the game--wow! At some point, collectively, the country has to say, is there anyone else in this race? And I hope the answer they hear is, 'yes, Libertarian Gary Johnson.' "" When he was a Republican candidate, Johnson tried to carve out a space on the libertarian left wing of the party. The people who managed debates determined, through a process of their own design, that this wing did not actually exist. As an L.P. candidate, Johnson insists that he will make it harder for Obama to win another term. Johnson will campaign on the drug war, for example. Surely no one who voted for Obama on that issue could vote for him again. ""He's certainly no better than Bush,"" says Johnson. ""Something I've argued since I've really stepped out on this issue is, the pusher, the seller of drugs is really misunderstood. The seller of drugs is somebody who was the user, who's now thrust into the selling role because the person ahead of them got arrested, sent to jail. This is why I've espoused decriminalization. Imagine the thought process: It's OK to possess it, it's OK to use it, so now, with impunity, you can go out and say 'hey, Joey, wanna buy some pot?' "" To make his point, Johnson affects a raspy Ratso Rizzo voice. ""Well, Joey goes to jail, and you get your pot. That doesn't solve the problem. Obama doesn't solve the problem by going after the suppliers."" Johnson has to wrap up the meeting because he's got an interview with the Washington Post. There's a spike of interest in third-party candidates right now, in part because the Romney-Obama race is so dreadful and in part because of the ""Field of Dreams"" campaign of Americans Elect. The group, which has spent at least $23 million, is drifting toward nominating former Comptroller General David Walker on a fiscal austerity platform. This does not worry Johnson. ""Americans Elect is kind of playing itself out,"" he says. ""As a candidate, as a declared candidate, you have to have 10,000 supporters from 10 states to win their nomination. Well, the cumulative support of all the candidates now is just below 10,000. I've seen that David Walker has 300 supporters, total. He needs 1,000 from 10 states and that needs to happen pronto. I don't know. I'm just guessing that doesn't happen. Anyway, he already has a candidate. Me!"" One more reason why people are talking to Johnson: They want to see what happens to the libertarians (small ""L"") after Ron Paul fails to win the GOP nomination. Johnson wants to win his supporters over. He wants to win over Paul's megadonor Peter Thiel. ""We had a nice dinner."" It would help Johnson tremendously if he could get a super PAC-scale donor in his corner, as the Libertarians did in 1980, when their vice presidential candidate was David Koch. Yes, that David Koch, who later gave up on electoral politics. ""I can't get in to see the Kochs,"" says Johnson. ""I don't know when that's gonna change."" Is it a missed connection or a blow-off? ""It's just a blow-off."" What does he want to say to them? ""Well, the fact that they've been such activists--I mean, they've been terrific! The Cato Institute? That was the Koch brothers! I just want to say, 'Thanks'! And, 'Hello.' "" This is the only down note in our conversation. Before Johnson leaves, he points to the Public Policy Polling survey that suggests he'd be a factor if he wins in Vegas. He's at 6 percent. Most of the support seems to come from Romney. ""I'm just jazzed about the 6 percent,"" says Johnson. ""Thinking that it goes higher. How am I at 6 percent, as a Libertarian, when I wasn't even on the radar running as a Republican. Ninety-five percent of America doesn't know who I am!"" He corrects himself. ""I guess it's 94 percent."""	Can Libertarian Gary Johnson Pick Up Where Ron Paul Left Off?

He taught others to kill. He built a global network of mass murder. He gave his life to death. But that wasn't his goal. We know what he really wanted, thanks to documents seized from his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, by the Navy SEALs who terminated him. The documents, released yesterday by the U.S. government, show Bin Laden saying in private what he said in public: He wanted to serve Islam and honor God's commandments. He was obsessed with right and wrong. He condemned the Times Square bomber for betraying an oath of loyalty to the United States. Bin Laden and his lieutenants even fretted about whether it was OK to invest in stocks. Bin Laden wanted to do the right thing. And he wanted to win hearts and minds. He wanted to persuade people, not kill them. He thought killing was the way to get there. That's what makes the Abbottabad documents so poignant. They show the world's most feared terrorist, at the end of his life, grappling with the moral and political failure of terrorism. Among the collection, the fullest picture of Bin Laden's thinking emerges in a 44-page letter he wrote in 2010. He chastised followers who had reinterpreted tatarrus--an Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances--to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians. This descent into indiscriminate slaughter, he warned, had turned Muslims against the jihadi movement. Bin Laden wrote that the tatarrus doctrine ""needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established."" He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaida, Bin Laden found particular fault with Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. He condemned a TTP attack on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that ""the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants."" Bin Laden's subordinates wrote to the TTP's leader, warning that its ""methods and behavior"" violated Islamic law and risked ""corruption of the jihadi movement."" The Abbottabad documents show similar revulsion at the tactics of al-Qaida's Iraq affiliate, which ruthlessly blew up Shiite civilians. One adviser called on al-Qaida to repudiate such ""ignorant/ungodly criminality."" It wasn't just the killing that worried Bin Laden and his lieutenants. It was the oppressive fanaticism. In Somalia, Bin Laden cautioned against al-Shabab's harsh and rigid interpretations of Islamic law. He counseled the group to grant ""the benefit of doubt when it comes to dealing with crimes and applying Sharia,"" so that the most extreme punishments could be avoided. One Bin Laden associate worried that Iraqi jihadists were alienating the public by talking like ""extremists."" Another criticized online jihadi forums as ""biased"" and ""repulsive to most Muslims"" because of the commenters' ""bigotry"" against versions of Islam other than their own. A third urged his comrades ""to rid ourselves of the accusation of inflexibility and narrow-mindedness"" and ""broaden the horizons of our brethren."" He pleaded: ""We must avoid the stigma of being a one-dimensional sect, opposed to all others. We are Muslims following the teachings of Islam and we are not the owners of the Salafist way, and must avoid [stereotyping] each other."" These appeals for tolerance, like Bin Laden's appeals to avoid targeting civilians, were generally reserved for Muslims. But some advisers went further. One excoriated al-Qaida's Iraq affiliate for attacking churches and antagonizing Christian Arabs who might otherwise support the anti-American insurgency. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a ""truce"" that would bring the country ""stability"" or would at least ""show the people that we are careful in keeping ... the Muslims safe on the basis of peace."" In Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised al-Shabab to pursue economic development. He instructed his followers around the world to focus on education and persuasion rather than ""entering into confrontations"" with Islamic political parties. How could a man responsible for so much killing write these things? How could a man who wrote such things be responsible for so much killing? The answer that emerges from the Abbottabad documents is that Bin Laden didn't understand what he had unleashed. Only at the end did he begin to face the consequences of terrorism, not for all the infidels he had slain, but for Islam, justice, and al-Qaida. His movement was destroying itself. That, inevitably, is what terrorism does. Most people think it's gravely wrong to kill children and other noncombatants. They don't like sectarian conflict or perpetual war. They don't want to live under oppressive government. If you go around blowing up crowded markets and chopping people's hands off for petty crimes, they'll turn on you. Bin Laden blamed these moral and political mistakes on his followers. He thought they had misunderstood and abused the ideas he preached. He never recognized that the cancer was in the ideas themselves. He thought you could blow up markets full of Christians without blowing up markets full of Muslims. But once you start blowing up markets--and rationalizing it through creative interpretations of scripture--it's easy to justify killing whoever's in the way, or whoever's available. And once you declare war on infidels, it's easy to extend your definition of infidels from non-Muslims to Shiites. Bin Laden was too deep in this madness to find his way out. But his letters are a warning to those who would follow. If you kill civilians in God's name, you're on the path to betraying God, your values, and your people. You'll destroy yourself and your movement. Turn away. William Saletan's latest short takes on the news, via Twitter: "	Bin Laden's Documents Show Him Facing the Failure of Terrorism	[]	[]
12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/newt_gingrich_ends_his_presidential_campaign_.html	"The embeds found the hotel before anybody else did. The ballroom where Newt Gingrich would suspend his presidential campaign was tiny, and there were only four comfortable tables for the press, so the embeds snagged them first. Only fair. These TV reporters, none of them older than 25, had been collecting video of Gingrich until long after their networks stopped using it. They did not earn the approval of Winston Cornwall, a strategist who said he'd done some work with Gingrich in the 1990s, who stalked the hotel hallway in a blue blazer. ""The teenagers are here,"" said Cornwall. ""I'm disappointed. I guess I was expected some kind of rally with Newt's supporters and staff. But it looks like a press conference. I don't even see any top reporters."" He craned his neck toward the hotel elevators. ""I stand corrected. There's press royalty right here!"" He'd spotted the Washington Post's Dana Milbank, who writes a daily ""Washington Sketch"" and materializes at events that carry a Defcon 1 risk of farce. Newt Gingrich, who has been written off as a has-been at least twice, had never really given a speech like this. In 1998, when he gave up the speaker's gavel, the announcement came via a statement read to reporters by a spokeswoman. Gingrich himself was sequestered in Georgia, brooding. In the summer of 2011, when the political press ran early obits of his presidential campaign, Gingrich fed off it, kept on running, and won two primaries. His Hilton Arlington address would be his first-ever career valedictory. People like to be in the room for things like that. As 3 p.m. approached, Gingrich's brother, daughters, and extended family found the ballroom and chatted with each other. ""What have I been up to? I've been letting out my skirts,"" said a staffer talking to Gingrich's brother Randy. (Randy looks like the speaker might look if he was a head taller and got picked first in gym class.) ""I want to tell Newt, I put on 20 pounds for you."" R.C. Hammond, Gingrich's perpetually arch spokesman, alternated between chats with supporters and quick Q-and-As with reporters. The Romney campaign, he said, had been generous giving Gingrich access to helpful donors. Gingrich would campaign wherever he was wanted. The campaign picked this hotel because ""the staffer who picked it went in a concentric circle around our office, looking for whatever room was closest."" Nathan Naidu, Gingrich's less arch spokesman, found the people who'd spent the most time on his campaign bus. At one point, all of them had written stories about what a disaster Newt 2012 had morphed into. Bygones. Naidu pointed at the unfamiliar press--which included, for some reason, two Japanese TV stations--that had occupied all the free space in the room. ""I don't remember them from the bus!"" he said. ""I don't want to see anyone who wasn't on the bus."" He excused himself when he spotted a photographer who'd covered Gingrich: ""I need to go hug somebody I like."" Many photographers had to go without hugs. Two of them debated among themselves about whether they'd paid enough to park--was two hours enough? Would Gingrich go longer than that? A few Gingrich staffers and volunteers snuck into the cramped press rows and reminisced about the campaign. Louis Altobelli had joined the campaign in March, long after it was clear that Gingrich couldn't win. His job: Calling delegates. It was incredibly unrewarding work. ""I talked to delegates that Newt won in Tennessee, who said they weren't going to back him anymore,"" said Altobelli. ""It was the machine. That's the word right now. We were outspent, and it's too bad, because it would have been nice to have somebody different, instead of the machine's choice."" At 3:10, Gingrich's daughters, two of their children, and one of their husbands took the stage. They stood stoically for a while. Finally, Callista Gingrich emerged from behind the stage, trailed by Newt. He took in the scene, flashed a ""gee, can you believe it"" glance at his wife, and thanked his daughters for bringing the kids. ""They brought, I think, the two best debate coaches,"" said Gingrich. He welled up. ""Whatever I did well in the debates, I ascribe it to Maggie and Robert."" That was all the emotion we'd get. For the last time, Gingrich described all of the facts he'd learned, or he'd taught people, in a year's worth of campaign stops. New Hampshire, he argued ""is a model of balancing the budget the right way. In New Hampshire, they start with the revenue number and they appropriate up to the revenue number."" Herman Cain's endorsement was ""tremendous."" The people of South Carolina, too, were ""tremendous,"" and ""the size of the victory was historic."" But he'd let them down, and would return to the state sheepish about ""breaking their perfect record"" of picking the eventual Republican nominee. Gingrich was almost honest about his campaign. Newt 2012 didn't work out. It stayed competitive only because of ""Sheldon and Maria Adelson who single-handedly came very close to matching Romney's Super PAC."" But when it sounded like he was about to blame himself for a mistake, he'd find a way to reroute and blame the media. ""One of the topics I feel saddest about not talking about very well is brain science,"" he said. And why? Because he struggled to take the concept ""from the world of science, where everybody agrees about it, to the world of politics, where nobody understands what it means."" He had erred, probably, in talking about a moon colony that could achieve early statehood. But, reporters: ""You may have noticed, the founders of Google are talking about mining an asteroid."" Smart people, as ever, knew that he was right. ""I am cheerfully going to take back up the issue of space."" The difference between Gingrich's campaign and the average presidential effort was honesty. Nobody runs for president thinking he or she is mediocre, and that he might only solve 20-30 percent of the nation's crises. Candidates have enormous egos. Gingrich just led with his. The loving staffers and family around him were probably less aware than him of what the campaign might cost him. His empire of influence and literature was a little diminished by the campaign. Solution: Remind his audience that the empire was going to rise again. ""I'm grateful to Human Events,"" said Gingrich, ""for publishing my newsletter. My newsletter from today focuses specifically on religious liberty."" As he described this, a reporter in the front row fiddled with Instagram. The only news Gingrich had left in him was about Mitt Romney. Would he endorse the man that every other loser has endorsed? ""I'm asked sometimes,"" said Gingrich, ""Is Mitt Romney a conservative? This is not a choice between Mitt Romney and Ronald Reagan. It's between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama."" That was as far as he'd go. After he wrapped, his fans and family went back to their hallway catch-up talks. Reporters located Hammond and asked whether or not Gingrich had actually ended his campaign and endorsed Romney. ""The week after the election,"" joked Hammond, ""we'll be in New Hampshire. We'll be in Iowa by Thanksgiving. It's good to see you guys!""

The press wouldn't let Hammond go. Was this an endorsement? No. ""Stay tuned"" for one. When would it happen? ""Leave me alone!"" Hammond disappeared. The reporters agreed: That was a perfect way to end this. Watch a Requiem for Newt: ."	In the End, Newt Was Almost Honest With Us All	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]

Women lost their jobs. Families lost their homes. The nation's debt soared. According to Barack Obama, everything that's going well started when he took office. The government rescued the auto industry. Energy production rose. The war against Osama Bin Laden turned in our favor. Each candidate rejects the other's story. Romney says the things that are going well started going well before Jan. 20, 2009. Obama says the things that are going badly went bad before Jan. 20, 2009. Both of these rebuttals are correct, which means both men are exaggerating what President Obama changed. This is what politicians do: They heap blame on incumbents, promise to change the world, and then, once elected, pretend to have done so. Don't believe them. It's wildly implausible that the nation's progress or decline began on Inauguration Day. In fact, it's false. And the candidates, in their rebuttals, show that they know it. Obama tells a thrilling tale of slaying terrorists and rescuing American foreign policy. Addressing Americans from Afghanistan last night, he bragged: ""Over the last three years, the tide has turned. We broke the Taliban's momentum. We've built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated al-Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama Bin Laden.""  An Obama campaign video about the Bin Laden raid focuses not on the intelligence officers who tracked down Bin Laden, or on the SEALs who killed him, but on Obama's decision to give the final order. Romney says the real story goes back further: ""That mission was the culmination of nearly a decade of hard work and sacrifice by our men and women in the military and intelligence communities."" He's right. Obama's counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, says credit must be shared with ""the many intelligence professionals who pieced together the clues that led to Bin Laden's hideout."" Brennan attributes al-Qaida's decline to ""intense efforts over more than a decade, across two administrations."" The CIA gathered leads for years before finding the one that led to Bin Laden. The first directive to accelerate drone strikes on al-Qaida leaders came from President George W. Bush, and the sharp upturn in strikes began in 2008, with 19 al-Qaida operatives among the 286 fatalities. On the economy, however, Romney prefers amnesia. He starts counting job losses and foreclosures on the day Obama was sworn in. ""Since Barack Obama became president, over 800,000 Americans have lost their jobs,"" and ""2.8 million homes have been foreclosed on,"" Romney declared a month ago. Obama replies that the recession began earlier, and he's right. According to Factcheck.org: The unemployment rate began its rise before Obama took office, surged nearly three percentage points--hitting 7.8 percent at the time Obama took office. The rate crested under Obama at 10 percent in October 2009. Since the peak, the rate has come down--steadily but slowly--and stood at 8.2 percent for March. ... The number of households that received a foreclosure notice grew from 1.3 million to 2.3 million during Bush's last year in office, according to RealtyTrac, a company that monitors foreclosures across the country. The number continued to rise under Obama to 2.8 million in 2009 and peaked at 2.9 million in 2010. However, the amount of households that received a foreclosure notice dropped to 1.9 million in 2011. Romney's manipulation of economic data on women is even more cynical. He says Obama has ""lost 800,000 jobs during his presidency,"" and ""over 92 percent of the jobs ... were lost by women. His policies have been really a war on women."" Factcheck.org exposes the dishonesty of this presentation: The downturn in male employment began in May 2007 ... By the time Obama took office in January 2009, both male and female employment were in a steep decline that continued for over a year. Male employment hit bottom in February 2010, and female employment continued to slump for another seven months, bottoming out in September 2010. ... ""If you look back to the start of the recession, many of the industries (construction and manufacturing) that were very hard hit initially were male-dominated,"" said Margot Dorfman, CEO of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce. ... It wasn't until later that jobs like retail and government jobs, particularly teaching jobs, began to take a hit, affecting women more, Dorfman said. Obama knows Romney's truncated story is misleading. His campaign spends much of a 17-minute video showing that the economic decline was well under way by the time he took office. Then the video pivots and, in an equally cynical truncation, claims all the credit for saving Detroit. ""Because of the tough choices the president made, the stage was set for a resurgent U.S. auto industry,"" says narrator Tom Hanks. But here's the rest of the story: Bush announced on Dec. 19, 2008, that his administration would provide General Motors and Chrysler with $13.4 billion in funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. GM would be eligible for an additional $4 billion. ... Obama used the viability plans required by Bush to force the automakers to go into bankruptcy and reorganize--successfully completing a process that Bush started. On spending and deficits, the candidates switch roles again. Romney edits history, claiming that Obama ""increased the budget by more than 20%.""  Really? Let's consult the same referee: Romney ... is attributing to Obama a big rise in spending for fiscal year 2009--which began under Bush, nearly four months before Obama took office. ... The BO attributed much of the increased spending in 2009 to three government programs: the stimulus, the Troubled Asset Relief Program and legislation to address the mortgage crisis, all three totaling $353 billion. TARP and the mortgage bailout were passed under Bush. On energy, Obama does the editing. ""Under President Obama, domestic oil production is at an eight-year high,"" says an Obama ad. But Consumer Energy Report explains: [W]hat happens today in the energy markets is a result of decisions that were made 4-8 years in the past. For instance, the ethanol production gains in 2010 were not a function of Barack Obama's energy policies; they were a result of energy legislation passed in 2005 and expanded in 2007. ... [T]he reason that oil production has risen under President Obama is ... years of steadily increasing oil prices that caused oil companies to approve a number of new projects that had marginal economics at lower oil prices. But these projects take some years to build, and as in the case of the Alaska Pipeline, decisions that were made 4-6 years earlier benefited President Obama with increased domestic oil production. Do elections make a difference? Sure. Obama's election sealed the demise of ""Don't ask, don't tell."" Romney's election would affect Supreme Court rulings well into the future. But the more complicated the problem--the economy, terrorism, China--the less likely it is that a president will fundamentally alter it, especially in the short term. Elections can change history. But mostly, they decide which party will pretend that the president changed history for the better, and which party will pretend that he changed it for the worse."

This ploy was first trotted out in the aftermath of Moamar Qaddafi's downfall in Libya, when Obama's former presidential rival, Sen. John McCain, gave all the credit to the French. Now Mitt Romney, this year's presumptive GOP nominee, is waving off Obama's role in the killing of Osama Bin Laden--the president's signal national-security achievement--by chortling that ""any thinking American would have ordered the exact same thing,"" even Jimmy Carter. Two new investigative reports--a book by Peter Bergen, Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad, and an article by Graham Allison in the May 7 issue of Time--thoroughly rebut that notion. Far from the no-brainer that Romney depicts, the secret, high-level discussions leading up to the raid were fraught with intense debate and uncertainty--and Obama's final decisions, on both whether and how to attack, went against some of his top advisers' recommendations. Vice President Joe Biden revealed a few months ago that he had urged Obama not to mount the assault. Bergen and Allison report that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates joined him in the dissent--and they explain why. In the weeks leading up to the decision, a group of counterterrorism officials, after conducting a ""red-team"" exercise of what could go wrong in such an attack, estimated that there was only a 40 percent chance Osama Bin Laden was actually in the compound. The CIA put the odds at 60 percent. Bergen quotes Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy director, as telling the president that ""the circumstantial case of Iraq having WMD was actually stronger than the circumstantial case that bin Laden is living in the Abbottabad compound."" Faced with these uncertainties, a president could have been forgiven for holding back. Certainly, a decision to go ahead was no ""slam dunk."" More to the point, if Obama had given the order, and it turned out that Bin Laden wasn't there, it is an absolute sure thing that, one year later, Romney and his allies would still be lampooning Obama for his foolhardy recklessness and accusing him of letting the world's No. 1 terrorist slip through our fingers, perhaps this time for good. Once Obama decided to attack, an equally weighty debate took place over how to go about it. Gen. James Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (and widely known at the time as ""Obama's favorite general""), recommended dropping a few dozen 2,000-pound bombs from a B-2 bomber. Others favored going in with missile-carrying drones. Others, however, advised sending in SEAL Team Six, noting that an aerial attack might kill lots of civilians--perhaps even some in neighboring houses--and, in any case, would preclude certain knowledge that the strike had actually killed Bin Laden. Obama sided with the advocates of the far riskier raid. Gates, still skeptical of the whole business, had been CIA director Stansfield Turner's executive assistant back in 1979, when President Carter ordered a raid to rescue American hostages in Iran--then watched the operation go down in flames, along with his presidency, when the Delta Force's helicopter crashed. Struck by Gates' concerns, Obama ordered Adm. William McRaven, the special-operations commander organizing the raid, to throw in two additional helicopters for backup. It was a good thing he did, since one of the assault choppers crashed outside the compound. Romney has kept up a barrage of attacks on Obama's national-security record--which is puzzling, to say the least, since there are no politically palatable routes to criticizing the president on this score, except from the left, which is hardly an angle that Romney or any other Republican (except Ron Paul) would traverse. On Afghanistan, Romney has lambasted Obama for announcing his troop-withdrawal schedule (a legitimate criticism), but he's also expressed support for NATO's announcement to pull out all combat troops by 2014 (which renders his first point moot). Let's see if he keeps up this assault after Obama's surprise May Day visit to Kabul, where he and Afghan president Hamid Karzai are scheduled to sign a ""strategic partnership"" accord, which, for better or worse, will keep the United States committed to the country's security well beyond the NATO deadline. On Iran, Romney calls for a different policy without specifying what that might be. Given Obama's multiple rounds of sanctions and likely cybersabotage, which may be having an effect, it is hard to imagine what Romney might do differently, except go to war, a step that few Americans would welcome. In an attempt to trash the New START arms-reduction treaty, which Obama signed with Russia, Romney wrote (or at least signed) the most misleading and ignorant article on the subject that I've read in more than 35 years of following the nuclear debate. On North Korea, Romney appears not even to want to try negotiating a solution. On China, he seems to be pushing for a trade war. On Russia, which he has called America's No. 1 geopolitical foe, he appears to think the Cold War is still raging. Romney's position--or, more accurate, his pose--on these issues is so preposterous, one can only surmise that he can't be serious. More likely, he and his proxies in the right-wing press are adopting Karl Rove's strategy of attacking the opponent's strengths. In the 2004 election, Sen. John Kerry's war-hero status posed a threat against George W. Bush, so Rove and the Swift Boaters painted Kerry as a war coward; Kerry and his team were so flummoxed, they didn't know how to respond. Now Mitt Romney, who has no foreign-policy experience whatever, is painting Obama as the dangerous naif. There are two big differences this time out. First, Obama's political operators seem more adept at dousing these sparklers than were Kerry's. Second, like Bush in 2004, Obama is the incumbent in this election; he can demonstrate experience and competence in foreign affairs as a matter of course, on a daily basis; hence his trip to Kabul. Republicans are no doubt pining for a second dip in the economy, because going after Obama on foreign and military affairs is a dead-end route."

We were bogged down in two wars, and the national debt was rising. President Bush was up for re-election, and Republicans needed a wedge issue. They found it in Massachusetts, whose Supreme Judicial Court in 2003 had asserted a statewide right to gay marriage. Seizing the opportunity, Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney ran around the country declaring a national moral crisis. Republicans, urged on by Bush, introduced a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage. On June 18, 2004, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Tex., the subcommittee chairman entrusted with the amendment, joined two colleagues at a press conference to promote it. Cornyn declared gay marriage an economic issue: We know from some of the social experimentation that's occurred in Scandinavia and elsewhere that when same-sex couples can legally marry, that essentially what happens is people quit getting married across the board, and more people raise children outside of marriage at higher risk for a whole host of social ills, placing additional burdens on the government and the taxpayers that support that government. A reporter asked the senators about Democratic complaints that the GOP was ""playing divisive election-year politics."" Cornyn brushed off the idea. ""I don't think it is a particularly divisive issue,"" he replied. ""I think, when the American people get a chance to have their voice heard, that they will overwhelmingly reaffirm their commitment to traditional marriage."" Four days later, Cornyn and other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the marriage amendment. Romney flew down to be the lead witness. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisc, called it ""a politically motivated exercise"" and pointed out that the country was ""struggling every day with so many more pressing issues."" Romney disagreed: I want to spend my time devoted to working in our schools and helping our kids, finding ways to provide more prescription benefits for our senior citizens, doing a better job to provide a stronger economy and more jobs to our citizens. Those are our highest priority. But when our Supreme Judicial Court acted, they brought forward a change in a definition of an institution which is fundamental to my state, fundamental to our nation. And in order to preserve the rights of respective states to set their own policies with regards to marriage, I believe this amendment, or one of a similar nature, is necessary. A month later, when Democratic senators condemned the amendment as ""divisive"" and ""the politics of mass distraction,"" Romney insisted in a CNBC interview that politicians must be put on the record: A lot of big things are going on. But for some people, myself included, how children are going to be raised in the next generation and the one after that is also important, and it's worth discussing and having politicians have to vote on. Most politicians don't want to you know where they stand on that issue. And I think it's appropriate for us to know where people stand. That was 2004. Eight years later, Cornyn is the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Romney is the party's de facto presidential nominee, and both men are singing a very different tune. Last Thursday, after President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage, Romney ducked an invitation on Fox News to challenge the president. ""Even within my party, there are people who have differing views on this point,"" Romney cautioned. ""The Republican Party does not consist of people who all have the same views on all the issues."" The next day, Romney dodged another reporter's bait: ""I just don't think this becomes a hot political issue dividing our nation. Instead, I believe that we should respect the viewpoints of various people and move on."" On Sunday, CNN anchor Candy Crowley asked Cornyn, ""Is this something that you think Mitt Romney ought to bring up frequently?"" Cornyn deflected the question: ""President Obama brought this issue up because ... he's trying to raise divisive issues up to solidify his base and to divide the country, and that isn't what we should be focusing on now. We should be focusing on jobs and the economy."" It's hard to believe these are the same guys who were whooping it up about gay marriage in 2004. What happened? To answer that question, look at the polls. In 1996, when Republicans campaigned successfully for a federal law against gay marriage, most Democrats opposed the legality of same-sex marriages. They rejected the idea by approximately 60 to 33 percent in Pew and Gallup surveys. Independents closely matched that split. Republicans opposed gay marriage even more strongly, by about 80 to 15 percent in both polls. In 2004, Republicans were still firmly set against gay marriage. Their margin of opposition was 80 to 19 in Gallup's May survey, 78 to 17 in Pew's combined annual data, and 73 to 24 in a February Washington Post/ABC News sample. The margin of opposition among independents, however, had declined considerably. It was 53 to 37 in Pew's data, 52 to 44 in the Gallup poll, and 48 to 44 in the Post survey. Democrats, meanwhile, were now roughly split. In February, the Post found them evenly divided, 48 to 47 percent. A later Post survey, taken in August, found them opposed by 52 to 43 percent. Pew's yearly average showed them opposed by 50 to 40 percent, while Gallup's May sample had them favoring gay marriage by 51 to 46 percent. Since then, public opinion has continued to shift toward accepting gay marriage. Democrats now support it by margins of 64 to 32 in the Post's March 2012 survey, 65 to 34 in Gallup's May sample, and 59 to 31 in Pew's combined 2012 data. Independents in all three polls now favor gay marriage: 54 to 42 according to the Post, 52 to 38 according to Pew, and 57 to 40 according to Gallup. At the same time, the Republican margin of opposition has fallen. It's 74 to 22 as measured by Gallup, 68 to 23 as measured by Pew, and 57 to 39 as measured by the Post. Republicans aren't split as deeply as Democrats were in 2004. Nor are Democrats as united today as Republicans were back then. And if you look at polling data over time, you'll see that public opinion has lurched or backtracked along the way. Just last night, CBS and the New York Times released a sample that leans further to the right. But overall, the trend is clear. Democrats, who initially opposed gay marriage and then were evenly divided, are gradually uniting in favor of the idea. Republicans, who used to be united against gay marriage, are becoming more closely divided. And independents, who used to lean against gay marriage, now lean toward it. In 2004, if you raised gay marriage as a wedge issue, you divided Democrats, united Republicans, and pushed most independents to the right. Today, if you raise gay marriage as a wedge issue, you divide Republicans, unite Democrats, and push most independents to the left. That's why Romney and other Republicans who loved to talk about gay marriage in 2004 now call Democrats divisive for bringing it up. Republicans are happy to divide the country. But they no longer like the way this issue cuts. William Saletan's latest short takes on the news, via Twitter:"	Republicans Used Gay Marriage to Divide Democrats. Now the Tables Are Turned.

Who are the voters he does connect with? I spent a morning recently in Columbus, Ohio, with small-business owners Philip Derrow and Rick Malir.* They aren't anti-Obama zealots, but nor do they begrudgingly accept the Republican nominee. They like Mitt Romney. They praise his smarts and his experience. Most important, they feel that he gets them--what they're going through and what they're trying to do. Their feeling can be summed up by twisting a phrase the Obama team likes to use to describe the president's supporters: They think Mitt Romney has their back. In the battleground state of Ohio, the National Federation of Independent Business, a small business lobby, says 49 percent of Ohioans are employed by companies with fewer than 100 employees. Derrow and Malir are part of this demographic, and they have three obsessions: their employees, red tape, and the fear that they might lose what they've built. Malir owns a string of 20 barbecue restaurants in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. He started the business with his wife in his garage. ""When a politician stands up and says I created 40,000 jobs, now I'm just a dumb farm kid from Kansas, going really? I don't remember that politician standing with me in my garage when I am worried to death I'm going to lose the house as I'm trying to smoke brisket. I don't remember them standing there. If anything, they were giving me more forms to fill out."" That is the only mildly heated thing either man says all day. Both men say they've ""won the lottery,"" as Malir puts it, by being born in the United States and having the success they've had. But it highlights two themes that run through our nearly two-hour conversation:  They are nervous they'll lose what they've got. And they think the people in charge of making health care, labor, and tax laws have no idea what people like them are trying to do--which is take risks, grow their businesses, and create jobs. ""I learned recently that I'm a HENRY,"" says Malir. ""A High-Earner-Not-Rich-Yet. If you look at my 1040 what you'd say is, 'that son of a buck is one rich dude!' But what they don't get is that because that money flows to personal income. I pour  all of my profits back into the company, risking the money to create a better company and create more jobs."" Often in conversation they retreat to first principles--reciting maxims about capital, risk, and productivity--as if the country has lost the most basic understanding of how to solve the problem of joblessness. That's just how Mitt Romney talks. And it's not how any of the other Republican presidential candidates did, which is why Derrow says he ""stayed as far away as I could"" from the other GOP contenders. ""He gets the economy. He gets business,"" says Malir.  Later he marvels about Romney's resume, saying its details alone prove that he would be a great president: ""Do you realize what a brainiac you have to be to get your MBA and your JD at the same time from Harvard? Then he founded Bain Capital. He ran the Olympics."" Perhaps the greatest cultural disconnect they see with Washington is the charge that businessmen like themselves are only out to protect their profits. ""We are not ruthless people. We care about our parents and our families,"" says Derrow, voicing his support for Medicare and Social Security. ""And yet, the math doesn't work and so our political class talks about things that make no sense."" When Derrow introduces himself and describes his company, he ends by saying ""50 years and not one layoff."" Malir points out that he carries a book with pictures of his 400 employees, so that when he visits a restaurant he hasn't been to in a while, he can greet everyone by name. Ask them how they survived the great recession and each will tell stories about doing everything necessary to keep from firing employees or reducing health benefits. ""Everyone took a haircut,"" says Derrow of salaries that dropped during the recession. ""But since managers took a bigger haircut than everyone else, there were no hard feelings. It hurt but we survived. The demonization of business people as being shortsighted and all these evil things just isn't borne out by any of my experiences with fellow business owners."" Do they think that Romney feels the way they do about people like their employees? The question doesn't make sense to them. Of course he does. They know he understands that any business wouldn't thrive without a good relationship with its employees. These men don't despise Obama. They don't nurse grudges about the president's foreign apologies or how he plays too much golf or uses teleprompters.  They don't talk about the president much at all. ""I don't hate the president,"" says Derrow. ""I think his policies are bad for the country. But there's no animus there. I am actually pretty proud of my country for electing an African-American with an Islamic name shortly after 9/11. I think that's a remarkable statement about this country. OK, but I disagree with his policies. It's time to change."" One thing they do admire is the president's political skill. ""I saw people that looked like Phil in the audience,"" says Malir pointing to his middle-aged white counterpart, ""with tears down their eyes. This guy has got something. He is connecting with folks, and it's guys that look like me. Forget his policies. There's a connection this guy is making. It's scary because it was not the guy I was supporting."" Both men already know how they are going to vote, but what about their employees? Will they do anything to sway their workers whose jobs both men think will be threatened if the current trend in anti-business regulations continues? Malir isn't planning to do much, but Derrow is planning a mock debate for his employees in which they discuss the issues that are most important to the future of the company. Upon hearing that, Malir asks: ""Can we cater it?"" Correction, May 22, 2012: This article originally misspelled Philip Derrow's first name. (Return to corrected sentence.)"

On July 11, 1804, Aaron Burr fatally wounded Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton in a duel. Hamilton had smeared Burr's name in the press. Burr killed a man. Enough said. 2. On Sept. 11, 2001, with the president away from the White House, Dick Cheney took the helm in the situation room.

And some would say he never gave it back. Either way, the attack on the United States and subsequent ""war on terror"" made Cheney the most powerful veep in U.S. history. 3. In 1899, Garret Hobart cast the tie-breaking vote not to grant independence to the Philippines, which the United States had acquired during the Spanish American War.

Putting the kibosh on the political autonomy of 7,832,719 people is a big deal. William McKinley's No. 2 earned the nickname ""Assistant President"" for his assertiveness. 4. While in office, Spiro Agnew accepted bribes and evaded his taxes. A watered-down plea bargain induced him to resign in 1973.

The disgraced veep embarrassed his country--and took part in the first of several scandals to haunt Nixon's White House. The presidency has never been the same. 5. In December 1828, John Calhoun penned the South Carolina Exposition and Protest.

Calhoun, the vice president under John Quincy Adams, wanted to stake out his opposition to a federal tariff that he felt trampled on state's rights. In so doing, he authored the nullification doctrine--the precept that states can reject rulings from the national government. As America tipped toward civil war, this elevation of the local paved the way for a flurry of secessions in the South. 6. On May 6, 2012, Joe Biden offered up his full support for gay marriage on NBC's Meet the Press. ""I am absolutely comfortable"" with ""men marrying men"" and ""women marrying women,"" the vice president declared.

We just watched this one. The White House says Obama's ""evolving"" position was heading to the same place--very soon. Maybe so. But Biden's gaffe made Obama get there sooner. 7. On Nov. 10, 1993, Al Gore clobbered Ross Perot in a televised debate on the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement.

Perot seemed a little unhinged; Gore played it cool. By the end of the televised trouncing, the 34 percent approval rate for President Clinton's project had spiked to 57 percent. Thanks in large part to Gore's footwork, NAFTA passed in the House of Representatives only a few days later. 8. On May 8, 1942, Henry A. Wallace delivered a stirring wartime speech to the Free World Association in New York City. FDR's veep outlined the Allies' core ideological arguments for taking on the Nazis.

It's hard to imagine a vice president being given such an important brief nowadays. Unfortunately for Wallace's political prospects, he kept talking--about civil rights and building an alliance with the Soviet Union. So FDR dropped him from the ticket and picked up Harry S. Truman as his last running mate. The rest is history."	The Eight Times the Vice President Did Something That Mattered	['Alexander', 'Burr', 'Obama', 'Ross']	['gay']

The following transcript of the discussion has been edited for length and clarity. To see the full conversation, click on this link. Frank Piel: Will Obama's endorsement matter? No. Everyone is focused on getting a job. ""Can he get jobs?"" is going to be the focus in this election. Will Saletan: Welcome. I agree. That's probably a big reason why Obama did this--social issues won't hurt him much this year, because everyone's more concerned about the economy. Dahlia Lithwick: Hi there, thanks for being here! I think you are probably right that jobs and the economy will be the main issue going into November, and this won't change that at all. June Thomas: But are there things that Obama can do to generate jobs and shore up the economy? It seems to be far easier to get attention for stands on social issues like this. I'm not sure what effect that attention has on his re-electability. Will Saletan: I agree. But let me turn the question on you: Are there things he could do about gay marriage? He says gays should be allowed to marry. Great. How exactly did his policies change yesterday? How many fingers did he lift to resist the ballot measure in North Carolina? _______________________ Sharon Batson: Many are saying this will turn off independents. Do you believe it will, or will they support the president's taking a stance? Dahlia Lithwick: Here is Greg Sargent this morning trying to work through the articles about whether this was risky for Obama. A lot of interesting stuff in here, and a lot of links to folks saying that Romney doesn't want to make gay marriage an issue this fall. Anna Marie Warren: It's been deemed a states-right issue, no? So what can he do, and what's he saying he's for doing? Dahlia Lithwick: Here is Chris Geidner's analysis, suggesting that it matters more than folks think, in light of the Obama administration's shift on the DOMA cases. Anna Marie Warren: I live in Mississippi and am interested in the federalist question. Will Saletan: Dahlia, what do you think of the federalist approach to changing policy on this issue? Looking back at Roe, and looking at how fast polls are moving on this issue around the country, do you think we'll be better off in the long run if we let states change marriage policy, rather than push to change it from above? Dahlia Lithwick: I think there's a reason the gay rights groups have been bringing incremental suits in the states, and using DOMA as the vehicle. Marriage really is a state issue; it always has been. There is widespread belief that the blowback from Roe proves that the court moved too far too fast and that incremental change is best. Will Saletan: I agree. I wonder what social conservatives will be saying if and when legislatures and referenda, not judges, start to roll back the ""traditional"" definition of marriage. Could get ugly. Dahlia Lithwick: I also think that's the reason the Ninth Circuit decision in the Proposition 8 case was so much narrower than it could have been. To limit the scope of the Proposition 8 ruling (only in states that permitted gay marriage and then took it away) so as not to have such a sweeping impact. _______________________ Will Saletan: I'm really curious about why the Mississippi personhood amendment failed, but the NC marriage amendment passed. Given the Mississippi result, I thought the NC amendment would either fail or barely scrape by. But instead it actually over-performed the last poll, despite a last-minute scare campaign against it a la Mississippi. Is there something about marriage that makes these ballot measures easier to pass? Dahlia Lithwick: That's an excellent question about why the personhood amendments fail, and the gay marriage amendments pass. When you think about polling on abortion and gay marriage, the exact opposite should be the case, right? Will Saletan: Yes, it's kind of a head-scratcher. In the sweep of decades, the gay marriage numbers in polls are moving steadily leftward, but the abortion numbers aren't. Yet the abortion ballot measures fail, while the marriage measures don't. I bet you good money, though, that that record ends this year. Dan Johnson: Interestingly enough, neither a woman's right to an abortion or gay marriage has any impact what so ever on another individual's life. However, both have a huge impacts on the woman choosing to abort or the gay couple choosing to marry. Fascinating how some people just can't cope when others don't share their ideology. Not your life. It's mine. _______________________ Amy Camardo Andersen: I'm troubled by his statement that he would ""leave it up to the individual states."" What would have happened in 1964 if Lyndon Johnson had left it up to the states to vote on civil rights for African-Americans? I think the policy has to be federal. The Neanderthals have to be dragged into the 21st century. Will Saletan: Are you sure race is the right analogy? What about abortion? There we changed policy in a single stroke instead of waiting for the states, and many analysts think this haste has bogged us down in decades of abortion war. Dahlia Lithwick: I think Geidner summarizes it correctly: marriage has always been a state matter (that's why a federal DOMA was such an overreach), but there are federal constitutional limits on state matters. _______________________ John Pace: It officially marks (and massively adds to) the shift in public opinion toward marital equality in particular, and tolerance more generally. That's big stuff anytime. But in this time of hyper-partisanship, it's downright huge. Will Saletan: But is this really such a break from partisanship? I bet partisanship made a big contribution to it, by convincing Obama he was going to lose socially conservative voters anyway, so why not throw in the towel on gay marriage. John Pace: Will, you are correct, of course, that some political calculation played into this. And that Obama considered how his statement might help the campaign (or mitigate damage). But it still remains a very important statement regarding civil rights, respect and tolerance. Our acceptance of marriage equality has been teetering around 50 percent for a while now, only recently surpassing it (albeit within the margin of error). I maintain that the president coming out in favor of tolerance and respect on a lightning rod issue of civil rights is just what this country needs. It's going to make a lot of people rethink the issue. It's going to make the issue a topic of dinner table discussion, and provide mom and dad some cover when they say, ""Well, yeah, equality really is a good thing."" And it's going to energize those already in the choir. _______________________ Brett Verlyn Scriver: My question for you: How do you think this will impact the vote on a constitutional amendment in Minnesota that's similar to North Carolina's Amendment 1? Polls are very close here in Minnesota, and many of us are working to keep this ban on freedom to marry out of our constitution. Will Saletan: The key thing to remember is that with polls shifting (as John noted), one of these states will be the first to vote on the side of gay marriage. Could be Minnesota, could be Maryland--I don't know. But the undefeated record of conservatives can't withstand the poll shift in the long run. Dahlia Lithwick: Are you hearing/seeing any shift in tone there after yesterday's announcement? Brett Verlyn Scriver: I don't know that there is a change in tone per se, but it has been and will be an impetus for conversation for ""regular Minnesotans"" who don't necessarily follow politics closely, which is a good thing. People should be talking about how the amendment would affect them and their friends and families personally. Here is an example of local media coverage. _______________________ J.P. Pecht: The irony would be if same-sex marriage becomes a wedge issue for 2012 that actually hurts Republicans this time around because it A) motivates Obama's base and B) is supported by a slim (but growing) majority of the general public and independents. Dahlia Lithwick: I think there is some sense that the Romney campaign is anxious about that very thing. Will Saletan: Have you noticed all the Republicans screaming and yelling and holding press conferences today to denounce Obama's radical statement? No? Isn't that interesting? You can bet that if the Democratic presidential nominee had said this eight years ago, he'd have been slammed by Republicans the next day. Yet they're keeping quiet or low-toned. Why? Some of it's the economy. But surely a lot of it is that they're no longer sure how the issue cuts. Claudia Reed Beaudry: Exactly. And didn't I see a poll somewhere that said the overwhelming majority of Democrats support gay marriage, 22 percent of Republicans do, and 57 percent of independents do? _______________________ Wendy Butler: As much as I appreciate the sentiment, it's an election year and simply more posturing. Lori Scribner: It's not posturing. Joe Biden did his usual ""speak his mind"" thing and opened up the issue. The President had to take a stand either way. And if you're not familiar with Biden, the man speaks from his heart. This wasn't staged. Dan Johnson Wendy: If this is posturing, it's a very gutsy move. I see him losing some of the middle, and gaining nothing. I can't see Romney ever beating Obama so maybe he just figures why not lay it all on the table. Dahlia Lithwick: I think the gamble was that this would galvanize young voters and the base, weighed against losing some independents. I defer to Will on how that cuts. _______________________ Sheena Garland: I don't think his statements will shift votes but I believe it means something to folks being denied the right to marry. I don't believe civil rights should be put to a majority vote. North Carolina passed this terrible amendment one with the majority of less than 20% of those eligible to vote. This crap passes because those who tend to vote tend to have these views. People need to quit bitching and vote! Dahlia Lithwick: I think Glenn Greenwald makes that argument this morning when he talks about what this means to those who have been denied this right. _______________________ June Thomas: Is there any way this moves from ""I've had a change of heart, this group of people shouldn't be excluded from a rights and responsibilities-conferring institution that is open to others"" to ""I'm going to repeal DOMA""? That's when it starts to count. Will Saletan: Don't you think DOMA will be the last thing to fall? Politicians aren't exactly brave. At some point, changes in the culture, public opinion, and state policies will make DOMA so obviously antiquated that they'll take it down. No? Dahlia Lithwick: That cuts against the Cory Booker argument, right? That civil rights questions should never be decided by popular vote? Will Saletan: Yeah, I disagree with Booker. With apologies to my liberal friends, I think liberals have a facile habit of declaring this or that to be an obvious issue of civil rights (similar to declaring religion or morality obviously irrelevant). In truth, our notions of what counts as a civil right are constantly, um, evolving. Shouldn't we debate that classification as we go? Case in point: Some people think declaring a right to life for the unborn is a civil rights question. Does anyone here think we should roll over and agree that such a policy shouldn't be subjected to a popular vote? June Thomas: The truth is I cannot be rational on this topic. I don't see it as a philosophical argument, I see it as straight-up discrimination, and I really don't see why I should have to wait for justice. _______________________ Will Saletan: Thanks for the conversation. I have to head out and get back to work now. I can already hear the next politician evolving! Dahlia Lithwick: Thank you everyone for the great questions and for reading Slate!"

With that statement, President (and candidate) Obama advanced a cause that had been moving at geological speed until Vice President Joe Biden suddenly thrust the administration into support. Last time a presidential campaign jumped the gun on gay matters, Bill Clinton casually promised to end the exclusion of gays from the military in 1992. Although he didn't lose that election, many analysts date the weakening of his administration from his losing battle to make good on that promise, culminating in the universally despised ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. Twelve years later, after the Massachusetts Supreme Court issued the first gay marriage decision, African-American boxing promoter Don King toured the black churches of Ohio to gin up the Republican vote. The difference--the black vote went from 10 percent Republican to 17 percent Republican--arguably took the state and the 2004 election from John Kerry. Obama's committed not to make the same mistake. After Vice President Biden grew feet and walked out of the warm sea on Meet the Press, Obama couldn't duck anymore. But he's not Bill Clinton, and he's not John Kerry. Because he's not white. And so he has a unique opportunity to move the gay issue along faster than anyone else could. Not so many people still remember, but it was an African-American, then Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell, who killed Clinton's effort to repeal the exclusion of gays from the military. Before Clinton raised the issue, the exclusion was a matter of Pentagon policy, which the executive could order changed--just as Harry Truman had ordered the military to integrate blacks. Indeed, Truman was the model for Clinton's plans and the gays' hopes. They thought the nation had learned its lesson about racial exclusion and that the heroic example of Truman's early commitment to civil rights would empower Clinton to do the same thing. Those plans and hopes died when the shining star of the integrated military, Colin Powell, the first nonwhite chief of staff in history, denied that racial justice was an argument for gays. ""Skin color,"" the general wrote, ""is a benign, non-behavioral characteristic. Sexual orientation is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics. Comparing the two is a convenient but invalid argument."" Repeal might have failed anyway, but once Powell took the stage to deny the racial analogy, it was dead on arrival. In the two decades after Powell spoke (and before he changed his mind in 2009), the gay revolution, unassisted by any president until this afternoon, undertook the task of changing peoples' minds about the malignancy of their behavioral characteristic. Powell looked more and more like an ungrateful winner who wanted to pull the ladder up once he'd been admitted to the club. Gays came out, cared for their sick, served with honor, kissed on TV, and started Glee clubs. One small state at a time, they started squirreling away places to marry, until they took New York last June. The New York-centered media covered so many gay marriages, it gave rise to a gay movement to resist the rush to the altar. The latest polling reveals that white people are finally evenly divided on the issue of gay marriage. And nonwhites are similarly split. Liberal commentators use these facts to argue that race is irrelevant. But those numbers are not what matters. Anti-gay-marriage whites are not voting for Barack Obama. Forty-nine percent of white folks oppose gay marriage, but 74 percent of Republicans oppose gay marriage. And the Republican Party is almost entirely white. Where are the 48 percent of nonwhite voters who oppose gay marriage? Where are almost all nonwhite voters? In the Democratic Party. Even if every single black Republican is anti-gay, there simply aren't enough of them to account for all the black anti-gay voters. Therein lies the danger for a Democratic candidate supporting gay marriage: that voters otherwise disposed to him will not support him because of his stance on gay marriage. And here is where Obama is different. If the black community doesn't flood the polls, Obama will lose in November. But he's the first black president of the United States. Black voters are sticky with Barack Obama in a way no white president could dream of. For whites, a white president is the natural order of things. For blacks, it was the miracle of Grant Park. Once the Iowa caucus happened, even Hillary Clinton, the wife of the ""first black president,"" could not stem the tide. As black houses went into foreclosure after 2008 and the unemployment rate went through the roof, Obama's support among blacks stayed amazingly firm. As the election approaches, his support is at the same level as in 2008. A simple thought experiment reveals the issue: Try to imagine Don King in black churches exhorting congregations to vote against Barack Obama over gay marriage. Not going to happen. In this way, the president was uniquely suited among Democratic politicians to advance the issue (just as Powell could have done in 1993). Until today, Obama's mealy-mouthed and harmful public statements on gay marriage looked suspiciously Powell-esque. But as happens now and then to Barack Obama, history gave him an opportunity no one else could seize, and he did."

Three days ago the vice president announced on Meet the Press that he supported same-sex couples getting married. Wednesday, President Obama announced that after a many-year evolution on the issue, he believed the same thing. The first African-American president became the first ever to announce his support for same-sex marriage. This is a landmark civil rights moment that happened awfully fast. It was both an act of conviction and political expediency--what measure of each we may never know. What we do know is that this was the president's private position. What's less well known is the thinking behind the timing of the announcement. White House and campaign officials have been talking about it for months. According to several sources involved in the campaign, the president was going to make his announcement soon, before the convention (and maybe even very soon) if for no other reason than to avoid a fight over the party platform and to rally gay supporters. Biden stepped on his plan, making it look like the president was backing into a decision and controlled by events. This looks like another instance of the vice president stumbling his way into the history books. But Barack Obama's untenable position is every bit as culpable for the firestorm and rushed decision. The president was for gay marriage in private but wouldn't say so in public. He told the Justice Department to inform the courts that it believed the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional and should be struck down. He said he was ""evolving"" which made it clear that it was a matter of time before he came to the enlightened position of supporting same-sex marriage (or simply announced a long-held private view that had been constrained by politics). It has been a long evolution for the president. In his 2006 book, The Audacity of Hope, he wrote that he was ""open to the possibility that my unwillingness to support gay marriage is misguided."" The administration policy on marriage equality was a jerky spasm of winks and nods. It was the domestic equivalent of the ""One China Policy,"" the strategic ambiguity that allows the United States to support Taiwan but not support its bid for independence, which angers China. It's policy by omission, not commission. It's not a policy that makes sense entirely, but it's a nonpolicy that everyone has agreed to simply treat like it makes sense. (The agreement that Starbucks makes good coffee is the consumer product equivalent.) The White House at first tried to pretend there was nothing new about Biden's remarks. Campaign and administration aides said that he was being totally consistent with the president's view. This wasn't exactly true, but under the agreement to keep everything in limbo it might have held. This was a good storyline to get out if the president really was planning a coming announcement. Only if Biden didn't appear to be getting out ahead of the president could the president take the leading position. The problem, say Democrats, is that the Biden comments poked an existing bruise among the president's supporters in the gay community. The rush to bowdlerize what Biden had said turned a glancing tap of the bruise into a grinding fist. A source who raises money for Democrats says that Obama has mostly maxed out with donations from the gay political community, but that his Super PAC and other nonaffiliated support groups still need massive high-dollar donations. A lot of potential donors are influential members of the gay community who follow the same-sex marriage issue closely and who were likely to be most offended by the president holding on to his same, ""evolving"" stance. How could an Obama bundler--one of those financial backers who raises huge sums from their circle of friends--who had been convincing those same friends that the president was with them, continue to make calls with this fresh slap in the face? Says the Democratic fundraiser: ""Once this became a litmus test if you're a gay bundler, after 100 hours saying 'the president is going to do the right thing' now you're calling saying 'sorry this happened, but I can't raise another dollar unless you do the right thing.' "" As a matter of narrative continuity, it was probably also a wise political move for the president to take a stand. The Obama campaign has consistently claimed that his opponent lacks a moral core; he shades and capers and doesn't tell you what he believes in his heart. This was all true of the president's position on gay marriage. It's good for him to be free of that wrinkle, though narrative continuity (running a campaign that makes sense) probably has a limited affect on voters and their final choices. What was less clear was whether the president was exercising logical continuity. Based on the limited transcripts of the interview, the president said he supported same-sex marriage but didn't think it was a right. He said the states could continue to handle the issue as they saw fit. Forty-four states right now do not allow it. Under this same line of thinking, in 1967 he would have supported the right for interracial couples to marry but would have thought Virginia had a right not to allow it. Shortly after Obama's comments, Mitt Romney reasserted his opposition to same-sex marriage and took the opportunity to point out that he had never wavered in that stance. Republican organizer Ralph Reed said the president's ""flip-flop"" on gay marriage would doom him. It's certain the president just helped Mitt Romney consolidate his base. How it will play in the wider electorate is less clear. The latest Pew Research Center survey found that Americans back same-sex marriage 47 to 43. The decision will turn off working-class voters but perhaps energize younger voters and college-educated suburban voters. The political machinations of the moment were fascinating--what will this mean to Hispanics in North Carolina?--but this election is not going to turn on same-sex marriage. Romney wants to keep focused on the economy. The president wants to divert from certain conversations about the economy but not to this issue. A lot of people have been comparing this election to the 2004 race. Today, they get another data point. During that election, President Bush called for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. According to White House sources at the time, it was an effort to stir the conservative GOP base in what the president and his team knew would be a close election. Obama's support for gay marriage may not have been aimed at getting the base excited as much as keeping some of its influential members from being angry. That anger would have been far more muted had it not been for Joe Biden. The president could blame his No. 2, but since Biden led to the culmination of Obama's evolutionary journey and put him on the right side of history, perhaps the president should thank him."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/obama_endorses_gay_marriage_how_same_sex_marriage_went_mainstream_.html	"In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed a state's right to prosecute two men for having sex. Today, 26 years later, the president of the United States affirmed the right of two men to marry. How did this happen? How did same-sex marriage go from a nonstarter--an idea so farfetched that nobody even polled the question--to a policy that half the country supports? To answer that question, watch the interview President Obama gave to ABC News this afternoon. Obama didn't answer the marriage question like a president. He answered it like an ordinary person. In his responses, you can see the cultural changes that have moved millions of Americans in the same direction. Obama told ABC's Robin Roberts that he and his wife are ""practicing Christians"" and that to endorse same-sex marriage would ""put us at odds with the views of others"" in their faith. He said he had previously withheld support for gay marriage because: ""I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, the word marriage was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs ... [But] over the course of several years, as I have talked to friends and family and neighbors, when I think about members of my own staff who are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together ... Malia and Sasha, they have friends whose parents are same-sex couples. There have been times where Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table, and we're talking about their friends and their parents, and Malia and Sasha, it wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated differently. It doesn't make sense to them, and frankly, that's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective."" What changed wasn't Obama's reflection on the idea of same-sex marriage. What changed was the people with whom he identified. Initially, he held back out of sensitivity to fellow Christians. Now he's more sensitive to the feelings and aspirations of homosexuals: his staff, parents of his daughters' friends, and probably the same Democratic donors whose acquaintance moved Vice President Biden to accept same-sex marriage. This couldn't have happened in the days when homosexuality was isolated, prosecuted, and silenced. Back then, most people either didn't know homosexuals personally or didn't realize that people they knew were gay. Once the closet door opened, a cascade of changes followed. People began to see whose feelings were hurt and whose aspirations were denied. Sensitivities began to shift. If you cross-tabulate poll results on homosexuality going back several decades, you'll see a sweeping realignment driven by two underlying factors: a rising belief that homosexuality is innate, and increasing awareness that some of our friends, neighbors, and relatives are gay. But this trend alone didn't guarantee the emergence of same-sex marriage as a politically viable idea. To reach that stage, something else had to happen: Same-sex couples had to succeed. They had to prove they could stick together and raise children. That's what Americans have been watching since the closet door opened. Social conservatives said homosexuality was a sin. They said gay people were dysfunctional. They said having gay parents was bad for kids. They said open homosexuality would degrade morals and harm society. It hasn't happened. People like the Obamas now know too many same-sex couples who live by the same values that churches prescribe for straight couples. ""As I see friends, families, children of gay couples who are thriving, you know, that has an impact on how I think about these issues,"" Obama said last fall. He extended that observation today, citing ""members of my own staff who are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together."" The picture of homosexuality as an inherent moral threat has become unsustainable. Policies, too, have changed. In today's interview, Obama said he had hesitated to endorse gay marriage ""in part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient"" and in part because many people objected to using ""the word marriage"" for same-sex unions. He's now surrendering that word. But the legal rights that underlie it have been falling into place for years. The final step, calling it marriage, has become easier now that most Americans have made their peace with the idea of same-sex civil unions or domestic partnerships. Still, because Obama is a politician, one more thing had to change: polls. Why have politicians been sensitive to voters who oppose gay marriage? It isn't just to avoid hurting their feelings. It's because those voters might throw them out of office. In 2004, public opposition to gay marriage was clear enough--55 to 42 percent in the Gallup poll, 60 to 29 in Pew surveys--to make it a wedge issue for Republicans. Now those polls show an even split, with gay marriage marginally favored: 50 to 48 according to Gallup, 46 to 44 according to Pew. If same-sex marriage were still toxic, Obama would still be ducking it. He's endorsing it because he no longer thinks it might cost him reelection. We'll find out in November whether he's right."

It was March 1, 2011, roughly 14 months before the key U.S. Senate primaries that Dick Armey's Tea Party group intended to win. Staffers for some of the new House and Senate members, plenty of them elected with FreedomWorks backing, strolled over from the Capitol for conversation and canapes. In walked Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar. Awkward. Lugar was just the kind of Republican FreedomWorks wanted to purge. It had been a few weeks since a local news team asked Lugar why the Tea Party didn't like him, focusing on the senator's support of the new START Treaty. ""I've got to say 'Get real,' "" chuckled Lugar in the clip. But he had a lot of fence-mending time before his primary, so he and a staffer made the rounds at FreedomWorks. He was introduced to Matt Kibbe, the group's mutton-chopped president. Later, more awkwardly, he was introduced to him again. And then he left. ""Some of our best allies had showed up,"" remembers Max Pappas, the executive director of FreedomWorks PAC.  ""And then, we saw guys like Orrin Hatch and Lugar. They thought that coming by for a handshake might fix some of their problems. Yeah. As if we care to shake hands with politicians."" Fourteen months later, FreedomWorks has held 15 local ""activist training"" events in Indiana, distributed more than 10,000 pieces of campaign swag, and organized thousands of phone calls on behalf of Lugar's primary opponent, State Treasurer Richard Mourdock. They've multiplied the efforts of Tea Party activists in the state, who organized early, endorsed Mourdock, and they are (metaphorically) cooling champagne for tonight. ""I think we have the race won, actually,"" says Greg Fettig, who co-chairs Hoosiers for a Conservative Senate, and who could take credit, if he wanted, for the Tea Party's coherence behind Mourdock against Lugar. ""We're already getting congratulations from around the country, which, to be honest, could probably wait a day."" On the ledger, a Mourdock victory shouldn't be possible. Lugar spent better than three times as much as Mourdock--$6.7 million to $2 million. When you include Super PAC spending, the Lugar's forces still outspent the Tea Party and the D.C. conservative network--chiefly the Club for Growth--2 to 1. Lugar was scared straight by the 2010 election, opposed the president's Libya approach, and ran TV ads about voting against ""Obamacare"" 33 times. His enemies think he's going to lose anyway. If it happens, we'll know that purification of the GOP is coming right along. Forget about the presidential primary. Yes, the Tea Party lost that one. (""We support free markets, constitutionally limited government, and fiscal responsibility and we oppose politicians from both parties who do not,"" wrote Pappas in September. ""Romney does not."") The primary, with its broader turnout and split field of flawed candidates, was not conducive to a Tea Party coup. In 2010, the best Tea Party wins came at state conventions and in lower-turnout, high base-intensity state primaries: Alaska, Delaware, Colorado. Moderate Republicans no longer have to come out and support Romney over the non-Romney-of-the-week. That, say conservatives, will make it easier for Mourdock to put together a win in Indiana, easier for Texas' Ted Cruz to get a runoff berth in the state's May 29 U.S. Senate primary, easier for House candidates everywhere. Even more important than the timing: the planning. Lugar started his charm offensive in early 2011. He was too late. In December 2010, Fettig and other Tea Partiers had announced the Hoosiers for a Conservative Senate group. They were driven by the trauma of 2010, when Democrat Evan Bayh retired and freed up a Senate seat for any Republican who wanted it. Two credible conservatives ran in the primary--former Rep. John Hostettler and State Sen. Marlin Stutzman. Combined, they got more than 280,000 votes. And so they were beaten by former Sen. Dan Coats, whom Tea Partiers couldn't care less about, with his 217,255 votes. Never again. Tea Party groups met often, in town halls and caucuses open to the press. Mourdock, with no financial advantage and a bio that scared off bigger money (three losses in House races), worked them like an Amway salesman. He had met some of them on the bus to the September 2009 Taxpayer March on Washington, where he gave a speech that reporters mostly ignored. The activists remembered it. ""There he was, 100 or so feet from the Capitol, preaching against bailouts,"" remembers Fettig. ""And there, inside, was Lugar, voting for bailouts."" The combined efforts of Mourdock and the Hoosiers group scared other challengers out of the race. (Last summer, when a conservative state senator threatened to get into the race, I assumed Lugar would play off the division and win again.) Lugar hustled. His American Conservative Union voting record--71 percent--was defensible, maybe. The hardest knocks against him seemed to be that he'd voted for TARP and for Barack Obama's SCOTUS nominees, and that he'd appeared in an Obama '08 TV ad trumpeting the work the two of them did on securing ""loose nukes"" in Asia. ""I'm pleased we had the association Sen. Obama describes,"" Lugar shrugged, shortly before Obama won the election--and Indiana. Some may call it treason. The people who'll probably beat Lugar express no malice about it. Taking out the Republicans who compromise with Democrats is a cold, logical decision, the easiest one they make. Jim Bopp, a lawyer who's worked on dozens of lawsuits to break up the campaign finance regime, was one of the first notable Indiana Republicans to dump Lugar. His USA Super PAC sent out around $100,000 of mail for Mourdock. It wasn't personal. ""Lugar is an honest and decent man, but he's voted wrong too many times,"" says Bopp. ""His approach is just wrong now. When Reagan was president, we could afford someone who approaches these issues in a moderate, bipartisan way. But now we have an administration out to destroy us, and we need a fighter. Here's another way to say it. We're in a march to socialism. Obama's getting us there at 100 mph. If you endorse bipartisanship, you get us there at 50 mph."" Bopp, like the other Mourdockians, hopes that a Lugar loss will put the fear of Tea back into Republicans. Nearly four years after TARP, the ""bailout"" can still be used to end the career of anyone who voted for it. The debit limit, that crisis Washington would love to rinse out of its memory banks, has become a new litmus test, a sort of TARP 2. Lugar voted for the debt ceiling deal in 2011; Hatch, who's also facing a primary, voted against it. Hatch is still expected to survive. That shouldn't matter. If Lugar goes down, and if the movement takes out freshman Rep. Larry Bucshon in Indiana's 8th district, then the debt limit litmus test will be ready for the rest of the party. The Mourdockians are confident today because of the polls, because of the ground game, because of Lugar's apparent desperation. They're also confident because the Lugar obituary--the ""he was too good for them"" storyline--has already popped up in the op-eds. Dana Milbank's snark-free Indiana column pre-emptively shamed voters for their purity test, because ""Lugar's bipartisanship was in the service of protecting millions of Americans from nuclear, chemical and biological terrorism."" This didn't really move Fettig. ""I've read New START, and it doesn't address North Korea or Iran,"" says Fettig. ""Why would we want to limit our arsenal and hope that Russia does when we're not even addressing other nations? I've been to Lugar's office in D.C. It's wallpapered with pictures of him climbing in nuclear silos in Russia. I guess that's the legacy he sees himself leaving, but it's an outdated legacy. He not only refuses to leave the beltway, he refuses to leave the 1980s."" That, says Fettig, is a real shame. ""Do we like the fact that the nation is polarized? No. But the fact of the matter is, it is. From the media's perspective, it's OK to be bipartisan if you're a Republican. But Democrats never reach across the aisle. Their idea of compromise is complete surrender. Well, we want a guy who doesn't give in. Yes, politics is polarized. Until one side or the other wins, that's the way it needs to be."""

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/mitt_romney_claims_to_hold_secret_meetings_with_everyday_americans_.html	"Mitt Romney has been running a vast focus group for months. He says that almost every day during his campaign he has secretly sat down with three or four families who are being hurt by Obama's economy to learn what their lives are like. He's been on the road for a long time, which means he must have met hundreds of families. Since the whole business happens on the QT, you can imagine the candidate suddenly appearing from behind the detergent display at the all-night Target to get the views of the startled Anderson family. That Romney was having so many secret meetings was a surprise to nearly everyone who has covered him. Where does he find the time? But more puzzling is that he seems to show so little return for his investment. When Romney was trying to show that he was in touch with the economic concerns of women voters, he referred to his wife. ""My wife has the occasion, as you know, to campaign on her own and also with me,"" Romney told newspaper editors, ""and she reports to me regularly that the issue women care about most is the economy."" Given that he's held so many meetings with families, you'd think his pockets would be laden with ready anecdotes. We all know what Bill Clinton would do. (And we'd still be listening well past dinnertime.) Romney is trying to connect with the middle class to show that he gets it. The rap is that he doesn't know what regular people are going through, so there's no way he can understand how his policies would change their lives. To combat this, Romney started last Friday to open his campaign speeches with rapid-fire anecdotes about his interactions with those who are in financial straits. At a Cleveland town hall Monday, he told the story of five different voters in short order--the barber, the small-business owner whose employee slept in her house, the couple who took out a loan to have a second child, the couple with the duplexes who lost their value, and the woman he met on the rope line in Norfolk. ""It touches your heart,"" he said. ""I know a lot of people are struggling. I am doing my best to help them."" Later, at a fundraiser he told the story of a veterinarian who was losing business. ""I guess even the animals are suffering in the Obama economy."" The gambit behind these stories is obvious enough: to show Gov. Romney cares. On Saturday,  President Obama said that Romney learned the wrong lessons from his years in business. Obama used an anecdote about Romney's off-key response to a woman distressed over her economic condition as proof. These stories Romney is now telling are anecdotal antidotes to that charge. By keeping the regular people from the media, Romney can tell their stories on his own terms. You can't blame him. Public roundtables devolve into spectacles where the candidate has to empathize for the camera or be labeled a brute or out of touch. The face-twisting and lip-biting required are embarrassing for everyone. Under the public-empathy spotlight, Obama had to pretend a woman was going to get her government job back, which he knew was unlikely. Plus, any civilian who talks to a candidate gets the full treatment by the press or the opposing political party. Why subject a private citizen to that? What the governor should be more candid about, though, is what he learns from these sojourns into the middle class. Do these meetings reaffirm his pre-existing views about the economy or does he learn something new? Is he challenged at all? When Barack Obama ran for president, he made a showy trip to Iraq. He wore swish sunglasses and sat next to Gen. Petraeus on helicopter flights. At the end of his trip, he told us almost nothing of what he'd learned. He explored none of the complexities of what he saw on the ground, and he offered us no insight into how his pre-existing ideas changed and shifted once he saw things firsthand. This was extraordinary because we knew--and have come to know even more since then--that Barack Obama has lots of thoughts about things. (Don't even get him started on ""The Waste Land."") Romney could surely give us some insight, given how much time he has spent with the hard-pressed. This isn't just about showing empathy. Romney is running as a person whose business career is supposed to make him wise about how to jumpstart a weak economy. We've never had a president from the world of finance. People are suspicious about how that experience might affect their lives. Even the last president from the business world, George W. Bush, had a skeptical view of financiers from his days in Midland, Texas: ""They'll buy you or sell you, depending upon if it's in their interest."" The political and governing challenge for Mitt Romney is how he adapts his businessman's worldview to the real world he faces. He's no longer shrinking payrolls to meet the bottom line. He has to think about the people who are being crunched by his decisions. Sometimes he'll have to ignore the pain that some will suffer for the larger good. That is what presidents do. It's why they deserve a vacation now and again. The job is hard. And sometimes he'll have to know when to tweak something or change his priorities to help people who are really hurting. Romney says he is running to help the middle class and its distraught members whose faces appear in his campaign ads. So there's got to be some benefit to all of these meetings beyond the production of new campaign propaganda about how they are hurting. Fine, keep the meetings secret, but tell us what he's learned and how his thinking has evolved. He wouldn't want to just use these good people as props to beat up the president. They've suffered enough."	Romney's Secret Relationship With Voters	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/barack_obama_officially_launches_his_presidential_re_election_campaign_.html	"Barack Obama once wanted to ""Win the Future."" Now he's just hoping to get there. ""Forward"" is the new message of his re-election campaign, which he outlined Saturday in the first two official speeches of his 2012 presidential campaign. While his message still contains the old slogan's optimism of a brighter tomorrow, the force of the president's new argument is not so much that Americans could achieve greatness but that they must lock arms to keep Mitt Romney from dragging the country back to a dark past. Hope and change are still alive, said the president, referring to his 2008 election themes. But this time fear is also his running mate. The president spoke in Ohio and Virginia, two battleground states. Though the day was billed as Obama's first official campaign day, it was really just the day that he dropped the last veil. The president, of course, has been campaigning for some time now. He's been in Ohio and Virginia a lot. For months, his domestic travel has rarely taken him outside of a battleground state. The issues he focuses on are aimed at key voting blocs. He's held regular meetings with his campaign strategists in the White House. The surest sign that he's been campaigning has been the regular denials from administration officials that the president was engaged in campaigning. What made Saturday notable, however, is that the president referred more directly to his opponent than he has before. Romney is now real, and Obama started right away to build the case for why the former governor is uniquely qualified to screw things up. The short version: He has a defect born of party and experience. His first task was to tie Romney to the unpopular House Republicans. ""Now after a long and spirited primary, Republicans in Congress have found a nominee who will rubber stamp this agenda if he gets a chance."" Then Obama turned to Romney the person. He praised him as a patriot and family man--right before he described him as constitutionally incapable of understanding the national moment. Obama, who often has been characterized as too lawyerly and professorial, said Romney was too obtuse to understand regular people and their struggles. Romney had drawn the wrong lessons from being governor and running a ""large financial firm."" (Expect Obama to make many references to his ""financial firm""; Romney prefers ""business,"" a more benign word that brings to mind a chain of restaurants or a manufacturer instead of money manipulators.) The president recounted how a woman from Iowa (swing state!) shared a story of her struggles and Romney responded by talking about productivity. The problem is not productivity, said Obama, but that as hard as people are working their wages aren't going up. ""Governor Romney doesn't seem to get that."" (Romney had other reactions to suffering Iowa female voters.) Both candidates are in a race to show that the other is out of touch. This was Obama's opening gambit. He would like it if the rest of the campaign is simply a competition between which of the two men can empathize in public with voters. Obama isn't great at it, but Romney is worse. ""Corporations aren't people,"" said Obama, rebutting a line Romney argued during the Republican primary, ""people are people."" The bulk of the speech outlined the stakes as we've heard the president outline them before. This election is a choice he pointed out repeatedly, between his vision of government that helps people achieve their dreams and Republicans who want lower taxes and less regulation that he says will make the water dirtier, rob students of a chance to get an education, and ignore displaced workers who want a chance to retrain for new jobs. ""This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class,"" said Obama. The president outlined a host of issues that affected women--from contraception to abortion--that were under threat. To show just how much he wants to goose his lead with this important voting bloc, he made a rare reference to his daughters. ""I want women to control their own health choices just like I want my daughters to have the same opportunities as your sons! We are not turning back the clock! We are moving forward!"" The president made several references to his blockbuster 2008 campaign arguing that hope and chance were still alive. But the rhetorical sleights of hand highlighted just how tough things will be for him. He tried to reframe the choice as Romney has presented it. The election is not a question of whether people are better off, he said, but whether they will be better off. (Alas, in 2008 the president said ""the real question is will this country be better off four years from now."") At other times today, his attempt to argue that the country is on the path to success and can't afford to turn back set him up for some awkward sound-bites. Acknowledging that the progress he wants to continue hasn't been enough, the president asked the audience ""Are we satisfied?"" The crowd roared ""No!"" If Mitt Romney doesn't ask the exact same question of his audiences from now until Election Day his advisers should lose their licenses. Obama was at pains to beat back negative images that have attached to him over his first term. He repeatedly affirmed that he supported business and free enterprise and echoed his inaugural address' insistence that risk-taking in business was crucial to national prosperity. He repeatedly asserted that America was the greatest nation on earth since Republicans seem to think this is in doubt. The president concluded his remarks sounding a theme that Bill Clinton made famous in New Hampshire in 1992 when he pledged, ""I'll never forget who gave me a second chance, and I'll be there for you until the last dog dies."" Today, Obama said: ""I am asking you to believe in me,"" reminding voters that he once promised that he ""would wake up every single day fighting for you as hard as I know how. I have kept that promise."" It was a brief look back on a day otherwise all about moving forward."	Obama Wants Hope, Change, and Fear To Give Him Four More Years	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

It's the letter--No. 9 of the 17 missives that the administration released this week through West Point's Combating Terrorism Center--in which Bin Laden discusses what he calls the ""very important matter"" of changing the name of al-Qaida. Contrary to the tone of some news accounts, the letter is not some mildly amusing display of the former most-wanted terrorist engaging in Mad Men-style ""branding."" Rather, it's a fairly sophisticated analysis of how cultural co-optation helps build a political movement--and it's a vindication of President Barack Obama's approach to undermining that movement. In this letter, Bin Laden regrets that his organization's original name, ""Qa'ida al-Jihad"", has come to be known as simply ""al-Qa'ida."" The abridgement, he writes, ""reduces the feeling of Muslims that we belong to them, and allows the enemies to claim deceptively that they are not at war with Islam and Muslims."" Rather, the United States could claim that it was at war only with the al-Qaida organization, which it depicted as ""an outside entity from the teachings of Islam."" Bin Laden complains that Obama has ""repeatedly"" made this argument. Therefore, he concluded, if al-Qaida adopted a new name, which included a reference to Islam, ""it would be difficult for him to say"" that he wasn't at war with Islam. He even makes ""some suggestions"" of possible new names, among them Muslim Unity Group, Islamic Nation Unification Party, and Restoration of the Caliphate Group. Along the same lines, Bin Laden is upset that his enemies ""have largely stopped using the phrase 'the war on terror' in the context of not wanting to provoke Muslims, because they felt that saying the war on terror could appear to most people to be a war on Islam, especially after they unjustly spilled the blood of innocent Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan."" And so, there it is: confirmation of the critique that many Democrats (and foreign-policy specialists of various political stripes) have lodged against the Republicans' approach toward the war on terror this past decade--that their pet phrases (""Islamo-fascism,"" ""Islamo-terrorism,"" even ""war on terror"") play into the hands of al-Qaida, reinforcing the rallying cry bellowed by Bin Laden and his successors that America is waging war on Islam. To his credit, President George W. Bush took some steps to rebut this critique, saying in several speeches that al-Qaida was a perversion, not a reflection, of Islam. But he also indulged in the same ""Islamo"" vocabulary that--we now see--warmed Bin Laden's heart. And the Republican activists who have most fervently touted his legacy in the war on terror--Dick Cheney, Newt Gingrich, John Bolton, Rudolph Giuliani, to name a few--have often denounced those who decline to say ""Islam"" or ""Islamist"" in characterizing this post-9/11 face of terrorism. Their line is that those who avoid the word are indulging in political correctness. But Bin Laden's letter suggests that they're engaging in political ju-jitsu. Bin Laden wanted the West to link Islam and al-Qaida because doing so would bolster both of his main messages: not only that the West is waging war on Islam (and therefore the West must be fought), but that Islam and al-Qaida are one (and therefore Muslims must join al-Qaida). Obama entered the White House intent on isolating the two from each other as much as possible. Many gasped in horror that his first trip as president was to Egypt, where he gave a speech to students--most of them Muslim--at Cairo University. The cable pundits accused him of appeasement, of apologizing for America. They also raised a red flag when he dropped the phrase ""war on terror."" Cheney in particular said it indicated that Obama lacked the right ""mind-set"" to confront threats in a dangerous world (even after Obama tripled the number of drone strikes on al-Qaida targets in Pakistan). Now we see that Obama had the concept right, and that Bin Laden was horrified at his turn. Bin Laden understood that Obama's rhetorical shift was subverting his strategy for spreading al-Qaida's message throughout the Muslim world, a strategy that Cheney had unwittingly abetted in his eight years as vice president (six of which he basically ran U.S. foreign policy). This is not to say that Obama's policies in this realm have been a total success, or that al-Qaida and its affiliates have lost all their strength (though they have lost quite a bit). On this point, too, the Bin Laden file is revealing. In the wake of last year's Arab Spring, the conventional wisdom here, among Republicans and Democrats, was that the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere in the Middle East dealt a fatal blow to al-Qaida, because they revealed that popular revolts could succeed in the Arab world without resort to violence or sectarian appeal. Bin Laden apparently thought otherwise. In a letter dated April 26, 2011 (Letter No. 10 in the West Point book), he heralded the Arab Spring as ""a great and glorious event"" that would allow Muslims across the region to get out from under ""the control of America"" and for al-Qaida's agents to spread ""The Word."" There is no doubt wishful thinking here. But Bin Laden seems to have understood that blowing the lid off an authoritarian regime opens paths to power for all sorts of elements--not just for the young democrats who blew it off in the first place--and that, in countries of Muslim majorities, these elements are likely to include well-organized Islamic organizations (as is apparent in Egypt's current election campaigns). Amid the festive cheer of the Arab Spring's opening days, Obama and his advisers may have underrated this possibility (as did many of his critics). Still his general outlook--which, to Bin Laden's dismay, draws distinctions among Muslims and doesn't view them all as enemies in a seamless war on terror--seems better suited to dealing with relatively moderate Islamic parties, as they arise (as some seem to be doing in Egypt). This makes sense in a world of 1.6 billion Muslims, of whom only a small fraction are al-Qaida sympathizers, much less active followers or fighters. A small fraction of 1.6 billion is nonetheless a large number. Bin Laden welcomed Bush's rhetoric and policies for creating the conditions for swelling his ranks; he fretted that Obama's rhetoric was diminishing them. Maybe, on this score, he knew what he was talking about."	"Why Bin Laden Missed Bush's ""War on Terror"""	['Obama']	[]

The following transcript of the discussion has been edited for length and clarity. To see the full conversation, click on this link. Dave Weigel: Hello! I'm profoundly, tremendously excited to be here. Aaron Mosher: Liar. David Vodolazkiy: Why is racism and sexism back in such a hard way? Why doesn't the mainstream press do more to combat this instead of opting for the easier and intellectually lazy ""both sides"" approach to journalism? Dave Weigel: How would you say those those isms are ""back""? I see the Romney and Obama campaigns exploiting the perception of racism or sexism when it benefits them. See: the Hilary Rosen kerfuffle. What examples are you thinking of, in particular? Because I agree, generally, that the press should not just process those things as ""spats"" between equally matched debaters. David Vodolazkiy: I worded that poorly. I guess what I mean is, even 10 years ago they were still dog-whistling those ideas in reactionary politics, but today we have Rick Santorum saying ""I don't want to make black people's lives better ..."" on video and being allowed to deflect with ""blah plives."" It seems to be more a pattern these days than an aberration. Am I reading too much into it? Dave Weigel: Well, it's more subtle. Nobody has made a convincing case that Santorum dislikes black people--I think he was being his usual ""look ma, no teleprompter"" self and clumsily failed to make a point about how he, unlike liberals, would not divide Americans up by race. I don't think most political racism is directed at a candidate. Too clumsy. It's more pernicious when used to justify voting restrictions or immigration law. _______________________ John Dickerson: Hi everyone. Sorry I'm late. My computer took 12 minutes to power on. Alas, you have just learned a dirty secret of my life: my computer is wood-burning. Christopher Baker: Do you see this election being decided by the respective organizations, as in who can mobilize their base better? John Dickerson: It's a bit of both. The parties have to mobilize their base and they have to find a way to get independent voters. The days of running up your vote in one particular part of a swing state and hoping the other guy doesn't do as well with his base are largely over. Both parties play in counties they aren't going to win in the hopes of shrinking the other guy's vote. _______________________ Andrew Lovseth: Is Texas in play for the Obama campaign? The most recent polling shows the president with a smaller gap than in 2008 going head-to-head with Romney. With the Hispanic vote being touted at ""crucial,"" is there any chance of the president taking Texas and its 38 electoral votes? Dave Weigel: Democrats made real progress in Texas from 2006 to 2008, and then 2010 came along and they slid back down the mountain. Should it hurt Romney that he got the nomination, in part, by running far right of what Texans see as acceptable immigration policy? It'll hurt a little. But in 2008, Obama won 26 percent of the white vote and 63 percent of the Latino vote in Texas. Do we see those numbers moving very much? No. _______________________ Dan Bucherer: Interested in your opinion on the Indiana Senate race. Seems to me like Richard Mourdock is running away with this thing and will be the likely nominee. Does Joe Donnelly have a chance at all? What does Richard Lugar have to do to try to salvage the race? Dave Weigel: I profiled Mourdock as a way of explaining whether it was still possible for conservative activists to oust incumbents. Answer: Yes, I'd give Mourdock the edge. Ironically, if the GOP primary had dragged on, and there was a dogfight between conservatives and Mitt Romney at the top of the ballot, Lugar might have had an easier time getting the votes of ordinary Republican voters. But the primary is likely to bring out the most motivated conservatives. I disagree a little with Nate Silver--Mourdock is a perfectly fine candidate, the kind of Republican who wins red state elections in presidential years. _______________________ Scott Chupack: Let's play alternate reality for a second. In retrospect, which of these candidates would have beaten Romney if only they entered the campaign a year ago. Palin, Christie, Jeb Bush, Rubio, Mitch Daniels, Pawlenty (if he stayed). Dave Weigel: A number of reporter friends have raised that scenario. The starting point: ""Hell, if Santorum could go this far, could someone else have won?"" That underrates Santorum a little. He crashed spectacularly in 2006, but he remained a young-looking, tireless, sharp campaigner with a loyal campaign team that put together strong ads/mailers. Jeb Bush is the only candidate who would have had a clear advantage over Romney, in part because non-Florida primary voters have never seen him campaign. (He's good.) I think Christie would have been weak with social conservatives and ended up losing the first three primaries. Palin would have found some way to lose. Daniels and Pawlenty--ah, those are the real missed opportunities. They would have worn quite well. _______________________ Jan Bowers: I have a fantasy. Neither Obama nor Romney is an ideologue. Any chance that in addition to the traditional debates, they could sit down for a moderated roundtable discussion of the issues, maybe with Jim Lehrer or someone neutral of that stature? Would the campaigns agree to that? What a plus for the voters. Dave Weigel: I like your idea, but historically, Obama has been debate-shy. Remember McCain challenging him to seven forums right after he won the nomination? Yeah, that didn't happen. I fear, sadly, that the campaigns prefer to do their talking through earned and paid media snowball fights. _______________________ Alex Knobel: Is there a previously uncontested state you think will be competitive this year, or will the map, assuming it's close, almost identically resemble the Bush elections? John Dickerson: I think it's identical. There will be some flirting with Ariz. for Dems (big Hispanic vote!) and Mich. for Rs (Romney's from there!) but in a month or so we'll be back to talking about the traditional six-12 states. _______________________ Andrew Walker: What are the odds that the liberal pipe dream of Hillary stepping in as VP for Biden happens? And is there any precedent for that kind of thing happening? Would it even help Obama's odds? Dave Weigel: Is that a liberal pipe dream? I thought it was a politics magazine ad manager's pipe dream! I'm no fun, and no good at selling ads, so I think it's a bunch of baloney. There's no static between Obama and Biden, no polling showing Biden hurting the ticket, and at the local level Democrats and labor love the guy. _______________________ Fake Bogardus: I supported President Obama for reducing the disparity between prison sentencing mandates for crack vs. powder cocaine crimes. What I'd like to know is, when will he take action against the grossly unfair practice of issuing longer prison terms for serial murderers compared to ordinary murderers? And why hasn't Romney spoken out about this issue, which is vital to many Americans like myself.

John Dickerson: He's going to do it tomorrow. Huge. Starts at 6 a.m. Tune your tinfoil hat into the usual frequency. _______________________ Christian Moyer: Of all the months between now and the election, which is the most important for economic data? Does job news now have more influence on campaign tone, or are voters more interested in data right before Election Day? John Dickerson: You tell me! I'm not sure. The standard line is that it takes 6 months for people to feel an economic turnaround. But what does that mean? Feel it how? New job? Better wages? Friends who were fired getting jobs? Or is a great jobs report enough to help people think things are turning around? Given the pace of this recovery it's probably safe to say that no boffo report is coming in for August 2012 or September. I think the best the president can hope for is a good report this Friday and steadily better ones 'till Election Day. Seventy percent of people in Fla. and Ohio think we're still in a recession. Tough to crack that. _______________________ Stan Weddle: Ron Paul supporters still believe he can get the nomination. Are they wasting their time? Just curious, I'm not a Ron Paul supporter. Dave Weigel: The short answer is ""yes, they are wrong."" They will get more delegates via the state convention system than many lazy media bean-counters thought they could. (Seriously, it's weird that the AP projects delegate counts from non-binding caucuses.) But Romney will have an overwhelming majority of pledged delegates from states that assigned them in primaries. He hasn't even pulled in those Texas or California delegates yet, for example. Also, a lot of states that assigned delegates to Santorum and Gingrich will give those slots to ""uncommitted,"" further reducing the chance of a floor fight. _______________________ Seth Archer: What I find the most upsetting is the wide acceptance that these Rove-ian (splintering votes from Romney because he's wealthy; questioning Obama's citizenship) techniques are now considered par for the course. Is there any way for U.S. democracy to move past such politicking without the elimination of the Electoral College? John Dickerson: You give Karl too much credit. That kind of thing has been around forever. Used to be worse. In the early days of the republic it was MUCH worse. _______________________ Martha Dunkelberger: Do you think the ""War on Women"" meme will flame out? Even over the last two weeks, the fury seems to have died down. John Dickerson: The War on Women always confused me. It was an overreach from the start. Now with the fight over student loans the Democrats have gotten even nuttier with it. Is it working? Obama's up by double digits with women in Ohio but tied with Romney for them in Fla. so it's not clear. I find the whole thing tiresome, lazy and pointless on both sides. Welcome to this election! _______________________ Kevin McSpadden: How does Mitt Romney have a chance when he doesn't seem to be relevant in the urban environment? Are there enough people outside of the cities to overcome that? Dave Weigel: Romney actually did well in the primary in the swing suburban areas. No Republican in a very long while has won urban areas. The goal is to win the exurbs and keep the suburbs close, like George W. Bush did. And the polling suggests that Romney is doing it. _______________________ Brad Evans: While talking with a friend about the upcoming presidential election, I let slip that, while certainly hoping for another Obama term, in the final analysis Mitt Romney appears to be about as centrist a GOP candidate as I could hope for. My friend responded that ""but he'll be beholden to the extreme right wing if he wins."" This is what Republicans would say to anybody thinking about voting for Obama. By that logic, you can never vote for anyone of another party. Wondering what your guys' take was.

John Dickerson: Romney would presumably be more ""beholden"" than Obama, who would not be up for re-election. Romney has already endorsed the House Republican budget so on the issues that people care about you pretty much already know where he lives. How much Romney would be beholden on social issues I'm not sure. They are not his deep passion.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/white_working_class_ohio_voters_romney_needs_to_win_them_over_.html	"Ohio Republican Senate candidate Josh Mandel is 34, but he looks 19. He's not clean-cut--he's freshly shorn. So when the young State Treasurer explains that he's going to beat incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown by winning over working-class voters who spend their day with equipment that is hot, heavy, and dirty, it seems like a long shot. But Mandel has possible inroads with these voters: He served two tours in the Marines in Iraq. His grandfather was a laborer at a brass factory and his mother was also a union worker--the kind of voters he's trying to court. In one of his ads he highlights his military experience. (A snapshot from Anbar Province puts grit on a man.) In another he highlights his working-class heritage. Mandel's strategy may not work, but at least he can start the conversation with white, working-class voters, a critical voting bloc. The question after two days of reporting in Ohio is what Mitt Romney can do to appeal to these same voters? Is he going to visit the shift-change at the Lordstown GM plant and let them take his measure, or is he just going to hope that history and a bad economy will bring them out to vote against President Barack Obama? Ohio is competing with Florida for the title of most important state in this election. According to almost every serious analysis, it is a must-win for Mitt Romney. (Pause to cite the election-year adage: No Republican has won the presidency without winning Ohio.) Fifty-four percent of the electorate is made up of white, working-class voters, according to the Brookings Institution. Romney has a hard time with them. In the Ohio primary, according to exit polls, he lost those making $50,000-$100,000 by 11 points to Rick Santorum, and lost those without a college degree, too. The good news is that Obama has also had trouble with these voters. He lost them in the 2008 primary to Hillary Clinton and he lost working-class white voters to John McCain by 18 points. Romney will probably win these voters in Ohio but his challenge is to win them by a big enough margin to overcome Obama's strengths with young voters, minorities, and college graduates. How should Romney make his case to working-class voters? How can he show that he understands them? We know what Romney's father George Romney would do. In 1968 when he was running for president, George Romney took a 17-city tour of the ""ghettos."" On this tour, the candidate interacted in unscripted moments with actual people. Unplanned events took place. He argued with those who opposed him. He suggested that he was interested in the lives of people who were not likely to be in his voting coalition. This kind of sustained engagement with serendipity would seem as foreign to the Mitt Romney campaign as campaigning in the nude. When Charlie Rose asked Romney this week on CBS This Morning whether he might replicate even a sliver of his father's outreach, the governor said he has held regular meetings with voters away from the cameras. This was politically and logistically confusing. Those who have covered Romney by the minute were surprised to learn about these events. Also: Why, if you're having trouble connecting with middle class voters--as the polls regularly show he does--would you hide these regular engagements with them? I asked the campaign for a few details and about why these meetings were secret and was told there would be no more information on this topic. Romney starts with an empathy deficit and continues to dig his hole deeper. At a recent speech at Ohio's Otterbein University, Romney suggested to the students that one of several paths to success was that they could borrow money from their parents to start a business. (Mitt Romney has helped his son through a family trust.) With nearly 70 percent of college students on some kind of financial aid, it's safe to assume that parents who can't pay for school also don't have ready cash to fund the first venture. Democrats added the parental-loan remark to the string of Romneyi$ms that highlight his wealth and his distance from the daily struggles of most Americans. The Obama campaign went on offense this week with a blunderbuss ad called ""Swiss Bank Account,"" that ends with the line: ""It's just what you'd expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account."" Subtle! Obama hopes to make Romney's financial background as exotic to these voters as Obama's upbringing in Indonesia. Josh Mandel thinks that Romney should show up at a plant or coal mine or find some other way to connect with these voters, or else risk losing them. And Romney clearly knows he must find some way to show that he understands what people face in economically uncertain times. A considerable danger to Romney would be that a factory tour would look like he was pandering. A hard-hat moment would look as inauthentic as John Kerry's afternoon of hunting or Michael Dukakis' ride in the tank. Despite Romney's deficit with white, working-class voters and his self-inflicted wounds, he does have two big advantages: history and the economy. A majority of blue-collar voters haven't voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson. These folks have been the hardest hit by the economic downturn. Romney just needs voters to blame the president for the bad economy, which they seem ready to do. In a recent Quinnipiac poll, Romney tops Obama on all questions related to the economy and jobs. ""The Romney campaign message is pretty simple,"" said one veteran GOP strategist, summing up the Ohio strategy, ""Under Obama, your life sucks."" President Obama has a direct rebuttal that he'll be making in his first official campaign event, which is scheduled for Saturday at Ohio State University. Obama will tout the 2009 bailout of Chrysler and General Motors which he says not only saved jobs at car manufacturing plants but also in those industries that service the car industry. Last week the Obama campaign launched a ""made in Ohio"" tour in which former Gov.  Ted Strickland toured the state reminding voters about the rescue and about Mitt Romney's  2008 Op-Ed that the New York Times editors gave the headline, ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."" Ohio Democrats may also have a tactical advantage that will help the president overcome the usual Democratic disadvantage with blue-collar voters. Last year, Gov. John Kasich and Republican leaders tried to limit public-sector union bargaining rights for roughly 400,000 state and local workers, including police, firefighters, and teachers. In November, voters overturned the law (Senate Bill 5, which Romney supported) 62 percent to 38 percent. Republicans admit this damaged the party's reputation with firefighter and police unions that had typically been sympathetic to the GOP. Democrats say the door-knocking and voter-outreach effort that led to that victory started a conversation with angry blue-collar voters that will make them receptive to Obama's re-election campaign. Republicans say any conversation with voters that starts with the auto bailout will lead to a larger conversation about the economy, enabling Romney to argue that his 25 years in business gives him special insight. But even there the issue is getting murky. During Romney's recent visit to Ohio, he joined Gov. John Kasich who touted the thousands of jobs now available in the state. The Ohio unemployment rate was 9 percent last year and is now 7.5 percent, just below the national average. Republicans argue Kasich should get the credit and not the president. To make that case, Mitt Romney will first have to find a way to talk to those working-class voters."	The Most Important Voters of 2012 Are White, Working-Class Ohioans.

It was founded during Paul's 2008 campaign, and the look and topics have barely changed. There are nearly 25,000 active threads about ""economics and sound money."" Nestled at the bottom of the page are ads for the Ron Paul Milk Chocolate Standard (""the Ron Paul chocolate bar is here!"") and Ammo.net, which promises an ""automatic donation"" to Paul for every bullet you buy. Laugh too hard and you'll miss the posts about how Ron Paul is actually winning. On April 30, a Louisiana Paulian named ""Darguth"" penned 1,826 words (not counting emoticons) about how, over the weekend, the movement took four of the state's six district conventions. Darguth explained how he'd tutored himself in Louisiana's Byzantine delegate-selection Hunger Games--a primary, followed by caucuses, followed by a convention--and how he ""diligently made calls"" to keep fellow Paulians engaged. ""We set about doing exit polling at the primary,"" Darguth wrote, ""and we identified Ron Paul voters who we could contact afterwards (to avoid any illegal electioneering at the primary site on election day) to give them details on the caucus."" Later, he was spending ""probably at least 5-6 hours a day"" crunching data to put together a Paul faction at his caucus. On the fateful day, as the votes were counted, ""our pile grew so much you could visibly see we'd won."" What was actually achieved by Darguth and his fellowship? Not much, not yet. The final Louisiana delegate selections will happen at a June convention. What was proved? Activist-for-activist, Paul's people make the Republican Party look like pikers. And there will be some consequence--we're not sure what yet--when the Paul diehards inevitably lose. The Paul campaign's ""delegate strategy"" is no secret. In January, as they stared down a month of popular-vote losses, the campaign talked of its 10 state campaigns, some in places that would not start caucusing until March. ""We're a delegate-focused campaign,"" said campaign spokesman Jesse Benton on January 10, explaining why a second-place finish in New Hampshire would be perfectly all right. They kept talking and the media turned out. The turning point came in Maine's weeklong series of caucuses. Paul's team, hyperaware of how the media wanted to switch the colors of states on election night maps, suggested that the candidate might win the caucus straw vote. He didn't. ""[Paul]'s campaign may have blown its best chance at winning a state in the Republican presidential contest,"" sighed Aaron Blake in the Washington Post. Paul only polled second in Minnesota and North Dakota. It didn't really matter that these were nonbinding caucuses. The press found other stories to cover, such as whether Rick Santorum dropped a meaningful clause in a speech, or whether Hilary Rosen was Barack Obama's running mate. Paul lost his last full-time ""embed"" on March 14. Let's give the media some credit: The mass embed exodus made sense. After Super Tuesday, Paul's campaign has consisted, mostly, of ""massive town halls"" (the campaign uses this term in press alerts) in college towns. There's not much for the press to cover, vis-a-vis the candidate. No, the action is in the states. In the second-to-last weekend of April, Paul supporters overwhelmed Minnesota's congressional district caucuses--the events that actually picked delegates. There were 24 delegates at stake, and Paul's people won 20 of them. One week later, Republicans in Massachusetts got to assign 19 delegate slots from the state's congressional districts. Paul  won 16 of them, denying one to the woman whose last resume item was ""lieutenant governor under Mitt Romney."" Four time zones away, Paul supporters were getting their man elected chairman of the Alaska Republican Party--a voting RNC delegate. Next week, the rolling coup moves to Nevada. The mostly binding February caucuses were disappointments for Paul supporters. They think they can win 65 percent of convention delegates anyway. Paul's supporters pulled this off in some 2008 conventions and caucuses. They ended up arriving at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., holding their own rally in Minneapolis, and getting totally screwed out of nominating Paul on the floor. But they have learned. In order for Paul's name to be put into nomination at the Tampa convention, according to RNC Rule 40(b), the candidate needs a plurality of delegates from five states. They're sure they can pull that off. They won't say how. ""We have a hard delegate count,"" says Benton, ""but we keep it internal."" It's hard to get a solid delegate count. Most media outlets that publish these counts base them on estimates on how they'd break down if state convention-goers behaved like primary voters. It's also in Paul's interest to keep this mysterious. When Republicans have prepared for the Paul takeover, they've defeated it. In Massachusetts, for example, party rules require the Paul-friendly delegates to vote for the guy who won the primary--Mitt Romney. In North Dakota, according to state director Jared Hendrix, Paul's forces had ""quadrupled"" from 2008 to 2012. But chicanery cost them the delegates they thought they earned. A list of RNC delegates, provided by the state party, suggests that most of them support Mitt Romney. He only came in third place in the Super Tuesday vote. ""They required people on the convention floor to write down delegate names on their own, on their ballots,"" explains Hendrix--for whom ""they"" are the Republican establishment. ""They'd flash the names on a screen, but the screen kept changing, and they didn't account for a number of old people there who had trouble seeing. They didn't follow rules ... they cut off the mic ... it was not a fair process."" The right amount of Paul-blocking techniques will prevent Romney from getting embarrassed. Too much of it will tick them off. Paul had actually gone easy on Romney during debates and primaries, neglecting to mention the front-runner in negative ads. The payoff (no quid quo pro, just talkin') was supposed to be prime convention speaking slots and serious input on GOP platform planks--not too difficult, because the much-ignored platform is usually more right-wing than the nominee. Four years ago, feeling a little stiffed by the party, Paul waited until after the convention to endorse a slew of third party candidates. How do you keep his supporters from leaving the GOP again? You start by letting them stage a few successful coups. The rest of the GOP has to plan for this. Paul's people aren't stopping. Another item for sale on RonPaulForums is a documentary titled For Liberty, a well-made insider's look at the 2008 campaign, with friendly interviews of volunteers. Its third act is full of cable-news reports on Paul's many, many losses. It's a popular item, one that inspires Paul's people to call their friends about showing up at the next caucus."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/norman_ornstein_is_playing_the_part_of_a_conservative_.html	"The column has been tweeted more than 2,400 times. More than 100,000 people have clicked a tiny, omnipresent ""f"" and shared it on Facebook. The Washington Post's comment widget, groaning under the pressure, stopped counting the number of new scrawls at 5,000. The title of this op-ed blockbuster, by Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein, is ""Let's Just Say It: The Republicans Are the Problem."" You see why it was popular. Ornstein is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Mann is at the Brookings Institution. The two think tanks, both embedded near Washington, D.C.'s Dupont circle, can be described, roughly, as right-wing and left-wing. And so ThinkProgress gave the ""conservative American Enterprise Institute"" partial credit for the column, as did the Detroit News, as did the Vermont Times Argus. Newser slapped on the headline ""Conservative Think Tank: Mess is the GOP's Fault."" That was the story--not that Republicans were criticized, but that they were criticized by a conservative. That meant that it mattered. But some of the Facebook-sharers were played for simps. Ornstein doesn't pretend to be a conservative movement, Republican scholar. ""He's as conservative a Democrat as there's ever been,"" suggests his friend David Frum. Back when Al Franken had a radio show, Ornstein would come on to talk politics and find areas of agreement. Franken would play him in with a Bruce Springsteen song for which he'd written new lyrics: Noooooorm in the U.S.A.! Nooooooorm in the U.S.A.! ""Ornstein's an intellectual,"" says Citizens United president David Bossie. ""He's a guy who's never been part of the conservative movement, and he's never been part of the conservative establishment or organizations on any policy."" So he's not a conservative, but people want him to play one on TV. There is an Apostate Factor in punditry, a multiplying effect powerful enough to turn any opinion into a newsy opinion. The schematic: Step 1: Become associated with a party or a movement.
 Step 2: Criticize said party or movement.
 Step 3: Repeat. How long can you keep it up? I've wondered about this, and I don't think it's about timing. It's about scale. You can dine out on your old party affiliation indefinitely if you keep it classy--sticking to books, op-eds, official-looking chin-stroking. If you make a giant production out of your apostasy, your credit burns right up. Let's point our magnifying glasses at three examples. Zell Miller: Effective apostasy period: 2003-04. Miller, a former governor of Georgia, took over a Senate seat after its Republican occupant died of a cerebral hemorrhage.* Starting in 2003, after his state's Democrats were obliterated, Miller was ready and willing to add his official Democratic voice to whatever Republican attack needed the oomph. The 9/11 commission was ""unpatriotic""; John Kerry would disassemble America's military defenses cog-by-cog. ""Kerry would let Paris decide when America needs defending!"" howled Miller at the 2004 Republican National Convention. In three years, he wrote two books on the premise that no sane person who cared for America's soul could ever vote for Democrats. But he became a has-been, fast. His mistake: For the media's purposes, if you endorse the other party's candidate, you've joined the other party. Miller's retirement gig as a Fox News contributor petered out as the Democrats took over Congress in 2006. Bruce Bartlett. Effective apostasy period: 2005-present. In his mid-20s, Bartlett was working for Rep. Ron Paul. In his 30s, he worked for the Heritage Foundation and for Ronald Reagan's White House. His rebel life began in 2005, when his think-tank superiors read the manuscript of his book about George W. Bush's betrayal of the movement. The think tankers sided with Bush. He was freed, in a way, to become a conservative critic of conservatives, the inspiration for headlines like ""Former Reagan Official: Rick Perry's an Idiot."" ""I seldom say anything supportive of Obama or the Democratic Party or their agenda,"" says Bartlett. ""I mostly criticize those on the right for stupidity, mendacity, sloppy thinking, lying, putting party, and tribal loyalty above truth, etc. For this, those on the right lump me in with the left as if there is no difference between being a critic of the right and being a member of the left."" He criticizes both sides. That gives him an endless supply of credit when he needs to hit Republicans. Pat Caddell. Effective apostasy period: 1988-present. He was one of the Democratic Party's best-known strategists for a decade, polling for four presidential campaigns--one of them actually successful. In 1988 he pulled away from the Democratic firm he worked for and nearly quit politics. But--and this is the key to apostate success--reporters knew where to find him when they needed quotes. By summer he was telling the Los Angeles Times that Michael Dukakis, his party's eventual nominee, ""doesn't have anything to say."" For the past decade he's been a reliable ""Democratic"" voice on Fox News, where his often-wrong judgment of his old party is always, always framed as the righteous indignation of the true believer. When he filed a column about Barack Obama's weakness or unelectability or ""overly partisan"" nature, he is bylined as ""a pollster for President Jimmy Carter."" This is because when modern Democrats hire him, they have to fire him after he calls union members ""thugs"" or agrees too vigorously with David Horowitz. Why does any of this matter? The Mann/Ornstein thesis isn't actually new. In the column, and in the accompanying book (It's Even Worse Than It Looks), they make the sort of points that columnists like Ezra Klein or James Fallows make about Washington: People, we can't get anything done because these Republicans won't raise any revenue. But that's an argument that makes the Democrats look like put-upon do-gooders. Thus, it's partisan. Thus, nobody wants to hear it unless there's an apostate in charge of the mic-check. Mann/Ornstein figured this out. ""A balanced treatment of an unbalanced phenomenon distorts reality,"" they wrote. ""If the political dynamics of Washington are unlikely to change anytime soon, at least we should change the way that reality is portrayed to the public."" Do we really have to sit and wait for the apostates to point that out?
