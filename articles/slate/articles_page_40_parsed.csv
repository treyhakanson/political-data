Hosea Williams led 600 people on a march from Selma, Alabama, to the capitol in Montgomery. Stopped by a gang of state police and white civilians on the Edmund Pettus Bridge outside of Selma, they were attacked in a vicious display of white supremacist violence. Besieged by tear gas, whips, nightsticks, and other makeshift weapons, they were injured, bloodied--dozens required care and 17, including Lewis, were hospitalized--and pushed back into town. Recorded by national media and broadcast to the world, these events would galvanize thousands of Americans, inspire a larger (and successful) march to Montgomery, and lead President Lyndon Johnson to commit to and push a voting rights act that would stand as the high-water mark of civil rights movement. Now, in commemoration of ""Bloody Sunday,"" tens of thousands of Americans have converged on modern-day Selma, where they will memorialize and celebrate the great racial progress of the past half-century. Unfortunately, this happens at a time of terrible retrenchment, as a host of forces pushes back against those hard-fought wins. If the 1960s were a Second Reconstruction--a second attempt to fulfill the promise of emancipation--then our present period is a second Redemption, where a powerful movement attempts to reverse gains and dismantle our fragile efforts at racial equality. Most Americans have a vague sense of Reconstruction--often, and unfortunately, informed by D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation--but few are aware of ""Redemption,"" which roughly encompassed the late 1870s to the end of the 19th century. It was the antithesis to the nascent biracial democracy of Reconstruction, where blacks enjoyed extensive political power and worked in concert with sympathetic whites to build and reform a broken South. ""Public schools, hospitals, penitentiaries, and asylums for orphans and the insane were established for the first time or received increased funding. South Carolina funded medical care for poor citizens, and Alabama provided free legal counsel for indigent defendants,"" writes Eric Foner of Republican Reconstruction governments. Black and white lawmakers provided food for the poor, made appropriations for schools and social welfare, pushed compulsory education, and even tried to regulate private markets and insurance companies. Some changes stuck and the most important one--emancipation--endured. But a decade of white violence and terrorism took its toll, and by the presidential election of 1876, recalcitrant rebels and supportive whites had seized control in much of the former Confederacy. It was in that environment that Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes promised ""home rule"" for the South, a new status quo in which the federal government would turn a blind eye to the white South. Hayes won a highly contested election, and as president, he gave white ""Redeemers"" free rein in their states, nearly unchallenged by federal troops or the voters they protected. Far from a unified group, the Redeemers--whose ranks included secessionist Democrats, old planters, Confederate veterans, and young modernists--shared a commitment to reducing black political power and, as Foner writes, ""reshaping the South's legal system in the interests of labor control and racial subordination."" In most states where they won power, they replaced Reconstruction constitutions with new documents limiting the scope and expense of government. ""Redeemer constitutions,"" explains Foner, ""reduced the salaries of state officials, limited the length of legislative sessions, slashed state and local property taxes, curtailed the government's authority to incur financial obligations ... and repudiated, wholly or in part, Reconstruction state debts. Public aid to railroads and other corporations was prohibited, and several states abolished their central boards of education."" Redeemers slashed state budgets--gutting the nascent welfare states of Reconstruction governance--and all but ended taxes on land and large estates, replacing them with new levies on machinery and other items used on plantations. ""Laborers, tenants, and small farmers paid taxes on virtually everything they owned--tools, mules, even furniture--while many planters had thousands of dollars in property excluded,"" notes Foner. In states like Florida--where one governor, George F. Drew, advised lawmakers to ""spend nothing unless absolutely necessary""--Redeemer governments leveled everything established by ex-black lawmakers. Redeemers closed hospitals, defunded state colleges, and dismantled public education systems. And to bolster these moves, they took care to curtail black political participation with either violence or legislation. In place of property taxes, governments levied poll taxes and other fees. In this, Redeemers had help from the federal courts, which were increasingly skeptical of race-conscious policy. In 1883, the Supreme Court overturned the Civil Rights Act of 1875, denying that the 14th Amendment prohibited private discrimination in public accommodations and declaring that ""there must be some stage"" where blacks cease ""to be the special favorite of the laws."" What's striking here is how familiar this sounds, and how Redemption is echoed in the politics of the past 10 years. Then as now, the federal courts are increasingly hostile to race-conscious legislation. In 2007, with Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, the Supreme Court struck down voluntary integration efforts in an opinion punctuated by Chief Justice John Roberts' declaration that ""the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" In 2013, with Shelby County v. Holder, the same court struck down the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act, which required federal supervision in states with a history of voting discrimination. Most recently, with Schuette v. BAMN, the court allowed voters to block affirmative action through a state constitutional amendment. And this year, following its judgment on these cases, it is expected to strike down ""disparate impact,"" a way of addressing stark racial disparities without the burden of proving explicit discrimination. It's a vital piece of the civil rights arsenal--a weapon against housing discrimination and police abuse. That the Department of Justice has a case against the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri is a testament to its power; the fact of huge disparities in arrests and other police treatment was enough to justify federal action. The Redemption parallel extends to the states as well. While the 2010 elections brought a wave of reactionary lawmakers to power throughout the country, this was especially the case in the South, where the last white Democrats fell to their Republican opponents, leaving a racially polarized politics of white Republicans and black Democrats. In short order, they imposed new voting restrictions and other laws meant to limit the franchise through obstacles and reduced access. Since 2011, more than half of states in the country have introduced or passed laws making it harder to vote, with the harshest ones in states like North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, and Wisconsin. What makes this worse is the extent to which black Democrats in the South have little input into policymaking, a product of Democratic decline and extreme polarization. The most sweeping changes after 2010 were at the level of economic policy. In Kansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina, lawmakers made deep cuts to corporate and state income taxes. They reduced burdens on the wealthiest residents and replaced them with new fees and sales taxes that placed the heaviest burden on the poorest residents. At the same time, they've slashed education budgets, reduced services, and refused federal funds for the Medicaid expansion, keeping millions of low-income people--many of them black Americans--from needed medical services. In appearance and in effect, the program of 21st-century conservatives is remarkably similar to the one of 19th-century Redeemers. It guts civil rights laws, shrinks state spending, and limits the scope of activist government. Yes, there are important differences: The conservative movement isn't motivated by explicit racial animus as much as it is ideology, and even in the deepest South, there's ample room for racial minorities. But it's undeniable that the two are connected by history. Today's anti-government conservatism has its roots in the antebellum politics of Sen. John C. Calhoun, was modernized in reaction to the civil rights movement, and was brought to the Republican Party by an alliance of Southern reactionaries and ideological conservatives. And while it's been attenuated from its racial history, you see hints of the past in its practical politics: The national coalition for ideological conservatism is anchored by white Southerners while the national coalition for progressive governance is anchored by blacks. The point of this parallel isn't to hammer conservatives with their history--liberals have an incredibly ugly racial past as well--it's to show that American civic life has cycles, and one of those cycles is the waxing and waning of black political power. The Civil War brought Reconstruction, which was met with powerful force by the agents of white supremacy. In turn, this was wounded--perhaps fatally--by the civil rights movement, whose gains are now waning in the face of economic turmoil and conservative ascendance. When will black influence wax again? It's hard to say for certain. But consider that every period of black American advancement has come in the wake of a traumatic national event: the Civil War, the Second World War, the assassination of John Kennedy, and--in the case of Obama--the Great Recession. If the pattern holds, then the night will have to get very dark before we see a brighter sun."	Why the Civil Rights Legacy of Selma Is Waning Once Again	['Lewis', 'Black', 'Williams', 'Shelby']	[]
1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/nra_s_personal_swipe_at_gabby_giffords_on_twitter_the_national_rifle_association.html	"Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman grievously wounded in a 2011 shooting near Tucson that killed six people, returned to Capitol Hill this week to renew her push for legislation that would expand background checks for gun purchases to include gun shows and Internet sales. The legislation, a similar version of which was blocked by a Senate filibuster in 2013, stands almost no chance in the Republican-led Congress. But Giffords--for whom ""talking is really tough,"" as she admitted in a recent interview--made the trip anyway.  ""Stopping violence takes courage,"" she said. ""The courage to do what's right, the courage of new ideas. ... Now is the time to come together and be responsible. Democrats, Republicans, everyone. We must never stop fighting. Fight, fight, fight. Be bold, be courageous, the nation's counting on you."" Here is how the National Rifle Association chose to respond to Giffords on Thursday: The NRA has of course tangled before with Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group that Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, created to push for common-sense gun law reforms, such as closing the ""gun show loophole"" for background checks. But as far as I can tell, this is the first time that the NRA has taken a personal swipe at Giffords, mocking her reform efforts by directly invoking the shooting that nearly killed her. The NRA tweet, which went out to the organization's 264,000 followers, was promoting a piece by the conservative website Breitbart, which ridiculed Giffords' renewed push for universal background checks by noting that the Tucson shooter, Jared Loughner, had passed a background check to acquire his Glock. ""Yes, Loughner acquired his firearm via a background check, as did Jerad and Amanda Miller (Las Vegas), Elliot Rodger (Santa Barbara), Ivan Lopez (Fort Hood 2014), Darion Marcus Aguilar (Maryland mall), Karl Halverson Pierson (Arapahoe High School), Paul Ciancia (LAX), Aaron Alexis (DC Navy Yard), James Holmes (Aurora theater), Nidal Hasan (Fort Hood 2009), among others,"" the article states. ""But Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, stood with Democrat lawmakers to argue that expanding background checks to include gun show sales is a way of 'stopping violence.' "" There are a few points worth noting. For one, Giffords and Kelly were not just standing with ""Democrat lawmakers""--they were joined by Rep. Bob Dold, an Illinois Republican who co-authored the background check legislation, and the bill has three other Republican co-authors in the House. (Giffords' group in general prides itself on having support from many Republicans and gun owners--Giffords and Kelly make much of fact that they themselves are gun owners.) For another thing, one of the above-mentioned shooters, Jerad Miller, complained bitterly prior to his attack about the difficulty he was having buying a weapon because, as someone with an extensive criminal record, he could not pass a background check--a sign that the requirement is not as ineffectual as its critics make it out to be. But the big problem with the mocking argument put forth by Breitbart and the NRA (which did not return a call seeking comment) is that it misses the entire point of Giffords' advocacy. She is not devoting herself to the cause of expanding background checks because that measure would have stopped Loughner, but because that measure is the one that police and criminal justice experts believe would have the biggest impact on reducing gun violence overall. The same was true of the families of the victims in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre: Universal background checks would not have stopped Adam Lanza, who got his guns from his mother, but the families wanted to push for whatever reform would limit shooting deaths, period. Making it harder for people with criminal records, histories of domestic violence, and adjudications for mental illness to obtain guns is one of the best measures at our disposal to do so. In other words, Giffords and others whose lives have been upended by gun violence are thinking about others, not themselves--they are exhibiting a form of political empathy. It's a concept that is apparently foreign to the NRA--which would help explain why the organization thinks it's perfectly acceptable to casually taunt a victim of gun violence who is still trying mightily to recover from her near-death experience."

That is the distinct possibility that emerged at Wednesday's oral arguments in King v. Burwell, the legal challenge to Obamacare that grew out of the discovery by a little-known employment-benefits attorney in South Carolina and the advocacy of an ardent think-tank libertarian in Washington to seriously threaten the viability of the law. The challenge is directed at the law's provision that federal subsidies to help people without employer-based health coverage afford private insurance would be available to those buying coverage on an ""Exchange"" or online marketplace. Whether it succeeds depends on how the court chooses to interpret these four words: ""established by the State."" The challengers argue that under this language, the subsidies should be available only in the 17 states that have proceeded to set up their own exchanges, and not in the 33 others that have left that task to the federal government, the backup that was provided for in the law. The government had come to the court prepared to make the arguments it had offered in the lower courts for why it was absurd to suggest, on the basis of a few clumsily drafted words, that the subsidies would not be available on the federally run exchanges as well. That the whole point of the Affordable Care Act was to provide affordable coverage to as many Americans as possible, so why would the subsidies to make that possible be allowed only in some states and not others? That it was ridiculous to suggest, as the challengers did, that withholding subsidies was a deliberate ploy on the law's part to get states to set up their own exchanges, since that incentive was never mentioned during the law's drafting nor spelled out in the Obama administration's communications with the states. That the full context of the law made clear that the subsidies were intended to flow to people in both state- and federally run exchanges, and, in fact, that if one accepted the challengers' reading of the clause in question, whole swaths of the rest of the law became nonsensical. Those arguments had been enough to persuade the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. But the challengers had prevailed in a 2-1 ruling at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, with the two Republican nominees on the panel siding against the lone Democratic one, and before a full en banc panel of that court had had the chance to review the ruling, the Supreme Court had snatched it up. This was cause for great consternation among the law's defenders, who worried that Chief Justice John Roberts had decided it was time to eviscerate the law that he had allowed to stand in 2012, a ruling that marked him as a quisling in the eyes of many of his fellow conservatives. But the law's defenders took heart Wednesday when an entirely different point was raised that seemed to argue in defense of the law. And it was raised not by Roberts, the swing vote in 2012--who asked virtually no questions of the lawyers at Wednesday's hearing--but by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had ruled against the law in 2012. Kennedy seemed concerned that ruling in favor of the challengers, and thereby eliminating the subsidies in the 33 states without their own exchanges, would pose a constitutional problem for the law. Why? Because it would mean that the federal government was exerting an undue level of coercion over the states--threatening them with the withholding of valuable subsidies for millions of their citizens if the states did not take a specified action. ""Let me say that from the standpoint of the dynamics of federalism, it does seem to me that there is something very powerful to the point that if your argument is accepted, the states are being told either create your own exchange, or we'll send your insurance market into a death spiral,"" Kennedy told Michael Carvin, who represented the challengers. The reason this argues against the challengers is that in seeking to interpret ambiguous statutes, the court traditionally favors whatever interpretation causes the least constitutional conflict. If this argument about coercion of the states sounds familiar, it's because it is what the Supreme Court relied on in the second half of its 2012 opinion--a 7-2 ruling that, to the great dismay of the law's supporters, undid the law's expansion of Medicaid to a new nationwide threshold of eligibility. That expansion was how the law was intending to cover the neediest swath of uninsured Americans. But the court ruled that it was too coercive of the federal government--a ""gun to the head,"" as Roberts put it in the ruling--to tell the states that they had to go along with the expansion, or exit the Medicaid program entirely, even if the feds were picking up nearly the entire tab of the expansion. And as a result of the ruling, some 5 million low-income people have been left uncovered in the half of the states that have refused to accept the Medicaid expansion--a grievous blow to the law's goals. So it was awfully ironic to have that same reasoning now being invoked in the law's defense. Carvin was not unprepared for it, as it was raised in a brief filed by 22 states arguing in defense of the law, and also in a trenchant recent piece by Yale Law professor Abbe Gluck. Asked about the implication of the Medicaid ruling last week by the Wall Street Journal, Carvin rejected the comparison, saying that withholding subsidies from residents didn't create the same degree of coercion as the Medicaid plan had, because the penalty for rejecting the Medicaid expansion would have been losing funding for existing Medicaid programs in the states, whereas the subsidies were an entirely new offering--that is, no one would be losing something they already had. ""You're not putting on the table old federal [funding] guarantees, and the fiscal enormity is much less,"" Carvin told the Journal. But at the court, Kennedy noted, correctly, that there was much more at stake in the threat that would be created by the challengers' reading of the law than just whether citizens got the new subsidies. The new exchanges created by the law for individual insurance would still draw some customers even without the subsidies, because the exchanges offer consumer protections, such as requiring insurers to offer plans regardless of pre-existing conditions. But without subsidies, the exchanges would attract only those who would want to buy coverage even if it was quite expensive--that is, older and sicker people who really needed coverage. And this would send the individual insurance market in these states into a ""death spiral"" where an ever-dwindling pool of people were buying coverage at ever-higher rates. Carvin struggled to respond to Kennedy's strong articulation of the problem. He tried to argue that by Kennedy's reasoning, even the Medicaid part of the Affordable Care Act that was left after the court's elimination of the nationwide expansion was unconstitutional, because coverage is being denied to poor people in the states that rejected the expansion. But again, Kennedy wasn't just saying that the coercion problem with the subsidies was that states that refused them would be denying their residents a financial benefit--he was noting that denying them would send their individual health insurance markets into a tailspin. Carvin failed to address that. Kennedy left Carvin with some reason for hope, noting, ""It may well be that you're correct as to these words [""established by the State""], and there's nothing we can do. I understand that."" And there was plenty to give the law's supporters disquiet. Roberts' portentous silence left no sign as to where he was leaning on the case. And there was Justice Antonin Scalia's scorn for the government's defense, despite the fact that he has in the past argued strongly for siding with administrative interpretations of ambiguous statutes, and argued that textual readings of laws should be ""holistic"" and ""contextual"" instead of ""wooden"" and ""literal."" The ultimate wooden and literal reading of the Affordable Care Act would be seizing on a few words to upend the law, thereby throwing millions of Americans off of health coverage and wreaking havoc in the health insurance market. But it appears as if that's just fine with Scalia. The millions depending on the law for their coverage will likely need to depend on another justice to retain the economic security they have gained under Obamacare. That's not ideal from the standpoint of many liberals, since it will only add to legal precedents favoring states' rights, which have so often been used to undermine liberal goals--as happened with the Medicaid expansion. But at this point, the law's supporters will take what they can get to move the president's signature legislative achievement past the legal assassins."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/king_v_burwell_why_anthony_kennedy_might_spare_obamacare_to_defend_a_conservative.html	"Something rather amazing happened during Wednesday's Supreme Court oral arguments over King v. Burwell. The basics of the case are pretty straightforward. The challengers maintain that the law limits federal subsidies to health care exchanges ""established by the State,"" which is to say exchanges operated by state governments, not those operated by the federal government. The Obama administration maintains that this interpretation is absurd, as the context of the law makes it clear that federal subsidies were meant to flow to every eligible person buying insurance on an exchange, whether that exchange is operated by a state government or the feds. This is important because only 13 states and the District of Columbia have actually set up their own exchanges. If the Supreme Court sides with the challengers, every other state will either have to set up its own exchange or Congress will have to pass legislation to keep the subsidies flowing or, well, a lot of people who were banking on subsidies will discover that they can no longer afford their insurance. Plenty of people much smarter than I am have weighed in on which of these arguments makes more sense. In the spirit of full disclosure, I will say that I find the challengers' arguments more convincing. But that's not really what I'm here to discuss. I'm here to discuss that aforementioned amazing thing. Before Wednesday's oral arguments, most observers expected Justice Anthony Kennedy, a moderate conservative who occasionally sides with the liberal justices, particularly on social issues, to join his fellow right-wingers in cheering on the challengers. Instead, he threw a curveball. He suggested that if the challengers are right, Congress passed a law that said to states, in effect: If you don't set up an exchange, we will force your citizens to buy expensive insurance without giving them the financial assistance they'd need to afford it. As Kennedy explained in an exchange with Michael Carvin, the plaintiffs' lawyer, ""if your argument is accepted, the states are being told either create your own exchange, or we'll send your insurance market into a death spiral."" To put his point more colorfully, if the plaintiffs are right, the deal on offer would be the equivalent of the federal government putting a gun to a state's head and saying, Either you establish an exchange or I'll shoot. So it seems Kennedy, the wishy-washy quasi-conservative, might side with the liberals for a very conservative reason: because to not do so would be to endorse federal bullying of state governments. I can't say where Kennedy will come down on King v. Burwell. Justice Antonin Scalia, a leading light among the conservative justices, seemed to suggest that Kennedy's concerns weren't really relevant, as the challengers could be right and Congress may have passed a law that is unconstitutionally coercive; to accept the challengers' argument isn't necessarily to embrace this brand of coercion. Perhaps Kennedy will wind up following Scalia's lead on this point. What I can say is that if Kennedy's view becomes widely accepted, if the court begins to consistently define federal coercion of state governments as constitutionally suspect, well, we're going to have to rethink the entire way the federal government has been doing business since the Great Society. The reason Kennedy brought up this issue of federal coercion is that in the 2012 case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court found that Congress overstepped its bounds when it required that states that wanted to keep their existing Medicaid programs intact would have to agree to the new Medicaid expansion. The Supreme Court didn't do away with the Medicaid expansion, however--it just said that the federal government couldn't threaten states that refused to expand the program with the withdrawal of all existing federal Medicaid funds. Yet this seemingly small tweak had a huge effect. Many states, particularly Republican-led states, have refused to accept the Medicaid expansion. Had they faced a choice between accepting the expansion and losing all of their federal Medicaid funds, it's a safe bet that there would be far fewer holdouts. Making the Medicaid expansion truly (not just theoretically) optional is no doubt a big part of why Obamacare has failed to expand coverage as much as its backers had hoped. But wait a second. If threatening states with the withdrawal of all of their federal Medicaid funds if they refuse to expand Medicaid is impermissible, what kinds of federal coercion are permissible? In 1984, for example, President Reagan signed into law the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which held that states either raise their drinking age to 21 or have a tenth of their federal highway construction dollars stripped from them. Back in February, Jeff Guo of the Washington Post explored whether or not the federal government's coercion on the drinking age could be rolled back for the same reasons the original terms of the Medicaid expansion were softened. The law professors he consulted, including Samuel R. Bagenstos of the University of Michigan Law School, an influential liberal legal scholar, dismissed the idea on the grounds that the ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was about the unprecedented nature of stripping Medicaid funds. The Supreme Court has had no problem in the past with denying states a small chunk of federal highway money, which represents a fairly small share of state budgets. Federal Medicaid funds, by contrast, represent a huge and growing share of total state budgets. Once you take those dollars away, states will find themselves in a serious bind. So Bagenstos' point that the Medicaid expansion is different, which he makes at greater length in a 2012 paper on what he calls the Supreme Court's new ""anti-leveraging principle,"" is certainly not crazy. Yet as he acknowledges, it's not the only way to interpret NFIB v. Sebelius either. What if a future Supreme Court did find the National Minimum Drinking Age Act excessively coercive, or if it found that the No Child Left Behind Act couldn't strip state governments of federal education dollars if they refused to play ball with various federal requirements? Forget the Supreme Court--what if a new generation of conservative lawmakers took the threat of federal coercion seriously? We might return to an older model of federalism, in which the federal government stuck to its own lane while leaving states to stick to theirs. No more would the federal government bully (or bribe) state governments into doing its bidding. This wouldn't necessarily mean that the federal government would get out of the business of making health care more accessible. But instead of coercing state governments to run their Medicaid programs in line with federal wishes, it could simply make Medicaid a completely federal program, leaving states to focus on other matters, like education and transportation, where the feds could get completely out of the way. The same President Reagan who signed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act once floated the idea of a ""Great Swap"" in which the federal government would take sole responsibility for Medicaid while the states took over various other programs, a deal that state governments that now find themselves overwhelmed by Medicaid spending would kill for. A deal along these lines would bring us much closer to the original founding vision, in which the federal government was limited in its powers while states were limited primarily by the threat of competition from other, better-governed states. Conservatives will be furious if Kennedy sides with the Obama administration in King v. Burwell. Yet he just might have given them the playbook for restoring constitutional government and competitive federalism."	Will Kennedy Save Obamacare?

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/hillary_clinton_private_email_scandal_no_one_gives_the_clintons_the_benefit.html	"On Monday night, the New York Times dropped a bomb: As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton didn't use her government email address. She didn't even have one. Her entire correspondence--from notes to staff to talks with diplomats--was done by private email. ""Her aides,"" notes the Times, ""took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act."" According to one former official for the National Archives, Jason Baron, this was an extraordinary act of rule breaking. ""It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario--short of nuclear winter--where an agency would be justified in allowing its Cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business,"" he said. It didn't take much to see the danger. Transparency aside, if Clinton was working with an unencrypted email address, she may have put a whole host of official communications at risk of foreign surveillance. And politically, it seems to stand as one more example of Clinton's secrecy and furtiveness. It's why, at the Washington Post, Chris Cillizza declared, ""This is a bad story for her and her presidential campaign because it reinforces many things people already don't like about the Clintons."" Or does it? For as much as this is grist for Hillary critics, on closer examination, the Times bomb was a dud. As per the story, at least one of Clinton's recent predecessors, Colin Powell, also used personal email to conduct official business. But this wasn't a particular problem, which raises an important question: What were the rules when Clinton entered office as secretary of state? If the regulations for email preservation changed before 2009--or during her tenure--her use of private email looks terrible. But if the rules weren't in place--if they postdate her time at the State Department--then this isn't as serious as it looks. In the Wall Street Journal, we learn the answer is in Clinton's favor. When she began as secretary of state in 2009, email wasn't a part of federal recordkeeping rules. Later that year, this changed when the National Archives and Records Administration issued regulations ""allowing employees to do official business on nonofficial email accounts,"" as long as they preserved records in ""the appropriate agency recordkeeping system."" The next round of guidance came in September 2013, well after Clinton had left the State Department. In those rules, writes the Journal, the National Archives ""said federal employees generally shouldn't use personal email accounts to conduct official business, except in limited situations, such as during emergencies when an official may not be able to access an official account."" And to that point, Secretary of State John Kerry, confirmed that year, is the first secretary to conduct all of his work over official email. The actual law for email and federal records changed in 2014 by way of the Federal Records Act, which required government agencies to preserve records--including email--documenting the ""organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions."" What's more, the fact of its comprehensiveness serves as an incentive for officials to use government email--if you're in the system, you don't have to work hard to keep records. All of this should help Clinton; she didn't break the law, she had precedent, and at most, she was slow to comply with 2009-era rules about storage and archiving. But it won't. Not because journalists are all out for the presumptive Democratic nominee, but because even if she didn't break the letter of the law, she certainly ignored its spirit. Look at this story again. Clinton didn't just use a private email account because it was convenient, she specifically registered a new email domain--clintonemail.com--a week before her confirmation hearings. Rules or not, odds are good she wanted to avoid as much transparency as possible, hence her slow move to comply with guidance from five years ago. As one conservative analyst said on Twitter (in somewhat uncharitable terms), ""[Clinton] simply valued total and complete control over her image and information with such paranoid fervor that the law was [a] secondary issue."" The problem is that this doesn't work. Far from protecting her fortunes, Clinton's secrecy will harm them. By refusing to share information, even when it's innocuous, Clinton loses the benefit of the doubt. And instead of stopping scandals, she makes them worse, turning small issues into frenzies of comment and condemnation. If, from 2009 to the end of 2012, Clinton had her eye on the presidency, then she should have been more open with her communications; she should have worked harder to comply with the rules as they stood. No, the heightened scrutiny isn't fair: Together, the Clintons have dealt with a lifetime's worth of bogus scandals. Despite this, the political world is loath to give either a chance before assuming the worst. But deserved or not, those are the breaks.

The best response--the only response--is to do better: to be more open and transparent than all of her competitors.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/jeb_bush_turns_on_the_u_s_export_import_bank.html	"Jeb Bush has been adamant that he will not switch his positions on two issues, immigration and Common Core standards, that will generate conservative opposition in the Republican primaries. But he just made a major concession to conservatives on another issue of great importance to many of them--he came out against the U.S. Export-Import Bank. And this new position of Bush's is not just hard to reconcile with his politics--it's hard to reconcile with his own business career. Over the past few years, many conservatives have seized on the Ex-Im Bank as a glaring example of crony capitalism, and they will oppose its reauthorization when it comes up in June. They say the bank, which aids exporters by guaranteeing loans for foreign buyers of U.S. products, mainly aids giants like Boeing, GE, and Caterpillar, and, under proper accounting standards, is running a 10-year deficit of $2 billion, on top of its operating costs. The bank's supporters argue that it is helping a vast array of smaller businesses as well, and that it is essentially self-financing, at minimal cost to U.S. taxpayers. The relatively obscure institution--which was founded in 1934 and whose leadership is appointed by the president--has become a major point of contention on the right, with groups like the Club for Growth and the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity coming out against it while the traditional business lobby, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, supports it. Jeb Bush would, at first blush, seem to be in the latter camp. He is a staunch internationalist and trade advocate (his first job was working for a U.S. bank in Caracas), and his views on other issues that are dividing conservatives, such as immigration and education, put him squarely on the side of the business lobby rather than with the populists. He hasn't said much on the record about the bank in the past few years, but if he has long thought it was worthless, he had a strange way of showing it: He helped get April Foley--the wife of his high school classmate Tom Foley, a private equity manager, former ambassador to Ireland, and two-time candidate for Connecticut governor--named as vice chairman of the bank during his brother's presidential administration. But at this past weekend's Club for Growth conference in Palm Beach, Florida, Bush came out against the Ex-Im Bank, to the delight of his hosts, when asked about it and other government subsidies for the private sector. ""I think most of these things should be phased out,"" Bush said. ""Ex-Im is a smaller one. ... We should find ways to lessen the contingent liability of the federal government."" Michael A. Needham, head of Heritage Action for America, the political arm of the conservative think tank now led by former Sen. Jim DeMint, told the Washington Post that he was ""ecstatic"" to see Bush come out against the bank. ""I think he needs to address the perception people have that he's maybe a little too tight with the business community and favoritism culture of Washington, D.C.,"" Needham said. Left unmentioned in the reception of Bush's turn against the bank was a highly relevant fact from his own background: One of Bush's most lucrative ventures in the business world was a partnership that relied heavily on Ex-Im financing. In 1988, as his father was in the process of moving from the vice presidency to the Oval Office, Bush branched out from the real-estate development work he'd been doing in Miami to go into business with David Eller, the head of a Deerfield Beach, Florida, manufacturer of water pumps called MWI Corp. The two men formed a partnership called Bush-El Corp. to market MWI's pumps overseas. Some of the sales abroad were financed with the help of the Ex-Im bank, including the partnership's most successful deal, by far: a 1992 agreement to sell pumps to Nigeria that was financed with $74.3 million from Ex-Im. Bush has for years sought to distance himself from that deal--not because of any pejorative association with the bank, but because the deal itself came under scrutiny. A former MWI vice president, Robert Purcell, sued in 1996, alleging that the Bush-Eller partnership had diverted profits from MWI. As the Tampa Bay Times and others have reported, that suit was settled in 1998, just days before Bush was to give a sworn statement in the case and one month before he was to be on the ballot for governor. But Purcell also filed a federal whistleblower lawsuit, alleging that MWI had defrauded the government to secure Ex-Im financing by concealing that the company would provide $28 million in ""commissions"" to its Nigerian sales agent, Alhaji Mohammed Indimi, now an oil baron and one of the richest men in Africa. The FBI launched a criminal investigation into the Nigerian deal, which never came to anything. But the Justice Department did take up the whistleblower suit in 2002, and last year, a federal jury in Washington found MWI liable for misleading the government and not reporting that the ""commissions"" went toward luxury cars, mansions, and a golf expedition for Indimi. Bush, who was not implicated in the federal trial, has for years played down his role in the Nigeria deal. He has said he had nothing to do with securing Ex-Im financing for Bush-El deals abroad. And he has said he did not receive any commission from the Nigeria deal, to avoid any perception of conflict with his father serving as president. Bush ""has answered questions and refuted inaccurate claims made regarding this case multiple times. Nothing alleges any wrongdoing by Bush-El or that Bush-El was even involved in this transaction,"" Bush spokeswoman Jaryn Emhof told the Tampa Bay Times in 2013. ""While a marketing agent for MWI/Bush-El, he received no commissions from any sales by MWI to any countries (including Nigeria) in which Ex-Im Bank government financing was involved."" But the fact is that Bush did make two trips to Nigeria prior to the deal's finalization--in 1989 and 1991. On the first one, he was feted in stupendously grand fashion with a parade of 1,300 horses and tens of thousands of people lining the road to welcome the president's son. And the Tampa Bay Times obtained a marketing video MWI made for Nigeria around the time of that first visit, in which Eller declares that his company has the ""support at the highest levels of our own government,"" accompanied by a picture of Eller smiling besides Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. ""In fact ... George Bush's son will be coming to Nigeria with us for the inauguration of our factory,"" Eller says, ""and we're very proud of that, and it shows that our government is very interested in what we're doing in Nigeria and very supportive."" As for Bush's claim not to have received any commissions from deals financed by the Ex-Im bank, the fact is that his role in the partnership proved quite lucrative--he reported $648,000 in income from it until he ended it in time for his first run for governor, in 1994--and the Nigeria deal was, by far, the most successful of that stretch for MWI, amounting to four times its average annual sales. One would, essentially, have to take Bush at his word that there was no connection between his lucrative cut from the partnership and MWI's biggest deal during that stretch. And just this past weekend, the Naples Daily News reported that former employees of MWI have asserted in recent interviews with the newspaper and in past interviews with federal authorities that Bush had earned far more than the $648,000 he reported from the partnership, and that he did in fact get a substantial cut from the Nigeria deal. Bush's current spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment, and Eller has declined my request for an interview about the partnership. The Club for Growth and Chamber of Commerce also declined to comment on Bush's turn against the Ex-Im Bank. But we can be pretty confident that we'll be hearing more about this on the campaign trail--Nigerian horses and all--as Bush's primary opponents make sure voters find out about his lucrative work for a partnership that relied so heavily on the Ex-Im Bank he says he now opposes."

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/john_boehner_s_dhs_funding_disaster_could_the_house_speaker_be_ousted.html	"While most of the GOP-watching world (your correspondent included) spent the last 24 hours zeroed in on the antics at CPAC--Donald Trump said some things! The Duck Dynasty guy said some things! There were millennials!--Capitol Hill offered its own drama. On Friday night, at the last possible moment, Congress managed to squeak through legislation to keep the Department of Homeland Security funded. But don't worry if you missed it; the compromise is just a weeklong patch, which means we may very well have a replay of the same drama in seven short days. More importantly, the funding-fight fiasco could lead to a major political casualty: John Boehner's speakership. If that happens (and admittedly, it's a very big if), Boehner would be the second member of the House Republican Leadership to be dethroned in less than 10 months, and it would indicate that some public policy differences within the Republican party are lethally irreconcilable. ""The Speaker has the strong support of the overwhelming majority of House Republicans--and he's not going anywhere,"" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel in an email. Even though the possibility still seems remote, the fact that we're even talking about it is telling, and it's a significant indicator of how fraught the GOP's divide over immigration has become. Here's how we got here: Last summer, a few months before the midterm elections, President Obama promised to take unilateral executive action that would defer deportations and provide work authorization for millions of immigrants living in the country illegally. The idea was immediately controversial and didn't poll particularly well, and some vulnerable Democrats representing red states persuaded the president to postpone the move until after the November elections. Republicans pounced. The president's plans gave them a rare moment of near-total unity on the immigration issue, and his timing couldn't have been more opportune. Many Republican candidates made opposition to the president's move the centerpiece of their campaigns, Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus promised Tea Party activists that the party would fight it tooth and nail, and the GOP proceeded to coast to historic wins. A few weeks later, the president announced that his executive action was going full steam ahead. So if Boehner and his fellow Hill Republicans were to cave on the fight over the president's executive action--whatever ""cave"" actually means in this situation--then many grassroots activists would feel cheated and deeply betrayed. This brings us to the question of DHS funding. Many on the Hill have argued that the best way to nip the president's executive action in the bud is to do so by using legislation that funds the DHS to prevent it from implementing the president's policy. Hiccup: Democrats filibustered that kind of legislation in the Senate (you can read more at Politico), so the upper chamber instead passed a bill to fund the DHS, sans caveats, for just a week. And at basically the last second on Friday night, the House passed the same legislation and the president signed it. So DHS lives to be funded another day. Before that happened, though, Boehner faced an excruciating defeat. He tried to pass a bill that would have funded the department for three weeks, but failed to get it through the House when dozens of Republicans defected. The Hill dubbed the defeat ""humiliating."" Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, who was with Boehner on that vote, told Huffington Post that the loss was ""a tough, tough, significant, emotional event for our conference right now."" So there's no dearth of emotions and sharp feelings among House Republicans at the moment. And CNN reported that if Boehner allows a vote on a bill to fund the DHS without blocking the president's action, then conservative representatives may move to vacate the chair, which would threaten his speakership. Professor Larry Larmer of the University of Wisconsin-Extension writes that, ""When the chair is vacated, the chairperson's rights of participation are the same as those of any other member."" ""Upon vacating, the chairperson is not permitted to resume the duties of presiding until the issue pending at the time of vacating is no longer before the group,"" Larmer continued. It's not the kind of parliamentary procedure that gets whipped out every day, and CNN didn't elaborate on how a motion to vacate the chair could remove Boehner from the speakership. Parliamentarian Nancy Sylvester defines vacating the chair as ""To temporarily relinquish the chair so that the presiding officer can participate in debate."" Republican Rep. Charlie Dent, who was a vocal critic of the Tea Party tactics used during the October 2013 shutdown, isn't having it. He leveled pointed criticism at his colleagues via CNN. ""I think a lot of people better get serious about governing and it's time for all of these, you know D.C. games to end,"" he said. ""I mean all these palace coups or whatever the hell is going on around here has to end, and we have to get down to the business of governing."" We'll see how that goes next week."

Scott Walker said he wasn't going to take the media's bait. But his challenge isn't avoiding taking the bait--it's avoiding becoming the chum. After speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Walker soon found himself at the center of a feeding frenzy over an answer he gave about what he would do to stop the advance of ISIS. At the end of a long response to a question about the terrorist group, Walker said, ""If I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the globe."" This answer was panned from the Talking Points Memo on the left to National Review on the right. By the next morning, Walker's competitor Texas Gov. Rick Perry said it was ""innapropriate"" for Walker to have compared the Madison, Wisconsin, protesters to the extremist jihadists of ISIS. ""These are Americans,"" said Perry. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka took umbrage: ""Governor Walker's statement comparing workers and terrorists is revolting. It is clear that Governor Walker's judgment is impaired, and that he is not qualified for the Presidency."" Gov. Walker didn't compare protesters to terrorists.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/why_it_s_hard_for_republican_presidential_candidates_to_talk_about_income.html	"None of the Republicans running for president has an agenda for fighting income inequality. But they do have a word for talking about it--opportunity. Jeb Bush says that ""the opportunity gap is the defining issue of our time,"" and that ""more Americans are stuck at their income levels than ever before."" ""This should alarm you,"" he said at a meeting of the Detroit Economic Club earlier this month. ""It has alarmed me."" Likewise, explained Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in a January meeting with wealthy donors in California, ""income inequality is a symptom of a bigger problem: opportunity inequality."" The problem, he said, was that you couldn't get to the middle class with traditional work. ""There are jobs out there that will allow you to get there. But you have to have skills and you have to have a system that allows people to access that."" And during the same event, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz echoed the opportunity talk: ""The men and women who are gathered here I believe are patriots who love this country and who fear for the direction for their kids and grandkids and they are fighting for an environment where there is more growth and more opportunity in the future."" As rhetoric goes, this works! Presidential elections don't turn on policy, and Republicans don't need anti-inequality programs as much as they need to cloak an existing agenda of tax cuts and deregulation in the language of mobility and opportunity. It worked for George W. Bush and ""compassionate conservatism,"" and there's no reason it can't work next year for the eventual Republican nominee. Then again, Bush had the advantage of a unified GOP and a fast-growing economy. He could talk about conservative compassion without pushback from hyper-ideological governors or Tea Party congressmen. Today's ""opportunity"" conservatives aren't so lucky. Their language isn't bolstered by their party as much as it's undermined by a whole constellation of policies and rhetorical choices. Take Congress. On Wednesday, during a hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee, Republicans accused Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen of political bias. Her offense? Talking about income inequality. Last October she gave a speech stating--in dry, wonky language--that income inequality was growing and that it is a problem. Republicans thought that kind of talk was unacceptable. ""You're sticking your nose in places you have no business to be,"" said South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney to the woman responsible for stewarding the $17 trillion American economy. It's not that there's a rule or norm against speaking on politically sensitive topics when you're head of the Federal Reserve, it's that many Republicans aren't concerned with income inequality, and see the issue as a stalking horse for liberal expansion of government. To them, Yellen is speaking as a partisan Democrat, out to advance the administration's mission. But for as much as it runs counter to what Bush, Rubio, and Cruz are trying to do, this kind of heated rhetoric is less damaging to ""opportunity"" talk than the recent state-level push to slash higher-education budgets and raise taxes on the poor. In Kansas, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback is still trying to fill the hole caused by massive tax cuts for the rich. Unwilling to go back on his anti-tax convictions, Brownback has called for a $45 million cut to public education, including funds to colleges and universities. The same is true of both Gov. Bobby Jindal in Louisiana and Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin; the two presidential candidates would rather cut $300 million from state colleges and universities than raise taxes on the highest earners. And in Maine, South Carolina, and Ohio, Republicans have cut state income taxes only to compensate with new fees and higher sales taxes, yanking cash from low-income Americans who spend most of their paychecks on goods and services. By siphoning income from the poorest residents while lessening the burden on the most affluent (in the name of ""growth""), these policies do nothing but worsen income inequality and increase class stratification. It's not that this undermines the substance of Republican presidential policies--which will hew closely to the agenda of GOP states and legislatures--as much as it makes it hard to elide the consequences of those policies. No, voters aren't wonks, but they can see what works and what doesn't. It's much harder to tout your tax and spending cuts as engines of prosperity or ladders to opportunity when there are real and recent examples of what happens when you slash revenue for the sake of upward redistribution. There's no doubt Republican presidential candidates will keep talking about income inequality. In the absence of a sluggish economy, their best bet is to try to claim the territory for themselves rather than cede ground to Democrats. By itself, that's a tall order. It's much, much harder when an entire chunk of your party is trying to make the problem worse."

ISIS and Ukraine have been taking up most of my attention lately, but as always, I've made time to see what my colleagues are up to. Here's what I've been reading this week. While very different in content, two of this week's best pieces also featured some gorgeous art and design: I've been listening to John Luther Adams' Become Ocean a lot over the past few months so I was really excited to read his meditation on making music in the Anthropocene. And whether he's untangling Middle East alliances or Travoltifying your name, Chris Kirk's interactives are consistently some of the most distinctive and memorable content on Slate so I loved reading about his journey into the heart of coding darkness in an attempt to build a better email client. (The revelation that there's a ""Slate Millennial"" Slack channel made me feel old for a few days--until Ali Griswold restored my smugness about not using Venmo.) The culture team kicked into overdrive during the Oscars with a plethora of content that I frankly enjoyed a lot more than the actual event. (For that matter, I also enjoy listening to June and Seth talk about Downton Abbey a lot more than I enjoy Downton Abbey these days.) I especially liked Dana Stevens' reflection on the career of Julianne Moore. No way am I clicking that video clip of Safe though--I saw that movie 10 years ago and am still creeped out. Slate superfans should also check out Dan Kois' Genius-annotated version of his Boyhood piece for a revealing look at how your Slate sausage gets made. I love to see writers smartly countering the outrage herds, as in Torie Bosch's argument that Keith Olbermann wasn't entirely wrong about her alma mater, Penn State. Speaking of highly unsympathetic public figures who are frustratingly correct in one particular case, read Mark Joseph Stern on why Washington football team owner Dan Snyder has a legitimate first amendment case against the U.S. patent office. Slate also delved into some frustratingly undercovered political debates this week. Jamelle Bouie looked at some of the cynical upcoming attempts to restrict voting access while Leon Neyfakh poured some cold water on hopes of an emerging bipartisan consensus on criminal justice reform. That's it for now. Whether you're spending your weekend smoking (sort of) legal weed, watching Robin Hood: Men in Tights before it disappears from Netflix, staring at the airport carpet, or combining those activities, I hope you'll also make time to catch up on your Slate reading.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/why_fox_isn_t_willing_to_fire_him_like_glenn_beck.html	"For a while it looked like Bill O'Reilly could be finished at Fox News. The year was 2009, and O'Reilly's star had been overshadowed by a larger ball of gas: Glenn Beck, whose eponymous television show launched on Fox that January and soon became the most talked-about news program in America. With his chalkboards and conspiratorial ramblings, Beck captured the Tea Party zeitgeist, and left The O'Reilly Factor in an unfamiliar position of comparative irrelevance. Then Beck went supernova. Advertisers started to desert his program, realizing that the ""paranoid goldbug"" demographic was one they could do without. Beck had conflicts with Fox executives. ""Beck trashes Republicans every night,"" Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes told the Daily Beast in November 2010. ""I've said to him, 'Where the hell are you going to get your audience if you keep this up? You're trashing everyone.'"" Beck left Fox News in June 2011. Bill O'Reilly returned to dominance. The story of Glenn Beck's tenure at Fox News--especially its sudden end--is worth remembering now, as O'Reilly faces accusations of exaggerating the dangers he faced while a foreign correspondent for CBS in the early 1980s, among other alleged distortions. It's OK when your grandfather exaggerates the details of his wartime experiences; it's not OK when a journalist does it. And yet O'Reilly's job appears to be in no danger. Fox News has issued a statement asserting that ""Ailes and all senior management are in full support of Bill O'Reilly."" Far from apologizing, O'Reilly has gone on the offensive and attacked the character of the Mother Jones and Media Matters reporters who have covered the story. On Monday, O'Reilly's program attracted 3.3 million viewers, its highest ratings of the year. This isn't the first time O'Reilly has faced charges that might have dimmed a lesser light. In 2004, for instance, one of his producers accused him of sexual harassment. Then, as now, O'Reilly did not apologize; then, as now, Fox News stood behind him. It's hard to imagine Beck would have won similar support from the network if he, too, had faced allegations of exaggeration and sexual harassment. For one thing, Beck was relatively unpopular within the network, with some Fox employees fearing that Beck's paranoid rantings undermined the credibility of Fox's news reporting. The lesson here: From Fox News' perspective, it's OK to be a boorish, bullying fabulist. It's not OK to be weird. When news networks decide whether to discipline errant employees, they do so primarily in order to protect their brands. That's why NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams was so swiftly punished after being hit with similar charges earlier this month. The Nightly News is a straightforward news program, and the network, presumably concerned about the effect the scandal would have on Williams' and the broadcast's journalistic credibility, responded by suspending the anchor without pay for six months. Being accused of fabulism by liberal news outlets like Mother Jones and Media Matters doesn't harm O'Reilly's credibility, because O'Reilly's credibility is dependent on exploiting a sense of victimization among his audience. Much of the Fox News demographic is composed of people who feel that they're under attack by unscrupulous liberals. So when it appears that a host comes under attack by unscrupulous liberals, that serves to reinforce their existing worldview. The first thought isn't Bill O'Reilly is a liar. It's The world is out to get Bill O'Reilly. And if the world is out to get you, then of course you're going to fight back. Brian Williams apologized to America. O'Reilly took the opposite approach, choosing to malign the Mother Jones reporters who first raised the questions, and casting himself as a victim in a liberal conspiracy. But there's a difference between insinuating some vague liberal conspiracy, as O'Reilly does, and attempting to unravel the details of that conspiracy, as Beck did. It's impossible to sustain the latter without eventually starting to seem crazy. Beck's flirtations with fringe ideas suggest a place most people--and most advertisers--would, in the end, rather not go. They damaged the Fox News brand. O'Reilly's apparent exaggerations haven't done that yet, but there's still time. As Jeremy Stahl has already noted in Slate, ""the case against O'Reilly is more open to interpretation"" than the case against Brian Williams, and O'Reilly will remain unassailable as long as that gray area continues to exist. The most damaging allegation, to me, is one first raised by the writer Jefferson Morley and since advanced by Media Matters, challenging O'Reilly's claim that he was on the scene when George de Mohrenschildt--a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald's who claimed to have inside information on the Kennedy assassination--shot and killed himself in 1977. De Mohrenschildt lived in Florida. Some of O'Reilly's old colleagues have said that O'Reilly was in Dallas at the time of de Mohrenschildt's death. If these charges hold up, then it will be hard to explain away O'Reilly's story as a simple misunderstanding. O'Reilly will have just straight-up lied. And if more stories like this emerge, Fox might be forced to discipline O'Reilly; one would think there has to come a point where the sheer number of allegations against him becomes too big to ignore. Or maybe not. According to the New York Times, O'Reilly's show earned more than $100 million in advertising dollars last year. When Beck left Fox in 2011, his show was attracting Z-list commercials from places like SeniorPeopleMeet.com. O'Reilly will survive as long as his advertisers stick with him, and if his advertisers have stuck with him this long, you have to think they're comfortable with bombast, resentment, and charges that are open to interpretation."

The New Jersey governor was considered too moderate and a member of the Republican establishment. This year he addressed the gathering of conservative activists and raised his profile by attacking the establishment candidate. ""If the elites in Washington who make backroom deals decide who the next president is going to be, then he's definitely going to be the front-runner,"" Christie said, referring to Jeb Bush. He was responding to a question posed by talk-radio host Laura Ingraham who hasn't always been a Christie fan. When Christie collaborated with President Obama on disaster relief after Hurricane Sandy, she said he was swooning so much it was likely he would become a Democrat. But Ingraham is also no fan of Jeb Bush, so she set up the tee and placed the ball waist high in a Thursday question-and-answer session for Christie in front of the CPAC crowd. It's more evidence of just how much difference an election cycle can make. During the 2012 campaign, it was Christie who was invited to private meetings at exclusive establishment enclaves where prominent Republicans pleaded with him to save the party from what they thought would be a disastrous Mitt Romney campaign. Now establishment donors and wise men are showering Bush with affection and campaign contributions. On Thursday, Christie pitched himself repeatedly as a man of the people, someone who was willing to stand up for regular folks and fight for them. He turned a question on immigration into an opportunity to praise ""hardworking people"" struggling in America. In response to a question about Bush's immigration remarks in which he had praised immigrants for their entrepreneurial character, Christie accused politicians of caring too much about what ""they say on the editorial page of the New York Times and Washington Post."" Free of the burden of being the establishment's darling, Christie also sought to exorcise his White House ties. Asked about the time he told a constituent to ""sit down and shut up,"" Christie didn't shy away, saying some people needed to hear just that advice. When the audience reacted positively, he said the Obama White House needed to hear that order. The audience reacted favorably. Christie's media strategy also seems to have evolved. For much of his early career as governor, Christie had a good relationship with the press. He was a favorite Republican of New York producers and editors in much the way Rudy Giuliani was after 9/11. When that relationship started to spoil during the fracas over the George Washington Bridge delays, Christie blamed the liberal press. He worked that theme again Thursday, echoing a strategy that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has put to great effect recently. Walker has repeatedly leaned into the press corps for posing gotcha questions that reveal nothing. Ahead of CPAC, Walker penned an op-ed in USA Today saying he wasn't going to take the media's bait. Many of the candidates appearing on the first day of CPAC brought a rhetorical straw man on stage they could wallop repeatedly. Carly Fiorina slammed Hillary Clinton again and again. Sen. Ted Cruz did a few flying kicks into the Republican establishment dummy. Christie brought a giant New York Times punching bag. Asked about the bad press he had received--most recently over a state judge's ruling that he had broken a law by cutting $1.57 billion from a promised payment to the pension system for public employees--Christie used the paper as a foil. ""When you do things like I've done in New Jersey--take on special interests,"" he said, ""they just want to kill you."" At the end, when asked what he'd given up for Lent, the governor said he'd told his priest that he'd given up the New York Times. But his priest replied that didn't count, because you have to give up something you'll actually miss."

The charge has the ring of truth when it comes to energy and environmental matters, given how much the Obama administration has sought to circumvent Republicans with regulation and executive orders in that arena, most notably with the rules announced last year limiting carbon emissions from existing power plants. But there is a reason that Obama has chosen to go it alone on energy: The GOP's utter refusal to reckon with the reality of climate change has left him no choice. And if anyone doubts the extent of that refusal, consider what happened Wednesday at a routine joint hearing of two House Energy and Commerce subcommittees. The hearing was being held to take testimony on the Environmental Protection Agency's budget request from agency chief Gina McCarthy, the no-nonsense Bostonian who worked in Mitt Romney's administration in Massachusetts. For two and a half hours, McCarthy absorbed a barrage of angry monologues and rhetorical questions from the committee's Republicans. Here are some of the highlights from Republican congressmen engaging with one of the most pressing issues of our time: 1. Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican and former chairman of the committee who is so close with the oil industry that he apologized to BP's CEO for the government daring to fine the company for the disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill, started off by telling McCarthy: ""I could really have some fun with you, but you're too nice a person."" He proceeded to have fun with her anyway, repeatedly demanding to know whether she had seen any actual signed documents from the president's agreement with the Chinese government to limit carbon emissions. His staff, he said, had told him that no such documents actually existed, an omission that he cast in conspiratorial tones. ""If it's a signed agreement, let's see it,"" he said. ""You don't just stand up and say, 'We have this agreement' and hug. What you have is a press release, a photo op."" McCarthy said that as she understood it, the agreement was a serious one at ""the highest levels of both countries ... expressing both of their commitments to this goal,"" regardless of whatever paperwork was signed. That didn't satisfy Barton. ""I can take you over to the National Archives and show you the signed Declaration of Independence. I can show you lots of documents that have signatures on them,"" he said. ""You and I can agree that I'm not going to go out and rob a bank. You can agree that you're not going to rob a bank. We can both hold a press conference: 'We've agreed that we're not going to rob a bank.' "" McCarthy was not sure where to go with that. Also unclear is whether she knew what Barton was referring to when he mentioned the ""Koyota Accord."" Presumably, he was referring to the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions, and not a new joint venture between Toyota and Kia. 2. Rep. David McKinley of West Virginia told McCarthy that she was, effectively, responsible for an epidemic of mental illness. ""I keep seeing the EPA putting in another regulation on top of another regulation,"" he said. ""What it's led, by these overregulation in rural America, it's led to people, their well-being, their mental health, is all being affected by it. I think we're having some depression in areas around the county because of the threats of regulation and what it's doing to jobs ... I really believe it's directly attributed to the regulatory body with it (sic)."" No mention of the other factors that are putting pressure on the coal industry in his district, such as the natural gas boom happening very nearby. In case you wondered, McKinley doesn't believe in man-made climate change. ""You continue to issue more regulations even though the models say it doesn't work with it,"" he told McCarthy. ""You have a model that says how [carbon dioxide] impacts the temperatures around the globe. We know from the standards that that doesn't work."" Oh? 3. Rep. Bill Johnson, representing the district just across the Ohio River from McKinley's in the Appalachian swath of southeastern Ohio, demanded to know why the EPA had not chosen Ohio for one of its public hearings on the new carbon emissions rules. McCarthy noted that it had held one in Pittsburgh, not far from his district. This wasn't good enough for Johnson--""How many coal mines are there in Pittsburgh?"" he asked--and he demanded that McCarthy come hold an event in his district ""and talk directly to the people who work in those coal mines and power plants and are likely to lose their jobs as a result of the EPA's action, your actions."" The invitation might have seemed more hospitable if it was not being shouted at her. ""Let me ask you: Will you meet with them? I will arrange my schedule so I can be there, to be there with you,"" he said. ""We've been reaching out all across the country,"" she said. Johnson: ""I'm asking you, will you come with me?"" McCarthy: ""Every state is asking me to go to their state."" Johnson: ""I'm asking you today, that's a simple question, yes or no, can I get with your team?"" He talked over her response. ""OK, I'm going to have my team reach out to your office to set up a meeting, because I'm going to take that as a yes."" She tried to answer again, to no avail. ""Will you come? You're not going to answer the question. It's clear why you left those folks out. But I'll set up the meeting."" Who said civility was dead in Washington? 4. Even the more cordial of the questioners made clear that they, too, weren't buying this whole anthropogenic climate change thing. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third-ranking Republican in the House, told McCarthy, ""I know the president loves talking about global warming--and they're canceling flights all around the country due to snow blizzards."" Rep. Larry Bucshon of Indiana opened his questions by saying, ""Climate is changing, it's always been changing for centuries, and reasonable people can continue to have a debate on the human impact on that."" The unfortunate thing about this spectacle was that it obscured some serious questions from a few Republicans--about challenges facing the nuclear industry or about the feasibility of the carbon dioxide capture-and-storage technology that the administration is placing great faith in. In a functioning Congress, a hearing between the energy committee and the EPA administrator would consist mostly of such substantive back and forth--a chance for legislators to engage directly with the executive branch, to challenge its assumptions, and to draw its attention to the reality of how policies are playing out in their districts. But this Congress simply can't summon such seriousness on climate change and energy policy. In the summer of 2009, the House passed cap-and-trade legislation to limit carbon emissions, but it fell short of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate to overcome a GOP filibuster. Since then, nothing. Rep. Ed Whitfield, the Kentucky Republican overseeing Wednesday's hearing, said that the ""cap-and-trade system was rejected by the Congress,"" only to have Obama ""[go] out and make international commitments"" on carbon emissions. But Rep. John Yarmuth, the only Democrat in Whitfield's Kentucky delegation, saw it another way. ""In fact,"" he said, cap and trade ""received a majority of votes in both the House and Senate and it was only killed because of Republicans in the Senate who filibustered that bill."" Then he zeroed in on the heart of the matter: ""Is it fair to say that if [cap and trade] had been enacted into law and not been stopped by Senate Republicans that we would not be involved with [the new carbon emissions rules] right now?"" ""In some ways, that might be the case,"" McCarthy replied. ""It might have impacted the choice considerably."" No might about it. If Congress had acted to address climate change, Obama would have signed the law and implemented it. Instead, Congress is still talking about planes canceled by ""snow blizzards."""

Now, three months after the 2014 Republican wave, another class of state lawmakers are prepping another assault on voting rights under the same guise of ""uniformity"" and ""ballot integrity."" In Georgia, reports Zachary Roth for MSNBC, Republicans are pushing a bill to slash early voting from the present maximum of 21 days to 12 days. The goal, says Rep. Ed Rydners, a sponsor of the proposal, is ""clarity and uniformity."" ""There were complaints of some voters having more opportunities than others,"" he said, ""This legislation offers equal access statewide."" If cities like Atlanta want to have more voting access, said Rydners, they could open more precincts and ""pay to have poll workers present."" In Missouri, this new push comes as a constitutional amendment overturning a 2006 ruling from the state Supreme Court, which struck down voter ID as illegal under the state's Constitution. Last Wednesday, notes Roth, the state's House of Representatives gave ""initial approval"" to two measures: ""One would put a constitutional amendment on the ballot asking voters to allow voter ID, and the other would implement the ID requirement, should the amendment pass."" The rationale? Voter fraud. ""It's not disenfranchising voters,"" says state Sen. Will Kraus, who sponsored the amendment. ""Voters who vote multiple times are diluting their vote."" In New Hampshire, according to a recent report from the Brennan Center for Justice, Republicans are aiming for a hat trick of voter restrictions. If signed into law, their bills would limit voter registration efforts and reduce other registration opportunities, make it harder for students to register and vote, and reduce the number of precincts open per voter, a move that would lengthen voting lines and make the process a greater chore for working people and others with difficult schedules. Likewise, per the Brennan Center, Mississippi Republicans are pursuing a bill that would ""decrease the likelihood that otherwise-eligible voters who cast provisional ballots will have their votes counted in the races for which they are eligible,"" and in Indiana, lawmakers have introduced measures to end automated straight-ticket voting and ""secure"" absentee ballots by requiring a voter identification number. ""I just think people need to take the time to learn about who they are voting for before going in rather than just pushing a button for straight party,"" said Rep. Milo Smith, chair of the Indiana House Elections Committee. ""I think that makes for a better election process."" It's always worth noting the scant evidence for these moves. In Missouri, for instance, the Brennan Center found only four cases of in-person voter fraud, for a ""documented fraud rate"" of 0.0003 percent. There is no problem to solve; the policy rationale for limiting registration drives or requiring photo identification--instead of a standard-issue registration card--doesn't exist. And if it did, there's no reason for a restrictive approach; automatic registration and free ID cards are just as effective as anything proposed by state and federal Republicans. Politically, however, there's a lot to gain from these laws. Every new barrier to voting makes it harder for the most marginal voters to get to the polls. And given the demographics of voting--the least frequent voters are poorer, browner, and less educated than their most frequent counterparts--it's in the Republican Party's interest to shrink the electorate as much as possible. It's the undeniable partisanship of new voter laws that explains the new ""right-to-vote"" plank in the platform of the Democratic National Committee. At its winter meeting last week, the DNC endorsed a constitutional amendment for the affirmative right to vote. ""The Democratic Party stands for inclusion, and we know that we are all better when everyone has a voice in the democratic process. The right to vote is a moral imperative, and I am proud to support this resolution,"" said DNC Vice Chair of Voter Expansion and Protection Donna Brazile in a statement. Readers with an eye toward the Constitution might say that we already have a right to vote. ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,"" says the 15th Amendment, ratified 145 years ago this month. There's also the 14th Amendment, which treats the individual right to vote as sacrosanct barring crime or rebellion. But notice the language. The 15th Amendment forbids governments from denying or abridging the right to vote on the basis of identity, but it says nothing about obstacles to exercising the franchise. And while the 24th Amendment forbids poll taxes and other racialized barriers to voting, the Constitution is mum on race-neutral disenfranchisement. Put differently, the Constitution allows voter suppression as long as it doesn't trip any of its race or gender wires. The goal of a right-to-vote amendment is to change the dynamic and place the burden on restrictionists. In a sense, it would make the pre-Holder v. Shelby Voting Rights Act a standard for the entire country. States and localities would have to make voting as accessible as possible, with a high standard for new barriers. And while the odds of winning a right-to-vote amendment are low--one reason Democrats should invest more effort in state elections--there's tremendous value in mobilizing around the issue. A movement for a right-to-vote amendment could encourage laws and norms that expand participation irrespective of an amendment in that direction. Think of it as a liberal counterpart to the ""personhood"" amendments used to mobilize anti-abortion conservatives around smaller--but just as potent--limits to abortion rights. Indeed, if she hasn't, Hillary Clinton should take notice of this DNC resolution. To win in 2016, Clinton will have to repeat Obama's performance with black Americans and other minorities. Building that enthusiasm won't be easy, but something like a right-to-vote proposal could help her start that fire."	The Next Attack on Voting Rights	['Clinton', 'Shelby']	['abortion']

The ground zero mosque. ISIS. Paris. Again and again, Republicans demand to know why President Obama won't name the enemy. They say he's too forgiving, too afraid of ideological conflict, too reluctant to wage all-out war, too eager to find people of good will on the other side. Maybe they're right. Maybe he should come out and say it: The GOP is trying to destroy him. Anyone who has watched Obama's genteel response to his Republican tormentors shouldn't be surprised at his delicacy about Islam. He resists generalizations and looks for common ground, whether the context is terrorism or domestic politics. No matter what Republicans do--heckle his speeches, impugn his patriotism, shut down the government, threaten a credit default, stage countless votes to repeal his health care law--he refuses to categorically condemn them. The classic Obama line is ""That's not just my opinion,"" followed by a bouquet to some Republican who thinks Obama is the devil. ""That's not just my opinion, that's John McCain's opinion,"" says Obama. Or: ""This isn't just my position. ... It's a position that's been taken by every Democratic and Republican president,"" including ""Ronald Reagan."" Or: ""That's not just my view; the majority of Republicans agree with that view."" Last fall, Republicans captured the Senate by running a nationwide campaign against Obama. But in his State of the Union address on Jan. 20, the president held out an olive branch. There isn't ""a liberal America or a conservative America,"" he argued. There's only ""a United States of America."" He acknowledged that pundits considered his bipartisan optimism naive. But he concluded, ""I still believe that we are one people."" Republicans responded with derision. When Obama said, ""I have no more campaigns to run,"" they applauded mockingly. He poked them right back, with a wink: ""I know, 'cause I won both of them."" But then he turned the other cheek: ""I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger."" The next day, Obama gave a shout-out to the former Republican lieutenant governor of Illinois, which, he noted, was the home of the first Republican president. At a speech in Kansas, Obama pleaded for unity: ""Whoever we are--Republican, Democrat ... we all share a common vision for our future."" In a Jan. 23 interview with Vox, Obama praised the Republican governors of Alaska, Michigan, and Ohio. On Feb. 1, Obama was asked in an NBC interview about the mockery of him during the State of the Union. He shrugged it off as good-natured ""ribbing"" and changed the subject: ""What I want us to focus on is the areas we have in common."" The next day, he sent his budget proposal to Congress. Republicans, determined to block his immigration agenda, were withholding money for the Department of Homeland Security. But Obama said these saboteurs didn't represent the true GOP: ""A large percentage of Republicans agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform."" Instead of using the fight for partisan advantage, Obama spread the blame to his own party. ""Republicans and Democrats in Congress should not be playing politics"" with the department's funding, he warned. On Feb. 6, Obama went to Indiana and lauded Dick Lugar, the state's former Republican senator. The next day, in his weekly radio address, he repeated: ""I'll work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, who wants to get to 'yes.' ... We should stop refighting old battles and start working together."" Even last Friday, in his speech to the Democratic National Committee, five of Obama's nine references to Republicans were positive. ""If Republicans are serious about taking on the specific challenges that face the middle class,"" he pleaded, ""we should welcome them."" That's how Obama treats his domestic adversaries. He doesn't take the bait. He doesn't define the whole opposition party by its worst elements. He rejects polarization. He emphasizes shared values. He reminds his own partisans that they, too, are sinners. For Democrats, this can be exasperating. It's especially exasperating when Republicans refuse to take responsibility for, or even disown, outbursts from their colleagues, such as Rep. Joe Wilson's ""You lie!"" or Rudy Giuliani's ""I do not believe that the president loves America."" Rep. Darrell Issa, who as chairman of the House oversight committee has led investigations of the Obama administration, claims Giuliani didn't deny that Obama loves America--""He said he didn't believe"" Obama loves America. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a 2016 presidential hopeful, says of Giuliani's remark: ""If you are looking for someone to condemn the mayor, look elsewhere."" Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana backs up Giuliani's insinuation that Obama favors the enemy over his own country: ""[Giuliani] is understandably frustrated with a president who, as I said before, is fully willing to lecture the people of this country about the Crusades but is unwilling to call Islamic extremism for what it is."" Please. If we're going to start calling out religious and political groups for extremism, we could start at home with Republicans. Too many of them spew animus. Too many foment sectarianism. Too many sit by, or make excuses, as others appeal to tribalism. If Obama were to treat them the way they say he should treat Islam--holding the entire faith accountable for its ugliest followers--they'd squeal nonstop about slander and demagogy. They're lucky that's not his style. Also in Slate:"	Maybe It's Time Obama Tells the Truth About Republicans	['Pence', 'Obama']	[]
15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/iowa_and_the_republican_party_all_of_the_gop_s_presidential_candidates_are.html	"DES MOINES, Iowa--This Saturday, Jeb Bush makes his first visit to Iowa as a possible presidential candidate to attend the Iowa Agriculture Summit. In past years an establishment favorite like Bush would approach the first caucus state gingerly, unsure whether to expend time and resources in a process that generally has favored more conservative candidates. But 2016 may be different. All the Republican candidates seem to be playing in Iowa. So in advance of his visit to the state this weekend, Bush told Iowa radio that if he were to run he would be ""all in."" Usually, hedging candidates simply promise to return to the state. For the last several presidential cycles, the Iowa caucuses have produced either a winner who was a favorite of social conservatives who then had trouble surviving outside the state, or one of the top candidates has not campaigned in the state and built his fortress in New Hampshire instead. It made the Iowa results an unreliable and quirky indicator for the strength of the candidates in the field. The results always had an asterisk next to them. That may not happen this election cycle, which makes the Iowa competition unlike anything we've seen from Republicans since 1988. Everyone in Iowa wants the state to be competitive and taken seriously. A rousing slugfest would bring campaign money and attention. For party operatives, every time a first-tier candidate visits, it means they can raise money and build their local networks. So everyone in Iowa wants the rest of the country to see it as a valid test of the entire Republican field. Iowa is also perhaps the greatest venue of expectation management in politics. The first four states in the Republican calendar--Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina--represent only about 6 percent of the delegates necessary to win the nomination. As a mathematical matter, the contests scheduled to take place in February are not that meaningful. But as a momentum- and buzz-generating production, they matter a great deal. A candidate who doesn't do well in those four contests has a tough time making a plausible case that he'll suddenly win everything once March rolls around. But what does doing well mean? That's where we wade into the murky and irritating world of expectations. Doing well means doing better than the press and your competitors thought you were going to do. In Iowa it doesn't mean you have to win--the state has rarely done a good job predicting the ultimate winner--but you do need to outperform the expectations, which then helps you build support in other states. In 1996, Lamar Alexander, a long-shot presidential candidate, was the story coming out of Iowa, even though he came in third. In 2000 he nearly lived in Iowa, and when he didn't do very well in the nonbinding straw poll, it effectively ended his campaign. Tim Pawlenty dropped a lot of money into the state in 2012, had a bad straw poll, and that was it for the Minnesota governor. Mitt Romney spent lavishly in Iowa in 2008 and didn't win. That was it for him, too. In 2012 he played it cool, making few visits to the state, keeping his official footprint small, and then swept in at the last minute to lose the state by only a handful of votes. He might have lost, but he did better than expected! You can't ascertain expectations by writing the formula up on the whiteboard, but the elusive bar you have to clear is created by conventional wisdom about the electorate in the state--is it dominated by social conservatives, broadened by moderates, or larger than usual because of libertarians or nonpolitical types attracted by Donald Trump?--and how much effort a candidate put into trying to win. So the conversations about what candidates are doing in Iowa must be put through those two filters. Reports are that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is investing heavily in Iowa. He's hired good staffers on the ground, and his supporters think he's going to make a big commitment. That makes sense: He's in sync with the conservative base in the state, he comes from a nearby Midwestern state, and he's ahead in the polls. But it's also in his competitors' interest to elevate him to front-runner status. That increases the focus on him now (so that when he stumbles, people can say he's not ready for prime time) and it inflates the idea of what doing well for him means. In the past, candidates who have built strong footholds in New Hampshire have watered down the impact of the Iowa contest and described it as a meaningless prize handed out by a narrow part of the party. In 2000, George W. Bush won Iowa handily, but then lost New Hampshire to Sen. John McCain, who had been camped out in the state. In 1996, Bob Dole won Iowa but was upset by Pat Buchanan's forces in New Hampshire. In 1992, Buchanan lost to George H.W. Bush in the Granite State, but the nearly 40 percent he was able to win turned the race upside-down for a time, making the Reagan-backed Bush look vulnerable. This time, all the candidates are competing in Iowa and none has a special advantage in New Hampshire. The Republican National Committee has also put in place draconian measures to keep any other states from moving their contests into February. So not only is Iowa the first state, but it's one of four chances a candidate has to make a name for himself. That means the state will, for the first time in seven presidential cycles, have a chance to act as a contest of equals with fewer asterisks. The two candidates Iowa Republican strategists are particularly skeptical about are Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. One local Bush source downplayed the extent of the Bush operation (keep expectations low!), but others backing Bush promise that he will be making frequent visits and doing the time-consuming campaigning expected by voters. In conversations with key Iowans, Bush has left the impression that he will participate in the thorough manner to which they have become accustomed. In his interview with Radio Iowa, Bush said, ""The lesson I learned that I took away from Iowa in my forays in there for my Dad and my brother is that you've got to be all in. You've got to really take the time to meet people and campaign there actively one-on-one and on a personal level."" The benefit of frequent visits by Bush is that they will allow him to dispel notions that he's just like his brother or father, which he has had success doing in small groups and the kind of close campaigning Iowa favors. Frequent visits will also allow him to show that he doesn't have a problem with conservatives--particularly since he has disparaged the conservative-dominated nominating process that picks GOP nominees. ""I'm going to run to the middle in the general election and you conservatives will just have to hold your nose"" is how Bob Vander Plaats, CEO of the Family Leader, characterizes the Bush message. Christie visited the state multiple times last year (more than a dozen in the last five years) and has also hired local talent that suggests he will seriously participate. He has also boasted about his ability to do well in the state, making Iowa a proving ground for the idea that he is not too New Jersey to find support in the rest of the country. These establishment candidates may feel compelled to participate because neither has a lock on New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada. McCain could skip Iowa in 2000 because he knew he could build support in New Hampshire (plus he didn't have the money to compete in both places). Some of Christie's supporters think he might be able to do the same, but his campaign is so damaged he may no longer have that luxury. In the latest CBS News poll, of all the candidates, Christie has the greatest number of Republicans who say they will never vote for him (43 percent) and is nearly tied for the smallest percentage of people who say they don't know enough about him (29 percent). In other words, he has the least amount of room to grow his vote. Trying to improve that situation after a big Iowa loss will be nearly impossible. Social conservatives have had an advantage in Iowa because caucus night requires a commitment. You sit for hours before voting. That means the most committed are the ones who participate. The most committed tend to be the most conservative. Every conservative who wants to destroy Bush or Christie would like Iowa to launch the first broadside in the hull of their sinking ship, so it's in those conservatives' interest to bait both into a big commitment on a tougher playing field. Mainstream Iowa Republicans have been arguing that the state can showcase a broader representation of the party. Their case was helped by the victory of Sen. Joni Ernst, who gave the Republican response to the State of the Union as an avatar of the new GOP: female and uniting the Tea Party and pragmatic wings. During the last three years, the GOP's forces of pragmatism expelled the forces of Sen. Rand Paul, who were running the state GOP--and running it into the ground, they believe. Gov. Terry Branstad, the soon-to-be longest-serving governor in American history, has worked to fashion the state Republican Party in his pragmatic image, which means it is in his interest to keep the state a competitive proving ground. Operatives who reshaped the state party have signed up for the Christie and Bush campaigns and are united in trying to make the state more mainstream. Finally, Iowa is an important general election state, which means every candidate has an incentive to compete to build an organization for the future. The state was a lock for Obama in 2012 given that his rise started here in 2008, so there wasn't a strong general election rationale for a GOP candidate to play here in 2012. But Iowa is one of the knife-edge states that could go either way in 2016. That is why Hillary Clinton is going to work hard in Iowa, even though she doesn't have a serious caucus challenge. It's possible that one of the candidates in the current crop tries to finesse Iowa and spends more of his time building a campaign in one of the states to follow. But given the nature of the contest this time around, that's a gamble that could be viewed as an admission of weakness that only leads to greater campaign woes. It all depends on what Iowa means for you."	Why No One Can Afford to Skip Iowa This Time	['Clinton', 'Buchanan', 'Romney', 'Christie', 'McCain', 'Obama']	[]
16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/scott_walker_s_national_prominence_is_owed_to_the_state_legislature_the.html	"MADISON, Wisconsin--Scott Walker loves the haters. In recent years as Wisconsin has moved further to the right, the mild-mannered preacher's son has become in the eyes of his opponents an icon of all that is evil--and he seems to relish it. On the stump, the governor is fond of talking up the fact that he's ""the No. 1 target in America of the labor unions and many others on the left,"" and the hecklers that seem willing to follow him to the ends of the Earth give him a chance to flex his conservative muscles. They feed the perception that in Wisconsin, it was Walker against the world, and Walker won. Next week Gov. Walker is expected to sign right-to-work legislation that will burnish his reputation as a bold fighter who stood against the hordes and remains unvanquished. But that image elides an important, perhaps crucial, fact about his record as a reformer: Walker is the chief beneficiary of a state Legislature that has demonstrated a boundless appetite for the kind of controversial, union-crunching attacks that have made the governor a conservative superhero. Without the Wisconsin state Legislature, Walker would just be a skinny Chris Christie. This all starts, naturally, in 2010. You could argue that the Tea Party made greater gains in Wisconsin than in any other state in the country. Democrats lost control of the governorship, incumbent Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold lost his Senate race to upstart businessman Ron Johnson, and the GOP netted two House seats. And, most importantly, Democrats lost hold of the state Assembly and the state Senate. In 2008, Obama won Wisconsin by 14 points and Democrats dominated state politics. Two years later, Badger State Democrats were eviscerated. Republicans are great at winning governorships in blue states. Walker is one of a host of state executives whose conservative policy goals belie the fact that his constituents consistently vote for Democratic presidential nominees. (There is Gov. Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Gov. Bruce Rauner in Illinois, Gov. Susana Martinez in New Mexico, and Gov. Paul LePage in Maine, just to name a few.) Republican governors helming blue states is nothing new. But of all these Republican state leaders, Walker is probably the one with the most ideologically simpatico legislature. National political pundits and election watchers often forget that state legislatures exist. But the Wisconsin Legislature has midwifed Walker's national political prominence. Walker has stood against those that he calls ""big government special interests,"" but thanks to the Republicans that roared into the statehouse in 2010, he's never stood alone. In the case of the right-to-work legislation that the governor plans to sign on Monday, the state Legislature is arguably to his right. In fact, Walker initially expressed reservations about the new law. ""As I said before the election and have said repeatedly over the last few years, I just think right-to-work legislation right now, as well as reopening Act 10 to make any other adjustments, would be a distraction from the work that we're trying to do,"" the governor told reporters a few weeks after his re-election in November, per Wisconsin Public Radio. But Republican state representatives didn't share Walker's concerns. Rep. Chris Kapenga told reporters the same week that he planned to introduce right-to-work legislation that would keep businesses from making it a condition of employment that their employees pay union dues. Speaking with Slate, Kapenga said moving forward on the right-to- work law seemed like an obvious next step, as Republicans saw their majorities in both chambers grow in the last midterm elections. ""We just feel politically that voters have said, we like what you guys have done and we would like you to keep doing what you're doing,"" he said. ""This really has been driven by the Legislature,"" he added. Myranda Tanck, communications director for the state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, agreed the timing was perfect. After the November elections, the Republicans' majority in the state Senate grew and became more conservative, and members were agitating for legislation that would take on private sector unions the same way Act 10 had taken on those in the public sector. ""It would be difficult to wait a couple years on this,"" Tanck said. And the midterm election wasn't the only signal that the time was ripe. In February, conservatives looking to tussle with unions saw another win: Businessman Duey Stroebel, who had made support for right-to-work legislation a central part of his campaign, won a special-election Republican primary to fill a state Senate seat. The Wisconsin Senate will vote to pass the new right-to-work bill either late Thursday or early Friday morning, and then the legislation will head for the governor's desk where Walker will sign his name and add another item to his list of conservative wins. Collin Roth, the managing editor of Right Wisconsin, said Walker will likely get more credit for this victory than he'll deserve. ""It's no secret that the Legislature, particularly Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, did all the heavy lifting on it,"" Roth said. But no one will remember that in Iowa. None of this is to suggest that the Legislature has been in the driver's seat for Walker's whole governorship; the Act 10 legislation, which Walker signed in 2011 and which kicked off the massive protests that made him a hero to national conservatives, was his baby. But without having a statehouse full of allies, it would have been impossible for Walker to distinguish himself from the growing field of potential 2016 contenders. Republican governors in blue states are typically hamstrung by their legislatures. Walker's Legislature, to his great fortune, has propelled him. He has become the public face of a state government that is predominantly and combatively conservative. Walker's success is an important reminder that hundreds of tiny, inexpensive state legislative elections that get zero national media attention can be the difference between being a nobody governor with a rinky-dink profile and being within spitting distance of your party's presidential nomination."

Was Michael Brown a thug or an ordinary kid? Was Darren Wilson a racist, or was he just trying to do his job? In each case, the hope was that you could justify your ""side"" with the right answer. If Brown was just a criminal, then his death wasn't a tragedy, and the protests don't mean anything. If Wilson is a racist, then the community is righteous, and their anger is just. As it stands, we have good evidence that Brown committed criminal acts, as well as a firm conclusion from the Justice Department that there aren't sufficient facts to support a criminal indictment against Wilson and that the officer is neither guilty of a civil rights violation nor culpable under federal law. As far as the state goes, the evidence shows that he did what he had to do. But this conclusion shouldn't lead anyone to dismiss the discord in Ferguson, which was fueled by stronger forces than Brown's death. The reason it happened as it did--the reason the anger spilled into protests and rioting--is because of a long history of police mistreatment and unfairness. Journalists covered much of this in the weeks and months after the August protests. But a new review from the Justice Department goes beyond what we know to expand on the Ferguson police practices. The department didn't just discriminate against black Americans; it targeted them for fines and fees and knowingly violated their constitutional rights. Take traffic stops. Not only did police stop blacks at a rate greater than their share of the population--from 2012 to 2014, blacks were 67 percent of Ferguson residents but 85 percent of traffic stops--but they were twice as likely to search blacks than they were whites, who were 26 percent more likely to have actual contraband. You see the same dynamic with small, discretionary infractions. Ninety-five percent of tickets for jaywalking were against black residents, as were 94 percent of all ""failure to comply"" charges. Either black people were the only Ferguson citizens to jaywalk, or the department was targeting blacks for enforcement. On the rare occasion when police charged whites with these minor offenses, they were 68 percent more likely to have their cases dismissed. And because supervisors awarded promotions on the basis of officer ""productivity,"" there was little incentive to stop any of this behavior. The most disturbing statistics are with regard to arrest, incarceration, and police force. Ninety-three percent of all arrests in Ferguson were of black Americans, and 88 percent of use-of-force incidents were against them. In cases where police had warrants, 92 percent were for blacks. Of those arrested for outstanding warrants, 96 percent were black, and among people jailed for more than two days, 95 percent were black. And in a terrible callback to Jim Crow, police used canines exclusively against black residents, including a 14-year-old boy who suffered puncture wounds in his arms, hands, and legs. It's possible that these are legitimate stops, tickets, and arrests and that the black people of Ferguson are unusually criminal and hostile to the law. But the full scope of the Justice Department's investigation belies this reading of the data. From beginning to end, the report--a six-month project of interviews, analysis, and research--details a steady stream of outrageous police conduct. ""Our investigation has revealed that these disparities occur, at least in part, because of unlawful bias against and stereotypes about African Americans,"" concludes the report. Indeed, there were times when it reads like a dispatch from another, more authoritarian era of American history, where police detained and punished black citizens for the slightest ""offenses,"" from challenging a police stop to simply asking a question. In one incident, during the summer of 2012, a police officer detained a 32-year-old black man who was cooling off in his car after playing basketball. While the officer ""arguably had grounds to stop and question the man""--his windows appeared more deeply tinted than allowed under Ferguson municipal codes--his actions were far more aggressive than necessary:"	Ferguson's Police and City Officials Are the True Criminals	[]	[]
18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/hillary_clinton_and_private_email_account_how_she_responds_will_tell_us.html	"When most of us get inundated with emails from foreign countries, we rely on our spam filter. It turns out Hillary Clinton created an entire separate email account. On Monday, the New York Times reported that while Clinton was secretary of state, she used a private account for all of her official correspondence. The Washington Post reported that the account was set up the day of Clinton's confirmation hearing. That appears to be an end-run around federal government regulations as of 2009. It has immediate political resonance because the details animate an existing storyline about Bill and Hillary Clinton: They live by their own rules and are always hiding something. Here is the rule: According to the 2009 National Archives and Records Administration regulations in effect when Clinton took office, ""Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system."" So the question isn't whether Clinton was allowed to have a private email account: She was, as secretaries before her were as well. The question is whether she was allowed to be the steward of the archives. The 2009 regulation contradicts Clinton's spokesman when he claims: ""Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use nongovernment email, as long as appropriate records were preserved."" The regulations require the information to be saved in the agency system, not simply that they are preserved. So the letter of the law doesn't seem to have been followed. How quickly did they need to be transferred? More quickly than six years after she started her tenure. Jason Baron, the former director of litigation at the National Archives, in an interview with Steve Chaggaris of CBS, said the intent of the regulations were not followed, but that Clinton was not subject to any individual liability. What about the spirit? I remember an Obama administration obsessed with transparency in 2009. I also remember a late-breaking Bush administration scandal about private email accounts being used to do public business. That's not the spirit the Clinton spokesman is talking about, but the spirit in the moment was to keep everything within a system that could be checked and called on by congressional investigators and Freedom of Information Act requests. This makes sense: When it comes time to collect the records, the government wants them in a secure place where they control the content, not the author whose motivations for archival constancy may be more lax or at odds with impartial observers. Update, March 4: And sure enough, the New York Times reports, when investigators asked for emails, the State Department didn't turn over everything because officials there didn't know about Clinton's private accounts. In this case, the Clinton team says they weren't hiding anything. They were told to preserve the email, they did, and when asked to turn over 55,000 pages to the State Department and thousands of pages to the Benghazi committee, they handed them over. (The State Department request was sent to all former secretaries of state in compliance with a 2014 law that tightened up record-keeping requirements) Were those all the relevant emails? We have to take the Clinton team at its word. House investigators are skeptical. Clinton will have to answer all these questions sooner or later, either to the House committee investigating the Benghazi attack or to the press. A cache of private emails unreleased is like Mitt Romney's unreleased tax returns--a nagging question of disclosure that goes beyond a simple discussion of transparency. It picks at one of the candidate's vulnerabilities. In Romney's case, talking about the tax returns was another way of talking about Romney's wealth and disconnect from regular people. It invited the claim, made by none other than former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, that Romney paid no taxes, and that's why he didn't want to release his returns. Given that standard, it's perfectly fine for current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other prominent Republicans to claim that the one email Clinton doesn't turn over contains the secrets of what she was doing the night of the Benghazi attack and the location of Jimmy Hoffa's body. Talking about emails is a way of talking about whether Clinton is trustworthy. It's tempting to say that in its response to this revelation that the Clinton campaign is sending all kinds of bad signals about what a Clinton White House would look like. Because Hillary Clinton has been in the White House and carries with her the black SUVs, Secret Service protection, and other trappings of political stardom, she has the posture of a president more than any other candidate. It's easier to see what she does as an approximation of what she will do. But while she may look like a president, she's still not officially a candidate. Thus, as tempting as it would be to draw big conclusions about an aloof candidate who will be an aloof make-her-own-rules president, we're not technically there yet. But this episode, like others before it, raises the bar for what her campaign needs to do to respond to legitimate questions about how she has acted and how she will act. Because Clinton seems to have operated outside the lines here--or at least blurred them--and her team's defense of her actions raises more questions than it answers."

Yes, he declared, ""those of us in law enforcement must re-double our efforts to resist bias and prejudice."" At the same time, he said, ""citizens also need to really see the men and women of law enforcement ... They need to understand the difficult and frightening work they do to keep us safe. ""If they take the time to do that,"" Comey continued, ""what they will see are officers who are human, who are overwhelmingly doing the right thing for the right reasons, and who are often operating in communities--and facing challenges--most of us choose to drive around."" Comey is right. Of the nearly 800,000 police officers in the United States, most are decent people doing the best they can to uphold the law and protect their communities. A select group of officers is very good at its job. Most others are fine. Some are bad, and a small minority of them are destructive to their mission, their department, and their colleagues. Here's the problem: While most professions will tolerate poor performance, they won't stand for damaging behavior. A cook who occasionally flubs his order might keep his job; a cook who contaminates food and poisons customers will almost certainly lose it. But modern American policing is different. Officers hold great power and discretion, but that doesn't seem to come with responsibility or accountability. In all but the most egregious cases, bad and destructive cops are virtually immune from the consequences of their actions, even when they lead to death or serious injury. What's more, unlike the journalist shunned for fabulism or the lawyer disbarred for theft, the officer accused of brutality can expect the full support of his colleagues and superiors. Some of this is understandable: It's often hard to know exactly what happened in a police-abuse case, and it makes sense to err on the side of the officer. But there are times when that choice is ludicrous--when an officer is clearly in the wrong, but the department stands with him anyway. This is the situation in Cleveland, Ohio, where the police department is in full support of the two officers who killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice--and where the city is now claiming Rice bears responsibility for his own death. Anyone who's seen the surveillance video of his killing would disagree. In it, a car zooms to where Rice is standing. Police had received reports that someone was holding a gun in a public park, but the gun was fake, and the ""someone"" was a kid. Within seconds, an officer fires his weapon, fatally wounding Rice. The cops refuse to give him aid, and when his teenage sister arrives, they tackle her. Paramedics eventually arrive, and they take Rice to a nearby hospital, where he dies. Both officers have checkered records. The shooter, Timothy Loehmann, was a washout. Superiors at a previous posting described him as ""unable to follow basic functions as instructed"" and visibly ""distracted"" during weapons training. ""Individually,"" wrote his former boss, ""these events would not be considered major situations, but when taken together they show a pattern of a lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions. I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct these deficiencies."" The driver, patrolman Frank Garmback, was just as ill-equipped, albeit in a more typical way. In 2010, a resident sued him for ""excessive force"" after he choked her in her driveway. (She had called the police for help.) The city settled last year for $100,000. These men never should have been on the street, where in their incompetence they've made life harder for other, better police officers. Yet both the city and the police union are behind them. ""Tamir Rice is in the wrong. He's menacing. He's 5-feet-7, 191 pounds,"" said Steve Loomis, president of the Cleveland Patrolman's Association, citing a city autopsy report. ""He wasn't that little kid you're seeing in pictures. He's a 12-year-old in an adult body."" Responding to a lawsuit from the Rice family, attorneys for Cleveland maintain that Rice's death was a result of his ""failure ... to exercise due care to avoid injury."" In other words, he all but killed himself. And at a recent community meeting, city police officers called for ""more parenting classes"" and more ""responsible citizenship"" in response to concerns over police violence and brutality. Yes, the union has to represent its members and the city has to avoid major costs. But none of this requires an attack on Rice or an attempt to show that his death wasn't a tragedy. You can fulfill your obligations to individual officers without blaming the family or defending Loehmann and Garmback as good, blameless cops. More broadly, where are the actual good cops in all of this? Where are the men and women who have to deal with the fallout from the death of Rice? They exist, and of everyone in this drama, they should be the loudest voices for better training and accountability, if only because it helps them and their jobs. As always, they're quiet. They may not like the Loehmanns and Garmbacks of the world, but right now they look awfully content to let the actions of such poorly suited officers speak for the whole."

This reputation isn't always unfair. On the main stage in a given year, you might watch a video montage of cable news luminaries saying mean things about the National Rifle Association's Wayne LaPierre, or you might see Sarah Palin waving a Big Gulp over her head, or you might hear Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson discuss how long it takes to contract genital herpes. If you wander down Radio Row, where talk radio hosts snag conservative VIPs for quick impromptu interviews, you'll see frat bros sporting blue blazers and American flag shorts, Tea Party activists in breeches and tri-corner hats, and a tall mustachioed gentleman in a cowboy hat and a ""Cops Say Legalize Pot Ask Me Why"" T-shirt. (He's there every year.) If you wend your way down two layers of escalators into the exhibit hall--the throbbing, burning heart of CPAC--then you can see all the weirdness distilled, compacted, and laid out resplendent in its glory. There's a new attraction every time: A stage with conservative musicians singing guitar songs about the Affordable Care Act; a huge sign that blares ""Big Government Sucks;"" a bevy of people in superhero costumes; a booth blasting metal music and hawking angry bumper stickers about terrorism (that was in 2013, as I recall); a cadre of men from the American Society for the Protection of Tradition, Family, and Property wearing fancy red sashes across their chests; and so on. You may be wooed. You could be alarmed. You will be overstimulated. But if you burrow through all this--past a person in a Windex-blue bear costume and past the booth for the conspiracy theory-touting Center for Security Policy--there's a quiet corner with a very normal booth. Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty had a modest spot in the back corner of the convention hall, and their predicament kind of highlighted why conservative criminal justice reform is so hard. It's hard to be gimmicky about people getting executed. Thus, the CCADP booth wasn't. I bunkered down there for part of a morning with national advocacy coordinators Heather Beaudoin and Marc Hyden--an NRA alum--and spent a decent chunk of time watching people walk by, squint, sort of slow down, and keep walking. It wasn't entirely desolate, though. One slightly rotund young attendee, wearing five different pieces of Rand Paul swag, stopped in to say he supports the death penalty in theory but not in practice. Two youngish-looking women swung by and sounded sympathetic, and the booth-mates from Families Against Mandatory Minimums also paid a visit. It was all very warm, very decorous, very professional, and very unlike the rest CPAC. CCADP's next door booth neighbor was Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition, manned by garrulous booth attendant David Hargitt. ""Kind of hand in hand with you guys!"" he says. ""They put the controversial ones together,"" Beaudoin jokes. ""Exactly!"" he replies. ""Over in the corner, away from everyone else."" ""But we're close to the food, we're close to the book-signing,"" she says. ""We get traffic."" ""Mandatory minimums, asset forfeiture, death penalty--we have lost our freakin' minds in this country,"" Hargitt says. He regales us with stories of Republican North Carolina state lawmakers slamming their doors in his face as we watch people start to line up for a Benham Brothers book signing. CPAC is a comparatively safe space to break with party pieties on criminal justice reform. Instead of getting mad, people just meander off in the direction of two blond brothers who lost an HGTV gig for saying distasteful things about gays. While Republicans are still more excited about the death penalty than the population at large--a recent Gallup poll shows that 81 percent favor execution for convicted murderers--their support for executions has waned a bit in recent years, as has support for the death penalty nationwide. And CPAC attendees that I saw held no animus over the issue. That, in and of itself, is a win for the group. But that doesn't mean CPAC is an easy crowd for them. If you're talking about a public policy of deliberately killing people, you can't really dress up in a goofy executioner suit and hand out silly stickers. And that's sort of a barrier for anyone trying to provoke sober reflection among CPAC-goers for changes in the criminal justice system: How do you compete with Donald Trump and the guy with the Gadsden flag? You can't go full CPAC. But you can meet CPAC halfway. It still counts."	The Anti-Death Penalty Crowd Has a Tough Sell at CPAC 	['Paul', 'Trump']	[]

On Tuesday, he'll address a joint session of Congress. Netanyahu wants to rally Americans against President Obama's plan for a nuclear agreement with Iran. He's coming here at the unilateral invitation of congressional Republicans, in defiance of warnings from the White House. Nothing like this has ever happened before. The opposition party is convening a special session of Congress so that a foreign leader, on the floor of our national legislature, can rebuke the foreign policy of our president. The breach is bad enough. But the story of how it happened, and the hostility and disrespect behind it, are worse. Israel negotiated the speaking engagement with aides to House Speaker John Boehner for at least 13 days without telling the White House. Not until the morning of Jan. 21--a day after the plan was sealed, and two hours before it was announced publicly--did Boehner inform the administration. Boehner made clear that the invitation's purpose was to counter Obama's message and challenge his policies. He cited the president's State of the Union address, delivered the previous evening. ""I did not consult with the White House. The Congress can make this decision on its own,"" the speaker declared. ""There's a serious threat that exists in the world. And the president last night kind of papered over it."" The White House, blindsided, expressed its dismay. ""The typical protocol would suggest that the leader of a country would contact the leader of another country when he's traveling there,"" said Obama's press secretary, Josh Earnest. ""So this particular event seems to be a departure from that protocol."" Netanyahu was undeterred. On Jan. 22, he announced that he was accepting the invitation. He claimed it had been extended ""on behalf of the bipartisan leadership"" in Congress. Democrats corrected him. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said they hadn't been consulted. ""It's out of the ordinary that the speaker would decide that he would be inviting people to a joint session without any bipartisan consultation,"" said Pelosi. She added: ""I don't think that's appropriate, for any country, that the head of state would come here within two weeks of his own election."" The White House announced that if Netanyahu came, Obama wouldn't meet with him. ""The President will not be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu because of the proximity to the Israeli election, which is just two weeks after his planned address to the U.S. Congress,"" said a statement from the National Security Council. The State Department added that Secretary of State John Kerry wouldn't meet with Netanyahu either. The White House noted that Obama opposed legislation--which Boehner and Netanyahu supported--to impose further sanctions on Iran. The statement explained: ""The President has been clear about his opposition to Congress passing new legislation on Iran that could undermine our negotiations and divide the international community."" Netanyahu pushed right back. On Jan. 25, Israel's Army Radio disclosed new talking points issued by Netanyahu's party, Likud. The talking points instructed party members to emphasize that Congress could override Obama's veto of a sanctions bill. This was the prime minister's objective: to marshal Congress against the president. Boehner called Netanyahu the perfect man for the job. In interviews with CBS News on Jan. 25 and Fox News on Jan. 28, Boehner said he had invited Netanyahu to highlight threats Obama was ignoring. The speaker was asked whether the Obama administration felt ""antipathy"" toward Netanyahu. ""Of course there is,"" he replied. ""They don't even try to hide it."" By this point, it was obvious that the invitation was a slap at Obama. Netanyahu could have backed out. But the prospect of standing up to Obama didn't discourage the prime minister. It exhilarated him. ""We are not afraid to determinedly object to the risky agreement that is being formulated between the world powers and Iran,"" Netanyahu proclaimed on Jan. 29. ""We do not hesitate to speak up clearly, even if there are those who refuse to hear."" A week later, Netanyahu criticized the United States directly. ""The American secretary of state and the Iranian foreign minister held talks over the weekend,"" Netanyahu warned Israelis on Feb. 8. ""They announced that they intend to complete a framework agreement by the end of March. From this stems the urgency of our efforts to try and block this bad and dangerous agreement."" At a campaign rally the next day, Netanyahu criticized those who quibbled about ""protocol."" Netanyahu didn't explicitly aim his remark at Obama's press secretary. But Obama decided to step in. ""It's important for us to maintain these protocols, because the U.S.-Israeli relationship is not about a particular party,"" the president explained on Feb. 9, the day of Netanyahu's campaign rally. ""This isn't a relationship founded on affinity between the Labor Party and the Democratic Party, or Likud and the Republican Party."" Obama said he didn't want the U.S.-Israeli relationship to be ""clouded with what could be perceived as partisan politics."" Netanyahu brushed aside the president's warning. ""I intend to speak in the U.S. Congress because Congress might have an important role on a nuclear deal with Iran,"" the prime minister affirmed the next day. Netanyahu wasn't going to let Obama talk him out of speaking to Congress, because the point of speaking to Congress was to thwart Obama. On Feb. 15, Fox News' Chris Wallace asked Boehner why he had told Israel's U.S. ambassador not to inform the White House about the discussions to arrange the speech. Boehner replied: ""Because I wanted to make sure that there was no interference. There's no secret here in Washington about the animosity that this White House has for Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I frankly didn't want them getting in the way."" Boehner wasn't just asserting his right to a separate foreign policy. He was telling the president to butt out of it. A prudent Israeli prime minister, sensing the constitutional showdown, might have backed out at this point. But not Netanyahu. On Feb. 16, he doubled down:"	Netanyahu's Speech in Congress Is a Revolting and Dangerous Gamble	['Reid', 'Israel', 'Pelosi', 'Obama']	[]
22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/the_climate_case_against_meat_u_s_nutrition_panel_suggests_americans_eat.html	"Last week the nation's top nutrition advisory panel unveiled 500-odd pages of advice for the federal agencies tasked with writing the nation's dietary guidelines. Tucked among the usual recommendations--eat more fruit, vegetables, and whole grains; eat less fat, salt, and sugar--were a few small coffee- and egg-themed surprises and one giant green one. Americans, the panel said, should consider the environment when deciding what to eat and what not to. If that sounds like common-sense advice, that's because it is. Climate scientists and nutrition advocates have been saying it for years. But the simple recommendation may end up sparking Washington's next knock-down, drag-out climate fight between Big Business and the Obama administration. ""Current evidence shows that the average U.S. diet has a larger environmental impact in terms of increased [greenhouse gas] emissions, land use, water use, and energy use,"" reads the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee report. ""This is because the current U.S. population intake of animal-based foods is higher and plant-based foods are lower."" The chapter goes on to conclude that Americans should eat a diet that ""is higher in plant-based foods"" and ""lower in animal-based foods."" Translation: Eat less meat. The climate case for such a suggestion has been well-covered by now, but a quick refresher: Livestock is responsible for 14.5 percent of the world's human-caused emissions, nearly half of that coming from the resources needed to grow and ship the corn and soy that most of the animals eat, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. A meat-eater's typical diet, meanwhile, is responsible for almost twice as much global warming as your typical vegetarian's and almost triple that of a vegan, according to a report published in the journal Climatic Change last summer. That Oxford University study suggested that cutting your meat intake in half could cut your carbon footprint by more than 35 percent. Beef is particularly damaging to the planet. According to the National Academy of Sciences, it results in five times more GHG emissions than pork or chicken, while requiring 28 times more land and 11 times more irrigation water. So what's the problem with telling Americans to eat a little less of it? Historically, that type of advice can't so much as be whispered in the nation's capital without being swiftly beaten back by the livestock industry's considerable muscle. By now the president's nutritional advisory panel has largely learned not to pick this fight. Or at least that's what everyone assumed before they unveiled its latest report. ""This is a dramatic departure,"" Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert who served on the advisory panel in mid-'90s, told Politico about the latest crop of recommendations. ""They're just telling it like it is."" The question now becomes whether the White House is willing to listen. The departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services don't have to follow the panel's advice when they finalize their updated nutritional guidelines later this year. While the agencies have traditionally hewed closely to the expert recommendations, the panel's never gone toe-to-toe with the meat industry quite like this before, despite conversation about meat consumption dating back at least four decades. If Obama does decide to press forward, it will open up yet another front in Washington's climate wars--with Republicans denying the science while decrying what they see as the nanny state run wild. That's not to suggest Obama shouldn't press forward--as my colleague Alec MacGillis has explained, the president's come to terms with the fact that if he wants to go at all on climate, he has to go it alone--just that doing so will take political capital. As expected, Big Beef and its conservative allies in Congress have already launched a pre-emptive strike. The North American Meat Institute blasted the report as ""flawed"" and ""nonsensical,"" sentiments echoed by other industry groups. A spokesman for Rep. Robert Aderholt, the Alabama Republican who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that controls the Agriculture Department's purse strings, likewise branded the report ""politically motivated"" and even threatened that the department could be subject to budget cuts if it follows the nutrition experts' advice. The panel knew that this would be the GOP reaction, and the fact that it wasn't cowed (sorry) by Congress is remarkable in its own right. But if the green-themed advice ultimately makes it into the government's final recommendations in its current incarnation, it'll be an even bigger surprise. The industry has an excellent record of coming out on top when it feels as though its bottom line is on the chopping block (sorry again). To get a sense of the power of the industry, consider how it has reacted to so-called Meatless Monday programs, voluntary initiatives that encourage people to go vegetarian for one day a week. In 2012 it took the industry only a matter of days to squash one such small-scale program in Capitol Hill cafeterias. The industry notched an even more convincing win the year before when the USDA published an interoffice newsletter that read, in part: ""One simple way to reduce your environmental impact while dining at our cafeterias is to participate in the 'Meatless Monday' initiative."" Almost immediately after the industry voiced its anger, farm-state lawmakers scrambled to fall in line, vowing, in Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley's words, to ""eat more meat on Monday to compensate for [this] stupid USDA recommendation."" Within 24 hours, the newsletter was taken offline, and the department issued a statement saying that it ""does not endorse Meatless Monday."" Americans aren't obligated to follow the USDA's nutrition guidelines, regardless of whether they come in the form of a plate or a pyramid. But they still represent an exponentially bigger fight than small-scale Meatless Monday initiatives. The federal guidelines shape the health narratives that influence the diets of millions of consumers and, more directly, dictate school lunch menus and what foods are eligible for food assistance programs. Given the stakes for the industry, the president could choose to focus its climate change-fighting attention elsewhere. Then again, given the stakes for the environment, that's probably why he shouldn't."	The Next Big Climate Fight Will Be About How Much Meat You Eat	['Hill', 'Obama']	[]

But the potential 2016 contender--with a resume the size of a phone book and a spiritual gift for taking jabs at Hillary Clinton--might be the busiest person at the Conservative Political Action Conference, and part of her jammed schedule is navigating a questionable back stairway down into the basement of The Walrus Oyster & Ale House a few blocks from the convention center to give a quick talk to a boisterous group of about 200 boisterous College Republicans. This is the kind of event that begs to be exaggerated: You won't believe how College Republicans got wasted in a shady CPAC basement bar well before 5 p.m.! But the reality is more staid. While it's basically a law of physics that College Republicans are big on drinking early and often, the group of business-casual clad kids that jostled around to hear the former California senate candidate speak really wasn't a hot mess. And that group of wine-glass-toting, sign-waving, GOP-loving scholars was delighted with the potential 2016 candidate. Carly Fiorina is a CPAC polyglot. She segues effortlessly from name-dropping Benjamin Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin on the mainstage to empathizing with a cancer survivor who wants a picture with her (she survived cancer, too) to sitting on a panel on ""The Wealth of a Nation: Economic Policies that Help Average, Middle-Class Americans"" to ducking into a bar full of ebullient College Republicans in the process of having one of the more sloshed weekends of their college careers. ""Hi guys, are you having fun?"" she asks. Cheers. ""Did you see my speech earlier today?"" Louder cheers. ""I'm not going to talk long, because I know you want to get back to--what you were doing,"" she continues (more cheers), and then praises them for being made of the stout stuff necessary to be College Republicans. ""When you learn to stand up for your principles and your values in an environment where a lot of people don't get it, you turn out to know how to be a pretty strong advocate for lots of things,"" she says. ""And that will serve you well in life."" She talks for just a few minutes, and her comments are punctuated by one raucous cheer after another. ""Continue with the libations, thanks for being here!"" she concludes. Then Alex Smith, the College Republicans national chairman, hops up on stage to direct the kids into a lengthy photo-op line. ""Hey guys, Carly Fiorina must be a true College Republican,"" says Smith, ""She just told everyone to continue with the libations, we all know what that means!"" More whoops. ""It was amazing,"" enthuses Erin O'Brien a few minutes later as she waits to get a picture with Fiorina. O'Brien, who sports perfect cat eyeliner and an ""I  Capitalism"" button, tells me she's a student at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Clair and that she ""would vote for her in a heartbeat."" But Fiorina's Cool Mom appeal may have limits. As we hustled toward the CPAC exhibit hall a few hours before she addressed the students in that room aromatic with maltiness and youth, she said she opposes marijuana legalization. ""I remember when I had cancer and my doctor said, 'Do you have any interest in medicinal marijuana?' I did not,"" she says. ""And they said, good, because marijuana today is such a complex compound, we don't really know what's in it, we don't really know how it interacts with other substances or other medicines."" She had a lot to say, however, about how Putin interacts. Fiorina said she met him when she went to China for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation event, where the two sat down one-on-one. ""He was quite charming, very intelligent, ruthless, not to be trifled with, and disrespects weakness of any kind,"" she said. ""He's quite funny, he tells good jokes,"" she added. ""I just remember sitting in the chair and thinking, this is a formidable guy who can disarm someone."" Fiorina didn't remember any of Putin's jokes, unfortunately, and said that even if she had she wouldn't have done a good job retelling them because she's not good with jokes. Could you be a good president if you're experienced at facing off with despots but bad at punch lines? College Republicans seem to think so."	Carly Fiorina Knows How to Speak CPAC 	[]	[]
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/america_s_transportation_system_discriminates_against_minorities_and_poor.html	"At the easternmost edge of Lake Erie, where the lake meets the Niagara River, the Peace Bridge connects the United States and Canada. The two-thirds-of-a-mile-long bridge is one of the busiest border crossings between the two countries, connecting Canada's Fort Erie with Buffalo, New York. Every day, an average of more than 15,000 vehicles, about 3,400 of which are trucks, drive over its steel girders. In the shadow of the bridge sits a small neighborhood called the West Side, where the asthma rate is more than four times the national average, and residents report a host of other health issues. Advocates say the thousands of trucks driving overhead spew harmful diesel emissions and other particulates into their community. The pollutants hover in the air, are absorbed into buildings and houses, and find their way into the lungs of neighborhood residents, who are primarily people of color. ""It's constant asthma problems on the West Side,"" says Sharon Tell, a local resident. Idling trucks, with their engines running, are a regular presence on residential streets. ""You see them park on our streets now, and sleeping overnight,"" she says. ""It's so much, and we're right there."" Tell is one of several residents who wore an air monitor funded through an Environmental Protection Agency grant. Her device collected more than 1.8 times the EPA recommended limit of particle pollutants. Tell could only wear the monitor for eight hours during a single day--the cost of conducting the air quality test is prohibitively expensive--but the result was deeply alarming. According to the EPA's standards, the recommended limit on particle pollutants should not be ""exceeded more than once per year on average over 3 years"" (emphasis added). Far from addressing the community's concerns, plans are now afoot to expand the Peace Bridge. A proposed expansion of the bridge's on- and off-ramps will further encroach into the neighborhood's streets. Residents say their concerns about the constant truck traffic and its deleterious health consequences are being consistently ignored. ""We have to move past the point where your zip code determines the quality of your life,"" says Virginia Golden, a Buffalo resident and activist. * * * Race and transportation have long been intertwined, whether it be federally funded highways that plowed through, or isolated, minority neighborhoods; Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott; or segregated streetcars and trolleys. And there has been tremendous progress within the past century, particularly when Brown v. Board of Education struck down ""separate but equal,"" leading to the eventual desegregation of public transportation. In the 1990s, two pieces of legislation, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, increased community involvement and awareness of civil rights issues in transportation planning. But discrimination, while certainly less overt, remains today. Sometimes, as in Buffalo's case, communities feel cut out of the decision-making process. Those in power make decisions about transportation planning, resulting in ill-planned bus routes, transportation more likely to benefit those with cars than those without, and bleak environmental costs. In some cities, roads continue to pull apart neighborhoods, prioritizing commuters over communities. Nationally, the United States remains a country where many forms of transportation are effectively still segregated--whites and minorities ride different kinds of transportation, resulting in an unequal ability to reach jobs, education, and a better life. ""Discrimination in transportation, quite often it's more subtle today,"" says Robert Bullard, dean of Texas Southern University's school of public affairs, and a co-editor of Highway Robbery: Transportation Racism and New Routes to Equity. ""We don't have laws about posting signs for whites and coloreds. We don't have laws segregating people on buses and trains ... [but] if you look at quality of service, efficiency of service, look at amenities attached to suburban rail versus inner-city bus lines, it's like night and day."" In Buffalo, the advocacy group Clean Air Coalition of Western New York filed a Title VI complaint against expansion of the Peace Bridge in response to what the organization's members call an exclusionary process. This type of administrative complaint uses the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as grounds for identifying and fighting discrimination. The landmark law forbids the recipients of federal funding from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin. Although occasionally used in lawsuits, which generally require proving discriminatory intent, Title VI complaints require demonstrating only that a federally funded transportation project has a discriminatory (or, in technical terms, ""disparate"") impact. If a transportation project can be proven to have a disparate impact, agencies can cut a project's federal funding. In 2010, of the $40.2 billion in public funds allotted for transit, $10.4 billion were federal funds. Based on recent complaints provided by the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Authority through Freedom of Information Act requests, as well as older complaints and several lawsuits, I closely examined about 40 cases of racial discrimination in transportation planning, many from the past 15 years. I interviewed people and lawyers involved, and looked at the relationship between transportation funding and race around the country. (These cases included Juneau, Memphis, Boston, Houston, Johnson County, Kansas, and the Gila River Indian Community, a reservation in Arizona.) While the presence of a Title VI complaint or lawsuit isn't sufficient on its own to prove discrimination--and conversely, the lack of a complaint cannot be assumed to indicate a fair and equitable transportation system--these complaints underscore that transit is often not available to those who need it most, and that new public transportation projects often serve those who own cars, at the expense of those who don't. It's a problem in most corners of the United States. In New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina brought public transportation to a standstill. Just a year later, the city's historic streetcars began to return, taking commuters and tourists to downtown destinations. But longtime New Orleans residents say that some buses serving low-income and minority neighborhoods haven't been seen since before the storm, and others have wait times so long that the buses are practically useless. ""We see transportation coming back, but not to our community,"" says Katherine Prevost, a community activist and lifetime New Orleans resident. Prevost, 61, is president of the Bunny Friend Neighborhood Association, which has organized and collected signatures for the return of its neighborhood bus line. Her neighborhood, St. Claude, has only 32 percent of the weekly bus trips that it did before Katrina. It is 81 percent black, with an average household income of $29,029. Thirty percent of households have no vehicle, and about 51 percent have just one. According to a 2014 report by the nonprofit Ride New Orleans, 86 percent of New Orleans' population has returned to the city, but only 36 percent of its transit service, measured by number of trips, had been restored.* Perhaps unsurprisingly, people of color, low-income neighborhoods, and those without cars have taken the brunt of the burden. By that same year, a full seven years after the storm, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority had restored 77 percent of trips to the streetcar lines, but only 29 percent of its bus routes. The gap between buses is more than an hour on 18 percent of these lines. Transit is built ""where they figure they can make money--places like Canal Street and St. Charles,"" said Prevost. ""The poor people that really need the transportation don't have it."" In Oakland, California, a $484 million elevated ""people mover"" (which connects Bay Area Rapid Transit to the airport) lost federal funding because it was found to have a discriminatory impact; its construction led to the elimination of a bus route in the minority neighborhoods it bypasses. In Detroit, a streetcar line estimated to cost $137 million is being built downtown in a corridor that caters to business and office workers, but the project does nothing for the carless poor who live in the urban outskirts. ""It is only moving people who are already there,"" says Rev. Joan C. Ross, who is director of the group, North End Woodward Community Coalition, which filed a Title VI complaint.  ""In our community,"" she estimates, ""30 to 40 percent of people don't have cars."" In Johnson County, Kansas, bus service was cut in a way that the complainants said eliminated routes in black areas while leaving ones in white areas untouched. In Nashville, a Bus Rapid Transit project, creating dedicated lanes for buses, was expected to cost $175 million, and receive federal funding. After the community's uproar, the controversial project was canceled late last month. But had it gone forward it would have served mainly white and middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, ignoring communities like North Nashville, where in some zip codes as many as 86 percent of residents are black and 28 percent don't own cars.* In some cases, federal money goes to building roads, while ignoring the types of transportation used by low income and minority residents. In Milwaukee, for example, a $1.7 billion project called the Zoo Interchange initially used federal money for a highway project without funding public transit.* Last year, a lawsuit charging discrimination was settled; the settlement allocated $13.5 million of the project's funding toward bus routes and improvements to the county transit system. ""This is the most racially segregated region in the United States,"" for black Americans, ""and has been for decades,"" says ACLU lawyer Karyn Rotker, of Milwaukee. ""There have been billions spent for massive highway reconstruction, and repeated and ongoing efforts to interfere with transit."" Cities may be designed for people without automobiles, but the suburbs have increasingly become the home of those without cars. The number of suburban poor increased by more than 60 percent between 2000 and 2012 according to the Brookings Institution, and public transportation systems have yet to catch up. For those without cars--according to 2013 U.S. Census data, 15.9 percent of blacks and 9.1 percent of Hispanics live in households without cars, compared to just 5 percent of whites--public transportation is not a convenience, but a necessity. ""One of the stories we tell ourselves in the narrative of the United States is about social and physical mobility,"" says Marc Brenman, co-author of the book The Right to Transportation: Moving to Equity. ""You can't have either of those kinds of mobility without an equitable transportation system."" * * * When buses started running to a suburban mall near Dayton, Ohio, in January 2014, online commenters, writing in the Dayton Daily News, erupted in anger. They resented--sometimes in purely racist terms--that this new public transportation line would be bringing outsiders, largely blacks, to Beavercreek, a suburb that is about 89 percent white. ""Homeless and thugs taking up residence in the food courts, thugs with no money wandering the hallways all day scaring off the people with money,"" wrote Godsey97, commenting on a local newspaper story. ""Let the shoplifting and Knockout Games begin,"" said a commenter named Guesswho. Another commenter, brack, chimed in, ""they have ruined schools, neighborhoods, companies, salem mall and Dayton mall and now the Beavercreek mall!!! time to flush political correctness and affirmative action."" The new bus service grew out of a conflict that had racked the area for decades, pitting the mostly white suburb against a church coalition and the local NAACP. The church coalition had been advocating for the buses for years, citing the dangerous commute from the nearest bus stop for riders, 73 percent of whom are minorities. Mall workers without cars had been forced to walk along a six-lane highway and then cross an overpass, hugging the fence at the overpass's edge to avoid getting hit by an incoming vehicle. Finally, they would sprint across a large intersection with four to six lanes of traffic and no crosswalk. ""Does someone have to die, being desperate to go to a job?"" asked Deacon Ronnie Moreland, the then-president of the church-based group, Leadership for Equality and Action in Dayton, in an interview in early 2013. The new bus service in Beavercreek, although limited, was the result of a Title VI complaint, filed by Moreland's church group. For more than a decade, the citizens of Beavercreek had fought the buses, claiming that they'd bring crime into their community. In an attempt to squash the public transportation effort, the city council requested restrictive bus-stop regulations, including requiring substantial shelters, lights, police call boxes, and surveillance cameras. In June 2013, about a year after a federal investigator came to Dayton, the Federal Highway Administration released the results of its investigation: Beavercreek's rejection of bus stops was, in fact, discriminatory. ""African Americans have faced discriminatory impact as a result of the City's decision to deny the [Regional Transit Authority's] application to install bus stops,"" the federal report read. Beavercreek isn't unique. ""The fact that there wasn't service [in Beavercreek], and was resistance to service there demonstrates a trend we've seen in other parts of the country, of seeing transit as delivering undesirables to the area,"" says Jason Reece, director of research at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University. ""It's not uncommon to get pushback to bus stops, and even bike paths and trails."" In August 2013, people on both sides of the issue attended a city council meeting at Beavercreek's city hall, a nondescript building in an industrial park, to debate whether they should reject the new bus stops, and therefore lose the federal funding that came with them. At the end of the meeting agenda, attendees each had three minutes to address the room. Among those who opposed the new bus routes, upset citizens bemoaned the criminals or unruly teenagers the buses would bring to the mall. They felt Beavercreek had been the subject of a smear campaign, and they were fed up with being called racist: by the blogosphere, the local paper, and, in some cases, their friends and neighbors. For some in the crowded room, it was an issue of individual responsibility; they had pulled themselves up by their bootstraps--without a public bus, mind you--and said that others should as well. A woman named Cathy Bryan said she had paid her way through college by waiting tables and tending bar. ""I figured it out, and if you care, you'll figure it out, too,"" she said. Some at the meeting feared a future regional, cross-county transportation system that would ostensibly connect what they viewed as isolated, safe suburbs with urban or poverty-ridden areas. The issue of crime came up repeatedly. Invoking the question of civil rights, Ronald Brandon of Beavercreek asked, ""What about ours?"" Others resented being bossed around by the federal government. Bill Curtice said that it was worth losing the federal dollars in order for Beavercreek to maintain its autonomy. ""I encourage you to take fresh courage,"" he said to the council. ""Our highway funds are being held hostage,"" said another woman. On the other side of the issue, person after person got up and told the city council why they needed a bus, their words spilling out until they were cut off at the three-minute mark. A white woman from Beavercreek said her church, which was located near the mall, had trouble hiring child care workers because the applicants were dependent on public transportation. ""I cannot stand here and say there is no racial element,"" she said. ""I'm confident that there is, knowing that the racial issues are much more under the surface than they used to be."" A black woman, Deborah Wagner, said a bus would help her family get to doctor's appointments, so that Wagner herself wouldn't have to miss work to drive. She took issue with the emphasis on teenagers and parenting. ""That's an insult to a black mother,"" she said. At the end, the mayor, looking exhausted and exasperated, closed the meeting and made a beeline for the door. But in an interview a few weeks later at a Panera in another mall in town, Beavercreek's mayor at the time, Vicki Giambrone, argued that the federal decision, which found that banning the buses resulted in discrimination, was motivated by economics, not race. ""This was about three bus stops on one stretch of road, and not about race or certain kinds of people or public transit in general,"" said Giambrone. ""The Federal Highway report says we ran a racially neutral process, and that often gets left out of any stories."" (That is true, says Ellis Jacobs, an attorney with Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, which worked with the church group. The decision doesn't accuse the Beavercreek council of having discriminatory intent, but does make clear the process had a discriminatory impact.) Since January 2014, buses have been running to the mall, although on a limited basis; on a weekday, buses come every hour or so. In May, the Dayton Daily News' analysis of crime statistics from the first two months of bus service found that crime hadn't increased. * * * Citizen groups first began to use Title VI to fight racial disparities in major transportation systems in the mid-1990s. One of the earliest was Los Angeles' Bus Riders Union. At the time, L.A.'s fleet of buses was old, overcrowded, and prone to breaking down. Rather than refurbishing or replacing its bus fleet, the city planned to decrease bus service and get rid of monthly bus passes, while building a billion-dollar rail line. (As in many cities, bus ridership was largely lower-income minorities, and rail ridership tended toward wealthier whites.) In 1996, the Bus Riders Union lawsuit was settled, resulting in a 10-year consent decree, which placed stringent rules on transit funding. The decree forced the transit authority to retain the monthly bus pass at a lower cost, purchase more than 100 new buses, and create new routes specifically to help people of color. ""[The finding] caused a lot of people in the transportation world to sit up and say, 'What's going on?' "" says Joe Grengs, an urban planning professor at the University of Michigan. ""That case really crystalized the link between civil rights and transportation more than any other case in recent history,"" says Guillermo Mayer, president and chief executive of Public Advocates, who has worked on more recent Title VI lawsuits and administrative complaints, including with the Bus Riders Union. Then, in 2001, the Supreme Court dramatically changed the way advocates could use Title VI. In the case Alexander v. Sandoval, the court altered the standard, concluding that an individual had to prove that the policy was intended to cause discrimination, a much higher bar to prove. Advocacy groups, like the Bus Riders Union, who fight for greater funding being allocated to transportation systems for minority communities, could no longer realistically take their claims to the courts. ""Without that right of private action, you have to go to the agencies themselves,"" says Bob Allen, director of policy and advocacy campaigns at Urban Habitat, a Bay Area advocacy group that has been involved with filing Title VI complaints. Filing administrative complaints are entirely dependent on the enforcement of individual people at individual government agencies, says Allen. The Federal Highway Administration receives 40 to 60 complaints each year and investigates about seven, says spokesman Doug Hecox. The FTA received seven Title VI complaints in fiscal year 2014, according to a spokeswoman. Janet Rogers, co-founder of the advocacy group Transit Action Network, which filed a Title VI complaint in Kansas in 2012, remembers calling her contact at the FTA. ""He said there were so many Title VI complaints from this region that he wanted to know if there was something in the water,"" she said. Complaints tend to fall into general categories: funding transit used by wealthier whites, like light rails and trolleys, over buses, whose ridership tends to consist of people with lower incomes and minorities; funding roads without devoting money to types of transit used by those without cars; and transit that helps wealthier populations while having negative health or environmental effects on poor communities. Some of these Title VI complaints get resolved after federal investigators visit, but others languish in bureaucratic limbo for years, especially those filed without legal representation. ""When you have lawyers behind you they treat you differently,"" says JoNina Ervin, who was involved in filing Title VI complaints in Memphis and Nashville, both without legal help. ""With just citizens, they are dismissive."" But after the Supreme Court's ruling, citizen groups lost their best weapon for fighting back. Even the Federal Highway Administration, in a civil rights self-assessment it conducted in 2009, concluded that it lacks the funding, organization, and expertise to level the playing field. ""Alexander v. Sandoval had quite sweeping ramifications,"" says Grengs, the urban planning professor. ""It really threw a wet blanket on the potential for pushing government agencies on civil rights issues ...  and it really elevated the bar that you had to clear for proving intentional discrimination."" * * * Erin Heaney and Natasha Soto are driving around Buffalo's West Side, pointing out neighborhood landmarks. They both work for the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York, which has advocated against the Peace Bridge expansion. One of the first sites is Public School 3, where nearly one-quarter of the students have asthma. In Front Park, a largely undeveloped green space adjacent to a ramp for highway I-90, Heaney, the nonprofit's director, recalls holding a field day with local kids. ""We were there from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., and afterward I felt like I'd smoked a pack of cigarettes,"" she says. The bridge, and the truck traffic surrounding it, is not a new concern. For as long as local people can remember, elected officials have been trying to expand the bridge. At one point, the whole bridge was to be revamped, at a cost of $350 million, but the project didn't pass an environmental review. The current project, contracted for $56.2 million so far, has begun and is expected to be complete in 2017. Neighborhood residents say that widening the plaza and bringing even more trucks into a residential neighborhood will have serious health consequences, which will disproportionately harm the minority community. The neighborhood is 25 percent black, 39 percent Hispanic, and 43 percent white, with 48 percent of residents living below the poverty line. More alarming, residents believe that public officials have figured out a way to have the bridge expansion go forward without running afoul of another environmental review. Based on recent purchases of area real estate by the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority, which manages the bridge, residents fear that the Bridge Authority is dividing the work into smaller projects so that, in its discrete individual parts, the project can pass environmental muster. ""They continue to take the approach of segmenting the environmental impact into individual projects that they say are completely independent, when no one in their right mind would see that as anything other than legal semantics,"" says Joseph Gardella Jr., a chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studies air pollution. In preparation for the expansion--and as a result of that initial complaint, says the Clean Air Coalition--the Department of Transportation held several community meetings, which Soto said were publicized poorly, with little advance notice and in publications community members do not read. Community activist Providencia Carrion, who has lived on Buffalo's West Side since the 1970s and raised her three children in the area, says she was one of five community members who attended one of the meetings. She recalls a conversation with an engineer. ""There's three bridges coming from Canada, through Buffalo,"" she told him, suggesting that trucks could be routed through another border crossing. He replied that no, the trucks wanted to come over the Peace Bridge. ""But I said, 'The more trucks you pass through here, the more asthma you're assigning us, and we don't have no barriers.' And he said, 'People don't die of asthma,' "" she recalled At the public meetings, the conversations haven't been any more productive. At an April 2014 meeting of the Peace Bridge Authority board, Maria Lehman, a New York State Department of Transportation project manager, said that the Bridge Authority shouldn't publicize the project until the day after the review is signed, meaning that the window for bringing a suit against it would be closed. ""So, but, can't we promote this? Can't we publicize this? Can't we market this?"" asked Anthony Masiello, a Bridge Authority board member who was present at the meeting, and is the former mayor of Buffalo. But Lehman explained why not: ""I think some of it has been a conscious decision not to kick sleeping dogs that might not be paying as close of attention as they are."" ""We've had inclinations for a long time that that's how they viewed us, that they didn't really respect the neighborhood and just wanted to check boxes on their forms,"" says Soto. Indeed, in the same board meeting, Lehman said, ""We did this Burmese seven-language thing so we could check the box,"" referring to the Bridge Authority's effort to translate materials about the bridge expansion to languages spoken by people in the community, which includes Arabic, Nepali, Burmese, and others. Soto said neither she nor her fellow activists were present at the meeting; she says the Bridge Authority's board meetings have been held on an irregular basis in Canada, making it difficult for activists to attend. The only board meeting currently listed on the Peace Bridge's website took place two months ago in Fort Erie, Ontario. (A Peace Bridge Authority spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment on the meetings. Likewise, an email to Lehman asking about the Peace Bridge expansion was answered by a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said any questions about the project should be directed to the Federal Highway Administration.) Lehman may have spoken freely at last April's meeting because she believed none of the opponents to the bridge's expansion were in attendance. Activists only became aware of her statements when a recording of the meeting was obtained through a Freedom of Information Request filed by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, an advocacy group that encourages public employees to work as ""anonymous activists."" Last year, the advocacy group submitted a complaint to the U.S. General Services Administration over the Peace Bridge expansion's environmental review. ""In essence the environmental review they did was premised on fictions--statements that there wouldn't be increased traffic or that there was no controversy or no health risk to the community,"" says Jeff Ruch, the group's executive director. ""They maintained the absurd position that the review wasn't disseminated, and therefore it wasn't required to be accurate."" Like Carrion, many residents would like to see the trucks out of their neighborhood, and off the bridge altogether, a solution that seems unlikely politically or financially. Nearly half of the Bridge Authority's yearly $33 million in revenue comes from commercial vehicle tolls and about $6.7 million comes from passenger vehicle tolls. Because there is no revenue sharing between the Peace Bridge and other local border crossings, it is in the Bridge Authority's interest to draw as many trucks as possible. The alternative proposed border crossing for commercial trucks, the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, while less populated, is demographically different: Residents are 96 percent white, with an average income of more than $58,000. There are other possibilities that would at least mitigate the fumes and pollution. Today, there are no trees or other environmental barriers between the bridge ramp and duty-free plaza and the neighborhood. The Clean Air Coalition has proposed planting bamboo, which grows quickly and absorbs more carbon dioxide than trees or installing truck stop electrification stations, which would curb emissions from idling trucks. Neighborhood residents have suggested fixes like speed bumps or signs prohibiting trucks from neighborhood streets, where they currently park when drivers want to sleep or wait out heavy traffic. Residents say they have won some small battles--the Bridge Authority hired a firm to create buffers--but, on a larger scale, residents still feel powerless, as the construction moves forward and the Bridge Authority plans to demolish another major property in the neighborhood, the former Episcopal Church Home, for unknown purposes. ""They did have meetings for us, to get accountability of people who came to the meeting,"" says Carrion, the activist. ""I wish I would have known what I know now, because I wouldn't have signed their sheet."" Carrion had gone to the sessions, believing that they were an honest effort to solicit opinions from the neighborhood. ""We went to all these meetings, and we were still thinking we were still in that process,"" she says, adding that she, like several of her relatives, has asthma. ""We thought they were going to change their mind. And give us the benefit of the doubt, or compromise. But they had their mind made up."" Every time she passes a sign near the highway, it's a reminder of what's to come. ""Right there, it says, the Peace Bridge plaza is coming,' "" says Carrion. ""All this fighting that we did, all that picketing that we do--these people didn't hear us."" *Correction, Feb. 27, 2015: This article originally misstated that Nashville's Bus Rapid Transit project would cost $175 million and receive federal funding.

How America's Transportation System Discriminates Against the Most Vulnerable	['Allen', 'Sandoval', 'Alexander', 'Wagner', 'Dayton']	[]
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/scott_walker_compares_unions_to_isis_the_wisconsin_governor_thinks_fighting.html	"Scott Walker checks a lot of boxes as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, which is a big reason why he's leading the early polls in Iowa. Pro-business conservatives like him for taking on the unions and cutting taxes; religious conservatives like that he's a minister's son and born-again evangelical. If there's any box that he doesn't fill, it's foreign policy--heck, Wisconsin doesn't even share a border with Canada. Walker sought to address this gap Thursday evening at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference when he was asked a question on stage about how he would take on the threat of Islamic State jihadists. Walker claimed he was prepared to confront this threat because of his experience confronting thousands of protesters who gathered in Madison in 2011 to decry his push to undo collective bargaining for public employees in the state. ""We need a leader with that kind of confidence. If I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,"" he declared. The remarks provoked an uproar on social media, where many noted the strained comparison. After all, the teachers and other union members who gathered in Madison (and who have gathered again this week in response to Walker preparing to sign anti-union ""right-to-work"" legislation) were armed with signs and earmuffs, not swords and balaclavas. Walker's remark even earned him some scolding on the right. Realizing he had misstepped, Walker told Bloomberg Politics after the speech that he had not intended to compare the fight against the unions to the fight against ISIS, but only meant that he had faced ""that kind of pressure, that kind of intensity"" during the protests. (He was somewhat less penitent in an interview with the Wisconsin State Journal.) In fact, though, this was no mere one-off overstatement or slip of the tongue on Walker's part. Just last week, at the New York event where former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said that President Obama did not love America, Walker made a similar remark comparing the fight against ISIS and the union protests. Here's Larry Kudlow's account of the event:"	Scott Walker Thinks Fighting Unions Is Just Like Fighting ISIS	['Obama']	[]

One side maintains that if Americans are to protect themselves against shadowy evildoers, they need to give their government wide authority to monitor the communications of potential enemies, even if that means that millions of citizens who are guilty of no crime might at some point be subject to some form of surveillance. The other argues that the national security bureaucracy has grown far too powerful, and that it routinely misleads the elected officials charged with overseeing it. Until recently, there was no doubt that the former camp was winning. But since 2013, when Edward Snowden first shared details of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance efforts with a small handful of journalists, including scathing critics of America's national security apparatus like Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, the politics of surveillance have irrevocably changed. Snowden and his ideological allies now have the upper hand. On Sunday, Hollywood feted Citizenfour, a documentary feature that portrays Snowden as an earnest patriot. Then Snowden joined Poitras, the director of the film, and Greenwald for a Reddit AMA, during which the former NSA contractor said his only regret about disclosing various national security secrets was that he hadn't done it sooner. Later this year, director Oliver Stone will release a fictionalized portrait of Snowden that will no doubt further burnish his legend. Of course, Snowden's brand of guerrilla civil libertarianism hasn't been embraced by everyone. As recently as last month, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 63 percent of Americans said they were willing to sacrifice privacy to give the federal government stronger surveillance powers. Yet 32 percent opposed giving up privacy in the name of greater security, a pretty substantial minority. Among adults younger than 30, meanwhile, the split was a tight 48 to 47 percent, with a slight edge to the pro-surveillance camp. In a similar vein, a Pew survey from January 2014 found that 57 percent of younger-than-30 adults felt that the Snowden revelations did more good than harm. So how is that the Snowdenites are winning? They're winning because they don't actually need a majority of the electorate to embrace their position in order to achieve their goals. They merely need a vocal, well-organized minority. For example, the NSA needs people with the technical skills to make their vast surveillance apparatus work. Not shockingly, these people are often young, tech-savvy men with an anti-authoritarian streak, many of whom might identify with Snowden. The result is that the NSA has been forced to switch up its recruitment tactics. Because the agency is now more skeptical of younger hackers with little in the way of formal education, it has renewed an emphasis on recruiting graduates of schools that produce large numbers of military recruits, whom it perceives as more reliable. To understand how a political minority can prove politically effective, consider the ongoing debate over imposing new federal regulations on guns. Though large numbers of Americans favor new restrictions on gun rights, the ""intensity"" of those who oppose them tends to win out. Yet intensity doesn't mean much if it can't be channeled into effective political action, as the University of Maryland political scientist David Karol has observed. For Karol, a key reason that gun-rights activists are so politically effective is that gun owners engage in group activities that strengthen their social bonds, like hunting and attending gun shows, as a matter of course. This makes it easier for gun advocates to reach their target audience, and it also means that when gun owners get together, they are more likely to pass along political information, like the latest outrage perpetrated by federal gun-grabbers or which primary candidate is a squish on the Second Amendment. Karol compares the gun-rights movement to other social movements, like those for alcohol prohibition, civil rights, women's suffrage, and gay rights, which ""piggy-backed on pre-existing social organizations and communities,"" meaning they didn't have to foster these connections in the first place. Gun-control advocates aren't united by their hobbies or their cultural proclivities in the same way, so they're inevitably harder to organize. Surveillance skeptics have a similar edge over surveillance defenders. No, not all of Snowden's biggest fans in America are affluent, well-educated libertarian technophiles who spend much of their spare time socializing on lesser-known corners of the Web. But these groups certainly overlap. Just as hunting and target shooting are ways that older gun owners cement social bonds, gaming and obsessively following Reddit could serve much the same function among young surveillance skeptics. Libertarian Republicans like Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul have recognized the growing power of this constituency, and they cater to it by regularly addressing libertarian groups and pushing for surveillance reform. Though surveillance skeptics are in the minority among Republican lawmakers, they're not easily dismissed. At the same time, Democrats like Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden and New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich press the civil libertarian case on their side of the aisle. But it gets worse for the defenders of surveillance authority. The Snowden revelations didn't just make working for the NSA less attractive. As Julian Sanchez, a privacy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute has explained, the revelations badly embarrassed major U.S. technology companies, particularly those that have substantial operations outside of the country. Suddenly the notion that Google and Facebook were essentially arms of the U.S. government seemed like more than a paranoid fantasy, particularly to consumers in Europe and Asia already inclined toward anti-Americanism. Before the revelations, these companies could work closely with the U.S. government to facilitate its surveillance efforts without ever being held to account. Even if they objected to getting pushed around by Uncle Sam behind closed doors, they had little incentive to make a stink about it, as doing so could jeopardize their business by raising suspicions. After the revelations, the international reputation of U.S. tech giants took a hit, and they had little choice but to push back forcefully and to ally themselves with civil liberties groups. Suddenly you had a deep-pocketed special interest group (Silicon Valley, to put it crudely) working hand in glove with civil-liberties activists in defense of their core economic interests. This is very similar to the alliance that helped defeat the Stop Online Piracy Act in 2012, before the Snowden revelations, and there's no reason to believe it's going to fade away. None of this is to suggest that the Snowdenites will keep winning forever. The rise of ISIS might strengthen the hand of those who call for more surveillance authority, and a future terror attack could very well do the same. Moreover, while surveillance skeptics can vocally oppose expansions of surveillance authority, it's not clear they have the political muscle to roll it back. In the months to come, Congress will debate extending the Patriot Act's Section 215 authority, which the Obama administration cites as the legal basis for the bulk collection of telephone metadata. The FBI is lobbying hard for an extension, and it has plenty of supporters on Capitol Hill, including Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Democrats like California Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The outcome of this debate will test the strength and the seriousness of civil libertarians in Congress. What's clear is that surveillance defenders now face formidable opposition, and Edward Snowden deserves much of the credit and the blame."

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/susan_stimpson_is_trying_to_defeat_william_howell_virginia_s_grassroots.html	"In northeast Virginia, some conservatives are looking for blood. The tensions in the state's Republican politics often have national implications: The state gets bluer all the time, Virginia Republicans aren't ready to make nice with each other, and Democrats' growing clout could give their nominee an edge in 2016. Now, a primary threat to the Virginia speaker of the House means Republicans' internecine tensions are about to erupt. That leading Virginian Republican, William Howell, has represented the commonwealth's 28th District in the House of Delegates since 1992 and is facing a credible primary challenger who has won support from one of the nation's most prominent conservatives. Susan Stimpson, who is challenging Howell, previously chaired the Stafford County Board of Supervisors and ran unsuccessfully to be the Republicans' 2013 lieutenant governor nominee. The primary is on June 9. If Howell goes down, he'll be joining a string of powerful Virginia Republicans who have been eliminated in primary campaigns, and he'll give an extra jolt of vim to the Virginia grassroots conservative activists looking to grow their influence in the state party. The most obvious example of their effectiveness is the saga of former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who lost last year to then-professor Dave Brat in a primary upset that astounded literally everyone, including Brat. In fact, Cantor's high-profile defeat wasn't without precedent. In June 2013, Virginia Delegates Joe May and Beverly Sherwood both lost to upstart conservative primary challengers who targeted them for backing a hefty tax hike. Both were longtime members of the House of Delegates, and both chaired committees. Americans for Tax Reform celebrated Joe May's loss, and now it's hoping for more blood. The organization doesn't endorse candidates, but it criticizes specific candidates' records and did so against May. Its president, Grover Norquist, endorsed Stimpson last week and called Howell ""a serial tax-hiker."" His statement also blamed Howell for the election of Virginia's two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. This isn't to suggest that the primary is a clear-cut instance of Gadsden flag-toting conservative insurgents clashing with business-chummy good-ol'-boy RINOs. The Washington Post ran an editorial mocking charges that the speaker is too centrist and saying he ""has guided the House of Delegates from one conservative milestone to another."" And Fred Barnes in the Wall Street Journal praised Howell's role in blocking the Medicaid expansion into Virginia. But his conservative credentials aren't unassailable. As speaker, he oversaw the passage of the largest tax hike in state history, and that alone was more than enough to make him an attractive target for a primary. ""He's been given opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to govern and pass legislation to the benefit of taxpayers, small businesses, and families in Virginia, and he's done the opposite,"" said Paul Blair, state affairs manager at ATR. ""Raising taxes is what politicians do instead of reforming government, and the speaker is the best living example of that theory."" And James Parmelee, the chairman of the Northern Virginia Republican PAC, said Stimpson can make the race competitive. ""Susan Stimpson is a solid candidate,"" he said. ""She has a wide statewide following and did very well--didn't win, but did very well--in her lieutenant governor race."" Parmelee's group hasn't endorsed anyone in the primary. He added that a Stimpson win would give more energy to the grassroots conservative activists who have already taken out a handful of Old Dominion Republicans. ""People see that very secure, powerful incumbents can lose to an issue-based campaign,"" he said. That doesn't mean Howell is going the way of Cantor (which, given Cantor's lucrative new Wall Street gig, isn't the worst way to go). For starters, Howell and his staff seem to be taking the challenge seriously. While Cantor's staff kept busy ""browbeating"" any reporters who mentioned Brat (that's per Breitbart's Jonathan Strong), Howell has put together a serious political operation. Matt Moran, a spokesman for the speaker, also said they won't run a negative campaign. ""We're not going to try to win this race by just spending more than her on flashy TV ads and blowing up the mailboxes,"" said Moran. That's probably smart. One of Cantor's key mistakes was lobbing awkward negative ads at Brat that backfired colossally by raising his name recognition with voters. Nor was he the only Old Dominion Republican incumbent to be hoisted on his own negative-ad petard; Joe May launched awkward, salacious attacks at his primary contender that backfired by making him look petty and mendacious. ""We're not going to take anything for granted,"" Moran said. ""We're going to learn from the mistakes that other incumbents have made, and we're going to win."" So Howell is the clear front-runner. He'll have a substantial fundraising advantage, and he won't be taken by surprise the way Cantor was. But perhaps the most interesting difference between Howell's and Cantor's challenge is that Howell faces a former protegee. The speaker helped Stimpson kick-start her political career, so her decision to try to take him out raised a few eyebrows. ""One of the hardest things to do in politics is hold your friends accountable, but frankly it's one of the things missing in Richmond and Washington,"" Stimpson said in an email. ""No one needs to be in office for 30 years,"" she added."	Virginia's Grassroots Conservatives Are Targeting Another Prominent Republican	['Brat', 'Richmond', 'Moran', 'Paul', 'Warner', 'Kaine']	[]

McConnell spent Tuesday scrambling to come up with a way to allow congressional Republicans to vent their opposition to President Obama's executive order on immigration without shutting down the Department of Homeland Security. As it stands, DHS will be shuttered at midnight on Friday as a result of the Republicans' demand that the agency's funding be tied to gutting the immigration order, a demand that McConnell has been unable to get past a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. To avert a shutdown, McConnell proposed that Congress take two actions, passing legislation targeting the executive order while separately allowing funding for DHS. But that gambit drew criticism Tuesday from both camps. Even the Democrats who are skeptical of the executive order are demanding that Republicans pass the agency funding before immigration is taken up. Meanwhile, conservative Republicans see McConnell's plan as giving Obama a pass on immigration since he can simply veto any legislation targeting his order and implement it with the money approved for DHS. ""Cave, cave, cave,"" one Republican lawmaker told National Review. ""It would pass with unanimous Dem support and fractured GOP support in each house--not exactly what the base will want to see."" What both sides are discovering now--if they didn't anticipate it already--is what was really behind McConnell's vow to make his party look less ""scary."" When McConnell's comments to the Washington Post's Paul Kane were reported in early January, many in Washington hailed them as a real shift in mindset for McConnell, who had infamously said in late 2010, to justify his party's obstructionism in the Senate, that the party's ""single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.""* But his comments last month did not, in fact, represent a shift in mindset. McConnell, with his characteristic candor, made abundantly clear that he was urging a shift in tone but that his underlying mindset was not changing at all. The reason he wanted Republicans to look less ""scary,"" he told Kane, was simple: He wanted to ""set the stage for a potential GOP presidential victory in 2016."" ""I don't want the American people to think that if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that's going to be a scary outcome. I want the American people to be comfortable with the fact that the Republican House and Senate is a responsible, right-of-center, governing majority,"" said McConnell. ""There would be nothing frightening about adding a Republican president to that governing majority. I think that's the single best thing we can do, is to not mess up the playing field, if you will, for whoever the nominee ultimately is."" In other words, McConnell wanted the party to project a more reasonable image for a single reason: to improve its chances of winning in the next election cycle. Not in order to restore voters' faith in Washington, or to tackle the nation's biggest problems, or, heck, to burnish his own legacy with some major legislative accomplishments. No, his driving goal, now that he had finally become majority leader after 30 years in the Senate, was for his party to win the next election. This, as I explained in the McConnell biography I wrote last year, is the key to understanding the inscrutable Kentuckian: He, more than any other major politician today, embodies the permanent campaign mindset that holds such sway in Washington, the notion that what matters is less what you do once you have won election than whether you and your party are in position to win the next time around. In the first six years of Obama's tenure, McConnell calculated, shrewdly, that the way to set up Republicans for wins after 2008 was to relentlessly obstruct Obama, since voters would blame Washington dysfunction more on the party that held the White House, that had a greater philosophical stake in a functioning government, and whose leader had made grand promises to change the tenor in Washington. Sure, Republicans could have achieved more policy goals if they had negotiated with the Democrats on health care, financial reform, and other issues to pull legislation in a more conservative direction in exchange for some votes. But that, McConnell calculated, would have reduced the odds of success in the next election, which was what mattered most. As his ally in the Senate, Robert Bennett of Utah, told me of McConnell's obstructionist approach to health care reform, ""He said, 'Our strategy is to delay this sucker as long as we possibly can, and the longer we delay it the worse the president looks: Why can't he get it done?' "" That was McConnell's strategy for winning elections when his party was in the Senate minority. But now that he is leading the majority, McConnell's calculation has shifted to account for the fact that his party will likely be accorded more blame than before for Washington dysfunction. So the strategy for winning the next election has shifted from obstruction to appearing less ""scary."" But what does it mean, under McConnell's definition, to not be scary? It does not mean actually getting significant legislation passed or addressing major problems. It means, above all, avoiding government shutdowns, and so he will scramble all week to make sure that DHS stays open. But he has shown no sign of taking on the underlying issue that has brought the country to this latest brink: a broken immigration system. That is hardly surprising, because McConnell has made plain in the past that this is an issue that he sees as distinctly unhelpful when it comes to winning elections. In 2007, when the Senate took up the immigration reform bill pushed by President George W. Bush--a more conservative approach than what Democrats are pushing today--McConnell, then already the Republican leader, was conspicuously absent from the debate. McConnell, who was up for re-election the following year in a state where anti-immigrant sentiment runs relatively high, waited until it was clear the bill was going to lack the necessary 60 votes before voting against it and did not even speak on it on the floor until its fate was known. Roll Call called him a ""virtual no show"" and conservative columnist Robert Novak called his performance a ""truly major failure of leadership."" McConnell voted against immigration reform again when it passed the Senate in 2013 (again, one year before he was up for re-election) and has not cited it as one of the few areas where he could foresee some consensus with the Obama administration. The irony, of course, is that many Republicans believe that comprehensive immigration reform would in fact help their party in 2016, by allaying the perception of the party as inimical to the interests of Hispanic voters. McConnell's new proposal, after all, would result in the vast majority of congressional Republicans voting to torpedo an executive order that many Hispanics are hailing as a godsend (and that, for the time being, is now in limbo as a result of a legal challenge). ""This is a short-term tack to get them out of a jam that they find themselves in, but the fact of the matter is that what he is doing is starting a full-on assault to stick it to the Hispanic community,"" says Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Perhaps McConnell fears that many in his party would not even be able to reap those electoral rewards in 2016 because they would be eliminated before that in primary challenges hitting them for their pro-immigration reform votes. Or perhaps the many years of obstructionism have simply eroded his instinct for tackling big issues in a big way. (Once upon a time, he was very much in the mix on major legislation, from tobacco-farmer buyouts to election-machinery overhauls.) Regardless, the leader of the Senate seems to have zero interest at the current pass besides keeping a government agency from shutting down and thereby hurting his party's prospects in 2016. That may not be scary--but it is depressing. *Update, Feb. 25, 2015: This post has been updated to include a missing word in McConnell's 2010 quote about the party's desire to make Obama a one-term president."

Daniel Bice reported for Milwaukee's Journal Sentinel that when the Wisconsin governor was asked about his stance on same-sex marriage, his responses left attendees confused. ""It really doesn't matter what I think now,"" Walker said, apparently referring to the fact that a district court judge had recently thrown out the state's constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. ""It's in the Constitution."" Pressed to elaborate, he said, ""I don't comment on everything out there."" Asked if he was reconsidering his stance on the issue, he said, ""No. I'm just not stating one at all."" If you have a healthy work/life balance, you may have missed the enormous Internet hubbub this past weekend over an awkward answer that the likely 2016 Republican contender gave to a question from the Washington Post about President Obama's religious faith. (Walker refused to answer when asked whether he thought Obama was a Christian.) Regardless of the public policy implications--or lack thereof--of Walker's response, it brings to mind that comparably odd exchange on gay marriage last June. Marriage is such an important issue to so many people that candidates typically see little benefit from equivocating and hedging when they discuss it, regardless of what they believe. But Walker's statements and actions have caused some head scratching. Though the governor states that he opposes marriage rights for same-sex couples, he's made a number of curious comments on the issue, and has taken a stance on anti-discrimination laws that could make trouble for him with his base. So it's as good a time as any to talk about what exactly the Badger State governor makes of same-sex marriage and other LGBT issues. His Oak Creek press conference wasn't the only time he has tried to shy away from the topic. A few months later, he again tried to duck the issue. ""I'd rather be talking in the future now more about our jobs plan and our plan for the future of the state,"" he said a few weeks before his third gubernatorial bid in four years, according to US News & World Report. ""I think that's what matters to the kids. It's not this issue."" He made similar comments on Meet the Press in March 2013 when erstwhile host David Gregory asked him about young conservatives' support for same-sex marriage. ""I think there's no doubt about that,"" he said, per ThinkProgress. ""But I think that's all the more reason, when I talk about things, I talk about the economic and fiscal crises in our state and in our country, that's what people want to resonate about. They don't want to get focused on those issues."" Kids these days may not be particularly enraptured with Santorum-esque stances on marriage, but plenty of the conservative voters that Walker needs to court if he wants to be president feel differently. And thus far, the governor has managed to stay on social conservatives' good side. Julaine Appling, president of the socially conservative group Wisconsin Family Action, said she didn't have complaints about the governor's record on marriage issues. Her group endorsed him in all three of his gubernatorial contests (two general elections and one recall vote in the summer of 2012). ""He aggressively defended our marriage amendment in court,"" she said. Matt Batzel, the national executive director of American Majority Action, who lives in Cedarville, Wisconsin, said the governor likely downplayed his stance on marriage during his 2014 re-election race out of political necessity. ""[Democratic opponent Mary Burke] would have loved to have him take a hardline traditional marriage position as often as possible,"" he said, ""and she would have used that probably fairly effectively with the war on women narrative to hit him pretty hard."" So perhaps Walker was intentionally coy about the issue. Either way, right now there's plenty of space for Walker's conservative opponents to get to his right on LGBT issues. In November 2013, the governor suggested that the House should pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would bar employers from discriminating against LGBT employees. In an interview with Bloomberg, he praised the state's decades-old law that does essentially the same thing. ""I haven't looked at that particular bill,"" he said, referring to the ENDA legislation that the Senate passed two weeks before his interview. ""I can tell you, in Wisconsin, we've had anti-discriminatory laws that are very similar to that for more than 30 years and they've worked quite effectively."" ""We've had no problems--or I should say, limited problems with that,"" he continued. ""At the same time, we still have a constitutional amendment that defines marriage. There's a healthy balance there."" It's unclear if the governor now thinks the state's LGBT rights balance is out of whack, but he can expect more questions about that soon. When I asked Appline about Walker's comments on ENDA, she said she wasn't familiar with his stance. ""I'm sure some of that will have to unfold if he decides to pursue a presidential run,"" she said. ""Part of it may be that he doesn't fully understand some of the ramifications of ENDA legislation. I would certainly give him the benefit of the doubt on it."" She has reason to do so. The governor sent a letter to her group two months before his re-election last fall reiterating that he backs ""marriage between one man and one woman,"" per the Journal Sentinel. And perhaps more tellingly, he opposed the state's registry for same-sex domestic partners during his first gubernatorial bid. (There's more on this at the Wisconsin Gazette). He also opposed providing benefits to the same-sex partners of state employees. During his first term as governor, Wisconsin Family Action filed a lawsuit charging that the registry was an unconstitutional violation of the state's marriage amendment. Walker fired the lawyers that his Democratic predecessor appointed to defend the registry, according to USA Today. The gay rights group Fair Wisconsin took over the case, and the state Supreme Court ruled in July 2014 that it was within the bounds of the state's Constitution. Despite that, his son Alex was a witness in a relative's same-sex marriage. ""Shelli Marquardt is the first lady's cousin,"" said Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick in a statement to the Journal Sentinel. ""She is a part of the Walker family who they dearly love."" So Walker's history on gay marriage is complicated, with lots of material for critics on both sides. No wonder he'd rather talk about jobs."
