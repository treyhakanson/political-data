She can allow Republicans to heap criticism upon her as she heads out the door. The more she is seen as the agent of Obamacare's woes, the embodiment of the bad website and the law's generally snakebit nature, the better it is for the political health of the president's signature program. As if to fulfill this promise, when Sebelius read her prepared remarks announcing her departure on Friday at the White House, she flipped through her pages and admitted, ""Unfortunately, a page is missing."" Now that more than 7.5 million Americans have signed up through the health care exchanges, it was only a matter of time before Sebelius left her post. Regardless of her blameworthiness for the website's poor rollout or the credit she deserves for meeting that crucial enrollment goal, she is the face of the initial disaster. There's no way that the administration and Democrats running for re-election could say the program is flying straight when the most high-profile official from that dark period is still on the job, appearing on television and in the newspapers. (You can't turn the page when ""unfortunately, a page is missing."") Reaching the once unthinkable enrollment target allows for a reconfiguration without it looking so much like a retreat. Many Washington analysts thought Sebelius would be out sooner. The president's critics and opponents demanded it. Though there was talk inside the administration about firing Sebelius, there was a lot to argue against it. Obama is temperamentally not one for symbolic firings, particularly to please his opponents or the pundits. Plus, slipping Sebelius a pink slip wouldn't have improved the management of the website rescue effort. The president did that by putting a new management team in place through the so-called tech surge. What leaving Sebelius in the post did do was allow her to work on what she was good at--pushing governors to stick with the federal exchanges and pushing national sign-up efforts--while serving as a buffer to the attacks leveled by Republicans and political pundits. When an explanation was needed, the administration could push Sebelius out front for media appearances or another round of congressional abuse. Democrats have long prayed that Republicans will overplay their hand by attacking the website failure so much that they teach people to associate the health of the site with the health of the underlying plan. So too with Sebelius. If she could draw all the poison, then her departure would help the administration pretend the problems had been banished. The good enrollment numbers help Democrats extol Obamacare's progress, and a new face at the head of the effort helps lock in the idea that the law is no longer in recovery but here to stay. Obama named Office of Management and Budget director Sylvia Mathews Burwell as Sebelius' replacement, focusing on her effectiveness. ""I could choose no manager more experienced, more competent,"" said Obama at the White House on Friday. In the New York Times, the president's chief of staff Denis McDonough said, ""The president wants to make sure we have a proven manager and relentless implementer in the job over there, which is why he is going to nominate Sylvia."" The president never mentioned management skill in 2009 when he announced that Sebelius was heading HHS. She was heralded for her bipartisan deal-making skills and her knowledge of what people wanted from the health care system. Now management is job No. 1. The focus on management isn't just about public relations. In the next year, Burwell will have to manage the next enrollment period, finesse the insurance companies as they respond to the first round of enrollment with new premium prices, and generally act as the administration's first responder as the law intersects with the existing health care market. The Burwell pick helps settle heartburn for congressional Democrats. They no longer have to defend Sebelius, and they can have more confidence that when the law faces inevitable challenges, Burwell's management skill will help avoid another political nightmare. Burwell enjoys the complexities and substance of policy and has worked hard to keep in touch with members of both parties in Congress as director of OMB. A veteran of the Clinton administration, as well as the private sector, she has Washington bonafides but also skills from working outside the government bureaucracy. Though this is the next stage in the White House page-turning exercise, the pages are never going to get so turned that Democrats in tight races can use the Affordable Care Act as a political weapon. Burwell can manage future bumps so that Democrats aren't surprised in the middle of their campaigns, but the best they are going to be able to hope for is that the Obamacare issue isn't on the front pages. Less time will be spent responding to the latest Obamacare challenge, which leaves more time to talk about the minimum wage, equal pay, or whatever local issue they hope to use to define their opponent. That might not be enough. The problem for Democrats still remains that the people who most passionately dislike the Affordable Care Act are Republicans, and they say they are more likely to vote in November than Democrats do. In the latest NPR national poll, Republicans were 7 percentage points more likely than Democrats to say they are certain to vote this November. And those voters are angry about the law's intrusiveness, its possible collateral damage to the care they already receive, and a host of other issues that can't be mitigated through improved enrollment numbers. Those are all problems that even Secretary Sebelius can't be blamed for."	There Is One More Thing Kathleen Sebelius Can Do for Barack Obama	['Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/the_lbj_comparison_why_every_politician_poses_as_lyndon_johnson.html	"Lyndon Johnson gave his final public speech at a civil rights symposium held at his presidential library in December 1972. He said that watching a panel discussion with Henry Gonzalez, the first Hispanic representative from Texas, and black civil rights leaders like Clarence Mitchell and Julian Bond overwhelmed him. ""I love these men more than a man ought to love another man,"" he said. That was his way of trying to capture what ""a great honor you do me by your participation in these proceedings."" Imagine the honor he would feel on Thursday when the first black president travels to that same location to celebrate Johnson's passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Obama's visit further burnishes LBJ's legacy, but it's not a two-way street. Johnson looms over Obama's tenure more than perhaps any of his predecessors. The pundits ask: Why can't Obama be more like Johnson? Regular people ask, too. During the 2012 election, participants in Obama campaign focus groups asked the question regularly. If only Obama had Johnson's skills, he'd be able to move Congress on immigration or gun control without wasting so much time in circular budget fights. The passage of his health care plan and Wall Street regulation would have been smoother. The anniversary this week has raised these old comparisons and annoyed the president's advisers afresh. The short answer to explain why no president has matched LBJ's legislative prowess is that LBJ had unique skills well suited for a particular historical moment. In fact, if he wanted to get elected in today's anti-Washington environment, LBJ would have to conceal these skills, and the truth is the system has changed so much even LBJ wouldn't be as effective today as he was 50 years ago. But as the Obama presidency winds down, there's a new constituency that benefits from keeping this unfavorable comparison alive: the men and women who would like Obama's job in 2016. A presidential campaign finds its shape in the deficiencies of the current administration. Candidates in both parties will present themselves as leaders who can get something done when nothing is getting done in Washington. They will suggest they have the LBJ skills Obama lacks. That is the message coming from Republican governors such as New Jersey's Chris Christie and Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, and it's the implicit message from Bill and Hillary Clinton when they talk about the culture of partisanship in Washington. If only there were someone in town who could get the two sides to agree. The LBJ critique of Obama rests on the appealing idea that the tools of the presidency are available to any occupant. If only Obama had the talent to pick them up and use them. This is a magical understanding of presidential power, but it's the kind that is encouraged in presidential campaigns. In campaigns, candidates can promise transformation and future effectiveness without much fear that anyone will ask how they will pull it off. It was actually Hillary Clinton who first raised the LBJ comparison during the 2008 campaign. During the New Hampshire primary, she tried to point out that there's a distinction between rhetoric and legislative success. Martin Luther King spoke eloquently and movingly about equal rights, but it took LBJ's legislative know-how to pass the Civil Rights Act. It was a reasonable point, but voters didn't buy it. Clinton was claiming some legislative talent for herself that she didn't really have. Obama's message of hope allowed him to bury the question of experience. He ran against the political tactics of the Clinton years as cynical and self-serving. He was going to find a new way to get things done. So it's no wonder Obama doesn't have a long list of friends on the Hill and doesn't like spending his afternoons massaging congressional egos. He was elected on the promise that he wouldn't be good at those things. And he kept his promise! In interviews with dozens of Republicans and Democrats in Congress over the years, Obama's weak congressional relations always come up. Ask a senator about how many times he or she has talked to the president and the most common reply you'll hear is that when they talk with the president they get the feeling that he is ""just checking the box."" Johnson was the opposite. ""[He] loved to manipulate people, to control events, to feel like he'd put something over on somebody,"" wrote his longtime Senate aide Bobby Baker. ""He loved the process--the flanker movements, pincer movements, the deployment of troops--almost as much as he savored the victories."" Johnson used to say that a president needed to court members of Congress like he courted his wife. He kept track of the vanities and vulnerabilities of the members he needed most and played on them. As Todd Purdum, author of An Idea Whose Time Has Come, the wonderful new history of the passage of the Civil Rights Act, points out, Johnson talked to his enemies and rivals not to convince them to go along with his program but to gain intelligence and create mischief. It's tantalizing, even cinematic, to read about how Johnson operated. It suggests an efficiency almost foreign in Washington today where efforts by one entity can lead to a result that might help people. Johnson had once-in-a-lifetime skills given a boost by big congressional majorities in his party and the momentum of a national tragedy. Proof of how hard it is to move Congress comes not from a comparison to Obama but to John F. Kennedy. Though Kennedy operated in the same political era as LBJ--when it was easier to make deals and presidential threats were more powerful--he didn't achieve as much domestically as Obama did during the same period in his first term. Johnson developed his skills in an institution that now has an approval rating in the low double digits. It's hard to imagine that today's electorate, which has such a foul view of Washington and the unprincipled politicians who work there, would vote for such an operator. It's also hard to imagine that Johnson could rise intact as a public figure in today's saturated media environment. Johnson's skills for understanding human needs came from his own deep neediness. His vindictiveness, penchant for bragging, and bouts of paranoia would never have been confined to the back offices the way they were in his day. They'd be the subject of vast Vanity Fair and New Yorker profiles, and consume endless hours of cable talk. Bob Dole was the last candidate to run as a Johnson-like inside player. Conservatives in his party never really rallied around him because they thought his talent for deal-making and legislative achievement meant he lacked principle. Every inch a senator, Dole could not break out of his upper house's rhetorical style to speak in the flowing sweep required in the modern presidential campaign. But let's imagine that someone with Johnson's skills could sneak into office. He'd have a tough time working his magic. He would find it difficult to engage a willing partner in such a partisan age. Lyndon Johnson had a pool of Republicans who felt a moral pull to pass civil rights legislation. There was no such large group that wanted to pass universal health care so much that they were willing to buck their party. Members of one party who might want to work with the opposite party have to worry about the outside groups--often backed by wealthy donors--that punish collaborators. In Johnson's day, on most legislation he was working to get 51 votes. The increased use of the filibuster has raised that bar to 60. In the 24-hour news environment Johnson's little payoffs and punishments would be exposed immediately. It's not just that the microscope is more powerful. The public takes a dim view of legislation used for personal reasons rather than the good of the country. Others think the government can never work for the good of the country and see inside dealing as feather-nesting, not a necessary tactic to break a deadlock and produce effective government. When Obama tried to buy the vote of Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson on health care, the ""Cornhusker kickback"" was discovered, publicized, and removed from the bill. Given these obstacles, is it time to stop looking for someone with Johnson's skills and rethink what it means to be effective in Washington? Obama supporters argue passage of the stimulus in 2009, the Affordable Care Act, and Wall Street reform are all signs of the president's effectiveness. Those measures were passed without Johnson era bipartisan majorities, which means that while Obama didn't achieve a new era of cooperation, he may have discovered the tactics to win in the new era. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker argues that government can only be effective when one party is in power. But single-party rule isn't likely to happen often, and that still doesn't remove Congress' role as a co-equal branch, which means even if it is controlled by the president's party, a president is still going to need legislative acumen. If Johnson-like legislative skills are in vogue now, voters should probably drop their fixation with candidates unsullied by practical political experience. Voters should also be more skeptical about how candidates are going to get Congress to enact their fancy campaign claims. Is there a candidate who has some share of the Johnson talent who could get elected and yet still be effective once in office? We don't know. Barack Obama never made congressional relations a sustained priority. George W. Bush didn't either. Bill Clinton had a talent for working with his opponents, but Washington is more polarized now. We've never really seen a real test of an all-out effort to woo Congress in the new age of partisanship. Perhaps the kind of talent that can figure out how to work with Congress in its current incarnation only comes along every 50 years."

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/hillary_clinton_is_thinking_about_running_the_former_secretary_of_state.html	"Hillary Clinton has answered a question about her presidential journey again. (Tea leaf readers to the front office, please.) During an interview as a part of an appearance at a marketing conference, the former secretary of state said: ""I am thinking about it, but I am going to continue to think about it for a while. ... The hard questions are not do you want to be president, or can you win. The hard questions are why. Why would you want to do this and what can you offer that could make a difference."" Clinton has said she is thinking about it before--in her Barbara Walters interview and her New York magazine interview. Still, the fact that she said she was thinking about a campaign generated news and interest as it apparently must by order of proclamation. Four thousand shares on Mashable's piece alone. If everyone is going to launch into a dervish of speculation every time Clinton speaks on this issue, we're going to have to pick up our game. It wasn't that Clinton was considering a candidacy that was notable, it was the part that came afterward that was interesting. If you strain your ears, you can hear a tiny shift in what Clinton is saying when she talks about ""why"" she is running. Though she isn't even close to declaring her candidacy, the Clinton 2016 campaign is already coming under fire for lacking vision. (This is like criticizing the food at the China Club restaurant in New York's Freedom Tower, which doesn't open until 2015.) If she rebutted the charge that the campaign she hasn't announced lacks a theme, that would be effectively announcing the campaign, so that's not going to happen. But there is a way to get at this issue. That's a little bit of what Clinton is doing here. No candidate wants to fail the question Roger Mudd famously put to Ted Kennedy in 1979. Mudd asked why Kennedy was running against incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter, and the senator didn't have much of an answer. (It was a tap dance routine that lacked only a hat and cane). This interview fed the belief that Kennedy was just going through the motions because he was a Kennedy and didn't have a real vision for himself or the country. Clinton faces the same problem Kennedy did. As with the son of the famous political family, there is so much noise that attends her presidential ambitions, whether it's talk of her husband, her gender, or her age and health, it's hard for a voter to hear a message even if there is one. Clinton must prove that she is not just running because it's her turn or because she's popular, but because she actually wants to do something. Clinton says that's what she's pondering now. If she can focus everyone on why she might run during this crazy speculative period, they might focus a little more closely on her explanation to that specific question. If she does decide to run, the purpose of her candidacy may not get lost in the circus of the announcement. If Clinton is being honest, and this is the only question she is considering, imagine the box that puts her in if she doesn't run. ""I've decided I can't make a difference."" That seems an unlikely outcome of this period of great pondering. So that means the bidding is open to come up with an answer to the ""why question."" The target answer presumably would be something that hinted at the prosperity of her husband's years but was also forward-looking, rebutting the idea that she's a candidate of the past. It would simultaneously flick at the historic nature of having a woman in the White House while not leaning too heavily on her sex. Oh, and the answer needs to be short enough to fit into Twitter's 140-character limit and leave room for the #Hillary2016 hashtag. Clinton says she's not going to announce until some time next year. Answering the ""why question"" will give her plenty to think about."	How Hillary Talks About Running Without Admitting She Is Running	['Walters', 'Clinton', 'Kennedy']	[]
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/jonathan_chait_race_and_obama_s_presidency_what_about_the_experience_of.html	"If I were outlining a racial history of the Obama administration, it would begin with policy: A housing collapse that destroyed black Americans' wealth; a health care law attacked as ""reparations"" and crippled by a neo-Calhounite doctrine of ""state sovereignty""; a broad assault on voting rights and access to the polls, concentrated in the states of the former Confederacy. Indeed, it would focus on the deep irony of the Obama era: That the first black president has presided over a declining status quo for many black Americans. In short, it would treat race as a real force in public life that has real consequences for real people. You should contrast this with Jonathan Chait's most recent feature for New York magazine, where the story of race in the Obama administration is a story of mutual grievance between Americans on the left and right, with little interest in the lived experiences of racism from black Americans and other people of color. It's a story, in other words, that treats race as an intellectual exercise--a low-stakes cocktail party argument between white liberals and white conservatives over their respective racial innocence. ""If you ... set out to write a social history of the Obama years, one that captured the day-to-day experience of political life,"" Chait writes, ""you would find that race has saturated everything as perhaps never before. Hardly a day goes by without a volley and counter-volley of accusations of racial insensitivity and racial hypersensitivity."" That might fit the experiences of a mostly white pundit class, but it has nothing to do with race as experienced in the ""day-to-day"" lives of ordinary people. When a twentysomething black New Yorker talks about race, she isn't as concerned with the rhetoric of Republicans as she is with the patrol car that trails her teenage brother when he rides his bike to the corner store. In any case, Chait marshals an impressive amount of evidence to make two points: First, that ""racial conservatism"" and ideological conservatism have become one and the same, and that this is true for ""racial liberalism"" and ideological liberalism as well. What's more, Chait argues that the worst suspicions of both sides are true: Conservatives have leveraged racial resentment in service of other political goals, and liberals have wielded the word racist as a weapon against their foes, regardless of the offense. What's odd about the argument is that Chait clearly shows the extent to which conservatism--even if it isn't ""racist""--works to entrench racial inequality through ""colorblindness"" and pointed opposition to the activist state. But rather than take that to its conclusion, he asks us to look away: ""Impressive though the historical, sociological, and psychological evidence undergirding this analysis may be, it also happens to be completely insane. Whatever Lee Atwater said, or meant to say, advocating tax cuts is not in any meaningful sense racist."" Of course, it's not accusing conservatives of ""racism"" to note that particular policies--say, tax cuts to defund the social safety net, or blocking the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act--have a disparate impact. That's just reality. And it's not tarring your opponents to note that race plays a huge part in building popular support for those policies. But again, for as much as this is interesting as a matter of political combat, it's less important to telling the story of race in the Obama years than, for instance, the tremendous retrenchment of racial inequality during our five years of recession, recovery, and austerity. Chait finishes his piece with a note (a hope?) that this dynamic of grievance will become irrelevant with time: ""The passing from the scene of the nation's first black president in three years, and the near-certain election of its 45th nonblack one, will likely ease the mutual suspicion. In the long run, generational changes grind inexorably away."" Yes, the Return of the White President will cause this tension to recede, as arguments over racial innocence--""You're racist!"" ""You're a race baiter!""--fade like the elves of Middle-Earth. But that's only the end of the story if you're most concerned with partisan fights. If it's policy that dominates your racial history of the Obama era, the future is uncertain and filled with questions. By gutting a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, Chief Justice John Roberts has left a gaping hole in Medicaid coverage, cutting millions of blacks and Latinos out of the benefits of the law. Will we fix this, and if we don't, what does that mean for the fight against racial inequality in our economy? Will we do anything to rebuild black wealth and end the long-term unemployment crisis in black communities? Will we end the drug war and move against mass incarceration? Will we buck the Supreme Court and push back against the conservative campaign to dismantle the Voting Rights Act? Will we leave millions of Latino immigrants on the margins of society because a white conservative minority refuses to sign on to immigration reform? And so on, and so on. You could argue that answering these questions--and finding solutions--requires a focus on the nature of racial conversation during and after the Obama era, in which case, Chait's focus is well-placed. If racial conservatism is indistinguishable from its ideological counterpart--if attitudes toward blacks are determinative of attitudes toward government, and vice versa--then that poses a tremendous challenge to ameliorating racial inequality and injustice, both by way of government (a strong social safety net) and its restraint (criminal justice reform). Still, if you're trying to tell the story of race in the Obama years, Chait's version strikes me as utterly ancillary. First and foremost in this history has to be the ways in which race kept its material salience despite the momentous political event of a black president. The partisan reactions to Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis are less important than the activism that emerged around them, in the same way that Republican complaints of language policing are less important than the party's ongoing push for voter suppression. Race matters for reasons far beyond the fact that it is another battleground for partisan combat."

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/mozilla_and_brendan_eich_s_resignation_why_don_t_conservatives_want_to_protect.html	"The Internet is currently worked up over the resignation of Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, who left the company on Thursday following controversy over his support for Proposition 8 in 2008. As my colleague Will Oremus explains, Eich had given $1,000 to the anti-gay marriage campaign, which sparked a minor controversy when it surfaced in 2012, but didn't affect his standing at the company, where he served as chief technical officer. After he was named CEO, however, this changed, and he was forced out by a combination of internal unrest and public condemnation. Defenders of the outcome say that it's a question of public morality; opposition to same-sex marriage is the same as opposition to interracial marriage, and that both are unacceptable opinions for people leading public companies. Critics, on the other hand, see Eich's forced resignation as a chilling attack on free speech. Writing on his website, Andrew Sullivan calls it a ""hounding"" and wonders, ""Will [Eich] now be forced to walk through the streets in shame?"" National Review takes its outrage even further: ""The nation's full-time gay-rights professionals simply will not rest until a homogeneous and stultifying monoculture is settled upon the land, and if that means deploying a ridiculous lynch mob to pronounce anathema upon a California technology executive for private views acted on in his private life, then so be it."" Comparing Eich's critics to a ""lynch mob"" is a bit much, especially given the actual violence gay people have faced for exercising their rights. Beyond that, it's hard not to see some irony in these complaints, given National Review's support of ""religious freedom"" laws in states like Arizona and Tennessee, and its broad view that the free market is sufficient to punish anti-gay businesses and business owners. The Mozilla situation seems emblematic of what conservatives want when it comes to the relationship between business, public opinion, and public sanction. But let's grant that Sullivan and the National Review are right. That Eich's forced resignation is an attack on speech, and that this is an ugly bout of bullying against someone who hasn't expressed his views in the context of his job. If that's true, then Eich is just the highest profile victim of a status quo that threatens countless workers. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act might protect workers from discrimination on the basis of their race, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin, but almost everything else is fair game for private employers who want to get rid of workers. Not only can you be fired for your political views--for sporting the wrong bumper sticker on your car, for instance--or for being ""sexually irresistible"" to your boss, but in most states (29, to be precise), you can be fired for your sexual orientation or gender identification, no questions asked. Overall, the large majority of Americans have at-will employment, which means that--outside of protected classes such as race or religion--they can be fired for any reason at all. For someone like Eich, this isn't a huge deal: He will survive his brush with joblessness. The same can't be said for millions of low-income workers who face termination lest they give their bosses their complete obedience. For a taste of what this looks like, and if you've never worked a retail job, you should read former Politico reporter Joseph Williams on his time in a sporting goods store. For a pittance of a paycheck, he consented to constant searches, unpaid labor, and borderline wage theft. It's a precarious existence, made worse by the fact that saying the wrong thing at the wrong time--either on the job or off it--could result in you losing your job, with no recourse. And of course, employment discrimination against LGBT Americans is a real and ongoing problem. According to a 2011 report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, at least 15 percent of gay Americans have faced discrimination and harassment at the workplace on the basis of their orientation, and at least 8 percent report being passed over for a job or fired. A whopping 90 percent of transgender individuals report some sort of harassment on the job. It's doesn't minimize Eich's situation (if you're opposed to his resignation) to note that gay people are far more likely to face discrimination than opponents of same-sex marriage. In any case, there's nothing conservatives can do about Eich's resignation. But they can join with labor activists and others to push for greater worker protections, like the Employee Non-Discrimination Act. For as much as employer flexibility is important to a dynamic economy, it's also true that no one should fear firing for the people they love, the identity they claim, or the donations they make. Simply put, if conservatives are frustrated by the treatment of Eich for his role in Proposition 8, then they should be outraged by the treatment of ordinary people at the hands of the people who employ them."

The Alabama Republican businessman was at work, walking through a Tennessee steel mill that he was helping get rewired for electricity. It was loud, as steel mills tend to be. McCutcheon's PR team wanted to tell its client that he'd just won at the Supreme Court, which struck down the cap on aggregate donations to multiple political campaigns. Eventually, he checked his messages. He luxuriated in his victory, then went back to work as he became nationally infamous. Democrats, who'd been expecting the court to strike down the donor limits, rotated between Washington's many microphones to denounce this victory for the megarich. ""We have got to be very, very careful that we don't let this great country that people have fought and died for become a plutocracy or oligarchy,"" said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse topped that line. ""It's a little bit ironic that we're spending so much time and energy and effort trying to support Ukraine as it emerges from corrupt and oligarchic government,"" he said at a press conference, ""while we have a Supreme Court that is busily at home kicking down protections that protect American democracy from that same kind of oligarchic government."" At the same podium as Whitehouse, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer warned of a new and inevitable age of ""robber barons."" McCutcheon, who insists he's ""not even that rich,"" found a reason to disagree. ""Schumer has all the benefit of free media, of staff,"" he said. ""There's no telling how much he's raised in his war chest. He's trying to tell us private citizens how and when to speak, but this is about disseminating ideas in the marketplace of politics. More free speech is a good thing. Elected people inside the government shouldn't be talking about what people outside, private individual people, are saying in campaigns."" As campaign finance laws and loopholes boost the power of wealthy donors, a sort of PR arms race accelerates. Democrats, blowtorched by millions of dollars spent on ads by Koch-funded groups, now portray the Republicans as a party owned by ""out-of-state oil millionaires."" For most of March, and every day since, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has attacked the Kochs by name. Democrats have baited Republicans like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Louisiana Sen. David Vitter into defending David and Charles Koch. ""They're fighting for our freedom,"" said Vitter. ""Forward, send,"" typed Democrats. The Kochs have been demonized for so long--at least since 2009 when liberal outlets wrote about the origins of large Tea Party groups--that they've invested in both defenses of their character and hypocrisy charges against the left. In 2011, after months of negative coverage, they sat for an interview with Weekly Standard reporter Matt Continetti. Liberals were simply deranged by the billionaire donors. ""No amount of contrary evidence was enough to dislodge the left's conviction that Charles and David Koch ran an empire hell-bent on America's destruction,"" he wrote. These men were called anti-science for their support of climate change skepticism, even though they ""held master's degrees from MIT and ran successful companies that refined oil, produced chemicals, and manufactured polymers."" The magazine's cover portrayed the brothers literally burning at the stake. In 2012 Continetti became the founding editor of a new Web mag, the Washington Free Beacon. Its coverage of the Kochs and their enemies has veered toward the heroic, with heaving dollops of sarcasm. ""Koch Brother Donates Money to a Hospital, Liberals Protest,"" read one recent headline. Another: ""Poll--'Un-American' Koch Brothers More Popular Than Harry Reid."" On the right, the Kochs are self-evidently populist and patriotic donors, the twin sons of Hank Rearden who are being ""smeared"" by politicians, often in cahoots with the press. The Kochs have company, and a strong narrative. In 2012, the Wall Street Journal started tracking the complaints and Internal Revenue Service issues of donors who'd given big to Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign criticized these donors, publicly. This, in the view of columnist Kimberley Strassel, was the direct descendent of Richard Nixon's ""enemies list."" The theory didn't gain popular acceptance on the right until the IRS scandal of 2013. After that, it made perfect sense. Who did Americans want to side with? Private citizens, who just wanted to speak (in the form of expensive TV ads), or a government that wanted them to shut up? The free speech argument is the focus of a new ad campaign from American Encore, a spinoff of the main hubs of Koch and Koch network money. In it, voters are warned that Democrats like Reid or Sen. Al Franken want to silence ""free speech,"" as represented by a video of suffragists and equal-rights marchers. Their base is sold. But the Democrats, who have exactly the same right to shake money from multimillionaire donors, aren't as proud of it. That's where another ad comes in, by another node of the Koch network. In American Commitment's TV ad, Democrats are shamed for taking potentially $100 million from environmentalist investor Tom Steyer. It started running the same week that Steyer trekked to a New York fundraising event, in an attempt to fund a new anti-Koch campaign. Democrats, by now, are used to being shamed for the support they get from labor unions, funded by mandatory dues. They are less ready to defend their tycoons. All they can say is that their rich guys are selfless, compared to the McCutcheons, or the Kochs, or this week's oligarch. ""It's an investment for them to have lower taxes, and to have weaker environmental laws, and to privatize Social Security,"" said Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a survivor of eight figures of PAC and super PAC spending in 2012. ""Steyer's not asking the people he supports to cut his taxes or to weaken environmental rules. That's the difference."" There has to be some difference, as long as wealthy donors are going to co-star in campaigns. The country does not lack for PR firms or publishers willing to varnish the reputation of a rich guy. The Kochs, for example, are collaborating with an official biographer to tell the story they prefer, as a few unofficial biographies start to hit the shelves. McCutcheon has been plugging away on an e-book, tentatively titled Outsider Inside the Supreme Court. ""I have already lived part of my version of the American Dream,"" writes McCutcheon in the first chapter. ""I worked hard as an electrical engineer to start and run a successful small business near Birmingham, Alabama. I believe passionately in freedom, the private sector, and free enterprise that made that possible for me and other Americans. But on that morning, I felt a public responsibility: one that had unexpectedly moved me into the national debate and spotlight."""

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/paul_ryan_s_new_budget_the_house_budget_chairman_would_slash_benefits_for.html	"""This is my next 'Roadmap,' "" said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, while meeting with poor residents of Cleveland, Ohio. ""I want to figure out a way for conservatives to come up with solutions to poverty. I have to do this."" That was almost a year and a half ago, and in the time since, Ryan has been vocal about his new concern with low-income Americans. Earlier this month, in fact, he released a report on the state of federal anti-poverty programs, which he presented as a precursor to more rigorous work on reforming the system. ""There are nearly 100 programs at the federal level that are meant to help, but they have actually created a poverty trap,"" said Ryan in an interview with the Washington Post. ""There is no coordination with these programs, and new ones are frequently being added without much consideration to how they affect other programs. We've got to fix the situation, and this report is a first step toward significant reform."" Tuesday morning, we finally got the latest step in Ryan's project: The fiscal year 2015 edition of the ""Path to Prosperity,"" Ryan's yearly budget release. But instead of new poverty reforms or anything else to showcase the congressman's interest in low-income Americans, it contains the usual barrage of tax cuts for the wealthy, financed by massive cuts to the social safety net. Ryan doesn't say much about his tax cuts aside from giving basic principles. As with last year's proposal, he wants to ""substantially lower"" tax rates for individuals by consolidating our existing brackets into two, with a bottom rate of 10 percent and a top rate of 25 percent. What's more, he wants to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent and end the taxes passed under the Affordable Care Act. These tax cuts would create a massive revenue hole of trillions of dollars, which is commensurate with Ryan's previous budgets. In its analysis of the 2013 ""Path to Prosperity,"" the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that the congressman's tax cuts would cost $6 trillion over the next decade. There's no way to plug this hole without substantial cuts to the largest federal programs--Social Security and Medicare--as well as military spending. But Ryan isn't interested in reducing the Pentagon's budget and--in the next 10-year window, at least--doesn't want to touch the two retirement programs. Insofar that Ryan even addresses Social Security, it's a recommendation that someone, somewhere, develop a plan. That leaves nondefense discretionary spending--the modest slice that contains our anti-poverty programs--and the Affordable Care Act as the source for cuts, and accordingly Paul Ryan attacks them with a meat cleaver. Over the next 10 years, he cuts $4.3 trillion from this area of the budget. And of that number, more than $3 trillion comes from programs for poor and working-class Americans. Those cuts include a full repeal of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion and an end to subsidies for the state and federal exchanges, which amounts to a repeal of the law itself. The Medicaid expansion, he writes, ""binds the hands of local governments in developing solutions that meet the unique needs of their citizens"" and would ""exacerbate the crippling one-size-fits-all enrollment mandates"" of the current Medicaid program. States have used the expansion to develop new programs and approaches, but Ryan's language of devolution has less to do with experimentation and more to do with his ideological commitment to federal block grants, which are central to his vision for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) as well as Temporary Aid for Needy Families (welfare). In the conservative telling, flexible grants to states--as opposed to federal directives--allow governments to tailor solutions to their needs. But this assumes a political consensus around the welfare state that doesn't exist. In reality, block grants would allow low-tax, low-service states to slash their benefits even further. As we've seen with the Medicaid expansion (which is voluntary), flexibility empowers opponents of social services and harms those who need them most--the majority of people who can't get coverage under the expansion are low-income blacks and Latinos in the ultra-conservative states of the South and Southwest. And the exchanges? He sees them as a dangerous stop on the road to a ""single-payer system in which the federal government determines how much health care Americans need and what kind of care they can receive."" This, I think, would come as a surprise to actual advocates of single-payer health insurance. With all of that said, these cuts are less striking than Ryan's silence on the fate of the uninsured, or the 4.7 to 6.5 million people who have received insurance under the Medicaid expansion, as well as the 7 million people who have enrolled in the private exchanges. To repeal Obamacare is to yank insurance from these people and throw them--as well as the entire insurance market--into turmoil. It's a disastrous approach that doesn't fit with Ryan's rhetoric on the poor and vulnerable. The same goes for cuts to food stamps and welfare. If we've learned anything since Congress cut SNAP funding, it's that private organizations aren't equipped to deal with the level of hunger and need in the United States. Ryan's budget would exacerbate the problem, pushing even more Americans into poverty and food insecurity. Given a year's worth of talk and fanfare over Ryan's concern for the poor, it's tempting to think this is an April Fool's joke; that Ryan will release the ""real"" budget that holds his much heralded reforms to the welfare state. But that's not going to happen. In the real world, the Paul Ryan we know is the same man who launched his career with tirades against the ""takers."" Yes, he might care personally for the welfare of low-income Americans, but it doesn't carry over to public policy. There, his priorities are the same: lower taxes, fewer services, and smaller government."	Is Paul Ryan's New Budget an April Fool's Joke?	['Paul']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/republican_voter_suppression_rationales_why_voter_integrity_is_nonsense.html	"Since 2011, Republican lawmakers in swing states have pushed hard for new restrictions on voting, from voter identification to new rules on early voting and ballot access. ""Nine states have passed measures making it harder to vote since the beginning of 2013,"" notes the New York Times, and other states ""are considering mandating proof of citizenship, like a birth certificate or passport, after a federal judge recently upheld such laws passed in Arizona and Kansas."" Voting rights advocates have attacked these laws as blatant attempts to suppress the votes of low-income and minority voters, but Republicans defend their actions as justified to protect ""voter integrity"" and ensure ""fairness"" and ""uniformity"" in the system. Here's Wisconsin state Sen. Glenn Grothman on a bill--signed last week by Gov. Scott Walker--to end early voting on weekends. ""Every city on election day has voting from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. The idea that some communities should have weekend or night voting is obviously unfair,"" he said. ""It's a matter of uniformity. I don't know what all the hoopla is over,"" he told Reuters. The fact that some communities have a greater demand for voting than others reduces Grothman's logic to obvious nonsense. To wit, under the constraints established by the new law, voters in the cities and large suburbs of Wisconsin are at a disadvantage compared to their rural counterparts. For example, Republicans have limited total early voting time to 45 hours during the week. In order to accommodate the number of early voters in 2012 under that time limit, explained Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, you'd have to have a voter cast a ballot every nine seconds. Areas with fewer voters, of course, would have an easier time. The ""uniformity"" argument doesn't make sense, either--but then, neither does the focus on in-person voter fraud, which doesn't exist. Nonetheless, North Carolina Republicans cited fraud last year when--empowered by the Supreme Court's ruling on the Voting Rights Act, which struck down the ""preclearance"" requirement--they passed a sweeping package of restrictions that cut early voting, ended same-day registration, introduced a strict photo identification requirement, and empowered independent ""election integrity"" groups to monitor polling stations and challenge voter credentials. For as much as Republicans insist that this is about ""protecting the vote,"" evidence suggests otherwise. According to a recent paper from Keith G. Bentele and Erin E. O'Brien, there's a clear pattern to the incidence of voter restrictions. States that elected Republican governors, increased their share of Republican lawmakers, or became more electorally competitive under Republicans were more likely to pass voter identification and other limits on the franchise. The same was true for states with ""unencumbered Republican majorities"" and large black populations--they were especially likely to pass restrictive measures. Not out of racial animus, but because African-Americans are a reliable Democratic constituency. It's clear that these laws are driven by partisanship--an effort to manipulate the rules of elections to blunt the impact of demographic change on Republican prospects. It explains why North Carolina Republicans coupled their push for voter ID with an assault on student voting (closing precincts near colleges and universities and blocking students from running for office) which leans Democratic. Indeed, partisan voter suppression is Texas Attorney General Greg Abott's defense against allegations of racial discrimination with its new voting law. ""The redistricting decisions of which DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial considerations,"" wrote Abott in a brief, ""and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to prove the contrary."" Republican voter suppression might not be an explicit attempt to target low-income and minority voters, but as far as effects go, it doesn't matter either way. The outcome is still one where minorities and low-income Americans have a harder time at the polls. It should be said that none of this is new. Most Americans are familiar with race-based voter suppression--the poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses of Jim Crow--but those are part of a larger history of partisan voter suppression that stretches back to the early 19th century. After a flood of Irish immigrants tipped the electoral scales and threatened Whig electoral prospects in New York, observes Alexander Keyssar in his book The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States, Whig lawmakers rushed to pass tough new registration rules for New York City, which contained the largest concentration of Irish voters. What's more, in states like Missouri, Maryland, and Indiana, Know-Nothing and Whig lawmakers sought to delay voting rights for naturalized citizens, fearing the political consequences of large-scale immigrant enfranchisement. This fear wouldn't go away, and would become a preoccupation of Republican lawmakers in the Northeast. In the late 1880s, for instance, New Jersey Republicans pushed a measure that would have required naturalized citizens to have their naturalization papers when voting--a precursor, of sorts, to voter ID. ""A sad feature"" of New Jersey's requirement, noted the New York Herald, ""was that many persons will be deprived of their vote, as their papers are either worn out, lost, or mislaid."" It's a worry that should sound familiar to anyone concerned about the impact of a strict ID requirement for voting. Today's voter suppression is the clear echo of a familiar past, where an earlier generation of American politicians worked to adjust to immigration, racial change, and newly competitive elections."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/jeb_bush_2016_presidential_run_why_it_would_be_hard_on_the_gop.html	"Jeb Bush is having a moment. For two months or so, as Chris Christie's presidential fortunes have appeared abridged, people who have supported the New Jersey governor (or at least are predisposed to support him) have started mentioning the former two-term Florida governor as a possible 2016 candidate. Should the federal investigation into the George Washington Bridge lane closures become a full-blown calamity, several have said, perhaps Bush could be lured into the race. Now the Washington Post's Philip Rucker and Robert Costa report that the whispers have grown into a draft-Bush movement. The argument for a Bush run is that he has a governor's executive skills, can forge a relationship with crucial Hispanic voters (particularly in a key swing state), and has a fundraising base founded, in part, on a reservoir of goodwill toward the Bush family. Republicans are sick of being out of the White House and want a winner. Perhaps, but Bush is also the perfect candidate if your goal is driving simultaneous wedges into as many fault lines in the Republican Party as possible. The first problem is his heritage. On domestic issues, the Bush family is synonymous among some conservatives with tax increases and federal spending. Perhaps the greatest sin in the modern conservative movement is George H. W. Bush's 1990 budget deal where he traded tax increases for budget savings. Jeb Bush, on the other hand, has cited his father's compromise as the epitome of presidential leadership. George W. Bush is criticized for his lack of spending restraint as well as his support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (which some might count as the second greatest sin). In his positions on fiscal policy, Jeb Bush has given comfort to the suspicious. When asked about the hypothetical trade-off posited during a 2012 GOP debate, where no GOP candidate would accept a dollar of tax increases in exchange for 10 dollars in spending reductions, Jeb Bush took a different view. ""If you could bring to me a majority of people to say that we're going to have $10 in spending cuts for $1 of revenue enhancement--put me in, coach,"" he said at the time. He has also criticized Grover Norquist's no-tax pledge that few GOP lawmakers refuse to sign. Bush even joked during a budget hearing two years ago that these positions ""will prove I'm not running for anything."" The GOP is having a robust debate about foreign policy that is likely to continue into the primaries in 2016. If Bush runs, he will have to field a greater share of questions about the war in Iraq than anyone else. He is appealingly loyal to his brother and father, but managing their legacies will lead to distracting fights, or at the very least increased stress as his opponents, Twitter, and the media bait him time and again. The second problem for Bush is the people backing the draft movement. He isn't being called from the counter in coffee shops or Tuesday Tips club meetings. The support is coming from what one GOP veteran referred to as ""the donor class.""  This group is also variously referred to as the establishment, Country Club Republicans, and the moderate wing of the party. These Republicans are tired of being defined by the unpopular Tea Party wing of the party. Meanwhile, movement conservatives are sick of elites using their money to arrange things without the interference of pesky voters. This, they believe, has led to support for squishy candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney who wind up losing anyway. Bush would enter the campaign wearing the establishment tattoo and carrying the burden of its past mistakes. The final problem is that Bush has taken policy stances against his party's grass roots on the hot button issues of immigration and education. Bush is an advocate for pathways to citizenship and residency for illegal immigrants, positions that House Republican leaders didn't even want to debate in this election year for fear they would cause too big a rift in the ranks. Bush is also an advocate for Common Core education standards, which advocates like Bill Gates say are designed to make the United States more competitive in the world. Grass-roots conservatives are passionately opposed to the standards, arguing that they remove local control of education and dumb down teaching of crucial subjects like math. In Indiana, activists have just convinced GOP Gov. Mike Pence to withdraw the state from Common Core. The tensions that a Bush candidacy would exacerbate have existed within the GOP since the New Deal as members have wrestled with whether to pick a candidate with the best perceived chance of victory or the one who best reflected the philosophy of the conservative movement. Even in 1952, war hero Dwight Eisenhower, the darling of the GOP middle, had to fight off a close battle with Sen. Robert Taft. The Ohio senator was considered a better conservative, but party wizards worried he couldn't win because of his dour personality. These fights are robust, though they do not doom a candidacy. Sometimes they are the necessary clarifying battles that lead to victory. But they are exhausting. Bush has never run at the national level, which Texas Gov. Rick Perry discovered can be very different from having the hot hand at home. Bush has also not run in a race since 2002, an age before Twitter, Facebook, and the towering and repetitive pettiness of the modern presidential campaign. He has a shorter supply of inner sunshine than his brother that would get exhausted by lunchtime on most campaign days. It would be in keeping with Bush's description of himself as an ""eat your vegetables"" politician if he challenged the orthodoxy of part of his party in his campaign instead of trying to skirt his challenges. If he replaces Christie and becomes the new establishment front-runner then a battle is coming."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/pew_research_death_penalty_poll_why_whites_support_capital_punishment_more.html	"We hear a lot about the racial disparity in death penalty sentencing, namely, that black Americans are dramatically overrepresented on death row. Less remarked on is the disparity in death penalty support, as revealed in a new Pew Research Center survey. Overall, 55 percent of Americans support capital punishment, and 37 percent are opposed. Among whites, however, support for the death penalty jumps to 63 percent, compared to 40 percent for Hispanics and 36 percent for blacks. Religion--or at least, Protestantism--seems to increase the divide. At 67 percent in favor, white evangelical Protestants are more likely than any other group to support the death penalty, followed closely by white mainline Protestants (64 percent). Catholics are the least likely among religious whites to support capital punishment, though 59 percent are still in favor. On the other end, religious blacks and Latinos are even less likely than their peers to support the death penalty. Before we get into why whites are so supportive of the death penalty, it's important to remember this: There's no separating capital punishment from its role, in part, as a tool of racial control. As Stuart Banner explores in his book The Death Penalty: An American History, one of the earliest American-made capital statutes--as opposed to ones borrowed from England--was passed in New York in the aftermath of a 1712 slave revolt. Likewise, in Southern colonies like Virginia and South Carolina (where enslaved blacks were close to half the population), legislatures imposed the death penalty for a long list of offenses. For blacks to do anything to interfere with their enslavement was to court death. ""In 1740,"" writes Banner, ""South Carolina imposed the death penalty on slaves and free blacks for burning or destroying any grain, commodities, or manufactured goods; on slaves for enticing other slaves to run away; and on slaves maiming or bruising whites."" He continues:"	The Disturbing Reason Why Nearly Twice as Many Whites as Blacks Support the Death Penalty	[]	[]

The bill's sponsor, Rep. Greg Morris, calls this ""common sense"" legislation. ""Hard working Georgians expect their tax dollars to be used responsibly and efficiently,"" he said in a statement earlier this year. ""Under no circumstance should the government fund someone's drug habit."" My guess is that most Georgians--and most Americans--would agree. But they're wrong. For the vast majority of people on public assistance, illicit drug use isn't a problem. I've made this point before, but it's worth restating the facts. Among women receiving Temporary Aid for Needy Families, the incidence rate for substance abuse is a scant 3.6 percent. Among food stamp recipients, it's similarly low. Operating under the widespread myth that drug use is tied to welfare dependence, states including Utah, Florida, and Missouri have instituted testing requirements for potential recipients. In each case, they've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for little in the way of public gain. In Utah, only 12 people out of 466 showed evidence of drug use after a mandatory screening, at a cost of $25,000. From 2011 to 2012, more than 4,000 Floridians took drug tests for welfare benefits. Of them, 108 failed, at a total cost of $45,780. Mandatory drug tests don't solve a public policy problem as much as they perpetuate the false notion that drug use and substance abuse are concentrated among recipients of public aid. They aren't. But, for the sake of argument, let's say that there were a drug problem among the pool of people who collect welfare, food stamps, and other forms of public assistance. And let's say that some of those people used their benefits to purchase drugs, either directly or through bartering. Even in that case, it wouldn't make sense to drug test for eligibility. Yes, you would save taxpayers some small amount of money, but every person removed from the system is someone deprived of resources--without the means to purchase food and other necessities--and abandoned to their addiction. As a way to show public disapproval for drug use, this is great. As public policy, it's terrible. Among the purposes of the American social safety net is to prevent destitution and reduce the various harms associated with living in poverty. You don't have to approve of their behavior to see that excluding drug users is counterproductive to that goal. If there's a ""right"" approach, it isn't to screen drug users out of the system; it's to use drug tests to connect them with other services. In a sense, you want the government to fund someone's drug habit, with strings attached. For people with positive results, the ""strings"" could include mandatory drug counseling and treatment. You could also have an aggressive move to reduce the harms of substance abuse. For as much as we want to deter people from using drugs, there's no reason not to work to reduce drug use while minimizing the risk of overdose and infectious disease. In fact, deterrence plus harms reduction might be the best option since it could lower the overall cost of drug addiction to local communities. Needle exchanges, to use one example, are cheap and have been found to reduce the incidence of HIV among participants. That's been the case in Washington, D.C., where, as Mike Riggs reports for the Atlantic, such a program has caused an 80 percent ""decrease in the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases where the reported mode of transmission was injection drug use."" Other cities, such as Los Angeles, have found similar results and have saved large sums on treatment costs. If, say, a state like Georgia wanted to be even more ambitious, it could take a page from Vancouver, British Columbia, which operates a medically supervised injection facility for intravenous drug users. Several multiyear studies of the facility have found good results. Not only has it attracted the ""right"" kind of users--men and women at higher risk for HIV and other blood-borne diseases--but the surrounding community hasn't seen an increase in intravenous drug use. In fact, one study found that the average Insite user had been injecting for 16 years and that only one person out of more than 1,000 reported doing their first injection at the facility, a strong suggestion that longtime addicts are coming to its doors, not new users. Insite has also connected users to needed health and social services, from HIV/AIDS treatment to detoxification programs. It's not hard to envision a system where, if you're on public assistance or have applied, a positive drug test connects you to a use facility, where you can use drugs under medical supervision and enroll in treatment if you want to kick your addiction. We could also have the reverse, where we bring people into the public assistance program and then provide them drug treatment if they need it No, voters and politicians won't get the sweet satisfaction of condemning drug use and ""government dependence,"" but there are plenty of ways to register moral outrage that don't require active harm against people who need help. ""But I don't want my hard-earned tax dollars to go to lazy drug users!"" says some commenter I just made up. That's fair enough. I don't want a quarter of my tax bill to go to the national security state. But what you or I want is less important than what we need. And in this case, just as we need a military and its associated bureaucracy, we need a more humane approach to public assistance and drug use. This is one way to do it, and a pretty good one."

Bruce Braley. In the space of just a few seconds, the four-term Iowa Democrat delivered a campaign gaffe of such power that the Environmental Protection Agency may seek to regulate it. Braley referred to the popular Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley as ""a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school."" Why is this so awful? Let us count the ways. Iowa is a farm state, and it's never a good idea to disparage one of the state's chief occupations. Next, it's particularly not a good idea to demean your state when you're somewhere else: In this case, Braley was speaking in Texas. Next, Braley, a trial lawyer, was making his pitch to a room full of trial lawyers at a private fundraiser (which is why he didn't think he was being recorded). Trial lawyers are perhaps the most unpopular constituency among Republican base voters--besides Obama administration officials. Since midterm elections are all about motivating your base, Braley has given his opponent a turnout gift. Next, look where Braley is standing: If you're going to talk down to Iowa farmers, at least don't do it next to a table of booze. It makes for amusing viewing and that reinforces the idea for voters that you're not one of them. Braley's gaffe is the result of both the rise of money in campaigns and the ubiquity of technology. Candidates must raise more and more money--the average amount spent to win House and Senate races has doubled in 12 years--which means more and more evenings by the bar cart straining for money. Since technology is everywhere and cameras are small and always on (see: 47 percent), it also means there will be more opportunities to broadcast candidates when they are saying anything to get elected. And when you want people to like you and they don't show it--whether with money or applause--technology can work in your favor. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell released a new ad in which audiences can be heard roaring approval as he outlines his vision. But listen to the actual speech from which the ad was drawn: The audience responded not with wild approval, but with a golf clap."

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/hypothetical_questions_and_candidates_politicians_are_cowards_for_refusing.html	"At the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague on Monday, President Obama and other world leaders participated in a hypothetical exercise playing out what they would do if terrorists gained nuclear weapons. The event was secret because the leaders were developing actual protocols for this eventuality, but none of the leaders refused to participate on the grounds that it was a ""hypothetical."" We are in the middle of a renewed conversation about American foreign policy. Whether a president's perceived strength or weakness invites aggression from other countries is open for debate again in a way that it hasn't been since the Iraq invasion. As we evaluate the candidates hoping to succeed the president in 2017, the NSS exercise offers an excellent model for actually learning about how a candidate thinks and acts. In fact, American politics would be much better off if hypothetical, role-playing scenarios replaced rhetorical claims about strength and weakness. Candidates hate hypothetical questions, which is why we know that more hypotheticals would improve politics. As Michael Kinsley wrote, ""by labeling a question as 'hypothetical,' politicians and government officials feel they are entitled to duck it without looking like they have something to hide. They even seem to want credit for maintaining high standards by keeping this virus from corrupting the political discussion."" But you can't duck hypotheticals as president. A president spends considerable time in his day evaluating the outcome of certain actions and trying to anticipate various kinds of calamities. When the Obama administration couldn't envision what would happen when its health care website collapsed, the president and his team were judged harshly, as they should have been. It wasn't that they engaged in a hypothetical and made the wrong call. They hadn't engaged in the hypothetical at all. It's not that they made a mistake. It's that they had their heads in the sand. Electoral politics is practically the only situation in the world where you get to be righteous about--and rewarded for--avoiding a hypothetical. At almost every major company, the job interview process requires evaluating hypothetical situations. At Google, it's the most important question, as Laszlo Bock, the senior vice president of people operations for Google, told Thomas Friedman: ""For every job, though, the No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability, and it's not I.Q. It's learning ability. It's the ability to process on the fly. It's the ability to pull together disparate bits of information."" These are the attributes a candidate would demonstrate by answering hypothetical questions, showing us how they would think in real time, what questions they would ask of the experts and how they order things in their world. Anyone can distribute sound bites. This requires thinking. It a perfect world (OK, my perfect world) we'd get candidates to engage in a protracted hypothetical of the kind Fred Friendly used to run on PBS. But since that will never happen, we should at least be able to get candidates to engage in hypotheticals for the purpose of showing us what questions they would ask and explaining to us why they would ask them. We can never know the truly presidential qualities that are required in foreign policy--Does the candidate like to cope with trouble? Can she handle uncertainty? Is he cold and calculating--but by poking around in this area we can at least increase what little we know about how they actually think. Getting answers to hypothetical questions is particularly important in foreign policy because when voters hand over the keys they're giving the president enormous unchecked power. Congress can do little--if its members even know the full extent of what the president is up to. And the consequences for foreign policy failure are worse. As Kennedy used to say, domestic policy can only defeat us, foreign policy can kill us. Candidates would rather have vague foreign-policy discussions because it allows them to play on fear without upsetting anyone with the practical implications of their specific policies. Ted Cruz suggested that Rand Paul is too much of an isolationist, but that word doesn't tell us much that is useful. Cruz offered this distinction as Russia was moving into Ukraine, but both men have essentially the same position on punishing Russia for its aggression, so the use of the buzzword didn't tell us much about what either would do if the situation escalated or what either might have done to keep it from happening in the first place. Candidates will only engage in hypotheticals for the purpose of getting us to imagine the chaos their opponent will unleash. Lyndon Johnson did this with Barry Goldwater, Jimmy Carter did it with Ronald Reagan, and, in 2008, Hillary Clinton did it to Barack Obama. Clinton wouldn't answer hypothetical questions herself, but ran an ad based on a hypothetical presidential emergency that would begin with a phone call to Obama at 3 a.m. As a candidate, Obama was much more forthcoming in evaluating hypothetical situations than his opponents. He famously said he would act on intelligence in Pakistan to go after al-Qaida even if that meant not telling Pakistani leaders what he was doing. This was an instance in which we learned something about a candidate that turned out to be true, a rarity in campaigns. Another favorite candidate trick is to look backward and pick on the various mistakes of their predecessor. Mitt Romney pointed to three instances in which Obama should have acted, in his recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal. Others will no doubt take up these examples. But a firm grasp of hindsight is a weak basis for evaluating a president. Romney's shining moment during the campaign, for which he has been recently praised, came when he accurately evaluated America's relationship with Russia. It was an assessment of the present with a view of the future, a version of hypothetical thought. This is also why voters credited Barack Obama's opposition to the Iraq war. He wasn't against the war after the fact. He was against it beforehand. If a candidate can't take the political risk and answer a hypothetical question then we can't be very confident that she is going to take the risk to act or not when the foreign policy moment comes. But it's not just the candidates who have to get a little tougher and accept the consequences. Voters are on the hook too. If a candidate is brave enough to say what he thinks, the audience has to be adult enough not to take it out of context or extend the hypothetical into its most extreme eventuality. But because candidates fear their answers will be distorted, they will continue to dodge hypothetical questions, calculating that the hits they take for engaging in general dishonesty through nonanswers are worse than the specific damage they may suffer from showing voters what they actually believe."

Nate Silver had rendered his judgment and colored his charts. Months before, while others still saw Democrats holding the Senate, Silver had predicted that the 2014 election was a tossup. Nothing he has seen since has changed his mind. Republicans had recruited strong candidates, Barack Obama had gotten intimate with a 43 percent approval rating, and FiveThirtyEight remained skeptical of Democrats' chances. ""Our forecast might be thought of as a Republican gain of six seats,"" wrote Silver, ""plus or minus five."" The substance of Silver's prediction surprised exactly no one who covers politics. Politico had been covering the shades of Democratic panic for half a year, every time a Republican paid his filing fee. Larry Sabato, the quote-machine political science professor, had speculated back in January that Republicans might ""win it all."" Earlier this month the Atlantic had asked whether carpetbagging New Hampshire candidate Scott Brown would be ""the face of the coming Republican wave."" (Silver rated the possibility of a Brown win at one in four.) But none of those voices mattered like that of Silver, the savant who had predicted the Obama waves in 2008 and 2012, much to the satisfaction of liberal readers. Within minutes of Silver's FiveThirtyEight post going live, DSCC Executive Director Guy Cecil was reminding followers (and reporters) of how wrong Silver had been about the senate (if not Obama) in 2012. Then came Michael Czin, the DNC's press secretary, with more evidence that the party had banked a gaffe file of bad Silver calls, ready to go. The DSCC took a gentler approach later, releasing a memorandum that noted that, bless their hearts, the ""groundbreaking"" FiveThirtyEight team was limited by a ""scarce supply of public polls."" The numbers looked poor now, the memo implied, because ""the Koch brothers and other Republican allies have spent months outspending Democrats, presenting only one (false) side of the story,"" so no fair looking now. The DSCC memo did change the story. It was no longer ""Dems to Lose Senate."" It became ""Dems vs. Silver."" The Silver backlash was inevitable. Silver's cachet on the left, which was high after 2008, became incomparable after 2012. That was the year FiveThirtyEight became a digital security blanket for liberals, a site they could refresh and refresh and refresh some more when their other news sources warned them that Mitt Romney might actually win. In the days before the 2012 election, one-fifth of visitors to the New York Times' website ended up at FiveThirtyEight. Conservatives and defenders of the horse race balked at this. A small conservative news site started publishing ""Unskewed Polls,"" correcting for media bias, and deriding Silver in personal terms. (The site is defunct, but its proprietor now says his ""projection of the presidential race was closer than those of Michael Barone, Dick Morris and Karl Rove."" This is not wrong.) BuzzFeed profiled some of the liberals ""clinging"" to Silver's numbers. Politico's media columnist wondered whether Silver might become a ""one-term celebrity"" after the election proved more dynamic than his polls. Obama won another term, and so did Silver. He never stopped dunking on Politico and ""columnists,"" and his readers never stopped agreeing with him. Older election handicappers--Sabato, Charlie Cook, Stu Rothenberg--relied less on poll averages and more on gut and reporting. They were eclipsed. They've dealt with that. ""A lot of people after 2012 started seeing what Nate was saying as tablets handed down from God,"" said Cook, founder and editor of the Cook Political Report. ""They started acting on it, in terms of donations. So I understand why the DSCC and DNC would bitch and moan about stuff we do, but go nuclear on Silver. The audience that Rothenberg and we have--it's a Washington audience, mostly. It's media, lobbyists, political action committees, political pros, grazing and taking things with a grain of salt. Nate has a very different audience and a sort of aura of infallibility."" Silver cultivates that aura by declining to listen to the Democrats' spiel. According to Cook, the DSCC sat with him and his team for ""hours"" before they issued a tranche of terrifying new Senate race ratings. Silver does not submit to any spin sessions. He collates the numbers, tells readers how he did so, and then laughs at the deniers. Still, Democrats are happy to use Silver for their purposes. When he is bearish on a Republican, as he was on Scott Brown, it makes it into Democratic pitches. When he predicts a bad outcome for a Democrat, it makes it into even more pitches. Doom, the sort of doom that the reader is elite enough both to see and to halt, is a fantastic motivator. So official Democrats are performing a neat mental trick: They actually disagree with Silver--hence their vigorous attacks on his recent forecast--but also use his gloom to help their fundraising. An open question for Silver is whether he'll retain his popularity on the left if the election offers nothing but bad news for Democrats. Do the liberals who checked in daily with FiveThirtyEight and got good news after the Romney-Obama debate in Denver really want to be reminded of how bad the Senate races look? It was one thing to see which way a swing state like Virginia might tip, but it's something else to obsess over a Senate race in a deep-red state where the candidate asking for your donation is going to distance himself or herself from the president you still support. In 2012 BuzzFeed included The Nation's columnist Katha Pollitt in its profile of FiveThirtyEight-obsessed liberals. But in 2014 FiveThirtyEight is giving her no solace. Is she going to keep refreshing? ""I will probably check FiveThirtyEight obsessively,"" she said, ""and search for proof that Nate is wrong by consulting a very Democratic astrologer."""

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/at_t_verizon_t_mobile_sprint_and_auctioning_airwaves_the_corporate_giants.html	"The setting was ornate, the subject esoteric, but the implications huge. The crowd that filed last month into the wood-paneled room 226 in the Dirksen Senate Office Building included lawmakers, lobbyists, company executives, and a few mystery guests--a roster that reflected the enormity of the issue at hand: nothing less than control of the growing wireless market and the hundreds of billions of dollars that go with it. Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile USA Inc. were out in force, as were some of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington, D.C. Along with those household names was the little known but quietly influential Jonathan Spalter. The chairman of Mobile Future, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group, sat at the witness table along with the big wireless carriers and well-known consumer advocates to tell senators how the government should auction valuable airwaves that the telecommunications companies say they need to keep up with the exploding use of smartphones and tablet computers. Spalter told the senators that the best way to ensure a successful auction--one that would best serve customers and promote innovative technologies--is to allow all wireless companies to bid without restrictions on as many frequencies as they want. What Spalter didn't reveal is that Mobile Future, which describes itself as ""a coalition of cutting-edge technology and communications companies and a diverse group of non-profit organizations,"" is funded in part by wireless giants AT&T and Verizon, which are also advocating for an auction free of limits. The group also didn't detail that relationship when it submitted three research papers to the Federal Communications Commission arguing against restricting how much spectrum a company can obtain in an auction. And it didn't disclose the fact that data from a research paper it used to create a graphic arguing against limits was commissioned by AT&T and filed with the FCC, which is writing rules for the auction. Mobile Future does list AT&T and Verizon as among its 82 members on its website. Sally Aman, principal of Aman & Associates, the public relations firm hired by Mobile Future, said the committee ""is and was fully aware of Mobile Future's membership."" But the relationship wasn't clear to almost anyone watching the proceedings. Orchestration of Influence Mobile Future is just one thread in the massive influence web being deployed by AT&T and Verizon as they fight proposals advocated by their smaller competitors and the Justice Department to limit how much of the new wireless frequencies they'll be allowed to bid on at the auction that's scheduled for next year. The spectrum that's up for sale is highly coveted because it allows transmissions to travel long distances and penetrate buildings. Good spectrum is crucial for wireless companies to attract customers by delivering an ever-increasing amount of information to smartphones and computer tablets. The competition for control of the airwaves has set off an intense lobbying fight that rivals some of the largest battles over telecommunications policies of the past. The four biggest carriers together spent $37.3 million in 2013 trying to influence lawmakers and the FCC on a host of policy issues ranging from taxes to cybersecurity as well as spectrum--and the auction is still more than a year away. But the carriers led by AT&T and Verizon likely have spent at least twice as much on behind-the-scenes influence campaigns--hiring Ivy League academics, giving cash to think tanks, associations, and universities, and employing public relations firms--all part of a synchronized effort to sway the FCC to establish rules that favor them, said James Thurber, a professor at American University who has been studying lobbying for 30 years. ""This includes all the advertising, white papers, surveys, grass-roots, and top-roots activities going on,"" Thurber said. ""Lobbying isn't just what the federal registered lobbyists do. It's an orchestration of a variety of techniques and influence."" Battling AT&T and Verizon are Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile, the third- and fourth-largest carriers whose networks and customer bases are dwarfed by their larger rivals. The two have put together their own influence campaigns, hiring teams of paid academics and building connections with consumer groups and associations. But Sprint and T-Mobile are at a disadvantage against AT&T and Verizon's deep pockets and network of political ties, according to those who track Washington lobbying efforts. At stake is no less than who may ultimately control the public's wireless access to the Internet, on which all kinds of data--from medical records and bank transactions to Amazon purchases and movie downloads--travel from providers to smartphones and tablets.

The sale of the newly available airwaves also will determine if the wireless market becomes one ruled by two companies or if a recent burst of competition initiated by T-Mobile will continue, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group in Washington that wants to limit how much spectrum each carrier can purchase in the upcoming auction. ""For wireless carriers, the stakes are enormously high,"" Feld said. If the smaller companies are shut out of the auction, ""it's hard to imagine they can overcome that and compete with AT&T and Verizon over time."" ""Stupid, Arrogant, Broken"" Three years ago the Justice Department blocked AT&T from buying T-Mobile, arguing ""consumers across the country, including those in rural areas and those with lower incomes, benefit from competition among the nation's wireless carriers."" The government was soon proven right. John Legere (pronounced Ledger), the trash-talking chief executive officer who took over T-Mobile in September 2012, has cut prices, eliminated two-year contracts and roaming charges, and offered to pay early termination fees for customers who switch to T-Mobile. Wearing his iconic hot-pink T-Mobile T-shirt and black leather jacket, the maverick CEO declared his industry ""stupid, arrogant, broken"" in a Jan. 9 interview with Yahoo Tech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and said he doesn't much care how his competitors respond to his changes. ""I don't give a s--t,"" Legere said, the expletive bleeped by Yahoo. ""Ultimately, I'm deploying a set of capabilities or a way that the marketplace should behave on behalf of consumers."" But respond they have. All three of his larger rivals--Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint--have cut prices, offered rebates, and instituted less restrictive plans. ""I don't think the people at the Department of Justice are at all surprised at the new competitive options that have emerged in the marketplace,"" said Gene Kimmelman, who worked in the antitrust division when it blocked AT&T's purchase of T-Mobile and is now president of Public Knowledge. ""This is what they hoped would occur and had strong reasons to believe could occur."" The economic benefits to consumers may be short-lived, however. To remain competitive, smaller wireless carriers such as T-Mobile will need to win a significant chunk of the newly available spectrum, or they may never be able to compete with AT&T and Verizon, which as of August 2012 controlled a combined 74 percent of the prime spectrum according to statistics released by the FCC. If left unfettered, the two giants are in a position to buy much of what's left. ""Depending on the outcomes of the spectrum auctions, it could get a whole lot worse in terms of a handful of companies being able to tilt the field in their favor,"" said Matthew Hindman, a professor at George Washington University, who researches Internet politics. Overcrowded Airwaves Spectrum is the lifeblood for wireless carriers as Americans ditch their desktop computers for mobile devices. The share of people in the United States who own a smartphone increased from 35 percent in May 2011 to 58 percent in January, according to a survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. The percentage of adults 18 years old and older who own a tablet computer jumped from 8 percent to 42 percent during the same period, Pew reported.

Wireless gadgets are quickly becoming the devices Americans use to run their everyday lives, from making purchases, managing finances, working, studying, listening to music, or watching movies. The amount of data downloaded from the Internet using a wireless device will, for the first time, surpass the amount of online information flowing through wired connections in 2016, according to an annual report issued by Cisco Corp. All that data will ride on radio frequencies. The growth has caused the airwaves to become overcrowded, slowing data transmissions. ""It is unlikely that wireless carriers will be able to accommodate this surging demand without additional spectrum,"" the White House Council of Economic Advisers reported in 2012. ""Other approaches to expanding the capacity of wireless networks ... will likely be insufficient to allow capacity to keep up with demand. In short, the projected growth in data traffic can be achieved only by making more spectrum available for wireless use."" Beachfront Property The airwaves to be auctioned next year are some of the most valuable that will ever, in the foreseeable future, be available to wireless providers. Most of the spectrum targeted for sale is in the 600 megahertz band of frequencies--what wireless carriers call ""beachfront property."" The frequencies are currently occupied by television broadcasters. The FCC will ask them to give up their airwaves voluntarily and if they don't, some may be moved to another part of the spectrum. The FCC plans to share the proceeds of the auction with those television stations that choose to sell their licenses. The 600 megahertz band is the kind of airwaves that wireless companies want and need. It travels farther than frequencies above 1,000 megahertz, can penetrate buildings, navigate hilly terrain, and more easily go through vegetation, all of which makes it less likely to lose a connection compared with those traveling on higher bands. It's also cheaper to operate because it requires fewer towers. As of August 2012, Verizon and AT&T together owned 74 percent of the low-band airwaves, according to calculations using the FCC's most recent annual report on the competitiveness of the mobile wireless market. Sprint controlled 12 percent, and T-Mobile owned just 0.2 percent. Most of T-Mobile's and Sprint's frequencies are in the higher bands. AT&T and Verizon argue that the high-band spectrum is equally good because it can carry more data, a characteristic that is desirable in urban areas where demand for wireless data is greatest. Corporate accountants, however, put a higher value on the lower frequencies. Verizon says in its company filings that its frequencies are worth $75.7 billion, second only to the combined value of all of its plants, properties, and equipment. AT&T reports its licenses are worth $56.4 billion. Sprint owns more spectrum than any carrier but it is almost all above 1,000 megahertz. The company priced its spectrum at $41.8 billion. T-Mobile, which has about half the spectrum Verizon has, reported its wireless licenses are worth $18.1 billion.

Verizon and AT&T have used their low-band spectrum to build networks that cover much of the United States, allowing them to attract more customers. Verizon has about 119 million subscriptions, or about 35 percent of all U.S. wireless subscribers, and AT&T has 32 percent, according to the latest report by Strategy Analytics, a technology consulting firm. Sprint and T-Mobile, whose networks are spotty by comparison, trail a distant third and fourth with 16 percent and 13 percent of the market, respectively, according to the report. Competition or Revenue? When Congress ordered the FCC in 2012 to hold the spectrum auction, the goals were to increase the frequencies available to wireless carriers, raise money to build a nationwide emergency radio network, and pay down the national debt. The agency now is writing the auction rules to balance the need to raise money with the desire to maintain competition. Verizon and AT&T argue that capping what they can buy will lower the price paid for the spectrum, cutting the revenue to the government, or worse, cause the auction to fail altogether. Sprint and T-Mobile argue caps will allow them and other carriers to obtain low-band frequencies needed to compete against their two bigger rivals. The competition will lower prices and encourage the carriers to develop advanced technologies to decrease costs and improve services. They also argue limits will encourage more bidders, because companies will believe they have a chance of submitting winning bids if AT&T and Verizon cannot bid in every market. More bidders, they argue, means more revenue for the government. The Justice Department agrees with Sprint and T-Mobile. In a filing with the FCC in April that drew sharp criticism from supporters of an open auction, the department's antitrust division argued ""rules that ensure the smaller nationwide networks, which currently lack substantial low-frequency spectrum, have an opportunity to acquire such spectrum could improve the competitive dynamic among nationwide carriers and benefit consumers."" Lobbying War Those opposing arguments are at the center of the lobbying war. AT&T and Verizon operate some of the most powerful influence operations in Washington. Last year AT&T doled out $15.9 million for lobbying on a range of issues, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks lobbying spending. AT&T spent the 11th largest amount of all companies that year, while Verizon ranked 18th. T-Mobile has increased its lobbying 74 percent in the past three years since its purchase by AT&T was blocked, but at $5.2 million it remains far behind AT&T and Verizon. Sprint doled out even less, spending $2.8 million in 2013. The money pays for lobbyists to visit members of Congress, or to urge them to call or write the agency. Sen. Chuck Schumer, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter Nov. 20 to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to urge Wheeler not to institute spectrum limits. Schumer wrote that the caps ""would simply ... reduce the amount of spectrum offered for auction as well as the revenue that would be generated in return"" as broadcasters would choose not to put up their frequencies for sale for fear that they wouldn't be able to get the high price that the big carriers could offer--an argument found in FCC filings submitted by AT&T, Verizon, and their hired economists. AT&T's and Verizon's political action committees gave Schumer a combined $18,000 between 2009 and 2013, compared with $10,000 from Sprint and T-Mobile PACs during the same period, according to CRP. Six Republican House lawmakers--including Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the FCC, and Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the committee's communications and technology subcommittee--wrote FCC commissioners in April in response to the Justice Department's filing, arguing that spectrum caps ""will reduce the potential revenues from the auction and possibly cause the auction to fail."" The six authors, who also included committee members Rep. Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee, Rep. Ed Whitfield from Kentucky, Rep. Billy Long from Missouri, and Rep. Robert Latta from Ohio, received among the largest campaign contributions in Congress from AT&T's and Verizon's PACs for the 2012 elections--a total of $107,000 from both carriers, according to CRP. T-Mobile's and Sprint's PACs gave the group as a whole less than half that much, a total of $42,000, according to the center. Spokesman for Latta and Whitfield said AT&T's and Verizon's campaign donations didn't influence the representatives' positions on spectrum limits. The other members didn't reply to requests for comment.

""AT&T and Verizon have put on a full-scale lobbying campaign and they're spreading money all over town and writing op-eds,"" said Michael Calabrese, director of the Wireless Future Project at the New America Foundation, which supports limits. ""Each side is trying to pressure the FCC, sometimes with public letters, and sometimes with research, and equally often it's with private phone calls."" The spending also pays for lobbyists to visit the FCC, where they meet with the staff writing the auction rules and with commissioners who will ultimately vote on them. Between October 2012, when the FCC issued its notice to develop rules for the incentive auctions, and Jan. 30, when the FCC held a public meeting to discuss its progress, the agency received more than 400 filings that include comments, papers, presentations, and information about visits, Gary Epstein, head of the commission task force writing the auction rules, said at the Jan. 30 meeting. The outpouring ranks the incentive auction among the most active issues at the FCC in years, said a senior FCC administrator. ""It's a lot,"" the administrator said. ""A whole lot."" T-Mobile, which views the auction as a make-or-break event for the company, has been a fixture at the agency. From October 2012 through March 13, lobbyists and executives for the company visited the FCC 36 times, and submitted 20 comments, presentations, letters, and research papers for a total of 56 filings, the most of any organization or company, according to data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity. One of the biggest complaints T-Mobile gets from customers is the inability to get access deep inside buildings, which can be alleviated with low-band spectrum, said Tim O'Regan, a spokesman for T-Mobile. ""Lack of low-band spectrum is the biggest challenge T-Mobile faces,"" he said. ""It's critical to the future of our network and critical for the future of the company."" AT&T and Verizon visited the FCC 15 times each during the same period, according to the center's analysis, ranking the carriers as the fifth most active. Sprint met with commissioners and agency staff 11 times during the same period, which ranked it tied at 11th. It's not the number of FCC filings ""that matters most, but rather the quality and depth of a stakeholder's conversation and advocacy with FCC staff,"" said John Taylor, a Sprint spokesman. The Expanding Opportunities for Broadcasters Coalition, a group of more than 70 television stations that support the auction, had the second most meetings with the FCC, and the National Association of Broadcasters, which may lose members if stations choose to sell their frequencies, was the third-most active group. Other organizations that have often frequented the FCC's offices in southwest D.C. have been the Competitive Carriers Association, a group that includes as members Sprint and T-Mobile and supports spectrum limits, and Dish Network Corp., which is considering launching its own nationwide wireless network. Buying Academic Research But tracking traditional lobbying doesn't tell half the story of the spectrum influence game. Wireless carriers have hired economists from some of the most prestigious universities to conduct research to support specific positions and attend FCC meetings where they can explain arcane auction theories and rebut other economists' papers filed by their rivals. ""With this [spectrum auction], the number of factors that go into what is right and wrong is very complicated and subject to debate,"" Public Knowledge's Feld said, ""so this has been an extraordinary boon to academic economists. If you do spectrum auction research, you are making a lot of money now."" AT&T has assembled the largest team of consultants and economists, most from top universities including Yale, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania. One of the key studies the company has cited during its meetings with the FCC, according to the center's research, was conducted by Philip Haile, an economics professor at Yale University, with co-authors Maya Meidan, an economist at the consulting firm Compass Lexecon LLC, and Jonathan Orszag, also at Compass Lexecon, a former member of President Bill Clinton's National Economic Council. The authors conclude the government would lose up to $13.4 billion if the FCC institutes the mildest limitations and twice that if tougher restrictions are followed. In a footnote on the front page of the study, the authors disclose that the study ""was supported by funding from AT&T."" T-Mobile has the second-largest team, with Greg Rosston, deputy director of Stanford University's Institute for Economic Policy Research and a former deputy chief economist at the FCC, figuring prominently. Rosston and another Stanford economist proposed a bidding process in which spectrum limits are sequentially eased if not enough revenue is raised under the caps. T-Mobile also paid Jonathan Baker, an economist at American University, who argued spectrum limits can increase auction revenue. ""We have retained a number of experts ... to help us respond and provide expert guidance on complex issues,"" said T-Mobile's O'Regan. He declined to disclose how much T-Mobile paid the economists, saying the compensation was ""consistent with what gets charged in the market and the field"" for such research. Enjoying Financial Support Verizon also has paid a former FCC economist on its team, Leslie Marx, who researches auction theory at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. Marx concluded in her research submitted to the FCC that an auction with no limits increases revenue and the amount of spectrum applied for mobile use. AT&T and Verizon didn't reply to repeated requests to comment on its spending on spectrum lobbying and support of research and associations. Sometimes relationships are less obvious. Economists at Georgetown University's Center for Business and Public Policy Research--including a former undersecretary of commerce in the Clinton administration and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' economic research arm--published a study in April 2013 that found spectrum limits would result in ""a less robust and competitive auction and reduce auction revenues by as much as 40 percent"" and slow the transition to faster networks, all arguments that are similar to AT&T's and Verizon's.

The center states on its website that it ""has enjoyed the financial support"" of AT&T and the Verizon Foundation and more than a dozen other organizations. John Mayo, an economics professor and executive director of the center, said the financial support didn't lead to the study or influence its conclusions. He declined to say how much AT&T and Verizon gave to the center. Spectrum caps ""is an important topic that the Center's experts in telecommunications policy proposed would be ripe for research, ultimately leading to our study,"" Mayo said in an email. ""The research methods, analysis, and findings in all Center studies are designed and determined solely by the authors and are released subject to internal quality review with no external input."" The authors state on the front page of the study that their research ""is not dependent upon any of the policy positions of current, previous, or prospective Center supporters."" ""You can have a peer-reviewed journal article with good data by distinguished scholars that comes to a conclusion that goes to a corporate point of view, and that's fine,"" American University's Thurber said. ""But we should clearly know that it does [support a corporate view], and then we can make a judgment about whether there is a conflict of interest."" Sprint has been much less active. The company filed a study by two European economists who found ""restrictions on the amount of sub-1 GHz spectrum operators can acquire at auction have not resulted in any reduction in auction revenue in the myriad European nations that have adopted them."" Sprint and T-Mobile also have funded groups supporting spectrum limits. The two carriers and Dish each gave between $10,000 and $24,999 in 2013 to the New America Foundation, which has met with the FCC to argue for caps on frequencies, according to the New America Foundation website. ""As always we are aligned with the other consumer groups and we are all in a coalition with the smaller carriers,"" the foundation's Calabrese wrote in an email. The financial support from T-Mobile, Sprint, and Dish, however, was ""not for any research papers or anything in particular."" Free Press, a consumer advocacy and journalism organization in Washington that supports restricting spectrum purchases and has testified before Congress, doesn't accept money from corporations and has funded no independent research, according to the group's website. Public Knowledge has received donations from all four carriers for an awards program, and Sprint gave money to the group to analyze FCC spectrum data to develop Public Knowledge's position on limits, according to Feld. But consumer groups are outgunned by AT&T and Verizon. With their big spending on traditional lobbying and funding of associations, think tanks and universities, the corporations play the influence game better than anyone else, said Kevin Werbach, who studies Internet and communications policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. ""This is their core competency, and they have been playing this game for a long time,"" Werbach said. ""These are companies that support foundations and other groups that do a lot of good work, but in the end are strategically designed to advance [AT&T's and Verizon's] interests."" Two Sides of Wheeler FCC commissioners are scheduled to vote on proposed auction rules, including whether it will include limits, at its May 15 meeting. That could open another round of public comments, and at that point the lobbying ""will hit its peak,"" said an executive at one of the wireless carriers.

Two of the Democrats on the commission, Jessica Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn, are likely to support limits. The two Republicans, Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly, are less likely to.

That leaves the affable FCC chairman, Tom Wheeler, whom President Barack Obama appointed last year, to decide. Wheeler knows a lot about lobbying, having headed up the National Cable Television Association, one of the biggest lobbying spenders in Washington, and the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association. Wheeler, who wields a lot of power as chairman, hasn't indicated how he would vote. At a speech at his alma mater, Ohio State University, he described himself both as ""a rabid believer in the marketplace"" and as ""an unabashed supporter of competition."" ""A key goal of our spectrum allocation efforts is ensuring that multiple carriers have access to airwaves needed to operate their networks,"" he then said.

It remains to be seen which Wheeler will show up to vote--the former lobbyist who fought federal regulations and whom an AT&T lobbyist called ""an inspired pick to lead the FCC"" or the Obama appointee who believes that the wireless market needs more, not less, competition.

It's supposed to invoke a certain fealty to the principles of the Founding Fathers: ""As a constitutional conservative,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann in 2011, announcing her presidential run, ""I believe in the Founding Fathers' vision of a limited government that trusts in and perceives the unlimited potential of you, the American people."" It's tempting to treat the phrase as mere rhetoric, but--as Ed Kilgore explained in the New Republic at the time--that's far from the case. ""[Constitutional conservatism] commonly connotes an allegiance to a set of fixed--eternally fixed, for the more religiously inclined--ideas of how government should operate in every field,"" he wrote. ""Constitutional conservatives think of America as a sort of ruined paradise, bestowed a perfect form of government by its wise Founders but gradually imperiled by the looting impulses of voters and politicians."" This isn't ideology as much as it's theology, transferred to politics. In particular, it's the ""premillennialism"" of fundamentalist Protestantism, which holds Eden as the pinnacle of human existence, and sees the present (and the future) as a hopeless corruption to be abandoned with the return of Christ and the rapture of the faithful. Let's ignore its merits as a theological approach; as an approach to history and politics, it's an impossible sell. In 18th-century America, women were second-class citizens, natives were driven from their land, and blacks were enslaved as a matter of course. And the founders, as self-interested elites, codified this in the Constitution with limited voting rights, disregard for Native Americans, protection for the slave trade, and a compromise that made slavery a political boon for slave-owners. The only way to balance this with constitutional conservatism is to pretend the founders were moral demigods who met and surpassed the challenges of their time. It's why Bachmann could say, with a straight face, that the founders ""worked tirelessly until slavery was no more in the United States,"" blind to the fact that George Washington held slaves and Thomas Jefferson was an innovator in the world of slave torment and slave labor. And it's why, last week, Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint--who also calls himself a constitutional conservative--could give this gobbledygook take on American abolitionism:"	Why the Heritage Foundation's Jim DeMint Doesn't Understand Basic American History	[]	[]

Working at Northwestern University, psychologists Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson apply that question to demographic change, and, in particular, to white Americans vis-a-vis the prospect of a United States where the majority of Americans are drawn from today's minorities. Does a threat to one's status as the demographic ""in-group"" increase political conservatism? The answer, in short, is yes. Using a nationally representative survey of self-identified politically ""independent"" whites, Craig and Richeson conducted three experiments. In the first, they asked respondents about the racial shift in California--if they had heard the state had become majority-minority. What they found was a significant shift toward Republican identification, which increased for those who lived closest to the West Coast. In the second experiment, they focused on the overall U.S. shift with census projections of the national population. Again, they found that white Americans became more conservative--and more likely to endorse conservative policies--when they were aware of demographic changes that put them in the minority. The final experiment--where questions were further refined and targeted--saw similar results. As Craig and Richeson write, ""Perceived group-status threat, triggered by exposure to majority-minority shift, increases Whites' endorsement of conservative political ideology and policy positions."" What's more, this held true even after they told respondents ""whites are likely to remain at the top of the future racial hierarchy."" The study is fascinating, and the empirical data is worthwhile. But if you're familiar with our history or politics, it shouldn't come as a surprise. Last year, for example, Democracy Corps, a Democratic polling firm, did a series of focus groups with conservative Evangelicals, Tea Party voters, and moderate Republicans. The goal was to ""understand the government shutdown and crisis in Washington"" and try to ""get inside the base of the Republican Party."" To that end, pollsters would sit down with various kinds of Republicans and figure out their concerns and fears. Near the top of the list, they found, was a deep consciousness of being ""white in a country with growing minorities."" One participant described his town as such:"	Could America Become Mississippi?

I do live in Virginia. And I am pissed. Because there is no excuse, not one, to block the Medicaid expansion, and no reason to shut down state government to do so. The Commonwealth of Virginia is modeling dysfunction yet again this month, as the legislature fights to the death over Gov. Terry McAuliffe's proposed two-year, $97 billion budget. The government is imploding in large part due to the fact that state Republicans in the House of Delegates have decided to fight tooth and nail--up to and including shutting down the whole government if this is not resolved by July--to avoid expanding Medicaid benefits to cover up to 400,000 lower-income Virginians who fall into the health care coverage gap. These are the folks who can't afford to purchase health care under the ACA, but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. The ACA would have taken care of those people through an expansion of Medicaid--money from the federal government to the states to cover the gap. The high court, in 2012, left it to the states to decide whether to accept the expansion. Virginia is one of the states having a hard time making up its mind. As with all government shutdowns, the answer to ""why is this happening?"" is ""Republicans hate Obamacare."" Last year, under the leadership of then Gov. Bob McDonnell, Virginia passed a controversial transportation bill that fractured the GOP by raising taxes to pay for new highways. The $6 billion transportation package also contained language sought by state Democrats that would create a bipartisan commission to explore Medicaid expansion and, at least the Democrats believed, would open the door to accepting the expansion. The commission did what it had to do and did it fairly well, but now finds itself gridlocked, since the Virginia GOP has pulled together to block the expansion. Sixty-six out of 67 Republicans in the 100-seat House voted against the Medicaid expansion, claiming that the federal government cannot possibly afford to pay the $2 billion bill when it comes due and also that the whole Medicaid program is broken. (The federal government only promises to pay for a limited time, then the state begins to incur some small obligation. Republicans don't believe the obligation will be small, or that the program can stay solvent.) Last week McAuliffe proposed a two-year pilot expansion of Medicaid, which could be canceled if it proved unsuccessful. This seemed very reasonable. The House Appropriations Committee killed it. So yesterday, in Richmond, both the Senate Finance Committee and the Medicaid Innovation and Reform Commission met to argue and vote about stuff. Republicans blamed Democrats. Democrats blamed Republicans. Everyone blamed gerrymandering and gridlock and ideology. It's worth at least pointing out here that the same House Republicans set on blocking the expansion represent 32 out of the 50 House districts with the most residents enrolled in Medicaid at current levels, at least according to this study from the University of Mary Washington. The representatives from the poorest districts, where residents who aren't on Medicaid desperately need it, are fighting hardest against helping their constituents. As the Post points out, recent polls suggest that voters support the expansion more than they oppose it. So, as always, GOP politicians are banking on the fact that voters are more afraid of Obamacare in theory than they are desperate for health care in reality. But have you noticed that all this debate has absolutely nothing to do with what happens if we fail to close the Medicaid gap? That GOP lawmakers can talk for hours and never once acknowledge what is actually happening to low-income Virginians who fall into the gap right now? Last weekend 60 Minutes did a terrifying segment on the Virginians who are unable to access affordable health care for diseases that range from cancer to epilepsy to black lung. Make no mistake about it: People without preventive care do die. According to the Virginia Poverty Law Center, the ACA establishes a new national Medicaid income eligibility level at 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Line. (That's about $15,400/year for an individual; $32,000/year for a family of 4.) Virginia's current program is very limited, and eligibility levels for adults are among the worst in the U.S. Parents' eligibility is under 30 percent FPL ranking Virginia 44th in the U.S. Virginia is ranked 48th in per capita Medicaid spending. Studies show that people will die because of states' decisions to not expand coverage. The poorest are being cared for, the rest of us can buy insurance. The folks who fall into the gap get nothing. Of the 32,100 Virginia veterans who do not have health insurance, 12,300 could qualify if the coverage gap were closed. A quarter of the people who fall into the coverage gap are parents with kids under 18. An expansion would infuse significant mental health dollars into our system. These families are literally too ""rich,"" with their minimum wage jobs, to afford health insurance, and too poor to afford health insurance. My friend Elizabeth Carpenter is a visiting home nurse who works with low-income and immigrant families here in Virginia.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/neocons_and_rand_paul_what_libertarians_don_t_understand_about_american.html	"We neocons have fallen out of favor, not just on the left, where ""neocon"" is routinely used as a term of abuse, but also on the right, where libertarian-minded conservatives who favor a smaller (and cheaper) military have seized the initiative. Rand Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky, is just one of many Tea Party conservatives who has defined his foreign policy views in opposition to the neocons. And it's easy to see why. Eleven years ago this week, Baghdad fell to U.S. forces. Donald Rumsfeld, who at the time was serving as George W. Bush's defense secretary, famously dismissed the lawlessness that followed the collapse of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship by oh-so-helpfully observing that ""stuff happens."" The Bush administration, from the president on down, seemed serenely confident that for all the madness of those first weeks, Iraqis would soon take advantage of their liberation and partner with U.S.-led coalition forces to build a new democracy. As we all know, that's not quite how it played out. From 2003 to the end of 2011, when U.S. forces declared a formal end to their operations in Iraq, 4,803 American, British, and other allied troops died in the conflict. These are the deaths that badly damaged the reputations of Bush, Tony Blair, and other leaders who sought regime change in Iraq. The overall human cost of the war in Iraq was much larger still. One oft-cited survey found that as many as half a million Iraqis died during the U.S.-led occupation, a number that includes those who died directly from violence as well as those who died indirectly from maladies caused or exacerbated by the bloody civil war and the displacement it caused. Though we can't know what the world would have looked like had the Bush administration not chosen to wage war in Iraq, and though it is at least possible that the region and the world might have looked even worse with Saddam Hussein still in power, I find it hard to imagine that the benefits outweighed the enormous costs. Most Americans would surely agree. At a bare minimum, those of us who favored the war might have hoped for a democratic Iraq in which the rights of ethnic and religious minorities were respected and that was more closely aligned with the United States than Iran. The new Iraq fails on both of these counts. Given all of this, why am I still a neocon? Why do I still believe that the U.S. should maintain an overwhelming military edge over all potential rivals, and that we as a country ought to be willing to use our military power in defense of our ideals as well as our interests narrowly defined? There are two reasons: The first is that American strength is the linchpin of a peaceful, economically integrating world; and the second is that we know what it looks like when America embraces amoral realpolitik, and it's not pretty. Like it or not, America's failure in Iraq does not change the fact that global stability depends on American global leadership, and American global leadership costs money. The United States is at the heart of a dense web of alliances. We extend formal security guarantees to more than 50 countries. Some see these alliances and guarantees as little more than a burden the U.S. can no longer afford. Yet what they actually do is dampen security competition. They reassure partner countries that they needn't build up their militaries to defend themselves against their neighbors, which then reassures their neighbors that they needn't build up their militaries. This virtuous cycle is one of the central reasons Western Europe and Japan recovered so quickly after the devastation of World War II, and why globalization has helped ease poverty around the world. For this virtuous cycle to be maintained, however, U.S. security guarantees must be considered credible. It must be clear that when the U.S. makes a security commitment to another country, that commitment will be met. This in turn means that the U.S. military must have the power and the reach to defend countries far from our borders. You may have seen one of those charts illustrating how much the U.S. military spends on defense vs. other countries. Slate recently ran just such a chart to show that America's 2012 defense spending surpasses that of China, Russia, the U.K., Japan, France, Saudi Arabia, India, Germany, Italy, and Brazil combined. The implicit message of these charts is ""Wait a minute, you guys--doesn't this seem like overkill?"" There is no question that there is waste in the U.S. defense budget, and that our military could deploy resources more effectively. But these charts are misleading insofar as they gloss over a pretty important fact, which is that personnel costs are much higher in rich countries than in poor ones. Stack up the U.S. against the same list of countries on health or education spending and you'll find that we spend an impressive amount in those domains too. The health and education sectors, like the military, are sectors that depend on hiring and retaining trained personnel. Keeping smart, hardworking people in these sectors means paying wages high enough to keep them from taking jobs elsewhere, including in sectors where productivity growth is much higher. That is expensive. Personnel costs absorb half of the U.S. military budget, as opposed to a third of China's. There are things we can do to contain high and rising personnel costs. Tim Kane, an economist at the Hoover Institution and an Air Force veteran, has written an excellent book on how the military can manage its human resources. And of course we could rely more heavily on drones and other labor-saving technologies. But as long as the military intends to employ talented Americans, it's going to be expensive. Liberals who want to raid the defense budget to finance social programs and libertarians who want to slash it to finance tax cuts need to wake up. A weaker U.S. military will mean a more dangerous world, and that will jeopardize everything that matters. Of course, all of these arguments could be true and one could nevertheless believe that the U.S. should avoid doing anything more than narrowly fulfill its security commitments. Why insist on moralistic crusades, as neocons are wont to do? I suppose I have a personal reason for doing so. It turns out that this week isn't just the anniversary of the fall of Baghdad. It is also the 43rd anniversary of a telegram in which an American consul general, Archer Blood, took the unusual step of condemning his own government. As Gary Bass recounts in his chilling book The Blood Telegram, Richard Nixon and his chief foreign policy consigliere, Henry Kissinger, enthusiastically backed Pakistan's military junta in its efforts to not only overturn the results of its country's first free and fair election, but to massacre hundreds of thousands of Bengalis in an effort to teach what was then a rebellious province a lesson. One of the men who died, as it happens, was my uncle. Knowing fully well that he was endangering his career, Blood decried the American failure to defend democracy or to denounce Pakistani atrocities. He also knew that had President Nixon decided to lift a finger, he could have forced Pakistan to stay its hand. Yet it seems that humanitarian considerations never entered the picture for Nixon and Kissinger. They were apparently too taken with treating the world as a chessboard to bother reckoning with the monstrous crimes they were aiding and abetting. Though Pakistan was unable to prevent the emergence of an independent Bangladesh, thanks in large part to India's decision to intervene, the country remains scarred by the bloodletting. Imagine if a different president hadn't cheered on Pakistan's military rulers but rather threatened to use U.S. power in defense of Bengali civilians. The neocon impulse proved badly misguided in Iraq, where it contributed to a moral calamity. But there are other cases, in South Asia in 1971 and in Bosnia in the early 1990s, to name two examples among many, where it might very well have prevented one.

We aren't afraid to be associated with the people who came up with us."" That's Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks writing in defense of his friend, DeSean Jackson, who was cut from the Philadelphia Eagles amid reports of gang ties. Sherman isn't trying to litigate the allegations or exonerate Jackson--he doesn't know the details. But he doesn't think it's wrong for Jackson to associate with the men from his childhood. And why would it be? Yes, some of them have criminal records--and for some, that includes gang activity--but leaving home is hard, and the social distance of wealth makes it even harder. As Sherman writes, ""In desperate times for people who come from desperate communities, your friends become your family. I wouldn't expect DeSean to 'distance himself' from anybody, as so many people suggest pro athletes ought to do despite having no understanding of what that means."" I don't know if Sherman sees it or not--my hunch is that he does--but in a few sentences, he's put his finger on the pulse of something overlooked in our discussions of poverty and economic mobility as they relate to black Americans: neighborhood. Sherman's experience of being pulled back to a poor neighborhood, even as he accumulates wealth, is common among blacks. The difference for ordinary black Americans, as opposed to NFL stars, is that this has been a powerful driver of downward mobility. Just a quick comparison of black and white neighborhoods is enough to illustrate the particular challenges that face black families as they reach for middle class, or try to keep their position. The key fact is this: Even after you adjust for income and education, black Americans are more likely than any other group to live in neighborhoods with substantial pockets of poverty. As sociologist Patrick Sharkey shows in his book Stuck in Place, 62 percent of black adults born between 1955 and 1970 lived in neighborhoods that were at least 20 percent poor, a fact that's true of their children as well. An astounding 66 percent of blacks born between 1985 and 2000 live in neighborhoods as poor or poorer as those of their parents. A recent report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation affirmed this fact. According to the foundation, only 50 percent of black children live in neighborhoods with a poverty rate below 20 percent, compared to a national average of 74 percent. Of course, the other way to say this is that 50 percent of black children live in neighborhoods with poverty rates of greater than 20 percent.* How does this stack up to white families? Here, Sharkey is indispensable: Among white children born through 1955 and 1970, just 4 percent live in high poverty neighborhoods. Or, put another way, black Americans live with a level of poverty that is simply unknown to the vast majority of whites. It's tempting to attribute this to the income disparity between blacks and whites. Since blacks are more likely to be poor, it stands to reason that they're more likely to live in poor neighborhoods. But the fact of large-scale neighborhood poverty holds true for higher-income black Americans as well. Middle-class blacks are far more likely than middle-class whites to live in areas with significant amounts of poverty. Among today's cohort of middle- and upper-class blacks, about half were raised in neighborhoods of at least 20 percent poverty. Only 1 percent of today's middle- and upper-class whites can say the same. In short, if you took two children--one white, one black--and gave them parents with similar jobs, similar educations, and similar values, the black child would be much more likely to grow up in a neighborhood with higher poverty, worse schools, and more violence. This is an outright disaster for income mobility. According to Sharkey, a child with roots in a high poverty neighborhood has a 64 percent chance of moving down the income ladder over the course of his or her lifetime. Given their circumstances, blacks face a reversal of their gains over the last generation. Simply put, the persistence of poor neighborhoods is a fact of life for the large majority of blacks; it's been transmitted from one generation to the next, and shows little sign of changing. All of which raises an obvious question: Why do blacks have a hard time leaving impoverished neighborhoods? ""When white families advance in economic status,"" writes Sharkey, ""they are able to translate this economic advantage into spatial advantage by buying into communities that provide quality schools and healthy environments for children."" The same isn't true for black Americans, and some of the answer has to include present and ongoing housing discrimination. For example, in one study--conducted by the Department of Housing and the Urban Institute--black renters learned about fewer rental units and fewer homes than their white counterparts. Once you grasp the staggering differences between black and white neighborhoods, it becomes much easier to explain a whole realm of phenomena. Take the achievement gap between middle-class black students and their white peers. It's easy to look at this and jump to cultural explanations--that this is a function of black culture and not income or wealth. But, when we say middle-class black kids are more likely to live in poor neighborhoods, what we're also saying is that they're less likely to have social networks with professionals, and more likely to be exposed to violence and crime. This can have serious consequences. Youthful experimentation for a white teenager in a suburb might be smoking a joint in a friend's attic. Youthful experimentation for a black teenager might be hanging out with gang members. As Mary Pattillo-McCoy writes in her book Black Picket Fences: Privilege and Peril Among the Black Middle Class, ""Youth walk a fine line between preparing for success and youthful delinquent experimentation, the consequences of which can be especially serious for black youth."" DeSean Jackson is still an NFL player, and--as a player for Washington, D.C.'s professional football team--will make a tremendous amount of money. He can keep his connections to his friends, he can live in the same neighborhood, if he wants, and downward mobility won't be a pressing concern. For millions of more ordinary black Americans, however, the opposite is true. Even with more income and more education, they're stuck in segregated neighborhoods. Yes, there isn't much mobility for anyone, but that fact is especially true for blacks. Indeed, when someone says that America has a ""racial hierarchy,"" this is what they mean: Whether times are good or bad, blacks remain at the bottom. Correction, April 4, 2014:This article origially misstated that 50 percent of black children live in neighborhoods with poverty rates of greater than 50 percent. They live in neighborhoods with poverty rates greater than 20 percent. (Return.)"

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/barack_obama_health_care_and_7_million_how_the_president_learned_the_value.html	"On Tuesday, President Obama celebrated the success of two franchises known for their long-suffering fans: He hosted the World Series champion Boston Red Sox and announced that his health care plan had signed up 7.1 million people. That number exceeded the hopes of administration officials before Oct. 1 of last year when the six-month sign-up period began. Given the protracted calamity of the launch of the health care website, besting the 7 million target was a near miracle. ""Armageddon has not arrived,"" said the president, tweaking the Republicans who have fought him at every inch as he has tried to implement the law. The final assessment of the Affordable Care Act is a long way off, but one preliminary conclusion can be drawn from this milestone: ""No Drama"" Obama learned the focusing power of panic. A president who came to office promising an end to the private drama of the Clinton era and the global drama of the Bush era and whose greatest personal attribute may be his placid temperament was in the Rose Garden on Tuesday celebrating the clarifying benefit of a big collective freakout. Before the failed launch of the Affordable Care Act, senior administration officials regularly attested to the president's focus on the implementation of the law. He asked about the Oct. 1 launch every day. When administration officials were forced to address what they saw as silly distracting issues--from questions about the response to the Benghazi, Libya, attack to the Internal Revenue Service scrutiny of conservative groups--they said they were focused on bigger, more important things. Chief of staff Denis McDonough told his staff to focus 90 percent of their energy on important things and only 10 percent on the daily obsessions of their opponents and the news media. A big portion of that 90 percent was presumably making sure that the health care launch would go well. Then it didn't go very well at all. Despite the stakes, the supposed focus, and three years to plan, the administration was not equipped to carry out its mission. It was only after everything fell apart and Democrats up for re-election started screaming that the administration went to its panic stations. The president moved aside the architects of the sabotage who had been running the show and installed management consultant Jeffrey Zients. He also brought back political veterans to man the rescue effort, which identified problems and tackled them in a systematic way. Under less fraught circumstances, administration officials might have worried more about the possible political fallout of repeatedly moving deadlines and modifying the law on the fly, but in crisis mode, the choice became easier. The repair effort did not take on all the hallmarks of panic. None of the key players were ever held accountable by firing, but the pace quickened, and the performance improved considerably. There is a management question at the heart of this management failure. Could the 7 million figure have been reached without the panic? If the site had been working from the first day, perhaps the sign-ups would have netted 7 million. But without the illuminating mood of panic--which focused the mind and allowed for bringing in talented people who had a mandate to cut through the bureaucratic fog--would it have been possible to create a website that worked? Would the president have been so easy to persuade that he should appear on Between Two Ferns? Would it have been so easy to mobilize the entire operation for the push that included more than 300 radio appearances by the president and others in the administration, 5,000 events on the ground, and 33 million views on the specialized online content they produced? The battle-stations effort Politico reports on was not there before the calamity, and there's no evidence that the president and his team could generate that kind of action on their own. Unlike the Red Sox, the administration hasn't won the title; it's simply come from behind in Game 1 of a multigame series. We won't know how the health care law is working until we learn how many people have paid, how healthy they are, and where they live in the country. Then we'll see how the insurance companies calculate their premiums, whether doctors and nurses are available to treat all the new patients, and how big the reduction is in the number of uninsured. If all of those figures ratify the sense of satisfaction at the White House, there will still be a big management question up for grabs. Was the colossal management failure of the Obamacare launch the predictable result of trying to get the government to do something so big in a time of near absolute partisanship, a special screw-up of the Obama team, or some combination of the two? The president said Tuesday that the rollout was simply what ""change looked like."" (All births are messy!) But if that's so, and this is just the normal way of things, then that tells us something about the Obama management model or perhaps White House management more broadly. The only way to do big things is either to create an existential panic or to have a chief executive who can instill a little drama on the front end before the focusing fire drill begins."

Would they sign up for Obamacare? In the first installment, back in October, our intrepid insurance-seekers struggled and eventually failed to log on to healthcare.gov. In the second, they started to understand their options, but often snapped their laptops shut, unsatisfied. Yesterday, the early enrollment period for the new health care exchanges came to an end. We checked in with our reporters to find out if they got the care they wanted, or if it was ripped away from them. Aaron W., 33, Wilmington, Del. So I managed to enroll around Dec. 10 in time to have my platinum level coverage take effect on the first of January. Ultimately I ended up having to enroll on the phone since I could never get the website to work. I think trying to enroll during the first days of October made it so I couldn't log on to the website even with the staff trying to reset my account. I knew what plan I wanted and the only downside was that I couldn't research the supplemental dental and vision plans I was going to select. So I paid my first premiums toward the end of the month and I took advantage of the plan pretty quickly during the month of January and got a vision checkup, a colonoscopy, and started to see a therapist. I also started taking all the medications I had been prescribed but wasn't taking because of the costs. Strangely though, as I was going through all of this and talking about how awesome it was to have health insurance for the first time in more than a decade, my managers realized that I was someone they wanted to have in a formal full-time capacity at the liquor store I work at, and they changed my status from a part-time to full-time. I decided to get covered by their PPO, which is as good and perhaps a little better than the platinum level of the health care exchange, and less money to boot. The only downside is the platinum plan had slightly lower medication costs, but the monthly savings more than take care of the difference. I think that for me, a reasonably unhealthy person who would have never been covered under the old health care regime, considering I had multiple pre-existing conditions, this has been an unmitigated success. Toby Dillon, 36, Toole, Utah So far, we've put about $500 into the pot and taken none out. It's nice to have the security blanket of ""If we find out I have cancer tomorrow, we're not all on our own"" but mostly, life continues apace with a premium that means I don't get as many lunch-on-the-go opportunities as I'd like. The only thing of note is how difficult it is to pay the premium. After signing up, paying the first month online, I kind of expected we'd pay online for each month. Somewhat interestingly, though, the company we're with, which has been in business for at least a decade, has no online bill payment option. In fact, they don't even have an option to talk with billing without specifically asking for it through a regular customer service rep. They send notices that say we haven't paid and they'll cancel our policy while, at the same time, saying that we're paid up when I call. It's almost Lovecraftian in the madness. If I were a conspiracy theorist, I'd think they were trying to make it so that they have a paper trail to prove that we didn't pay the premium and that's why they cut off our benefits, when in fact they apparently make it as hard as possible to pay. Erin Molnar, 25, Ferndale, Mich. My son just turned 6 months old yesterday. We discovered with the help of the hospital that we could get a form of Medicaid for both our hospital stays and for his care thereafter. We have a high monthly deductible before it kicks in since we exceed the income requirements for Medicaid. So we have been paying for his well visits, sick visits, and immunizations out of pocket. I have been unemployed since Sept. 13. I was just offered three jobs in the past few days. One is 30 hours a week, so it would not provide health benefits. The other two have good benefits packages, and the premiums are about one-fifth of what we would pay for a silver plan on the health exchanges, even with subsidies (which we wouldn't qualify for once I go back to work). The plans on the health exchange exceed 8 percent of our income. Had I been offered the part time job prior to these other offers, I would have taken it and we would have chosen not to buy insurance because of the high premiums. We would rather have taken our chances; we simply don't have that much extra money per month. And honestly, paying out of pocket means we get discounts on services and don't have to ever fight with insurance companies for coverage. That being said, I will likely accept one of the offers with benefits. There are other reasons why, but the benefits are a factor. It's unfortunate that I still can't take a part-time job that might be better for my family because we can't afford health care otherwise. Ali Diercks, 27, Hilton Head, S.C. I did get signed up and I am now covered. But oh my god, was it a convoluted and long, hard road out of hell. I started trying to sign up on the ACA website on Oct. 1 at 8 am and didn't succeed until Dec. 18. I tried almost daily. I got stuck at the identity verification stage on my first application and it couldn't be fixed. I had to create a second account in the marketplace, and I was finally able to apply. I lost my job a month after I initially wrote to you, and as someone living paycheck-to-paycheck with no savings, this was terrifying. The insurance company I signed up with was created specifically for, or because of, the ACA, and at the time I chose my plan, they barely even had a website. Jan. 1 hit, and you still couldn't register, and there was no way to pay my premium. I was apoplectic. If I didn't pay my premium on time, I wouldn't be covered retroactively to Jan. 1, and there was no way to pay! I needed coverage because my prescriptions were outrageous out of pocket. Everything came together, but at the 11th hour and operating on a dearth of information. I was able to get a crappy, low-paying job at the end of January, and there are no benefits for 90 days. I am covered in the interim for about $100/month including a subsidy. My deductible is very low at $250--I signed up for a Silver ""HDHP,"" which I understood to mean high deductible plan, but I'm not questioning how it ended up this way. So far it has been a major benefit to my life and I've gone to the doctor to be treated when I wouldn't have previously. The stress and confusion of enrollment was infuriating and bordered on Kafkaesque. But ultimately I'm grateful to be covered. I can afford it in my present circumstances, and without the program I would be one serious illness or injury away from total ruin. Tasha Huebner, 45, Silverton, Ore. I'm in good shape. The Oregon website is still a disaster, as we all know, but I got my application in in plenty of time so that it could be processed in time, to have insurance coverage as of Jan. 1. (Cover Oregon wound up needing to hire 400-plus people to process all the applications by hand.) So, covered by Providence, paying $138 a month (would be $300 without a subsidy), reasonable deductible and OOP limit. I've had to use it this year to get a bad cough checked out, and get new prescriptions for my meds. Initially I was told my migraine meds weren't covered, so I sent an outraged email to Providence, and they looked into it and took care of it. And it actually sounds like it might have been the pharmacy that screwed up by not calling them. I've also gotten the first round of bills from said doc appointments, and was pleasantly surprised that they looked exactly what they were supposed to, i.e. in terms of how much they would pay and what I'd pay. So yes, it's worked out great for me. All the docs I'd want to see are covered as well. Wendy Packard, 32, Chicago I ended up calling the hotline in December, since I couldn't manage to get the website to work.  I would say the phone call was maybe 15 minutes, and I got signed up with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. My payment is $140 a month, which is a lot for me. Fortunately I started a new project in January and the pay is good. But when this project ends, $140 a month is gonna become a burden. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. I wish they had explained insurance to me on the hotline, because I guess I don't really understand it.  I pay every month, but the deductible is like $5,000, so I don't think the insurance will ever pay anything for me.  One of my coworkers was trying to explain it to me ... I guess I'm a ""young invincible,"" although I'm not super young or super healthy. So my money goes to pay for other sicker people, I guess."	Did Slate's Obamacare Guinea Pigs Ever Get Insured?

At the start of last week, the New York Times reported that Paul could claim ""contributors from all 50 states,"" despite his own skittishness about organizing. A few days later, the Washington Post published a sort of rebuttal--a guide to the ""mainstream coalition"" that had coalesced around Paul while his possible rivals pandered, stumbled, or slumbered. But Paul's network is older and stranger than they know. Six months ago, for example, hundreds of diehards in the ""liberty movement"" (the catchall term often used to refer to people who agree with Ron and Rand Paul's politics) gathered in Chantilly, Va., for the annual Liberty Political Action Conference. Rand Paul showed up, as did his father, but the most revealing moment of the weekend came when a man named Mike Rothfeld took the stage. His speech, he said, was supposed to be about leadership. Halfway through it, he pivoted. ""Money!"" said Mike Rothfeld. ""Oh, that's a dirty word, isn't it?"" Rothfeld, founder of Virginia-based Saber Communications was delivering his pitch at the annual conference. In Paul-world, Rothfeld is an important figure; of the $40.6 million raised for Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign, nearly $7.7 million went to Saber. Rothfeld's firm had basically mastered the art of direct-mail fundraising, and some people in the liberty movement--some very loud people--had a problem with this. ""We shouldn't really need money to fight for our liberty,"" said Rothfeld, imitating the voice of a whining critic. ""Bless your little socialist hearts. I don't like that direct mail, because all they do is ask for money. And then they earn a living. Outrageous! People that spent 40, 50, 60, 70 hours a week of their lives, who have wives and children, husbands, dreams, sicknesses just like you do. How dare they earn a living, huh? And you know who you are, bless your heart, that think like that."" Bless your heart, Rothfeld explained, was ""Southern"" for ""you're an idiot."" He was talking to activists that had already shelled out to learn how to campaign harder for their causes, and who now had the option of paying $250 to enter an LPAC reception with Ron Paul or $550 for a ""private briefing."" They needed to know how campaigns actually worked. ""Only the volunteer is pure? You better be darn glad there's professionals doing it. It's hard work. It's unpleasant work sometimes. And yeah, we didn't take a vow of poverty, most of us. We're free market guys. If we're really good at what we do, we want to be paid more for it."" Rothfeld went on, rebutting his critics, explaining the costs of snail mail and Internet ads. ""When you spam people to the sum of 50 or 60 or 70 million pieces of spam a month, as my shop does--those of you who get Rand Paul spa--"" Rothfeld smiled at his intentional verbal gaffe--""uh, email, or Campaign for Liberty or National Association for Gun Rights or National Right to Work or National Pro-Life Alliance, that is all my spa--uh, email!"" Rothfeld had given a guided tour of a little-understood sector of the Ron Paul/Rand Paul universe. (He later told me that he does not talk on the record to reporters.) Critics on the right call it Ron Paul, Inc., the byzantine array of organizations that helped create and staff the ""liberty movement."" Some of these critics insist that the network will sink Rand Paul's ambitions in 2016, either through misdirection of funds or scandal, and they point to an ongoing grand jury investigation of a former Iowa state senator who allegedly solicited a bribe from Paul's 2012 deputy campaign manager. Rand Paul is approaching his new network more carefully. He didn't linger at LPAC, for example, giving his speech then flying to Michigan to meet with a more elite group of Republican donors. His national fundraisers include a 2004 Bush-Cheney bundler and veterans of the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. But the new organization is built on the foundation of a group of long-term staffers activists, who are mistrusted by some in the ""liberty movement"" and linked to a 2011 campaign finance scandal that was equal parts Byzantine and brazen. ""Rand can learn, from his dad's campaign, who to rely on for good support that will be totally above board and ethical,"" says Drew Ivers, a former Iowa Republican Party official who's considered one of the nascent campaign's top men in the caucus state. ""I always look for the silver linings, and here's one--people become transparent in hindsight."" The starting point of the scandal that could dog Rand Paul is the anti-union National Right to Work Committee. Founded in 1955, it really sprung to life in 1965, when a re-elected Lyndon Johnson attempted to strengthen unions by gutting the Taft-Hartley Act. The committee, as Lee Edwards recalled in his 1999 history of conservatism, ""concentrated on two objectives: to arouse public opinion at the grass roots, which would in turn influence members of Congress, and to provide sympathetic members of Congress with every possible assistance."" It did this by lobbying, and by building a sprawling network of donors via direct mail. National Right to Work was an early client of Richard Viguerie, the godfather of conservative direct mail. By the mid-1970s, when he helped National Right to Work kill legislation that would have expanded the right to picket construction sites, Viguerie claimed to have 15 million names on 3,000 rolls of magnetic tape. These were conservatives who could be activated by the right pitch or warning about what would happen if they didn't join up. National Right to Work was effective. In good years, it raised eight-figure sums and spawned spinoff groups across the country. It created an infrastructure outside the ""Republican establishment"" and ""consultant class,"" one that existed for years, with little hype, as individual Republican stars rose and plummeted. From 1987 to 1991, Mike Rothfeld oversaw National Right to Work's direct-mail program. He left to form Saber Communications, which would run mail operations for the National Association for Gun Rights and the National Pro-Life Alliance, and then do direct mail for Ron Paul's presidential campaign Different groups, same strategy: reaching out to the maximum number of conservatives to bring them aboard a campaign for (usually hopeless) legislation the establishment wouldn't touch. This network, little understood even inside the right, would supply some of the key talent to Ron Paul's growing organization. John Tate spent 14 years at National Right to Work, six of them as vice president. He went on to become the political director for Ron Paul's 2008 campaign, and has led the Campaign for Liberty (the main organization that grew out of the 2008 run) since 2010. Doug Stafford, who was Rand Paul's chief of staff until he left to run his RANDPAC, came directly from National Right to Work. So did Dimitri Kesari, who was National Right to Work's government affairs director until he became deputy campaign manager of Ron Paul 2012. Ron Paul's 2008 campaign marked a turning point in the history of direct mail. He started, as he had started his 1988 Libertarian presidential campaign, as a fringe candidate with a mailing list. In the summer of 2007, especially after an explosive debate confrontation with Rudy Giuliani, Paul became the master of Internet fundraising. A December 2007 ""moneybomb"" for Paul raised $6 million, all from small donors logging onto his campaign site. When the 2008 campaign ended, its vigorous organizing and fundraising drew on the lessons of National Right to Work. Activists interested in the Campaign for Liberty could be trained in $35 workshops run by the Foundation for Applied Conservative Leadership, an outfit led by Mike Rothfeld. Some of these graduates went on to swamp the GOP establishment in Kentucky, helping Rand Paul win an upset in the 2010 primary for U.S. Senate. Rand Paul's campaign paid nearly $800,000 to Saber Communications. In 2011, when Ron Paul started another run for president, it called Rothfeld a key adviser. And it was during the 2011 primary run up that things went awry. Iowa was one of Ron Paul's best-wired states, with a strong ""liberty movement"" on college campuses and allies in the home school movement. It was also wired by National Right to Work. NRW had a convoluted relationship with local Iowa candidates, as revealed via leaks to journalist Lee Stranahan and surreptitiously recorded interviews between the key players and Dennis Fusaro, formerly of National Right to Work and briefly national political director for the 2008 Paul campaign. The gist was that National Right to Work co-operated with some 2010 Republican candidates for Iowa's state senate. Candidates' family members were interviewed or encouraged to write about their lives together--the state senate hopeful that you wish you knew. NRTW then printed these up as letters to be sent to key direct-mail lists. It was effective, and necessarily under the radar. Even in the wild and untamed plains of campaign finance law, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group can't appear to be coordinating any messages with candidates. But Fusaro proved that when he turned on his colleagues, and unbeknownst to them, hit record when he called them to talk about the direct-mail campaign. In 2010 he recorded a conversation in which Doug Stafford, then vice president of National Right to Work, explained why Dimitri Kesari--who'd just launched Mid-America Right to Work, in Indiana--was being tasked with so much. ""Four years of election cycles, of having Dimitri and his guys run the mail shop, shows me that that's who needs to be running the mail shop,"" said Stafford in the call. Kesari was good at a task few people understood, and doing it in a way that seemed to skirt laws against candidate ""coordination."" That became more important in 2011. Iowa State Sen. Kent Sorenson, one of the candidates aided by National Right to Work's 2010 letter program, became a power player in the state's Republican caucuses. Sorenson endorsed Michele Bachmann, and his Grassroots Strategies group started receiving monthly $7,500 checks from her campaign, which wasn't even legal in Iowa. He could, in other words, be bought. Later in 2011, according to some documents leaked by Fusaro and some obtained by an investigator in Iowa, the Iowa Gun Association's Aaron Dorr drafted a proposal under which Sorenson could switch his endorsement to Ron Paul. Dorr's memo was addressed to John Tate, who'd temporarily left the Campaign for Liberty to manage the 2012 Paul effort. The plan would require Sorenson being paid off secretly. ""The money for salary and the PAC needs to be paid in advance,"" wrote Dorr in the Oct. 29, 2011 memo. ""To be blunt, there is an issue of trust involved, likely on both sides, and as a result KS, etc. needs to have the financial side met in advance."" In return, ""KS would naturally speak at RP events in Iowa and be visible with him."" Dorr's plan called for the Paul campaign to pay nearly a quarter-million dollars: $100,000 for a PAC to be run by Sorenson, $8,000 a month for the senator, and $5,000 a month for Aaron's brother Chris Dorr, who was Sorenson's clerk. Had the plan been carried out, it would have tied the Paul campaign to a career-ending scam. But it wasn't carried out, at least not to completion. Under investigation in 2013, Sorenson handed over to investigators a $25,000 check from Ron Paul's deputy campaign manager Dimitri Kesari, dated Dec. 26, 2011. Sorenson had endorsed Paul two days later, but the check had never been cashed. Sorenson had previously said as much in a secretly taped phone call with Fusaro, in which he revealed his intention to ""give it back,"" wondering only whether he should ""hold onto it so I have something over"" Kesari. Drew Ivers, who introduced Sorenson at the endorsement event, says he was shocked when the senator showed up. ""I've been around for a long time, and I can smell out people pretty good,"" says Ivers. ""I put distance between Ron Paul and Kent Sorenson and Aaron Dorr."" In 2013, Sorenson resigned in disgrace from the Iowa state Senate. He's been talking to a grand jury, but no one else--his old phone numbers have been changed and he doesn't answer questions from reporters. Kesari has remained active with candidates in the Saber/National Right to Work network. He made the rounds at March's Conservative Political Action Conference, and was spotted partying with Rep. Steve Stockman. But with every week there's more distance between the Pauls and the people involved in the Sorenson mess. Jesse Benton, who'd been Ron Paul's spokesman and Rand Paul's 2010 campaign manager, went on to manage Mitch McConnell's re-election bid. In 2013, campaign finance records revealed that McConnell's campaign had paid $61,954 to Hyllus Corp., a newly incorporated company that happened to be located at a P.O. Box used by Kesari. There have been no payments to Hyllus Corp. since OpenSecrets reported this figure. But Rand Paul remains deeply connected to the little-understood world of conservative direct mail. One of the first bills he took up in January 2011, after being sworn into the Senate, was a national right to work bill. (South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint had introduced the legislation, fruitlessly, in prior Congresses.) Soon, Rand Paul's name and face started appearing on e-mails endorsing the latest efforts of National Right to Work and asking readers to sign a petition--i.e., to join a larger mailing list. ""They snickered when I said I came to the U.S. Senate to change Congress,"" read one letter, sent on Jan. 21, 2011 to users of the conservative site TownHall.com. ""Their laughter stopped when I sponsored the National Right to Work Act to free U.S. workers from forced unionization and break Big Labor's multi-billion dollar political machine forever. President Barack Obama and Big Labor allies in the Senate are now feverishly scheming to bury the National Right to Work Act without a vote. So I have a question for you. Will you be my sledgehammer?"" Rand Paul's name has also appeared on scores of emails from Mike Rothfeld's Saber clients, emails like the appeals from the National Association for Gun Rights asking conservatives to help stop the ""U.N. gun ban"" and take a ""sovereignty survey."" In April 2013, the NAGR started running ads against Republicans who'd spoken about a need for ""gun safety"" legislation. One of those Republicans, Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell called out Paul. ""Your good name is being leveraged, with your permission one must assume, by a corrupt, detestable outfit,"" said Rigell. The attacks continued. According to Rigell, Doug Stafford made it clear that Paul would not distance himself from the National Association for Gun Rights. But after Politico reported on the spat, the e-mails stopped. This was a teaching moment for the Paul network. By April 2013, Rand Paul had already delivered his 13-hour filibuster on drones and civil liberties. Pieces of a new network were coming together, and the senator no longer needed to rely on the more troublesome aspects of Paul, Inc. The direct mail industry and the outsider class of consultants had helped build a new libertarian political movement when the mainstream had wanted no part of it. But the mainstream had been gentled. Paul, if he chose to, could move on."	Could Rand Paul's Shadowy Fundraising Machine Sink His Presidential Ambitions?	['Paul', 'Rigell', 'Obama']	[]
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/tax_credits_and_children_parents_should_pay_lower_taxes_and_childless_people.html	When my mother was my age, she was working full time while raising three small children, and she spent every spare moment studying to finish a graduate degree. My father was working extremely hard as well. Between the two of them, they were able to provide their kids with a solidly middle-class life. But it wasn't easy, and it wasn't always fun. So now, as a childless professional in my mid-30s, I often reflect on the sacrifices working parents make to better the lives of their children. And I have come to the reluctant conclusion that I ought to pay much higher taxes so that working parents can pay much lower taxes. I believe this even though I also believe a not inconsiderable share of my tax dollars are essentially being set on fire by our frighteningly incompetent government. Leviathan is here to stay, whether I like it or not, and someone has to pay for it. That someone should be me, and people like me. Who should pay more? Nonparents who earn more than the median household income, just a shade above $51,000. By shifting the tax burden from parents to nonparents, we will help give America's children a better start in life, and we will help correct a simple injustice. We all benefit from the work of parents. Each new generation reinvigorates our society with its youthful vim and vigor. As my childless friends and I grow crankier and more decrepit, a steady stream of barely postpubescent brainiacs writes catchy tunes and invents breakthrough technologies that keep us entertained and make us more productive. The willingness of parents to bear and nurture children saves us from becoming an economically moribund nation of hateful curmudgeons. The least we can do is offer them a bigger tax break. Raising children is not exactly a thankless undertaking, I realize. As many parents will tell you, the satisfactions of parenting can be their own reward. Parents appear to be very into the supposed cuteness of their progeny. I wouldn't know, but that's the word on the street. We as a culture still hold parents, and particularly working parents, in high esteem. Yet it is also true that we've stacked the deck against parents in all kinds of ways. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has found that raising a child born in 2012 will cost a middle-income family a cumulative total of $301,970 over 18 years. As high as this number sounds, it is actually a massive understatement, as it fails to take into account the cost of postsecondary education. It also fails to factor in the value of forgone earnings and career opportunities. While nonparents can focus on their jobs in laserlike fashion, parents are rarely in a position to do the same. Every time a sick child keeps a parent home from work, her earnings suffer, either directly, because she's taking an unpaid leave of absence, or indirectly, because she's missing out on opportunities to climb the corporate ladder. Even when we compare a nonparent and a parent who are working exactly the same hours and earning exactly the same income, the nonparent has a clear leg up. Most obviously, the nonparent has far more disposable income to play with, which she can save, to become much richer than her parent counterpart over time, or spend, to travel to exotic locales, to eat out constantly, to wear awesome clothes, or to live as I do in a conveniently located shoebox in a great American metropolis. Raising taxes on nonparents could even the score a bit, tilting the balance ever so slightly in favor of those who toil on behalf of America's future workforce by wiping their butts and painstakingly removing their head lice. There are, to be sure, some decent arguments against my soak-the-childless plan. It could be that lowering disposable income for nonparents would actually lead them to delay marriage and child-rearing, as people might want to build up a sizable nest egg before they start being fruitful and multiplying. Or we might take the view that even if we ought to give middle-income parents bigger tax breaks, it is the ultrarich rather than nonparents who should pay for it. Giving working parents a meaningful tax break is going to cost quite a lot of money--so much money that raising taxes on the ultrarich alone won't be enough. Recently Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Tea Party Republican first elected in 2010, released a tax plan, the Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act, that preserves the current $1,000 child credit, the personal exemption for children, and the earned income tax credit while adding a new $2,500 child credit. Unlike the current child credit, Lee's new credit never phases out, so it can be of use to higher-income families. Under Lee's plan, a middle-income family with two kids earning $70,000 could expect a $5,000 tax cut, which sounds about right. The problem with Lee's plan is that it would massively increase the deficit. The Tax Policy Center finds that it would reduce revenues over the next decade by $2.4 trillion relative to the current law baseline. Lee doesn't propose this, but the most straightforward way to offset the lost tax revenue from parents would be to raise taxes on nonparents. Right now, Lee's plan has two income tax rates: 15 percent for all income below $87,850 for singles or $175,000 for joint filers, and 35 percent for all income above those thresholds. You could come pretty close to closing the revenue gap by changing those thresholds to, say, $50,000 for singles and $100,000 for joint filers. Parents wouldn't have to worry too much about these new thresholds, because the new child credit would still lower their taxes. Nonparents would take the hit. Right now, the 35 percent tax bracket only kicks in at $405,101 for singles and joint filers, so this tweak would infuriate large numbers of articulate and engaged upper-middle-income childless voters who earn more than $50,000. These millions of nonparents are not good political enemies to have. But does this mean those of us who favor a more parent-friendly tax code should give up? Not quite. Tax reform along these lines could awaken a sleeping giant in American politics, namely the 36 percent of American voters who have a child under 18 in their household. Unlike the retirees and near-retirees who fight tooth and nail to protect Medicare and Social Security, we don't have a well-funded political pressure group that defends the child credit. It can't help that parents are too busy raising children to plot and scheme their way to more favorable tax treatment. But if parents were to flex their political muscles, we might have a revolution on our hands. And this nonparent, at least, welcomes the prospect.	Childless People Should Pay Much Higher Taxes	[]	[]

Ryan continued: ""She knows me well, and she knows that I don't have a racist bone in my body."" The question is: Does anyone have a racist bone in his body? Ryan's bony response has become the de rigueur reply for anyone on the racial hot seat. A few favorites. Who lacks a racist bone? Republican Sen. Bob Dole. According to a New York Times report, the kickoff to Dole's 1988 presidential campaign was met with protests over his opposition to the African National Congress and support for the apartheid regime in South Africa. The protesters stood at the ""fringe"" of the rally supporting Dole, but they were irritating enough for him to interrupt his speech and address them. ""The signs are wrong,"" he said. ""There isn't a racist bone in my body."" Who lacks a racist bone? Anti-immigration activist Harold Ezell. In 1994, Ezell was one of the architects of California's Proposition 187, which blocked unauthorized immigrants from using state social services such as health care and public education. His opponents accused him of anti-Latino racism, and at one town hall in support of the proposition, he faced hundreds of Latino demonstrators: ""Ezell cried foul, telling reporters on his way out that the assertion was ridiculous.

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/nsa_bulk_metadata_collection_rand_paul_ron_wyden_support_obama_s_plan_to.html	"Edward Snowden was the first to declare victory. On Monday night, the Obama administration had, via the New York Times, announced the imminent end of the bulk collection of metadata and proposed new rules requiring the National Security Agency to get warrants before grabbing individual records. It was far less than what civil libertarians had wanted. But Snowden called the White House announcement a ""turning point"" and the ""beginning of a new effort to reclaim our rights from the NSA."" The race to the bandwagon had begun. By Tuesday morning the Republican-run House Intelligence Committee was polishing and promoting the End Bulk Collection Act of 2014, which would grudgingly achieve much of what the White House grudgingly asked for. On Tuesday afternoon, Sens. Rand Paul, Ron Wyden, and Mark Udall strolled into a Senate hallway bustling with reporters to accept the NSA's partial surrender. ""When the executive branch says you've got to collect millions and millions of phone records of law-biding people, we said no,"" said Wyden. One year ago he'd asked Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about metadata collection from ""law-abiding Americans"" in an open hearing.  Clapper said it didn't happen.  Snowden proved him wrong. Clapper had never quite recovered. ""It's very clear now that the administration agrees with us,"" said Wyden. ""After all these years of saying that collecting these records are vital to Western civilization, they've concluded that it's not."" ""They're looking for congressional permission to stop doing what they're doing,"" said Paul, who was still suing the administration over the metadata trawling. ""They never got congressional permission in the first place. There's nothing forcing them to keep collecting data."" ""The Congress ought to codify what the president's done so the message is sent to future presidents,"" said Udall, who faces re-election in a swing state this year. ""But this administration could go and implement what they're proposing, today."" ""This is the start of the end of dragnet surveillance in America,"" said Wyden. ""Turning off the vacuum cleaner,"" added Udall. It was exactly what the administration and the NSA's defenders wanted to hear. They'd never wanted to end metadata collection. They defended it for months. Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, had pulled up to many Sunday show tables to argue that the program was safe, and legal, and that its opponents were ignorant defenders of the treacherous Snowden. ""I passionately believe that this program saved American lives,"" said Rogers at an hourlong press conference with Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the committee's ranking member, where they outlined their bill to end bulk metadata collection. ""All of the reviews, and I mean all of the reviews, from the IG to congressional review to the presidential review panels, found no misuse of this program. But Americans need to buy into this. ... I started out with, maybe we ought to stick with the program that has been tested, legally overseen, and protects civil liberties. Well, we're beyond that. We get that."" If it was a ""turning point,"" as Snowden suggested, it was one that the administration and its critics both needed. The congressional and civic outcry against the NSA started and basically ended with the revelations of domestic snooping. That wasn't where the Snowden revelations ended. Day after week after month, newspapers were using the Snowden documents to detail American spying in foreign countries. This was costing the American tech industry billions of dollars, maybe as much as $180 billion. Rogers and Ruppersberger, and the administration, wanted to restore American credibility. Domestic surveillance reform was the only attainable idea, even if it barely addressed most of Snowden's leaks. The reform, said Ruppersberger, would ""set an example,"" while ""at least a year's"" worth of Snowden revelations continued to trickle out. The world outside would see that America was doing something about surveillance, and their own governments weren't. Hey, it could work. ""The French, just recently, passed a measure so that you don't even need a court order to get personal data stored on their systems in France,"" said Rogers. ""Espionage is a French word, after all."" That line got a couple of laughs, but Rogers meant it. ""We should get over the shock and awe of all of this and have an honest dialogue about what is exactly happening,"" he said. ""Europeans spy on the United States of America, sorry, every single day."" Multiple times, when reporters asked Rogers why Congress wasn't reforming any of the programs that worried foreigners, the congressman accused the press of overhyping stories and possibly being suckered by bad intelligence. Snowden, who Rogers only referred to as ""the former NSA contractor,"" had created ""confusion on legal programs he had no understanding of,"" and then fallen into Russia's grip. ""There's a lot of intelligence officials today who have to go back and, [with] every new revelation, knowing he's under the influence of Russian intelligence, scrutinize it 10 times more than they did,"" said Rogers. ""A lot of people take it as gospel. I assure you, it's not."" ""I would love to have Russia's Snowden come over here and give us all the data he found,"" said Ruppersberger. These were the congressmen who were now backing the end of bulk metadata collection. The civil libertarians could accept that, because they knew what to go after next. Paul, who had just returned from a well-received and widely-covered anti-spying speech in Berkeley, Calif., openly derided the arguments he expected to hear next. ""They will say, we have these privacy controls that da-da-da-da,"" said Paul, replacing the intelligence community's jargon with nonsense syllables. ""We're going to do da-da-da-da. But the records are not protected by the Fourth Amendment. This is still a big question. I think it will still have to be decided by the Supreme Court."" But that sets up a sort of detente. The civil libertarian campaign would continue. The campaigners would give their blessing to incremental reform. The skeptics would go along with the reform, because they know how quickly the conversation can shift. ""Substantively, are we retaining the ability to deter these attacks?"" asked Sen. Lindsey Graham. ""We're one attack away from this completely changing the focus."""

The government's response is that none of these contraceptives ends a pregnancy. Rather, they prevent implantation in the uterine lining. The rejoinder, from supporters of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, is that this doesn't matter. ""Although the government has made statements that terminating a fertilized embryo before it implants in the uterus is not an abortion,"" writes Bart Stupak and Democrats for Life in an amicus brief filed in support of Hobby Lobby, ""the relevant matter for claim of conscience ... is plaintiffs' belief that a distinct human life begins at fertilization. It is no salve ... to be told that the government defines abortion differently."" There's no doubt that this belief is sincere. But what's fascinating is the extent to which, for conservative evangelicals, it's new. So new, in fact, that when Hobby Lobby's president, Steve Green, was a child in the 1960s, it was the minority view among American evangelical Protestants. In his book Broken Words: The Abuse of Science and Faith in American Politics, Jonathan Dudley notes that most evangelicals held far more liberal views at the time. ""God does not regard the fetus as a soul no matter how far gestation has progressed,"" wrote professor Bruce Waltke of Dallas Theological Seminary in a 1968 issue of Christianity Today on contraception and abortion, edited by Harold Lindsell, a then-famous champion of biblical ""inerrancy."" His argument rested on the Hebrew Bible, ""[A]ccording to Exodus 21:22-24, the destruction of the fetus is not a capital offense. ... Clearly, then, in contrast to the mother, the fetus is not reckoned as a soul."" This position was reaffirmed at a symposium sponsored by Christianity Today and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, where participants agreed to disagree over the ""sinfulness"" of an ""induced abortion,"" but agreed about ""the necessity of it and permissibility for it under certain circumstances,"" namely, rape and incest. The document produced by the conference, ""A Protestant Affirmation on the Control of Human Reproduction,"" said, ""The prevention of conception is not in itself forbidden or sinful providing the reasons for it are in harmony with the total revelation of God for married life"" and that the ""method of preventing pregnancy is not so much a religious as a scientific and medical question to be determined in consultation with one's physician."" Three years after the symposium, the conservative Southern Baptist Convention endorsed this view, with a call for ""Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother."" By 1982, however, the SBC--along with most American evangelicals--had switched gears entirely. During that year's convention, delegates held that ""human life begins at conception"" and that they would work for ""appropriate"" legislation or a constitutional amendment to ""prohibit abortions except to save the physical life of the mother."" What happened to cause this sea change in attitudes toward fetal life and abortion among evangelicals? In short, politics, and in particular, the successful coalition-building of Jerry Falwell, Paul Weyrich, and other Christian conservatives in the wake of Roe v. Wade. Conservative Catholics were quick to mobilize against the court's ruling, but many Protestant evangelicals were relatively apathetic. At that point, ""culture war"" issues such as abortion, feminism, and homosexuality weren't on their radar (hence Jimmy Carter's successful appeal to them in the 1976 presidential election). It took the organizational might of Falwell and his ""Moral Majority""--as well as evangelical anti-abortion figures such as Francis Schaeffer--to galvanize evangelicals around other ""culture war"" issues such as feminism, homosexuality, and school prayer. This in turn led to alliances with largely Catholic organizations like the National Right to Life Committee. Belief tends to follow behavior, and working in political alliance with Catholics--a significant shift from earlier periods of evangelical political activism--led conservative evangelicals to adopt ""pro-life"" positions on abortion. Likewise, there was a shift in evangelical media--via books, magazines, radio, and television--toward anti-abortion beliefs. In 1980 Falwell declared, ""The Bible clearly states life begins at conception."" Four years later, notes Dudley, InterVarsity Press--an evangelical imprint--was forced to withdraw a book that restated the earlier consensus around abortion. Again, the clearest picture of this comes by way of the Southern Baptist Convention, which resolved in favor of limited abortion rights through much of the 1970s, but then made an abrupt shift in 1979 and 1980. By the late 1980s, the SBC had all but erased its previous history of abortion acceptance. To wit, at the beginning of its endorsement of the 1987 ""Danforth amendment,"" the SBC held that ""Southern Baptists have traditionally opposed abortion."" At the moment, few evangelicals have joined conservative and traditional Catholics in opposing birth control. It has been an extreme position for evangelicals, limited to the far right wing of the movement. Indeed, in a 2009 poll by the National Association of Evangelicals, 90 percent of respondents said that they approve of contraception. But the fight against the Obamacare contraception mandate has begun to transform the landscape of evangelical belief about hormonal birth control. Concerns over potential ""abortifacients"" like Plan B have led to concerns over the ""pill"" itself, and evangelical leaders like Albert Mohler have warned their followers against the ""contraceptive mentality,"" and encouraged them to ""look closely at the Catholic moral argument"" for guidance. Ask most (white) evangelicals about the morality of abortion these days, and you're certain to hear about its absolute immorality in most, if not all, circumstances. But this is a recent innovation in the history of evangelical belief, a product of political forces as well as new theological insight. That's not to say that it's illegitimate, only that--like more liberal evangelicals and mainline Protestants--conservatives aren't immune to the winds of the world around them. Their beliefs, like those of the people around them, change with time and circumstance. If the Hobby Lobby fight over the contraception mandate is any indication, we're seeing history repeat itself. There's a good chance that, in 10 years, conservative evangelicals will hail their opposition to birth control as a ""timeless biblical truth,"" the traditional view of ""traditional"" Christians."

Rand Paul can have all the tact and graciousness of an arrogant college student. He'll talk as if no one else could have his insight or perception, leading to embarrassments like last year's speech at Howard University, where he lectured black politics students on the civil rights record of the Republican Party. He almost put a foot in it again last week, during an address to the College Republicans at the University of California, Berkeley. ""I find it ironic that the first African-American president has without compunction allowed this vast exercise of raw power by the NSA,"" he said, taking a swing at Obama, ""Certainly J. Edgar Hoover's illegal spying on Martin Luther King and others in the civil rights movement should give us all pause."" It was a glib line, and the objections were what you'd expect. ""Is a black president more responsible for stopping inappropriate NSA spying than a white one?,"" wrote Zerlina Maxwell for the Grio, ""This issue is complicated enough that it doesn't need Senator Paul's cheap shot on the president invoking race, when it's not relevant."" Likewise, at Salon, Elias Isquith condemned Paul for ""whitesplaining Martin Luther King, Jr. to the first African American president,"" especially given Paul's ""infamous"" attack on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Maxwell and Isquith have a point, but so does Paul. Barack Obama is the direct product of the civil rights movement, and without its hard work and sacrifice, his rise to the White House couldn't have happened. Obama is quick to admit this. In 2007, shortly after announcing his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he gave a speech to mark the anniversary of the march in Selma, Ala., where protesters--led by a young John Lewis--withstood the blows of segregationists. ""It's because they marched that I got the kind of education I got, that I got a law degree, and a seat in the Illinois Senate and ultimately in the United States Senate,"" he told the audience. ""I'm here because somebody marched for our freedom. I'm here because y'all sacrificed for me. I stand on the shoulders of giants."" He sounded a similar note last year, while commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. ""Because they marched,"" he said, ""city councils changed and state legislatures changed, and Congress changed, and, yes, eventually, the White House changed."" We can argue all day over the goals of the civil rights movement and the extent to which its leaders fought for economic as well as social equality. There's no question, however, of Barack Obama's view as it relates to his life: He sees himself as the embodiment of their legacy, someone who represents the extent to which they won the battle. In which case, Paul is right. It is ironic that the first African-American president has overseen a mass expansion of the government's surveillance powers--powers that, in an earlier form, were used to spy on almost every figure in the civil rights movement. Under the watchful eye of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover--who directed his agents to ""expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize"" the activities of protest groups--COINTELPRO (short for ""counter-intelligence program"") invaded the lives of Martin Luther King, Jr. and other civil rights leaders. King, in particular, was the target of an aggressive investigation. At one point, FBI agents mailed him a recording compiled from his affairs with various women. Attached was a note: ""King, there is only one thing left for you to do. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, fraudulent self is bared to the nation."" No, Obama isn't Hoover, and--as far as we know--he hasn't directed the NSA to harass community leaders and derail their efforts (though his Justice Department has yet to challenge the NYPD's spying on Muslim New Yorkers). But he holds surveillance powers that go beyond anything proposed or imagined by Hoover and his allies. Powers that, had they existed in the 1960s, would have been used to attack and discredit the men and women who made Obama's life possible. And COINTELPRO wasn't the only government effort aimed at disrupting the movement. In Mississippi, officials shaped the State Sovereignty Commission into a massive spy organization, dedicated to the defense of Jim Crow. It infiltrated organizations like the NAACP and the Congress of Racial Equality, and claimed broad authority to arrest, detain, and keep secret files. Looking at this, it's hard not to see similarities to the Obama administration and its continued support for mass surveillance, permanent data collection, and indefinite detention. You don't have to support Rand Paul or his policy agenda to see that he was right to call out the president on the tension between his position and his actions. The fight for black equality was also, explicitly, a demand for America to live up to the ideals of its Declaration and the laws of its Constitution. If Obama is going to claim the legacy of the civil rights movement--if he's going to present himself as its inheritor--then he must also grapple with his role in expanding the same surveillance state that terrorized his forbears, and may--in the future--do the same to their descendants. To do otherwise--to ignore the deep irony of the situation--is to do himself and his legacy a disservice."

""I am in Washington, D.C., all week, introducing myself,"" wrote the Arizona state senator in an email. ""If elected I will be the first Gay Latino elected to congress in the United States."" It had been only a few days since Gallardo could say that out loud. On March 5 the Democrat had gathered reporters in the state Senate caucus room and come out of the closet. He and fellow progressives had rallied the business community (and seemingly the entire political press corps) and convinced Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to veto SB 1062, a bill that codified the right of businesses not to serve gays. ""After I stood up on the floor and argued against 1062,"" he told the reporters, ""as I've done on many bills before, I sat down and said, 'Wow. This bill affects me. It affects me directly.' "" Gallardo had already entered the race to replace Rep. Ed Pastor, an 11-term Democrat from Arizona's safely blue, Phoenix-based 7th District. A lot of ambition can build up in two decades; every Democrat with a donor list and a pulse had entered the race, and much of the early hype had gone to state Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Iraq war veteran and rising party star. And then Gallardo came out. The gay rights movement has won so much so fast, after decades of marginalization, that openly gay candidates no longer seem to be taking risks. They intrigue donors, who don't mind the idea of making history. Over the course of a week, I met with Gallardo, who'd be the first openly gay Hispanic member of Congress (""there aren't many firsts left,"" he joked) and with Massachusetts Republican Richard Tisei, who in 2012 almost became the first member of his party elected after coming out of the closet. Both are running in 2014, and testing how ready their constituencies actually are to elect gays. When we met up in Washington, Gallardo had just wrapped a labor union meeting and was prepping for a summit with the Victory Fund, a group that supports openly gay candidates. ""I'm the most progressive candidate in the race. I introduced ENDA before anyone knew what ENDA was."" Gallardo introduced an Arizona version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act a decade before he came out. Gallardo, who's 45, came out to his friends when he was 25 (""most of my friends are gay"") and to his family when he was 30. He'd brought his partners to Thanksgiving. He'd won re-elections, easily. No one, he said, had ever tried to out him. ""But during all the rallies,"" said Gallardo, ""while we were waiting for the governor to make a decision, there were two young ladies holding a sign. I forget what the sign said, but I remember them, together holding hands. They asked me: 'Why are they doing this?' I honestly could not even give them an answer. At that time I thought, you know, there's a broader message here. I'm a Latino. I was raised in a strong Catholic family. To this day, my parents have never said the word 'gay.' They know about me. They've known since I was 30 years old--I'm 45 now. They never said the word. I think there's a lot of people in a situation like that and it was time to send the message that it's OK."" Gallardo, who'd wanted to talk about this, lowered his voice. His eyes were dry when he'd started talking. They weren't dry anymore. ""I had to tell my mother what I was going to do,"" said Gallardo. ""So I sat her down, and said, 'I'm going to talk to everyone at the Capitol.' First, she was like, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'I'm gonna come out. I want you prepared. It's going to be in the news.' Her response was 'Why do you have to do this?' I said, 'I need to do it.' So she said she had a meeting with the women's auxiliary of the American Legion on Thursday. Could I do it Friday?"" Gallardo laughed and broke the tension. ""I said it had to be Wednesday. You know, I think it goes back to the cultural thing. In the Latino family, it's something you don't talk about. It's the same in pop culture. You have some prominent gay Anglos out there, but very few Latinos. They don't see anyone on TV that's openly gay."" But Gallardo was convinced that his announcement wouldn't cost him net votes. ""I lose some, I win some,"" he shrugged. It was, he hoped, an afterthought, which was what Massachusetts Republican Tisei also insisted when we met at a restaurant near the House of Representatives. Tisei had just met with some of the people he might call ""colleagues"" in 2015. But he hadn't met Rep. Randy Forbes, the Virginia Republican who'd called on the GOP to deny money to gay candidates. ""I haven't bumped into him yet,"" said Tisei with a half-smile. ""Let me just say, I was surprised he would basically say he wouldn't want anyone in the caucus who was gay. If you took out that word, 'gay,' and put any other word in there, I think most people would find that to be pretty inflammatory. Right after he made his comments, the entire leadership said we're going to judge our members by the content of our character."" Tisei's theory, and his main point, is that his party was evolving too. He came out in 2009, when he was 47 years old and being considered as the GOP's nominee for lieutenant governor. The revelation didn't hurt him at all--he got on the ticket, which lost in 2010. Neither that loss nor his 2012 loss had discouraged him about the progress of gay rights or gay candidates. He'd been in the state Senate when the state supreme court legalized gay marriage. ""There was a tsunami of opposition,"" he said. ""I remember being in a room with perhaps 20 state legislators who supported the decision, and we knew it was going to be a steep mountain to climb. The calls were coming in 20-1 against the decision. But over the past 10 years, we've seen just a tremendous change take place in people's attitudes. Five years from now, 10 years from now, it won't even be an issue."" Tisei said that to me in the first week of March, right after his state party had inserted a definition of ""traditional marriage"" into its manifesto. Days ago he announced that he'd boycott the state convention, to protest a platform from ""the 19th century."" His campaign happily sent out the news of the intraparty friction. There just wasn't any downside to being known for this, not anymore."	Will Richard Tisei Be the First Openly Gay Republican to Enter Congress?	[]	['gay']

Taylor, it turned out, was doing a lot more than stealing public-aid checks. In addition to several alleged homicides, I detailed the kidnapping of a newborn named Paul Joseph Fronczak. There is strong circumstantial evidence, if not definitive proof, that Taylor snatched the infant Paul from his mother's arms in Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital in 1964. Her son Johnnie Harbaugh told me that his mother was always nabbing children that didn't belong to her, and that she would often wear a nurse's uniform, just as the kidnapper did. Jack Sherwin, the Chicago police detective who investigated Taylor for much of the 1970s, says her station wagon matched the description of the getaway car. She was ""guilty as hell,"" Sherwin told me. Three months after my story, ABC News unveiled its own report on Linda Taylor and the Fronczak kidnapping. On March 14, the network issued a press release touting its ""exclusive investigation."" In a subsequent 20/20 special and a report on the ABC News website, correspondents Barbara Walters and Brian Ross claimed that a ""cold lead has come back to life in the half-century-old case."" That lead: an anonymous note received on the ""20/20 tip line"" that the ""baby was stolen by a lady known as the 'Welfare Queen.' "" Ross told viewers that ""Linda Taylor died 12 years ago, but we found her son living in a Chicago suburb, prepared, he said, to finally tell what he knows about his mother and the stolen baby."" As my former colleague Jack Shafer wrote recently, the term ""exclusive"" doesn't mean what TV people think it means. ""[M]ost pieces billed as an exclusive interview,"" Shafer wrote, ""are usually no more exclusive than a seat in a public commode."" It also isn't news that TV networks, especially newsmagazine shows, aren't particularly magnanimous when it comes to using other people's reporting. But it's still worth noting that this kind of credit-grabbing has been standard practice for ABC News throughout the Fronczak investigation. Over the last eight months, ABC has been latching onto other people's work, then repackaging it as a series of phony scoops. George Knapp, the chief investigative reporter for KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, first brought Paul Fronczak's story to the attention of television viewers in April 2013. After their baby was stolen in 1964, Dora and Chester Fronczak adopted a child they believed was their missing son. That man--who goes by Paul Joseph Fronczak--recently discovered that he is not the Fronczaks' biological child, and he's now on a quest both to find the real stolen baby and to ascertain his own origins. Knapp reported on all this on TV and on the Web, and set up a Facebook page to help chase down potential leads. Four months later, thanks in part to Knapp's reporting, the FBI reopened the Fronczak kidnapping case. On Good Morning America, ABC's Josh Elliott reported this reopening as ""an ABC News exclusive,"" a development that was ""coming to light now thanks to months of work by our Barbara Walters and so many of our colleagues here at ABC News."" Knapp doesn't want all the credit for getting the FBI to take a fresh look at the case--he says the Chicago papers also deserve recognition for bringing attention to the story. ""It's not about getting credit,"" he told me. ""It's about being honest."" In a November piece for Las Vegas CityLife, Knapp wrote that ABC's self-congratulatory claim ""was an absolute lie, a self-serving pat on the back."" At the point that the case was reopened, Knapp explained, ""ABC News had done nothing on the story other than to record an interview with Paul in a hotel suite."" I can empathize. This past week's 20/20 Fronczak investigation did not see fit to mention that it was Slate, not ABC, that uncovered that Reagan's infamous welfare queen died 12 years ago. It was Slate, not Brian Ross and his investigative team, that found Linda Taylor's son living in a Chicago suburb. And it was Slate, not 20/20, that reported that Taylor was the possible culprit in the Fronczak kidnapping. I make no claim that I did all of this myself. Every story benefits from prior acts of journalism. My article, for one, wouldn't have been possible without the hard work of a passel of Chicago Tribune reporters, who wrote about the alleged Fronczak-Taylor connection in the 1970s, and who are credited throughout the piece Slate ultimately published. But ABC, in Knapp's words, lives in a make-believe land in which ""no one else had reported anything about Paul [Fronczak]'s amazing story."" Slate scored a single mention on 20/20, but Ross' voice-over made it seem like we were working in parallel--Taylor's son ""never volunteered what he knew about the Fronczak baby until he talked with us and a reporter for the online news site Slate,"" ABC News' chief investigative correspondent said--never indicating that my story filled in the gaps in ABC's reporting, and that it appeared online many months before the ABC segment aired. I do take ABC at its word that it received an anonymous tip about the welfare queen, and that the tip came in prior to the publication of my story. The network ran its first 20/20 special on the Fronczak mystery (a Barbara Walters exclusive, naturally) back in November. Though that special never mentioned Linda Taylor's name, it's plausible that a viewer wrote in and mentioned the welfare queen. I find it much harder to believe that ABC pursued this lead--one among a huge number of tips that poured in to the network--in any significant way prior to my story going live on Slate. I contacted Paul Joseph Fronczak on Dec. 17, two days before my piece was published, to alert him to the revelations in my article. At that time--47 days after ABC says it received its anonymous tip--Fronczak told me that he had never heard of Linda Taylor. When contacted again this week, Fronczak said he believed that Slate's story prompted ABC's latest investigation. Isaiah Gant, a defense attorney who represented Taylor in the 1970s, also told me that ABC did not contact him about appearing in its welfare queen report until months after my story appeared on Slate. Gant said that my article came up several times in his conversations with a producer. Johnnie Harbaugh, Taylor's son, told me that ABC News producer Rhonda Schwartz appeared at his house after my story was published. Harbaugh says the ABC producer told him that she had read my article. He believes the Slate piece is why--and how--Schwartz tracked him down. A network spokesperson told me earlier this week that Schwartz, the chief investigative producer of the ABC News Brian Ross investigative team, was not reachable. [Update, 6:40 p.m.: I was finally able to reach Schwartz just prior to publication.] In a written statement, ABC News' manager of digital publicity and communication Nicole Enberg said, ""The Slate piece was very helpful and we acknowledged the article both on-air and online. ABC News received a legitimate tip from our anonymous tip line long before the Slate.com piece was published. ABC News conducted our own lengthy, independent investigation which included extensive archival research and interviews with numerous law enforcement officials, which furthered our on-going investigation into the stolen baby case."" I am happy to acknowledge the ways in which ABC has pushed the story along. The 20/20 special included still photographs and video footage of Taylor that I'd never seen before, archival finds that will thrill any welfare queen obsessive. The 20/20 crew also revealed that they tracked the man Johnnie Harbaugh believes helped his mother abduct the Fronczak baby--a man who ABC and I have declined to name, due (at least on my part) to the lack of hard evidence implicating him in the kidnapping--to a town in Tennessee before the trail ran cold. That's a tidbit I had not discovered. Harbaugh also told ABC that his mother called the Fronczak baby Tiger, while he told me that he wasn't sure that Tiger and the Fronczak child were one and the same. (In fairness to him, it was surely difficult to keep track of which kid was which--Linda Taylor seems to have pilfered a lot of children.) I will continue to work on this story in the months to come, and I hope ABC does, too. If you have any additional information on Linda Taylor, send me an email. And--credit where credit is due--if you think you may know something about Paul Fronczak's mysterious origins, you should email George Knapp."	"How 20/20 Repackaged My ""Welfare Queen"" Reporting and Billed It as an ABC Exclusive"	['Paul', 'Walters', 'Ross']	[]
