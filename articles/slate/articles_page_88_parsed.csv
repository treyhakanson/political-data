As Slate's David Weigel reports,"" I chatted with Breitbart on Saturday, in Michigan, where he was giving a speech to an Americans for Prosperity conference, and he was as hyped-up and funny as I'd ever seen him."" In 2010, Christopher Beam profiled Breitbart. The article is reprinted below. The first time I saw Andrew Breitbart, he was publicly insulting a reporter. ""Kate Zernike of the New York Times, are you in the room?"" he asked the crowd. ""Are you in the room?"" Heads turned. Apparently not. ""You're despicable,"" Breitbart said. ""You're a despicable human being."" Zernike's offense: an item posted on a Times blog in which she said a speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where Breitbart was also speaking, had mocked President Obama in ""racial tones"" by adopting a ""Chris Rock voice."" Breitbart disagreed. ""She's the one that correlated his voice to Chris Rock. He happens to be from Brooklyn! He's using his voice!"" Laughter and applause. ""This is what these creeps do,"" Breitbart said. ""I'm sick of having cocktails with them. I'm now at war with them. No more cocktails.""

Ritual denunciations of the mainstream media, as well as personal invective, are not uncommon at CPAC. (It's where Ann Coulter famously insinuated that John Edwards was gay.) Even so, Breitbart stands out. Conservative figures may rail against the media, but they rarely call out reporters by name. They rely on those reporters, after all. It's one thing to toss fans some vague media-bashing red meat. It's another to deliberately alienate individual journalists in terms usually reserved for murder trials.

In the past year Andrew Breitbart has gone from Internet famous--for years he served as Matt Drudge's second-in-command, then in 2005 he helped found the Huffington Post--to famous famous. Now, with a budding eponymous Internet empire of his own, he's using it to inflame the left, one bilious, apoplectic, vein-popping, pseudo-comedic rant at a time. The hard part is figuring out who the joke is on. Since January 2009, Breitbart has launched three Web sites--Big Hollywood, Big Government, and Big Journalism--each a conservative critique of their respective industries. Big Hollywood broke the story that got a flack for the National Endowment for the Arts tossed from the Obama administration. Big Government posted the now-famous videos that showed two young conservatives, James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles, entering several offices of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, better known as ACORN, posing as a pimp and a prostitute looking to open a brothel for underage, illegal immigrant girls. Meanwhile, Breitbart's face and voice--a younger John Lithgow who sounds like Rush Limbaugh if he surfed--are everywhere, at least in the conservative media. He's a regular on Fox News. He has guest-hosted Dennis Miller's radio show and does frequent spots on Hannity. His sparring match with MSNBC's David Shuster in January, after O'Keefe was arrested for entering Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans office under false pretenses in what the FBI claimed was a phone tampering scheme, introduced him to liberals as that guy who yells even more than Chris Matthews. His Twitter feed, meanwhile, is a dutiful liveblog of his unfiltered brain firings. ""I've never met a person as depraved as Eric Boehlert,"" Breitbart tweeted one night at 2 a.m., referring to his vocal critic at the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America. ""What a sickening variant of the human form. His mother must throw up thinking of him."" Breitbart also enjoys retweeting his critics' most derisive comments. This recent message is typical: ""RT @ johnandrewwalsh: RT @ andrewbreitbart I am positively DRENCHED in semen!"" At any given moment, the odds that Andrew Breitbart is emitting words are roughly 9 in 10. Breitbart is a pundit scientifically calibrated to piss off liberals. By Saturday morning, after his speech in the main hall at CPAC, Breitbart is trailing flipcams. Most of them are toted by liberal journalists looking to grill him on ACORN. Breitbart gladly submits. ""Are you insane?"" he asks Salon's Mike Madden. ""Why don't you care about ACORN?"" ""Fuck. You. John. Podesta,"" he intones, leaning over to speak directly into a reporter's notebook as if it were a microphone. (Podesta, president of the liberal Center for American Progress, also sits on ACORN's Advisory Council.) He calls The Nation's Max Blumenthal, who criticized O'Keefe for attending a panel with a white supremacist, ""the most despicable life form I've ever seen."" (Watch clips here, here, here, here, and here, or the Slate V compilation below.) The videos serve as the ultimate Breitbart Rorschach test. To the left, they expose Breitbart once and for all as a blubbering, red-faced freakazoid. To the right, they're the testimony of a telegenic hero finally standing up to the liberal media.  For Breitbart, bringing down the mainstream media isn't just a crusade. It's practically a civil rights issue--only more fun. He considers himself a journalist-slash-entertainer, an Edward R. Murrow by way of the Merry Pranksters. What makes him different is that he's offensive in every sense of the word. ""My entire business model is to go on offense,"" he said. ""They don't like our aggressiveness."" He knows how he's seen by the liberal establishment. ""They want to portray me as crazy, unhinged, unbalanced. OK, good, fine. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you."" As media criticism, it's not subtle. But then, neither is Andrew Breitbart. As a six-word corporate motto, however--a kind of elevator pitch for the whole Breitbart enterprise--it is genius. As long as his message is getting through, Breitbart doesn't care if you think he's an asshole. Assholes get attention. **** ""Media is everything. It's everything."" It was the first night of CPAC, and Breitbart was having a heart-to-heart with O'Keefe at an after party at Morton's Steakhouse in Washington. When O'Keefe first approached Breitbart with a handful of ACORN videos over the summer, Breitbart plotzed. But his enthusiasm didn't come from wanting to expose ACORN. ""That was James and Hannah's bugaboo,"" he said. Breitbart wanted to expose the media. ""When they came to me, I told them, 'You don't understand, you're about to prove my thesis,' "" he said. He knew the mainstream media would resist covering the story, so he formulated a strategy to force them to cover it. The idea was simple: Post the videos one at a time. Never say how many videos there are altogether. And space them out in such a way that ACORN's inevitable backtracking would be contradicted by future videos. It worked. The first video posted on Sept. 10. After the second video went up, ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said that O'Keefe and Giles's ruse had failed at several other ACORN offices, including in New York. The next day, Big Government posted the New York video. It turned out the pair had not been thrown out at all. They had been instructed to, among other things, bury their sex money in a tin in their back yard. The New York Times did cover the story. But only after Congress had already voted to rescind federal funds from ACORN. The paper's tardiness earned it a slap on the wrist from its ombudsman, Clark Hoyt. Breitbart's main beef, though, is that the Times didn't cover ACORN--it covered the coverage. The reporter, Scott Shane, treated the videos and ACORN's response as a political spat between two warring factions, rather than as an expose of corruption that merited further digging. Of course, it's the prerogative of the Times to decide what's published in the Times. Maybe it just didn't think the ACORN scandal was that big a deal. (Shane said as much to Hoyt.)Plus, when the publication breaking the news is itself fresh-faced and unproven, as Big Government was, the big dogs are always skeptical. Breitbart doesn't buy it. ""It's one of the biggest stories ever,"" he says, comparing it to Watergate and Abu Ghraib. ""It's a big-ass story."" Nor do ethical objections persuade him. By Times standards, the ACORN story was ill-gotten. The Times doesn't allow its reporters to misrepresent themselves. Why would it follow up on a story by a news organization that does? Breitbart dismisses this as pointy-headed Columbia Journalism School twaddle: ""If Blackwater said, 'We know who raped those Iraqi girls, but we covered that up,' and somebody got an internship at Blackwater and exposed them, do you think they'd be asking whether the person got the internship under illegitimate means? ... This is what journalists do. They get the story."" The best measurement of the ACORN videos' impact may be the lengths to which Breitbart's opponents have gone to discredit them. Follow the back-and-forth closely, and you'll quickly find yourself deep down a rabbit hole of charges, countercharges, and counter-countercharges over such details as whether O'Keefe went into ACORN's offices dressed as a pimp or in business casual. (Answer: business casual. But critics say the credits montage used in each video, in which he wears a fur jacket and sunglasses, intentionally misleads viewers. They also fault the normally correction-obsessed Breitbart for failing to correct news stories that misreported that O'Keefe wore the pimp costume all along.) To Breitbart, what O'Keefe was wearing is beside the point. What matters is the behavior of the ACORN employees. Still, to placate his critics, Breitbart has offered to release the complete, unedited video footage--but only if Boehlert or Podesta agrees to watch it with him in public, followed by a Q&A. (Breitbart has already released the complete transcripts and audio.) Breitbart knows they won't take him up on the offer. But that's the point: His job is to extend the story. To drag it out as long as he can. That's why he won't just release the full videos online. ""Because no one would cover it,"" Breitbart said. ""Now the more they come after me, the bigger the story gets, the more the pressure builds. ... I'm admitting it publicly: I'm fucking with you."" Put another way, he advocates fiercely for his stories. He waged a long-running war with the Washington Post, for example, over its inaccurate description of the charges against O'Keefe. (The results of his efforts can be seen at the top of this piece.) He urges other conservatives to tape their conversations with reporters, in case they get misquoted. ""I will skullfuck anyone who misrepresents what I say,"" he said. Journalistic objectivity isn't impossible, per Breitbart. It's just extremely rare. ""I've met many journalists who impress me with their ability to play it straight,"" he said. ""I think they're the exception to the rule."" Most journalists will claim to be objective. But ""out of the other side of mouth, they say they got into it because of social justice and economic equality. It's obviously a contradiction."" Is there any publication he considers objective? ""Playboy,"" he said. ***** Breitbart wasn't always conservative. He wasn't even always a Breitbart. He was adopted at 3 weeks old in 1969 by Gerald and Arlene Breitbart, who raised him in Brentwood, an upscale neighborhood in Los Angeles. His father owned a restaurant, his mother was a banker--which by Brentwood standards made them working class. His sister, Tracey, a year younger, was also adopted, as were many of his friends. ""Adoption was a big thing before Roe v. Wade,"" he said. ""Trust me on that one."" (Breitbart said he once bribed someone in Sacramento $500 to show him his original birth certificate. His birth father had listed his occupation as ""folk singer."") His parents raised him Jewish--his mother converted in order to marry his father--but the faith didn't take. Especially when he realized Mom and Dad weren't exactly frum. One day, he fell and chipped his tooth. ""I said, 'Jesus Christ,' and my mom said, 'Don't use the Lord's name in vain.' I was like, 'I'm Jewish, Jesus is not the Lord. I was just Bar Mitzvah'ed. You were there.' "" When their rabbi defended Jesse Jackson after his ""Hymietown"" comment, the family left the synagogue. Breitbart remembers his upbringing as otherwise apolitical. But in 1980s Los Angeles, apolitical generally meant liberal by default. More important was celebrity culture. His friends' parents would send his parents pictures of themselves in Beverly Hills society magazines. ""My dad would be like, 'Why are they sending us this?' "" Breitbart didn't do well at the Brentwood School, one of the top private schools in L.A. He was friends with most everyone in his class--""My sense of humor saved me""--but did not distinguish himself in academics or extracurricular activities. His football coach, Pat Brown, said he was always screwing up the plays: ""Things like not knowing the assignment. Maybe hitting someone too late. I always said there's a fine line between aggressiveness and stupidity."" One of the first articles Breitbart ever published appeared in his high-school newspaper, the Brentwood Eagle, in 1986. It was an anthropological dissection of the school's senior and junior parking lots. One had Mercedes and BMWs, the other Sciroccos and GTIs. Breitbart needed a quote to support his thesis. So he made one up--and attributed it to the new kid from South Korea, Henry Sohn. Breitbart recalls it verbatim: ""Seniors are having too much of nice car than juniors."" ""He loved it,"" Breitbart says. It was an epiphany. Not only did Breitbart enjoy writing--he found he could do it in a quirky, funny, politically incorrect way. Breitbart kept writing in college. His first piece for the Tulane Hullaballoo was a field analysis of Tulane's most notoriously debauched hookup bar, complete with annotated floor diagrams and submitted on 19 cocktail napkins. ""Then I started to descend into pure weirdness,"" Breitbart said. His articles were stream-of-consciousness brain dumps written on deadline. One recounted a bowling date with the fictional Ambassador Johnny Autrod DeBumperspoons. ""He was ambassador to Chile,"" Breitbart said, ""but he was also ambassador to Chili's the restaurant chain, and the ambassador to the sensation of being chilly."" College was also when Breitbart began to question liberalism--or at least its judgmental, humorless coastal variant. He'd come back home to Los Angeles to find friends skeptical of the South. ""I said, 'You won't believe it, these are people who are actually normal, actually funnier than us, and they're not as uptight, it's really weird. They're not snobs.' And they're like, 'You're wrong about those people, they're ignorant and they're horrible.' So I go, 'There's something wrong with this picture.' "" For four years after college, Breitbart bounced from job to job, city to city. He waited tables at Hal's Bar and Grill near Venice Beach. He wrote for an alternative music magazine, which allowed him to interview bands he loved--Crowded House, The Church, The The. He moved to Austin for a year. He coded briefly for E! Online. He'd always wanted to write comedy (dream job: writing jokes for Chris Elliott), so he went to work for a production company. It didn't go well. Part of it was the material. One supposedly big break for him was an offer to develop Valley Girl 2. ""I remember being like, 'Wait, is this not the worst fucking idea you've ever heard of?' "" The other part was the crowd. ""The people who come to L.A. saw Beverly Hills, 90210 or a variation on that theme, and so that's how they act there. Or they see Entourage. So you have bad actors coming to Hollywood bad-acting the part of what they think Hollywood is like. So you have really insecure people in a non-meritocracy where it's all about your relationships, who are vicious backstabbers, who don't think you should be dating somebody. It's like an orgy of people climbing over each other to stick it into the next orifice."" Breitbart first met Susie Bean at a karaoke bar in 1988. He'd heard about her from their mutual friend, Mike, who phoned Breitbart at Tulane to tell him that he'd met Breitbart's future wife. When he and Susie landed back in Los Angeles four years later, they bonded over their shared appreciation of Chris Elliott's genius. Breitbart was nearly as smitten with Susie's father, the actor Orson Bean, as he was with Susie. And vice versa. ""I was very taken with him,"" said Bean. A former liberal who had been blacklisted as a Communist in the 1950s, Bean was also the person who introduced Breitbart to Rush Limbaugh. Breitbart spotted a copy of The Way Things Ought To Be on the coffee table. ""I said, 'Did you read this for giggles?' "" Breitbart said. ""He said, 'Have you listened to Rush?' I said, 'Yeah, he's a Nazi or something.' He goes, 'Are you sure you've listened to him?' "" When Breitbart's favorite radio station started playing grunge--which he despised--he flipped to talk radio instead. ""At first it was like a foreign language to me. But over time, it started to make sense."" That was around the time of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings, to which Breitbart traces his politicization. He was a liberal then. But watching Ted Kennedy and Senate Democrats accuse Thomas of sexually harassing Anita Hill broke the needle on his hypocrisy meter. ""These white, privileged men knew that by taking this conservative, religious man and asking him if he rented pornography, the mere exposure of that would hurt. ... I was so pissed off. You guys are just trying to ruin him. You don't have anything."" The Clinton presidency further stoked his rage. ""Bill Clinton comes in, and his entire M.O. is mowing down as much trim as he can. ... Yet the feminists ignored Bill Clinton and they excoriated Clarence Thomas. That's everything to me."" Professionally, Breitbart struggled. ""I was like, 'Please God--and I'm not religious--please God, give me something that I'm passionate about. Because I cannot do something well that I'm not passionate about.' "" In 1995, Breitbart started reading Matt Drudge's e-mail newsletter, then called, simply, Report. It wasn't a Web site yet--just a mix of Hollywood gossip, Clinton Whitewater news, and extreme weather. Breitbart was impressed enough to send Drudge a note. Drudge lived in Hollywood at the time, and they arranged a meeting. Breitbart soon started working for Drudge. He doesn't like to talk about that period, citing Drudge's desire for privacy. ""He's a mysterious dude. And I grant him that mystery."" What we do know is that the Drudge Report was not a cash cow--at least not at first. (Drudge started running ads in 1999.) So while Breitbart had found his dream job, it wasn't feeding him. Breitbart eventually became known as Drudge's second-in-command--or, as he put it, ""Drudge's bitch."" Drudge would aggregate and post headlines in the morning; Breitbart would take the afternoon shift. It was Drudge who introduced Breitbart to Arianna Huffington, then a conservative syndicated columnist, who hired Breitbart as her research assistant. ""Arianna was my Mr. Miyagi,"" Breitbart said. ""She turned me from a slacker into a hyperproductive person."" Breitbart originally thought he'd be doing Web design for her. But it quickly became clear he would be her researcher--sometimes up to 16 hours a day. ""I was like, what did I sign up for?"" In retrospect, that Breitbart discovered his two loves simultaneously--politics and the Internet--seems miraculous. So does the timing. Breitbart was able to embrace the Web only because he had drifted for so long. ""All my other friends were committed, whether it be law school, medical school,"" he said. ""I had zero to lose. So I was like, This is it. I'm doing it."" Some say the Internet is changing the way our brains work. Whatever that way is, Breitbart's ADD-addled brain was already there. ""I have a very good memory. I'm also good at connecting things together. That allowed me to make outrageous cockamamie narratives. To be able to apply that to the newsworld, that was it."" Breitbart stuck with Drudge for the good part of a decade. In 1997, he and Susie got married in Orson Bean's backyard garden on the Venice canals in Los Angeles. Their first of four children, Samson, was born two years later. Breitbart took on side projects. In 2004, he co-produced a documentary about the death of Vince Foster that was slated to appear on the History Channel but never ran. That same year, he co-authored a book with the journalist Mark Ebner about the absurdity of celebrity culture, Hollywood, Interrupted. (The book is dedicated to ""Benjamin Geza Affleck."") Along the way, Breitbart eased into a new role as curator, connector, and booster of the right. Especially in Hollywood. He became a regular at the monthly gathering of L.A. writers and pundits at the Japanese restaurant Yamashiro. He befriended Ann Coulter. He would later introduce Steven Soderbergh's agent-turned-right-wing-documentarian Pat Dollard to financial backers for his film about Iraq. ""I'm the Simon Cowell of the conservative movement,"" Breitbart said. ""You've got talent, you don't."" After the 2004 election, Breitbart got a call from Huffington. She wanted to talk about starting a Web site. Breitbart no longer worked for her--he had moved to Drudge full time in 1999, and Huffington had since become a devout liberal--but they were still friends. At Huffington's request, Breitbart said, he drew up the plan that eventually became the Huffington Post. ""It was basically my idea,"" Breitbart recalled. (Though the name, he said, came from his wife. Arianna initially wanted to call it the Huffington Report). ""I was basically the architect and they were the implementers."" A Huffington Post spokesman disputed Breitbart's account: ""It's odd that five years after HuffPost launched, Andrew Breitbart is now claiming he 'created the Huffington Post.' Whatever. Success has many fathers, right? Arianna Huffington and Ken Lerer created the Huffington Post. Andrew helped get it up and running, as did Jonah Peretti and Roy Sekoff. It was a team effort. But Andrew didn't come up with the idea."" Breitbart was brought on full time in the months leading up to the site's launch. The plan was to have Huffington oversee the blogs--the site relied on celebrity screeds more than it does now--while Breitbart would handle the news aggregation. Kenneth Lerer, a former AOL Time Warner executive vice president who would become chairman of Huffington Post, shuttled between the news and business sides. Breitbart said he knew that working at a liberal site would produce conflict--within himself, as much as with others. But the opportunity to do something new and influential was too tempting. ""I didn't want to exist in Drudge's shadow in perpetuity,"" he said. ""And by helping Arianna create the Huffington Post and making it a success, I felt it would allow for people to say, 'Oh, this guy kind of understands this milieu.' "" The Huffington Post, meanwhile, could brag that it had stolen the secret sauce from Drudge. Once the site launched, Breitbart lasted three weeks. ""Editorial differences to the nth degree"" is how he characterizes the breakup. Breitbart was nominally in charge of aggregation. But he had thought that while the opinion blogs would be mostly liberal, he could bring in some conservative voices. This turned out not to be the case. He was also asked to take a larger role in the site's day-to-day operations than he had expected. Political tensions sometimes blended with personal ones. Lerer in particular chafed at Breitbart's style. He didn't like the headlines Breitbart wrote. The time difference between New York and Los Angeles also created conflict. Some days, 11 a.m. would roll around and the headline would be from the night before, to Lerer's dismay. ""I think that the conflict was that Ken and I liked each other,"" Breitbart said. ""I thought that I could convert Ken, and Ken thought he could convert me. And when both of us realized that wasn't going to happen, it was like, 'Oh, OK.' "" As for Huffington: ""Trust me, we've got one of the great awkward air-kiss relationships going."" ""It was a difficult period with unpredictable results that in hindsight worked out for everyone,"" Breitbart said. ""I'm happy Arianna has the Huffington Post."" Not to be misunderstood, he added: ""Let it be known that I seethe with contempt for 90 percent of what appears on that site."" Breitbart's next move, in August 2005, was Breitbart.com. The idea was quietly brilliant. Before, when news broke, the Drudge Report would link to wire stories hosted by, say, the Washington Post or the Los Angeles Times. Those sites would thus get huge amounts of traffic for content they paid for but didn't produce. Breitbart.com simply aggregated all the wire services--Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France-Presse, UPI, and others--in one place. So whenever Drudge linked to a wire story, he would link to Breitbart.com. The site has since produced a steady income. ""It allows for me to have a middle-class to upper-middle-class life in Los Angeles,"" Breitbart said. ""Probably the lifestyle of a backup catcher."" (Brad Ausmus, a backup catcher for the Dodgers, made $1 million in 2009.) Breitbart now lives in a triple-decker house on a hill in the neighborhood of Westwood, near where he grew up. He's got art on the walls--including an original Solidarity poster he found for $2,000--and a small basketball court out back. For years, the house doubled as his office. When the three Big sites were gearing up to launch in 2009, his colleagues piled into his basement. The kids would run in and out. They'd hold meetings at the dining room table. This arrangement became too much, particularly for Susie, who had to take care of the kids in the middle of a daily political circus. (Their cat had to be relocated to Bean's house due to stress.) So Breitbart leased some office space in Santa Monica. The workplace consists of four rooms and two cubicles. ""Isn't this so weird I have an office?"" Breitbart says. It's the first time in 15 years. ***** ""I have two speeds,"" Breitbart likes to say. ""Humor and righteous indignation."" It's meant to be self-deprecating. But it's also the secret to his effectiveness. When anyone dismisses Breitbart as a loon, he comes back at them with moral fury. When they threaten to pin him down in an argument, he wriggles free with a joke. Or he simply changes the subject. Breitbart doesn't pretend to care about policy. ""Have you ever seen me on TV? I always change the subject to the media context. It's my monkey trick. It's what I do."" (His clash with David Shuster is a valuable case study.) Breitbart thus occupies a weird space in the media universe. He claims no expertise. ""It's like when people are like, 'What do you think we should do on health care?' I don't fucking have a clue. It's too complicated for me."" (This does not prevent Breitbart from doing Fox News hits about health care.) He doesn't prognosticate, either. ""I don't want to be a guy who's simply processing the best of Charles Krauthammer and Mark Steyn and coming up with my formulated hodgepodge that is a synthesis of what the experts are saying. So I defer to them."" Breitbart likes to think of himself as the big-picture guy. Sure, he can be the doofus who rubs his nipples and snorts red wine powder. But when it comes to substance, every discussion is panoramic. He talks culture as much as politics. Change the way people think, goes his argument, and you'll change the policies they support. ""I'm trying to shift the focus of conservative movement from the narrow--the policy--to a much higher elevation, granting them a greater perspective."" He's all about unified theory. That's why he can transition naturally from Obama (""a joyless PC freak"") to ACORN to Bill Clinton to Clarence Thomas to Hollywood to political correctness to the New York Times before finally settling on why Sarah Palin should skip the presidency and just become ""red-state Oprah."" It's the upside of Breitbart's ADD. Breitbart traces everything he despises about cultural liberalism to his college days. ""When I told my parents I was an American studies major, they were like, 'That's fantastic! Did you read Mark Twain?' 'No, I didn't.' 'What did you read?' 'Marcuse, Adorno, Horkheimer, Michel Foucault.' 'They don't sound American!' 'They're not.' "" Luckily, recalls Breitbart, ""I was too drunk to be completely indoctrinated by it."" He also resents being lectured about multiculturalism, in part because of his upbringing. He's Irish-American by blood. His sister is Hispanic. Their father is Jewish. Their mother was born Midwestern Protestant. ""That's why I hate this multicultural shit,"" Breitbart said. ""You're not gonna tell me my sister and I are different because we're not blood."" The advantage of coming from the left, however, is that Breitbart knows the left, which enables him to use the left's language and tropes against it. Rachel Maddow isn't just wrong. ""She believes in a poststructural model in which she's a lesbian progressive activist first and an American fifth, sixth."" Maureen Dowd doesn't just make fun of Dick Cheney. She creates a ""Republican other."" Eric Boehlert doesn't just falsely misrepresent Breitbart's views. ""He takes text and deconstructs it and then makes false accusations based upon the most ridiculous readings."" I asked Breitbart whether the appropriation is intentional. ""I'm saying that with a grain of irony,"" he said. ""You gave me these tools, I'm going to use them back against you."" Meanwhile, he and O'Keefe explicitly acknowledge their debt to Chicago activist and community organizer Saul Alinsky. O'Keefe told the New York Post in September that he had been inspired by Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, particularly the lesson that ""ridicule is man's most potent weapon."" He said he wanted to expose the ""absurdities of the enemy by employing their own rules and language."" That could mean testing the limits of ACORN's willingness to help unsavory characters get loans. Or it could be as simple as pointing out that Max Blumenthal has a booger hanging from his nose. The willingness to be ridiculous is something Breitbart has on his critics. When Media Matters finds a discrepancy in one of Breitbart's stories, it calls him out for breach of journalistic ethics. ""He's a pathological liar,"" Boehlert says. ""These people are almost incapable of telling the truth."" When Breitbart finds an error, he trots out Retracto, the Correction Alpaca. Another advantage is Breitbart's readiness to go to the mat over minutiae. Most public figures, when facing an attack on their integrity, make a mental calculation. Do I respond and dignify the attacker? Or do I let it go? Breitbart always fires back--sometimes unnecessarily. ""Just because you can retweet everything about yourself and every inch of your scorched earth crusade doesn't mean you should,"" said Breitbart acquaintance and Mother Jones Washington bureau chief David Corn. A formative moment for Breitbart the pugilist was his appearance on Bill Maher last March. Among Maher, guest Michael Eric Dyson, and the audience, Breitbart was taking it from all sides. Yet at the end of the show, he felt energized. ""I kind of like getting hit,"" he said. ""The adrenaline is running. Bring it on."" In a bygone era, Breitbart's manner--the shouting matches, the nipple rubbing, the 2 a.m. tweets about his enemies' mothers--would be considered a career killer for any aspiring media mogul. Yet Breitbart's career shows no signs of collapsing. His success instead is testament to a new era in which sobermindedness is no longer a requirement for influence. ""I can't fire me,"" Breitbart likes to say. Yet his opponents seem to think that cogent arguments will somehow drive him away. ""They think they can take me down, that they can hurt me,"" says Breitbart. ""It just makes me bigger."" **** Breitbart made his career piggybacking on the work of the mainstream media at the Drudge Report. Now he's one its most vocal critics. The paradox is nothing new--new media have always depended on old media as both a source and foil--but it's still a paradox. ""I've said I have a dysfunctional relationship with the mainstream media,"" Breitbart said. ""It was a dance. You're getting traffic from us. We're helping you into this transparent new media age."" Breitbart's goal is to eliminate the paradox altogether. There's a maxim that Breitbart wants to be ""the Arianna Huffington of the right."" Nonsense, he said. ""I'd rather be the Ted Turner of the right."" The analogy is one of scale as much as politics. He doesn't just want to be a parasite and critic of the mainstream media. He wants to displace it. Breitbart's model currently combines aggregation with commentary and original reporting--a kind of right-wing Huffington Post but uglier and less comprehensive, albeit with far fewer costs.  The investigative portion, according to his plan, will snowball. Big Government has posted other stories in the James O'Keefe mold. In one, a young woman films herself seeking help at an Alabama Planned Parenthood clinic while claiming to be a 14-year-old impregnated by a 35-year-old man, to see if the organization would report a statutory rape to authorities. (It didn't, and after an investigation, the clinic was put on probation.) The aggregation, meanwhile, will get more sophisticated. Frugality is key. Breitbart says all the ""Big"" sites are self-sustaining, thanks in part to low overhead. They pay salaries to eight people total: one editor per site; a chief technology officer; plus Breitbart; his associate editor, Alex; and his childhood friend and business partner Larry Solov. Hannah Giles is newly on staff. Bloggers don't get paid. (O'Keefe was paid a lump sum, as opposed to a regular salary, for telling his ACORN story on Big Government.) Solov said the sites get more than 10 million unique visitors and about 40 million page views every month. Breitbart.com is still the biggest traffic magnet, with about 5 million uniques and 15 million page views per month thanks largely to Drudge links, followed by Big Government, which rates about 1.75 million uniques and 8 million page views, according to Solov. (The independent traffic analysis site Quantcast estimates that Breitbart.com attracts 3.2 million unique visitors per month. Compete puts it at 1.3 million, with BigGovernment in the hundreds of thousands.) Each new site launches when the old ones become self-sustaining, Solov said. Just last week, they paid off a $25,000 loan from Breitbart's parents that helped launch Big Government. Other sites are in the works. Next up is Big Peace, a site dedicated to national security news. Big Education and Big Tolerance--sites dealing with liberal bias in academia and homosexuality from a conservative angle, respectively--will probably come after. Breitbart promises more prank videos in the near future. (The next stunt targets Housing and Urban Development offices in Detroit and Chicago, as well as the Detroit Free Press, as Wired has reported.) He enjoys creating suspense, but also finds it silly. When he suggested on Greg Gutfeld's show Red Eye that he would take down the institutional left ""in the next three weeks,"" the Twitterverse mockingly dubbed it #breitbartocalypse. ""I used to say something and no one would care,"" Breitbart said. ""Now I say something and the left freaks out."" As if he needed more platforms, Breitbart got more than $500,000 for his upcoming book, Thinking Big. Part memoir, part intellectual expose of the ""liberal matrix"" from which a nation of Neos must free themselves, the book is essentially the Breitbart manifesto. ""Books are so 2003,"" Breitbart said. ""Books should only be written if you have something to say."" **** That doesn't seem to be a problem.

Despite his many advantages in Michigan, the race was a nail-biter. In the end, Romney won 41 percent of the vote to 38 percent for Rick Santorum. ""We didn't win by a lot, but we won by enough but that's all that counts,"" said Romney at his victory party, looking relieved to have survived another near-death experience. In Arizona, he clobbered the former Pennsylvania senator 47 percent to 26 percent. By the end of the night, Romney captured more than 30 new delegates. On that score, he is now well ahead of his rivals. Although Michigan was the 10th contest of the 2012 Republican primary, it was the first two-man race to test the fault lines of the Republican Party: a battle between the establishment candidate, Mitt Romney, and the populist candidate, Rick Santorum. In the end, both men weakened themselves. Romney underscored his fundamental vulnerability: He struggled to win party stalwarts in a head-to head fight despite superior finances, a vast organizational advantage, and local roots. Santorum's opposition to everything from college to contraception frightened Republicans who think his values-laden and ideologically strident tone would not only cost him the presidential election but hurt House and Senate Republican candidates, too. In another election season, Romney's victories in Arizona and Michigan would suggest he has momentum. Perhaps it will this time. It didn't after he won in New Hampshire or Florida. In this race, candidates have shown bursts of speed, but just as someone seems poised to break away, they run out of breath. So the race continues: one runner with emphysema (Santorum), the other with asthma (Romney). For the moment, Romney is back in the lead, lungs open and face rosy. But if past is prologue, he might soon feel a tickle in his throat. The future for Romney is unclear because his party is so openly divided. It was evident in the exit polls. Thirty-two percent of the voters said defeating Obama was the most important quality they looked for in a candidate. Of that group, Mitt Romney beat Rick Santorum handily, 61 percent to 24 percent. On the other side of the party were those who voted based on character and ideology. Twenty-five percent picked strong moral character as their No. 1 quality. Of those, Santorum was dominant, swamping Romney by 41 points, 57 percent to 16 percent. Of the 17 percent who voted based on who was the true conservative, Santorum beat Romney by an almost identical 40-point margin. One party, two worlds. Romney won in Michigan with a familiar coalition of older and wealthy voters. Fifty-five percent of voters said the economy was the most important issue in helping them determine their vote. Romney won that group by 17 points with 47 percent of the vote. There was also good news for Romney in that voters valued his time in the private sector, preferring a candidate with business experience over government experience 57 percent to 31 percent. This was the only large group that Romney won with a majority. Santorum did very well with evangelical voters and those who identified themselves as ""very conservative."" He won both groups by double digits. He also scored well with die-hard Tea Party members, but Romney was able to split the vote among the 52 percent who say they support the Tea Party. Romney showed that outside of the Party's ideological purists, he could find support. Romney also won self-identified Republicans by 10 points. In the final days, he was able to grow his vote into Santorum's territory more than Santorum was able to do the opposite. Romney's organization paid off the way it had in Florida. He identified his voters and encouraged them to vote by absentee ballot. CBS estimated that 22 percent of them did and Romney won that group 41 percent to 35 percent. He also won among independent voters and moderates. Santorum did not benefit much from Democratic mischief-makers, though the pranksters did show up in the exit polls. Democrats voted overwhelmingly for Santorum, with 53 percent picking the former senator vs. the 17 percent who chose Romney. Among those self-identified as ""somewhat liberal,"" Santorum beat Romney 32 percent to 27 percent. But there just weren't enough of them to change the outcome. Nine percent of the voters identified as Democrats, hardly more than the 7 percent who participated in 2008. Now Rick Santorum faces the questions of viability that Mitt Romney once did. Does he have the discipline, the money, and the skill to win beyond his ultraconservative base? After conceding Michigan, Santorum immediately began a course correction. Speaking to his election night party, he opened by talking about his mother, who earned more money than his father. He talked about work-life balance. He retained his attacks on the Obama administration's overreach but kept his emphasis on his plans for the economy. Now the landscape changes again. There are 10  contests on the March 6 Super Tuesday. Ohio is the biggest prize. Santorum has been ahead in several Ohio polls, but more than 40 percent of those surveyed have said their support is soft. Romney will get a bump, but he won't have a home state advantage in Ohio, a state that has more evangelical voters than Michigan. Romney--unlike Santorum and Newt Gingrich--also had his act together enough to get on the Virginia ballot. But the other big states--Tennessee, Georgia, and Oklahoma--don't look good for Romney at the moment. For the last several weeks, Santorum has been inching toward becoming the conservative alternative to Romney. If that holds, the party split Romney barely survived tonight could continue to bedevil him. However, Super Tuesday will widen the race, and with it could mark the return of Gingrich, who believes he will do well in Southern states. If Gingrich rises again and keeps splitting the vote with Santorum, it could be a long summer with Santorum winning the Midwest, Gingrich the South, and Romney the states of any true size. If that's the case, then this may not be the last time Mitt Romney's campaign is born again. "	After Michigan, Can Romney Continue To Limp Forward?	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/in_michigan_mitt_romney_is_trying_to_appeal_to_as_many_republicans_as_possible_.html	"FLINT, Mich.--Mitt Romney's advance team has a simple mission: Make the candidate look like he's already president. Maybe he was sworn in when you weren't paying attention. To see him, you had to sign up with the campaign, show up early, prove your harmlessness to the Secret Service, and find a place in a theater-in-the-round set-up where the candidate is flanked by whale-sized American flags. Romney showed up in casual chic: dress shirt, blue jeans, dress shoes. The speech took advantage of only a third of the room--curtains clipped off the rest of it--so the crowd, mustachioed security, and media pen were pushed together for maximum effect. (Clearly, the campaign had learned its lesson from the less-than-epic staging of his Friday economic speech.) Romney paced the stage in front of a bleacher full of Kettering University students. ""Kids can't find work,"" said Romney. ""This is something I've heard Dick Armey say: It used to be that the American dream was owning your own home. Now, the American dream is getting your kids to move out of your home!"" The Kettering students, serious-looking in matching gray T-shirts, did not laugh. The rest of the crowd did. They were being asked to whipsaw between jokes like this, brief descriptions of what he'd do in office, and patriotic musings on the common man. ""Everywhere I go, I see people who love this country,"" said Romney. ""I'm proud of the fact that when we perform the national anthem, we put our hands on our hearts."" He put his hand on his heart. ""The reason we do that is to honor the blood that has been shed by those who have sacrificed for liberty."" Romney's pitch to this crowd was hardly different from the pitch he'd used in Iowa and New Hampshire. The stakes were very different there. In Iowa, he only needed to avoid falling far below his 2008 numbers--he basically tied them. In New Hampshire, he had to rack up a huge vote to prove that he'd gained ground since he lost to John McCain. Michigan, though--Michigan is different. After Rick Santorum won two caucuses and a ""beauty content"" (no delegate) primary, he moved ahead of Romney in Michigan primary polls. No one had bested Romney in those local polls since 2009. Santorum adviser John Brabender has said his candidate ""already won"" here, because he's forcing Romney to hustle in the place where he was born. A lot of campaign spin is self-evidently ridiculous. Brabender's spin is not. Even if Romney wins here, Republicans already want to know why he's struggling. There's no new reason. Romney's weekend blitz of the state took him to wildly different segments of the GOP base. He was very comfortable with one of them: well-groomed, well-heeled Republicans, the kind that run local party organizations and clap awkwardly to Bob Seger songs. The others--the sort of people who either rebelled against the ""establishment"" in 2010--didn't hug him so close. Romney's Saturday started off well. He was the star of the Ingham County Lincoln Day breakfast, an eggs-and-coffee-and-county-commissioner-placards affair in the dining room of a Lansing, Mich., country club. Before he spoke, Republicans heard ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" sung by the Old School Fellas, a zoot-suited amateur doo-wop group. ""Mitt's a good, Christian man like I am,"" explained Clinton Tarver, wearing the reddest of the zoot suits. Romney spent five of his 25 minutes reminiscing about the state. ""I remember my dad's first inauguration,"" he said. ""As I recall, it was a snowy day. A very cold day."" He spotted a friend in the crowd. ""You were there! As I recall, they'd just changed the slogan of the state, on license plates. It had been Water Wonderland. They changed it to Winter Water Wonderland. It was hard just to say it!"" He had less to say about the Michigan of 2012, specifically. His stories of economic woe came from people he'd met ""all over the country,"" like in New Hampshire, where an elderly barber told him he couldn't quit yet. ""I talk to retired couples who thought these would be the best years of their lives. Instead, they have to work."" The room was packed with Romney endorsers. Half the room stuck around to try and press flesh when he finished. He loaded up on positive vibes, because he was about to head 70 minutes east to Troy, Mich. Romney had to follow Rick Santorum at a one-day seminar put on by Americans for Prosperity (AFP), the best-funded of the Tea Party mega-groups. (Democrats never miss a chance to remind you that David Koch helps fund this one.) We weren't in Romney country anymore. Michigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, had just endorsed Romney. AFP was passing out fliers warning that Snyder wanted to ""raise your gas prices,"" portraying him cold and uncaring in front of an expensive-looking pump. (The governor supports a higher gas tax.) Santorum had just called Barack Obama a ""snob"" and Romney a simp who ""adopt[ed] the verbiage of Occupy Wall Street."" Santorum had completely won the room over. Columnist Michelle Malkin, speaking after him, accidentally re-endorsed him from the stage. (This is frowned upon at nonpartisan, educational AFP events.) Romney had a tougher time of it. Watching him sell himself as a conservative was like watching Jack Lemmon's character in Glengarry Glen Ross try to sell overpriced plots of real estate. ""I was in business for 25 years,"" he said. Mild applause. ""I will cut spending, I will cap spending, and I will finally balance the budget."" Louder applause, no real rapture. The real sirloin in the speech was a long section trashing Rick Santorum as a phony conservative. Romney pointed to Santorum's debate performance as proof that he couldn't be trusted--he ""took one for the team,"" he would fold again. But proving this case meant providing examples. ""He voted for No Child Left Behind,"" said Romney. ""I favored that, by the way, but he was opposed to it, and he voted for it."" Strong stuff. Another tack: ""It was also in 1996 that [Santorum] supported Arlen Specter, by the way. Arlen Specter, the only pro-choice candidate we've seen in that race. There were other conservative candidates running, like Bob Dole. He didn't support them! He supported the pro-choice candidate."" Bob Dole? The conservative candidate? The guy Santorum and Gingrich mention as proof that Republicans never win if they pick compromisers? As Romney struggled, Andrew Breitbart paced near the table where organizers had parked a coffee carafe on top of a slowly browning white tablecloth. ""I despise the left because I despise the political correctness they apply to everyone and everything,"" said Breitbart. ""I see the same thing happening on the right with this campaign. You don't support Ron Paul, you're not a conservative. You don't support Santorum, you're not a conservative."" Breitbart was describing Romney's problem perfectly. Romney's allies in the state can't really disagree with his analysis. Rep. Bill Huizenga, a freshman Republican who represents one of the districts Romney carried in 2008, told me that the voters would come around, slowly. ""You'll hear people clap when Santorum talks about right to work,"" said Huizenga. ""That's one of the issues he's the worst on? Look, I like Rick Santorum. I just don't think he can win in November. Voters are going to learn more about him and figure this out. He's getting a boomlet, like all of these other candidates had boomlets with Republican voters. Herman Cain wasn't perfect. Michele Bachmann wasn't perfect. Rick Perry wasn't perfect. They're looking for perfect. Perfect isn't showing up right now."" As they filed out of Romney's speech, the AFP Tea Partiers were still waiting for perfect. They buzzed about Santorum, not the guy who was born a few miles away. And Romney was ending his day in Flint, in front of a mixed crowd, not overwhelming in size, supportive but not thrilled. He closed the speech by starting to talk up his electability. Polls show that Republicans are far more confident that he could beat Obama than they are about the new phenom from Pennsylvania. It's the Romney trump card. ""I think I'm the only guy in this race that will be able to beat Barack Obama,"" said Romney. ""And why is that?"" The crowd interrupted Romney with cheers. ""We've got to get that job done,"" said Romney. He didn't actually explain ""why"" he was electable. He just started asking for people to turn out on Tuesday and vote. The crowd didn't need an answer. Because these Michigan voters know that they are the ones who will choose to make him electable."	Will Michigan Ever Learn To Love Mitt?

Ruben Gallego invites me into the Arizona House of Representatives, and I take a seat near the lobbyists. Half a dozen of them are in the well-upholstered lounge behind the floor where members work and vote. Gallego runs a quick errand, and while he's gone I give up my seat to a lobbyist who wants to talk up a few Republican members. When he returns, my Democratic host ribs me for losing my chair. ""Don't listen to these guys!"" says Gallego, motioning toward the lobbyists. ""They're a bunch of jokers."" The freshman member from south Phoenix is joking. That's his style. His Democratic colleague Daniel Patterson, a soft-spoken ecologist who represents part of Tucson, is a lot more somber. The access that lobbyists have is unseemly. Much too much about this job is unseemly. ""This capital has been really hijacked by extremists and out-of-state special interests,"" he says. As we talk, his Democratic colleagues are trying to fix that on the House floor. They are aiming to amend a disclosure bill by requiring groups that write model legislation to register as lobbyists. It's a shot at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a free-market group that flies state legislators to conferences and advises them on how to craft libertarian-flavored bills: How to end public campaign financing, how to desanctify sanctuary cities, stuff like that. ""The amendment's not going to pass,"" says Gallego. At least 50 of the 90 legislators serving in the Arizona legislature are ALEC members, and two-thirds of the state GOP leadership are on the group's ""task forces"" that help draw up model legislation for state legislators elsewhere. Still, the Arizona Democrats think it's a vote worth calling. ""It puts people on the record. None of them are going to stand up on the campaign trail and say, ""I'm against disclosure."" Sure enough, the amendment fails. That is nothing new. Saying ""Arizona Democrats failed to pass something"" is like saying a unicycle-racing juggler failed to look serious. In 2010, as Gov. Jan Brewer was winning her first full term and two Democratic members of Congress were eating pavement, Republicans won 2-1 majorities in both houses of the state legislature. A Democratic source gives an example of how bad the year was: After Brewer muffed her opening statement in one debate, a focus group claimed they actually liked her more. That, say Democrats, was rock bottom. My brief day at the legislature featured a bill, sponsored by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, that would  authorize ""resistance against any international force infringing on the United States Constitution."" The day before, the Appropriations committee approved a bill ensuring that all students pay at least $2,000 for state college tuition--those freeloading scholarship kids have done enough damage already. As I talk with the Democrats, a retiring Republican legislator named Cecil Ash walks by to commiserate about the crowded schedule of occasionally silly bills; a ""waste of time,"" he says. The votes come at the end of the day. The Democrats win an argument over modifying the ""national sovereignty"" bill, but apart from that, they have to pick their battles. Gallego takes his desk on the far left of the room and speaks up for a bill that would eliminate restrictions on the size of magazines for hunting rifles. ""I support hunters,"" Gallego says. ""I'd just say that if you can't shoot something after five tries, you shouldn't be hunting."" Gallego's humor has been refined since he got to Phoenix. A year ago, as a very green freshman, he said that the legislature was embarrassing itself with a bill requiring birth certificates from presidential candidates. ""You might as well change Arizona to Alabama,"" he said. He apologized, and grew into a role as a top Obama campaign surrogate in the state. His bio was a dream: He met his future wife at a date auction to raise money for the Red Cross after 9/11. He graduated from Harvard. He served in Iraq, then earned a legislative seat by driving up Latino turnout. This was not a fluke. In 2011, he helped elect a Latino city councilman in a district that had never had one. Latino turnout surged from 9 percent to 35 percent. ""It was basic grassroots politics, but no one had done it before,"" he says. ""The problem with the Latino vote had been that our candidates were missing half of what they needed. We'd see somebody with money and no grassroots, or somebody with organizing skills and no money. That was the problem, and I think we figured it out."" This, plus the legislature's antics, explain why the Obama campaign is opening its fourth Arizona office. At 6 p.m., after the day's session ends, Gallego grabs his Prius from the parking lot and gives me a tour of the district. He drives toward the South Mountains, where his district ends and a much richer one begins. In between is the barrio, the great untapped source of Democratic votes. ""There aren't many empty homes here,"" says Gallego, gesturing toward rows of ranch homes. ""If a house gets foreclosed on, it gets snapped up fast. A lot of times the buyers are immigrant families who pay cash. Some of these go for around $10,000."" Gallego drives further south, into the lower lands where black people lived in segregation-era Phoenix. (It was vulnerable to floods, so it was all theirs.) There are massive supermarkets, closer in scale to flea markets, with owners that donate to Democrats. The politician's first stop of the night is at Raptor Guitars, a Latino-owned shop that's moved from a sleepy strip mall to a bustling one. Gallego speaks briefly to a small local crowd, mostly Latino, and explains how bad the current government is for them. ""We're cutting, in my opinion, too much,"" he says. ""We're cutting programs that were essential to making sure our kids were getting taken care of. We need businesses to step up, we need people to mentor kids."" Gallego jumps back in the car and points out more landmarks. There's an Italian restaurant owned by a Latino, there's a plot owned by a family that's been in the neighborhood for 100 years, there's a fairly stately home owned by a guy who turned his local eatery into a franchise. ""People forget that the Latino community is very industrious,"" he says. ""I don't just mean we work hard. I mean tons of people who own businesses."" The Prius is headed next to a local union hall, where twentysomething Latino activists are meeting with U.S. Senate candidate Richard Carmona. The activists are members of the evocatively named ""Team Awesome,"" which organized the 2011 city council victories. The candidate was George W. Bush's surgeon general, an independent who couldn't stand the GOP anymore. This is the dream: More and more voters abandoning the GOP because they feel disrespected. ""The Republicans missed such big opportunities,"" says Gallego. ""They had a bill to end birthright citizenship. They had one to prohibit people from paying for college, even if they were paying with cash, if they didn't have proof of citizenship."" The danger, for the majority party, is that they head into a presidential election, with new and unfamiliar local districts, having alienated the fastest-growing part of the state. ""These Latino kids are paying attention, and when they vote, they're never going to vote Republican."""	Why the GOP's Grip on Arizona May Be Slipping	['Gallego', 'Obama']	[]

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/rick_santorum_missed_his_moment_to_shine_in_arizona_s_republican_presidential_debate.html	"The 20th and perhaps final Republican presidential debate wheezed across the finish line and collapsed. At times it felt like the candidates had already talked themselves out on the big themes and could only bicker over table scraps. There was a long symposium on how earmarks and the congressional appropriating process work. Then, there was a confusing discussion of Arlen Specter, his re-election, and the judiciary committee. Who won? Ask the undecided Republicans in Michigan. They count the most tonight. Though the debate was held in Arizona, and there were some sturdy local panders to the state's immigration law, the most important audience was in a state 50 degrees cooler. In Michigan, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum are neck and neck in the polls. If Romney wins that state next Tuesday, his campaign will remain alive. If he doesn't, his campaign will slip into critical condition. Going into tonight's debate Romney was inching ahead of Santorum and on his way to a narrow win. Nothing in the debate would suggest a change in that trajectory. A decline in Santorum's standing may give Romney a bigger margin. Rick Santorum used to complain about being left out of debates. He was in the center of this one and he missed his moment to shine. He fared better when he was on the periphery, jockeying for position and demanding attention. He was in a defensive crouch for much of tonight's debate, fending off attacks on his tenure in Washington and his conservative credentials. Depending on how voters process the debate, it was either a middling night for Santorum or a bad one. If you believe that all you need in a debate is one good moment--because that's what people will see on the cable news loop--Rick Santorum arguably had two of them. He defended his comments about contraception effectively and passionately, citing the instability of the American family in which ""children are being raised by children."" This is Santorum on social issues at his best for Republican audiences: from the heart, trying to help and not sounding like an intruder in the bedroom. He also clobbered Mitt Romney on his health care plan again. Though, at this point, it's hard to see how there's any new advantage to gain on that well-trod ground. The problem with these good moments is that it's hard to see how they help Santorum build a coalition outside of the evangelicals or those who identify themselves in exit polls as strongly conservative. In his opening remarks, he talked about offering a ""positive vision,"" but there was nothing positive from Santorum tonight. In fairness, none of the other candidates offered the lift of a driving dream either, but the other candidates didn't need to as much as Santorum did. The darker view of Santorum's night is that he fully inhabited the Washington insider caricature that Mitt Romney has been trying to paint. He was every inch a senator. It's surprising he didn't bring a spittoon on stage. First, he got stuck in the swamp of defending earmarks. The crowd seemed like it would applaud anything, but when Santorum explained his support of earmarks the hall remained silent. At one point, in trying to explain away how he had voted for funding Planned Parenthood--it was part of a much larger spending bill--he said meekly, ""I had to vote for some big appropriations bills."" That does not sound good coming from a man who has built his campaign on conviction. Later, Santorum explained how his support for moderate Republican Arlen Specter was part of a negotiated deal to support conservative nominees. It made sense if you were listening and had covered Congress. But to anyone else--including those independent voters in Michigan--it sounded like a classic backroom deal. Then, to apply superglue to the insider flight suit he'd zipped up, he described his support for No Child Left Behind as being a team player with a Republican president. ""I have to admit I voted for that. It was against the principles I believed in. But, you know, when you're part of the team sometimes you take one for the team, for the leader."" Honest! So is saying, ""I have a personal moral objection (to contraception), but I've voted for bills that included it, too."" But this is very confusing coming from the candidate running as the principled man who will not bend. You can imagine the Romney team stringing together some of these rationalizations to make a devastating ad. Ron Paul, the lively elfin conscience of the Constitution, scolded Santorum after each one of these moments. Mirthful and full of delight, Paul answered the question about why he was running an ad saying Santorum was a fake by saying with a wide smile, ""Because he is a fake."" Most devastating, though, was this Paul line: ""He calls this a team sport. He has to go along to get along. That's the problem with Washington,"" said Paul. ""That's been going on for so long. So I don't accept that form of government. I understand it. That is the way it works. You were with the majority. You were the whip and you organized and got these votes all passed. But I think the obligation of all of us should be the oath of office. It shouldn't be the oath to the party."" If Santorum had highs and lows, Mitt Romney was steady, if unspectacular. As in previous debates, he came schooled on his opposition research. He is a precise debater. The formula is: attack, explain past position, explain current proposal. He got his licks in, pegging Santorum as a creature of Washington. ""While I was fighting to save the Olympics, you were fighting to save the 'Bridge to Nowhere,' "" he said, referring to the single most infamous pork-barrel project. His defense of his position on the auto bailout sounded plausible, though it wouldn't pass muster in a general election. He tied it off with an attack on the United Auto Workers, which will be a hit with the base. He defended women in combat (probably helpful in a debate where four white men were debating contraception). He sounded like a man in control of his brief when talking about Iran and Syria, which helps his pitch that he is the best leader of the bunch. ""If I'm president that will not happen,"" he said of Iran getting a nuclear weapon. ""If we elect Barack Obama it will."" Newt Gingrich was a man in repose. He was relaxed in his chair. He's gotten some sleep since Florida. Asked to pick a word that described him, Gingrich said ""cheerful,"" and he seemed it. He didn't seem hunted, but he also didn't seem particularly hungry. He said some amusing things. He has plans. But he wasn't forceful, except when he swiped at the media for not asking candidate Obama about an infanticide bill. (He was wrong.) He sounded like a man who will make mountains of money on the lecture circuit. The Republican debates have played such an important role in the primaries, but it was hard to see a clear storyline emerging from this one. Santorum may have blown his moment to grow, but the weaknesses that have dogged Romney remain. Gov. Romney is no more compelling than before the evening began. There are no more debates scheduled, which is a little unsettling. They've dotted the race like fence posts. But if they're like the candidates in this campaign, just when you think they're gone, they'll come back."	Did Rick Santorum Just Miss His Last Best chance at an Upset?	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Obama']	[]

Such testing, Santorum claims, is aimed at identifying babies with birth defects or disabilities, and encouraging parents to abort them. Santorum said, ""Free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society. That, too, is part of Obamacare, another hidden message as to what President Obama thinks of those who are less able than the elites who want to govern our country."" Santorum is not the first person to raise the issue of whether prenatal testing leads to the abortion of children with special needs. Back in December 1996, Tucker Carlson, now editor of the Daily Caller, wrote a powerful article for the Weekly Standard about the abortion of babies with Down syndrome. It is reprinted here with Carlson's permission. Testifying before Congress in the spring of 1990, Arkansas state health director Joycelyn Elders took an unusual tack in her defense of legal abortion. ""Abortion,"" she said, ""has had an important, and positive, public- health effect,"" in that it has reduced ""the number of children afflicted with severe defects."" As evidence, the future surgeon general cited this statistic: ""The number of Down's Syndrome infants in Washington state in 1976 was 64 percent lower than it would have been without legal abortion."" Her remark went all but unnoticed at the time and has received little attention since, even during Elders's contentious tenure as surgeon general in the Clinton administration. But it was a significant statement nonetheless, if only because it represents one of the few occasions on which a public health official has publicly acknowledged the eugenic utility of abortion. Terminating a pregnancy, Elders argued, is not simply a difficult personal decision, an agonizing last resort. When guided by public-health objectives, abortion can also be a positive act--a means of improving the species. Stylized and dulled by euphemism as it is, the debate over abortion in America rarely allows for statements as clear and direct as Elders's, and the words may sound almost unrecognizably harsh to ears accustomed to intentionally opaque terms such as ""choice"" and ""life."" But what Elders said is nothing new. For 30 years, nearly every element of Western medicine--physicians, geneticists, insurance companies--has, explicitly and not, encouraged the use of abortion to reduce the incidence of birth defects. The effort has succeeded dramatically, particularly in the case of Down Syndrome, the most frequently occurring genetic disorder. Far more women now are able to detect Down Syndrome pregnancies, and far more end them with abortion. Yet even as it becomes easier and more common to prevent children with Down Syndrome from being born, the justification for doing so grows murkier. Unlike many other genetic anomalies, such as Tay-Sachs and anencephaly, Down Syndrome (also known as Down's Syndrome or Trisomy 21) is not a terminal disorder. Children born with Down Syndrome are not vegetables, nor are their lives demonstrably not worth living. Indeed, advances in science and changes in public perception have combined to make Down Syndrome a relatively mild birth defect: The average child born with Down Syndrome in America today can expect to reside at home, go to school, learn to read, hold a job, and live to the age of 55. He will grow up cognizant of ethics and events, and will be mildly to moderately retarded, with an IQ of between 55 and 70. It is one of the triumphs of modern society that the life of the average person with Down Syndrome has become strikingly normal. Except that, unlike normal people, people with Down Syndrome have been targeted for elimination. Of 22,000 women who received prenatal diagnosis in one 1990 study in Canada, 88 percent of those who found they were carrying a child with Down Syndrome aborted the fetus. Other studies have put the rate of Down Syndrome abortions at about 90 percent, some even higher. Last year, British journalist Dominic Lawson published an article in the London Spectator about the birth of his daughter, who has Down Syndrome. Lawson, a self-described atheist, expressed outrage at the National Health Service's policy of providing free prenatal tests for, and complimentary abortions of, babies with Down Syndrome. He went on to compare the policy to the Nazi eugenics program. Lawson's article was reprinted in the Daily Mail, prompting scores of letters to the editor and counter articles. Partly in response to what Lawson had written, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords that would outlaw abortions conducted solely to prevent the birth of a child with Down Syndrome. (Currently, abortion of ""seriously handicapped"" children, including those with Down Syndrome, is legal in England through the ninth month.) A national debate has begun. So far, no such public discussion has broken out in the United States, where amniocentesis and other genetic tests have been used to target Down Syndrome pregnancies for abortion since at least the late 1960s. In 1959, French geneticist Jerome Lejeune discovered that people with Down Syndrome have an extra chromosome responsible for the disorder. The discovery soon made it possible to detect the presence of Down Syndrome in utero. Grasping the implications of his work, Lejeune grew to be a passionate opponent of abortion and prenatal testing, which he called ""biological pornography."" But Lejeune could not stop what he had unwittingly begun. By the summer of 1967, the American Medical Association had passed a resolution endorsing abortion in cases in which ""an infant may be born with incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency."" A year later, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists came out with a similar policy. A number of states, years before Roe v. Wade, followed suit with laws allowing abortion for the purpose of eliminating children with mental defects, including Down Syndrome. During the 1970s, genetic testing of pregnant women became routine, a practice encouraged by groups like Planned Parenthood. Since it is an invasive procedure that entails extracting amniotic fluid with a needle from around the child, amniocentesis (like its alternative, chorionic villous sampling) carries a significant risk of miscarriage, in some places as high as one in 100. As a result, the test generally has been reserved for use by women over the age of 34, who are more willing to weigh the risk against that of having a child with Down Syndrome. (The incidence of Down Syndrome increases with maternal age, from about one in 2,000 births at age 20 to one in 10 at age 49.) In 1984, however, it was discovered that a non-invasive blood test could be used to calculate the likelihood of bearing a Down Syndrome child. The blood test made it possible to provide screening for Down Syndrome to women of all ages at no risk to the mother. In 1986, the State of California began requiring physicians to offer the tests to pregnant women. The state's health department now funds much of the screening itself, spending $56 million a year to detect prenatal birth defects. The rest of the country followed California's lead. Between 1988 and 1993, the number of pregnant women who received blood tests for Down Syndrome doubled, to about 2 million. Almost all the tests were covered by private health insurance or Medicaid. Last year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists officially recommended Down Syndrome screening for all pregnant women. Although there is no cure or prevention for Down Syndrome--indeed, the only real intervention that can be taken after a positive test result is abortion--prenatal screening is now, in effect, mandatory. Few physicians, regardless of their beliefs on the subject, are willing to risk not offering the test, for fear of being slapped with a ""wrongful birth"" suit if a handicapped child is born. It has happened, repeatedly. The rapid growth of prenatal testing has had some undeniably positive effects: A woman who knows she will bear a child with a handicap can plan to deliver in a hospital equipped for risky births. And many couples prefer the opportunity to prepare psychologically for the work of raising a disabled child. By far the most profound effect of prenatal testing, however, has been a staggering increase in the number of abortions. The trend is clear: More testing invariably leads to more--many more--abortions of Down Syndrome children. ""Most women who have children with Down Syndrome did not have the amnio,"" says Lori Atkins of the National Down Syndrome Society, and there is growing evidence to indicate this is true. A study of data from selected states by the Centers for Disease Control found that the rate of Down Syndrome births to mothers 35 or older dropped by about a third between 1983 and 1990. Another study, conducted over a slightly longer period, pegged the decline at 46 percent. Larry Edmunds, a CDC statistician who is among the country's acknowledged experts on birth-defect trends, cites data from the 1980s suggesting that abortion reduced the number of children with Down Syndrome born to white women over 35 in the metropolitan Atlanta area by about 70 percent. Of the 30 percent in that study who did bear children with Down Syndrome, Edmunds explains, ""those were mainly women who didn't have the test."" Lewis Holmes, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School who works at Massachusetts General Hospital, says that in his experience, of women who learn they are carrying a Down Syndrome child, ""90 percent will say they want to terminate. If you have all the technology available and educate the women as to what their choices are, that will happen."" Far fewer than 90 percent of women support abortion, at least in the abstract, so there is some question as to why so many are choosing it when they find they are carrying children with Down Syndrome. A number of studies have attempted to provide an answer. One, conducted by the Canadian Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies, found that, because of pressure from hospital staff, one in four pregnant women ""felt obliged"" to undergo amniocentesis. Of those who tested positive for a birth defect, one in three believed she was ""more or less forced"" to have an abortion. Another study, published this summer in the British Medical Journal, describes the case of one pregnant woman whose child had tested positive for birth defects. Following her doctor's orders, she reported to the labor ward of her hospital for what the physician had termed an ""induction."" It dawned on the woman, who was five months pregnant, that the ""induction"" was in fact to be an abortion. Horrified, she returned home and later bore the child. Laurie Cowan, a physician at the state of Delaware's public health department, readily admits that abortion has had a dramatic effect on births of children with Down Syndrome. ""We are seeing a real drop in the rate of [Down Syndrome] children who are born. We're not seeing a drop in the rate of children who are conceived,"" she says. But like many in the medical profession, Cowan is wary of how such information might be used. Abortion, she explains, ""has been a right that people have had. So I hope that in no way you'll do anything to try to take away that right. I'm just very concerned about that. I just hope in no way your work will undermine that."" Antiabortion forces, she warns, would allow the procedure ""only if the mother is raped, only if she's going to die because of this pregnancy. And that's uncomfortable for me because there are certain things that are pretty close to that."" Having a Down Syndrome child is close to being raped? To dying? Why such eagerness to prevent Down Syndrome children from being born? Undoubtedly, some physicians are motivated by a belief that children with birth defects pollute the gene pool. ""There is nothing wrong with eugenics,"" said Dr. F. Clarke Fraser, founder of the genetics clinic at Montreal Children's Hospital, not long ago in an unusually blunt interview with the Montreal Gazette. Many others, however, simply view abortion and Down Syndrome as parts of an economic equation. Amniocentesis ""may cost about $1,000, but a reasonably conservative estimate is that it costs $ 100,000 for just the first year of a Down Syndrome baby's life,"" explained Dr. Mark Evans, director of Detroit's Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy. ""How many people would I have to test to balance the lifetime cost?"" he asked a New York Times reporter in what must rank among the creepiest rhetorical questions ever posed. 'And then there are economic considerations nobody knows how to factor in, like the number of women who would have to quit their careers to care for these babies. "" Actually, Dr. Evans was wrong on at least one count: A number of people have ""factored in"" the various costs of Down Syndrome. A 1995 study led by Norman Waitzman of the University of Utah sought to calculate the toll birth defects take on the American economy. The results, published in a CDC report, found that each child born with Down Syndrome will, over a lifetime, cost society about $451,000. The total cost for all children born with the disorder in a given year, the study determined, is $ 1.8 billion. ""Particularly in these times of fiscal squeeze,"" he concluded, ""these costs provide a vivid picture of the value of research and prevention"" (italics added). Needless to say, Waltzman failed to point out that, in the case of Down Syndrome, there's no way to ""prevent"" the disorder, only the birth of those afflicted with it. Obscured by euphemisms or not, calculations such as Waltzman's have not escaped the attention of insurance companies, many of which have proved indecorously eager to cover testing for potentially expensive genetic defects, most recently for cystic fibrosis. Nachum Sicherman of the Columbia Business School, another researcher who has examined the ""enormous cost-saving potential of amniocentesis,"" is the sort of expert insurance companies doubtless will consult as they begin to sort out the growing number of prenatal genetic tests in order to determine which ones they should pay for. Sicherman figures the cost to society over the lifetime of a person with Down Syndrome is at least $ 1 million--most of which, he points out, ""is not going to be paid by parents."" Numbers like these--and Sicherman's are larger than most--have led Sicherman to recommend that amniocentesis be made available to all nearly pregnant women, regardless of age. ""If you take all costs into account--costs to school districts, to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, lost days of work for parents,"" he explains enthusiastically, ""there is nothing more beneficial than amniocentesis, if it is given under the assumption that if Down Syndrome is discovered, there is an abortion following. It's a great cost saving."" Sicherman does more than simply theorize on the subject. ""When my wife was pregnant,"" he recalls, ""we went to Lamaze class and I asked the women there if they'd ever heard of amniocentesis."" Being a mostly young and lower-income group, he says, none had, and Sicherman did his best to remedy their ignorance. It was, after all, only the right thing to do. ""Everybody should tell their patients about amniocentesis,"" he says. Sicherman's views may be a bit blunt for the present state of public opinion in America. Not so in the Netherlands, however, where subjecting pregnancy to rigorous economic calculation is considered a civic responsibility. A 1991 report by the Royal Dutch Society of Medicine (entitled ""Life Terminating Actions with Incompetent Patients, Part I: Severely Handicapped Newborns"") studied a series of 2,816 amniocenteses given to pregnant women. The tests resulted in 75 abortions, 57 of which were of "" defective fetuses."" ""These 2,816 amniocenteses and the chromosome analyses cost approximately $ 1.5 million,"" the study said. ""This is in the same order of magnitude as the costs for taking care of one patient with Down's Syndrome in a medical institution for a period of 60 years. Seen in the light of a cost-benefit analysis the conclusion is obvious."" From here, it is a short trip to killing handicapped children outright. Why, after all, stop the economizing simply because a child has left the womb? James D. Watson, who won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of DNA, believed that newborns who scored below a certain level on the APGAR test given immediately after birth should be euthanized. In fact, infants with Down Syndrome are routinely starved to death in Dutch hospitals--a practice that has been resoundingly affirmed by both that country's supreme court and its Council for Children's Protection. Nor are such practices restricted to the Netherlands. A 1975 poll found that 77 percent of American pediatric surgeons favored withholding food and medical treatment from infants with Down Syndrome and leaving them to die. Seven years later, in the well-publicized Baby Doe case, a Bloomington, Indiana, couple asked their doctor to do just that to their child born with Down Syndrome. The infant, who needed only simple surgery to correct a blocked esophagus, died after six days of neglect. In a strikingly similar incident several years later in Montreal, a Down Syndrome child died after 11 days without food or water. ""The presence of Down Syndrome,"" said a local coroner, ""was another element [in the decision to kill the child] since mongolism implies a quasi-vegetative life or severely diminished quality of life."" Given these stories and the evidence that an entire population of retarded people may be wiped clean from this country, one would expect organizations that represent the disabled to be up in arms. One would expect wrong. ""We have a clear position not to take a position on the issue of abortion,"" says Paul Marchand, head lobbyist at The Arc (formerly known as the Association for Retarded Citizens), one of the country's largest such groups. The National Down Syndrome Congress, in its ""Position Statement on Prenatal Testing and Eugenics,"" is equally explicit: ""These positions ... in no way involve the movement in the debate over whether a woman should have a legal right to abortion."" Disability groups tend to be on edge when it comes to public perceptions of the mentally retarded (Al Gore learned this the hard way when he referred to Oliver North's political supporters as ""the extra-chromosome right wing,"" drawing roars of protest from Down Syndrome groups). They are quick to spot even the most subtle forms of discrimination--The Arc actually has an official policy demanding equal access to dental treatment. So it is puzzling that so few groups have seen fit to comment on the growth of state-endorsed eugenics targeted--in the most discriminatory, dehumanizing way imaginable--at their own constituents. It's a little like the NAACP refusing to come out against slavery. In 1978, the Delaware chapter of the Association for Retarded Citizens did take a position: It passed a resolution demanding that the federal government pay for abortions for poor women who learn they are carrying potential retarded citizens. The resolution prompted The Arc's national organization to convene a task force on the issue. After months of work, the group produced a 60-page report declaring that, although a majority of its members supported government funding for the abortion of retarded children, a unanimous decision could not be reached. And that, says lobbyist Marchand, was that: ""I don't think anything on abortion has crossed my desk in the last ten years."" The only comparable issue today, he says, is the debate within the ""disability community"" over whether it is valid to search for a cure for mental retardation. ""It can be a touchy subject,"" he explains without a hint of irony, because when you seek a cure, ""what you're doing de facto is devaluing people with mental retardation."" Not that The Arc spends a lot of time pondering existential questions like these. The group's real concern nowadays, says Marchand, is ""the federal role in the future of mental retardation""--i.e., getting more money from the government. He rattles off a list of programs his organization is lobbying to maintain and expand: Medicaid, Social Security, disability insurance, job training, special education. ""We are extremely occupied with a myriad of federal policy issues that are before us,"" Marchand says. ""Our plate is more than overflowing."" Meanwhile, as The Arc concerned itself with its ""myriad of federal policy issues,"" another issue was being decided on Capitol Hill, one from which the voice of the disability lobby was noticeably absent: partial-birth abortion. The vast majority of Down Syndrome children identified in utero are diagnosed using amniocentesis, which is not even performed until the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The abortions that result are of the grisly variety, some of them performed by the skull-crushing partial-birth technique on infants capable of living outside the womb. During the debate over the procedure, the Clinton administration cited the record of abortion doctor James McMahon as evidence that a ban on partial-birth abortions would be unacceptably rigid. The pregnant women McMahon had treated, the administration argued, had received abortions to alleviate the sort of ""serious health problems"" that should be exempted under the ban. And what were these problems? According to data the doctor himself provided to Congress, the single most common ""serious fetal defect"" McMahon"" treated"" was Down Syndrome. It would be unfair to single out organized Down Syndrome groups for their unwillingness to confront the subject of abortion, since the willful blindness runs much deeper. In Life As We Know It, his recent book about raising a son with Down Syndrome, Michael Berube describes the typical response on an Internet discussion group when the subject of prenatal testing and abortion arises: ""Every time someone brings up the question on the listserv, he or she is met with dozens of e-mail responses reading, ""NO! NO! NOT ON THIS LIST! Please don't have this discussion here! There are plenty of other newsgroups for this debate. This is about children with disabilities.'"" Dr. Bill Cohen of the Down Syndrome Center of Western Pennsylvania, a noted authority on the disorder, has much the same response when asked about his views on abortion. ""If someone comes to me and says that they're thinking about terminating the pregnancy, my job is not to convince them not to,"" he says. ""This is not a right-to-life issue. This is a choice issue. This is an information issue. ... It's hard enough to deal with any of these things without being made to feel on top of it that you've done something wrong."" Yet, it's difficult to shake the feeling that those who abort a child simply because he or she has Down Syndrome have done something wrong. Children with Down Syndrome are not monsters, but uncommonly gentle human beings who can and do lead full lives. And there are alternatives to abortion. ""It's not at all difficult"" to find homes for kids with Down Syndrome, says Janet Marchese of the Down Syndrome Adoption Exchange in White Plains, New York, one of several agencies of its kind in the United States. Over the past 20 years, Marchese has placed about 3,600 children with Down Syndrome; her waiting list of couples hoping to adopt rarely dips below 100. What do people who would adopt a Down Syndrome child know that most obstetricians do not? ""Having a child with Down Syndrome is not such a big deal--if you have some experience with Down Syndrome you realize that,"" says Nancy Simpson of Chesapeake Down Syndrome Parent Group in Phoenix, Maryland, whose eight-year-old daughter has Down Syndrome. ""It's definitely not as easy as raising a typical child; there are a lot of things that are involved in it. Raising a child with Down Syndrome takes extra patience and extra care and extra time. But you also get back a completely different perspective on the world, and a great deal of love."" Sentiments like these are almost unimaginable to Jeffrey Greenspoon, M.D. Greenspoon is the director of the high-risk obstetric unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. In the summer of 1995, during the beginning of the debate over partial-birth abortion, Greenspoon sent a letter to Rep. Henry Hyde passionately defending the procedure, especially in cases where a child might be born with ""problems ... incompatible with a normal life,"" such as Down Syndrome. ""A pregnancy that is desired and planned is the foundation for the next generation of productive, healthy Americans,"" Greenspoon wrote. ""The burden of raising one or two abnormal children is realistically unbearable."" Reached at his office, Greenspoon admits that he approves of eugenics--weeding out ""babies who don't have much of a viable life."" What makes him uncomfortable, he says, is the word ""eugenics,"" which somehow has assumed ""bad connotations over time. I think the better terms would be 'genetic counseling' and 'prenatal diagnosis' and 'having a country in which the option to exercise choice in whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy is a right of the people.'"" After all, he says, ""Sometimes you need to abandon words that have common meanings that connote the wrong ethics or morals."" But only the words have changed."

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/michigan_republican_primary_romney_has_to_let_rick_santorum_defeat_himself_.html	"In a lot of ways the coming Michigan primary feels like the Florida primary again for Mitt Romney. He's facing another near-death experience. He wakes every morning to news accounts of the five things he needs to do to right in his campaign before it dies. Then, after choking that down, he rolls over to the other stories--speculating about which white-knight candidate might arrive to rescue the GOP from the botch Mitt Romney has made of things. This flashback feeling perhaps explains why Romney is following the Florida playbook he used against Gingrich to defeat Santorum, who's become his primary competition this time around. The general strategy consists of three parts: attack Santorum as an insider; encourage him to hang himself on his own; and while Santorum is tied down with that two-front war, present Romney as the candidate talking about jobs and defeating Barack Obama. Monday, with seven days of campaigning to go before the Michigan primary, the Romney campaign was working on the two fronts it can control: bashing Santorum for his record in Washington, and holding a conference call to remind us that Romney is a conservative leader who is right for Michigan. Romney can't win just by tearing down his opponent. He has to bring out the Romney fans in Michigan. He must do that not only to win, but also to have something to say about what it all meant after the win. He has to show that he has people who are for him. Santorum, for his part, does not have Newt Gingrich's baggage, which makes him a trickier target, but he also doesn't have Gingrich's ballast. Voters could forgive Gingrich his foibles because they thought he was a behemoth who could clobber Obama in the fall. They just don't think that of Rick Santorum. When Gingrich was threatening Romney a few months ago, voters started to see him as more electable than Romney. In the latest CBS national poll, Santorum is ahead on the horse-race question, but trailing by almost 40 points to Romney when voters are asked who can beat Barack Obama. In a Gallup poll out today, Santorum leads Romney 50-44 among Republicans, but by nearly 2-to-1 (58 to 32 percent) they say Romney has a better chance than Santorum of winning in November. Romney advisers believe Santorum's support is very soft outside of those who identify themselves as ""strongly conservative"" in exit polls. That means Romney's team believes they have a lot of room to define him as a creature of the culture of big government spending in Washington. Santorum won't fall because he's seen as negatively as Gingrich perhaps, but if Romney can raise enough doubts about him, that might be enough to pull it out. Romney may benefit even more from Santorum's self-inflicted troubles. One way Santorum is like Gingrich is that he is having trouble controlling his moment in the sun. With movement conservatives behind him, his chief political goal is to grow his vote with conservatives focused on issues that go beyond the social conservative basket--creating jobs, lowering taxes, and maintaining a strong national defense. That means Santorum must not swing at every pitch, and instead stay focused on those mainstream issues. Santorum knows this and is acting on it, but he also can't seem to stop himself from swinging. When social issues come up, he takes them on. And when there are no pitches, he's out in the backyard tossing the ball in the air and taking a swing by himself. This weekend Santorum jumped into sticky situations on the issues of education, prenatal screening, and Obama's theology. Talking about these issues explains why Santorum has such ardent fans. As he said during his interview on Face the Nation, he's happy to talk about these issues that don't get discussed much on the campaign trail. But doing so is also a time suck, requiring lots of clarification that eats up time for any talk about his plan to encourage manufacturing. This means every time the people hear about him, he's being the ""social issues candidate."" You could argue that Santorum got a bum rap on each of the incendiary issues he was wrestling with this weekend. His comments were misinterpreted and distorted by the opposition. When he said Obama had a different theology, he wasn't challenging whether Obama is a Christian (despite the dive for the fainting couch from Obama's advisers). A more generous reading based on the context, his standard stump speech, and Republican political talking points suggests that what he was saying was that Obama's secular big-government ideology completely rules his decision making. For the president, that ideology is as thoroughly felt as a religious belief. So that's the fair reading of what Santorum meant. But he was vague, which meant it was reasonable to ask him what he was going on about. Also, politics isn't the best place to look for fair readings. Santorum knows that, and should know how to avoid making his own sand traps to jump in. Why? Because he understands exactly how to use an unfair reading, and does so regularly with things President Obama says. (American exceptionalism being a good example.) Michigan will determine whether Mitt Romney's superior money advantage and bigger organization is worth anything. It's to these two qualities that insiders cite when explaining why Romney can weather these challenges from Santorum and Gingrich. But Romney's losses show the obvious limitations to this firewall. Money and organization don't help much in contests where movement conservatives dominate. They don't help in Michigan, which is not as hospitable as Florida was but has a more diverse electorate than the caucuses in Colorado and Minnesota. Right now Romney advisers still seem confident they will pull it out in Michigan. And if past is prologue, a win will revive his fortunes, diminish the talk of a brokered convention, and set Romney up for his next near-death experience on Super Tuesday."	Romney's Efforts To Allow Rick Santorum To Engineer His Own Loss in Michigan	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/can_mitt_romney_end_the_curse_of_herbert_hoover_.html	"In 1925, a successful advertising executive wrote a wildly popular book that depicted Jesus Christ as the ideal American businessman. Bruce Barton's The Man Nobody Knows imagined a strong courageous, Republican-leaning leader of men. He was handsome, resolute, and his ""muscles were so strong that when He drove the moneychangers out, no one dared to oppose him!"" The publication of The Man Nobody Knows is arguably when a prototype of Warner Sallman's strong-jawed all-American visage of the Head of Christ took its place in American popular culture. Although Barton's opus is long forgotten, his book had a political impact we can still see evidence of today. It helped install American businessmen into the pantheon of great American leaders. Indeed, Barton's vision came to life three years after his book's publication. Herbert Hoover, who made his fortune in the mining business, was the first big test of Barton's leadership model under the national spotlight. (Barton is said to have personally liked Hoover, and supported his candidacy.) In Hoover, here was a man, as American novelist Sherwood Anderson observed, who acted as if he has ""never known failure."" Hoover was a successful food relief administrator in World War I, famous for relieving hunger in Belgium. He was internationally respected for his humanitarian work. In the lead-up to the 1928 election season, Hoover emerged as the most electable candidate, a progressive Republican set apart from the conservative fringe. He avoided the culture warmongering social issues of the mid-1920s (like the Scopes trial), preferring to focus on his reputation and experience in ""offering solutions of various national problems."" The comparison is now pretty obvious. Hoover was, in other words, a lot like Mitt Romney. Both men sought to leverage their business experience and competence as executives into the Oval Office. Hoover, like Romney, believed that the government existed to facilitate cooperation and trust with the private sector to solve problems.  He campaigned on the notion that a bureaucratic government in the business of direct federal assistance would only threaten America's unique spirit of individualism, and stifle initiative. Romney talks a lot about his plan for his first day of office, when he will issue ""a series of executive orders that gets the U.S. government out of the economy's way."" While Hoover talked about his administration of food programs during the war, Romney leans heavily on his (admittedly less dramatic) management of the troubled Salt Lake City Olympics. Of course, Romney has one thing on Hoover: He looks the part. His strong jaw, large frame, and perfect hair are a lot closer to Barton's imagined ideal. No one remembers that in 1928 Hoover won in a landslide. His four years in office are the epitome of a failed presidency. In the end, his name was more closely associated with ""Hoovervilles""--the Depression-era shantytowns of the homeless--than business acumen and competence. And the bad taste left in everyone's mouth has lingered. In 84 years, despite many opportunities, American voters have never put another accomplished businessman in the White House. The Hoover curse reigns. Will Romney be the one to break it? Who knows? Right now the Massachusetts Republican is fighting hard to win his party's nomination. Even if he succeeds in the primaries, Barack Obama, a far more formidable opponent, is waiting in the wings. For better or for worse, Romney's campaign has chosen the candidate's business experience as its fulcrum, and in doing so, Romney has set out to portray himself as the ideal man for the job in a sea of politicians. To be fair, Romney's resume is broader than the one Hoover offered. Romney has already served in elected office as governor, and this political experience may be a helpful antidote to the decades-old curse against businessmen. Even if 2012 ushers in a Romney presidency, Mitt and his team will want to exorcise the Hoover ghost by having a successful four years. And there, too, they should bear in mind what historians say sank Hoover once in office. As David M. Kennedy has pointed out, one of the leading causes of Hoover's political demise was his inability to control his party. Hoover may have had the reputation as a competent, powerful businessman with an engineer's mind, but he didn't have the personality to go with it. Starting with the disastrous Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of 1930, which raised international import duties to record highs, Hoover contradicted his own personal political convictions and gave in to pressure from his party leadership on major points of policy. Even when faced with a petition of 1,000 economists begging Hoover to veto the bill, and a visit from Henry Ford himself, Hoover signed Hawley-Smoot into law. The disastrous results--both for Hoover and the country--are well-known. Romney's early troubles on the campaign trail suggest he may not have the personality to unite his party either. At least, many Republican party leaders think so. At the CPAC convention two weeks ago, Grover Norquist had this to say: We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don't need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. We want the Ryan budget. ... We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don't need someone to think it up or design it. The leadership now for the modern conservative movement for the next 20 years will be coming out of the House and the Senate. That doesn't bode well for a man looking to kill an 84-year curse."	Can Romney break the Hoover Curse?	['Herbert', 'Kennedy', 'Romney', 'Warner']	[]

James Pethokoukis, the chart-loving opinion-maker at the American Enterprise Institute, started with a warning: ""How Republicans can win even if the economy keeps improving."" How they can win? Had Pethokoukis lost the rights to his old pieces like ""Obama Faces Worst-Case 2012 Scenario"" and ""If Obama Loses, It Will Be Because of This One Chart?"" All of a sudden he was drawing up Republican battle plans based on contingencies, concluding that the party ""just might"" win if everything remains stagnant. We're living through the phony war of the Republican primary. Barack Obama's buoyant poll numbers aren't surprising anyone. The bigger worry is that Obama will get to preside over a solid economy. Republicans will re-enact the Bob Dole juggernaut of 1996. That's not how this was supposed to work. Is the New Republican Pessimism widespread? That's the tricky part: There are different flavors of pessimism. In this period, a lull that happens to feature good economic news and good Obama poll numbers, there are four identifiable sorts of pessimism. All of them were present at last week's Conservative Political Action Conference, the kickoff of the movement's year. Not since 2008 had the event been so moody. You can make the case that this is healthy, even desirable. ""Obama has always been likely to win a second term, as most incumbents running for re-election do,"" says Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor of National Review who has been shouting about this for a year. ""Conservatives were too optimistic about defeating him for much of 2011 and are now, I think, a bit too pessimistic."" But the pessimism is there, and growing. To simplify matters, I will break it down into four strata, using the defense readiness condition that the Joint Chiefs of Staff use when they're girding for war. DEFCON 4: Everybody else is a pessimist. The cocktail chatter of the right this month has been the surprising resilience of Barack Obama, mixed with the unsurprising insistence of Republican voters to drag the race out to Berlin Alexandrplatz proportions. On InTrade--which doesn't mean much, although the Romney campaign recently cited it as proof that it will beat Santorum--Obama's chance of victory has floated up to 60 percent. ""The Twitterization of politics,"" says Commentary editor-in-chief John Podhoretz, ""really is leading people to overreact."" Podhoretz calls the New Pessimism a ""classic fallacy,"" easily explained. ""A few good bits of news in February combined with GOP campaign nonsense will only be indicative of the results in November if those few good bits are followed by almost uninterrupted good economic news and if GOP campaign nonsense is never-ending. Neither is likely to be the case, and the crowing in certain liberal quarters is beyond foolish."" Ed Morrissey, the chief blogger of HotAir.com--he's endorsed Rick Santorum--gives the new pessimism little credence: It's bitter pregame whining. ""I'm hearing it from the people who were Rick Perry backers, Newt backers, Romney backers. I'm hearing pessimism of the type you get when your guy is not winning."" DEFCON 3: The economy is improving, but we can overcome that. In his CPAC speech, the official kickoff of the conference, Sen. Jim DeMint acknowledged that the economy was getting better. The president--that fink!--was trying to grab ""every piece of credit."" One week later, on the Michigan trail, Rick Santorum admitted that ""there are good things happening all across the upper Midwest. That day, a Public Policy Polling survey showed President Obama leading any Republican in Michigan. The fear, as several conservative activists put it to me at CPAC, was that Republicans had been too successful--they'd started to turn the country around, and the president would get the credit. Republicans elected new, austerity-centric governors in Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and Florida. A turnaround would be good for them, but they aren't on the ballot in 2012. ""If the economy picks up it's harder, no doubt,"" says Jennifer Rubin, author of the Right Turn blog at the Washington Post. ""But I do think the funk is overdone. Perhaps this alleviates [Republican voters] from considering electability. If you're going to lose, you can vote with your heart and not your head."" DEFCON 2: We are blowing it. Some of the New Pessimists have been worrying about this election for months. They tried to draft Chris Christie. They tried to draft Paul Ryan. Bill Kristol's column space in the Weekly Standard became the world's sloppiest campaign launchpad--none of these guys ever took off. ""I think the base of the party, the conservative 'Reagan' base, is disappointed and dismayed because they don't feel any of the candidates have all of the 'elements' needed to win,"" says Christopher Ruddy, the CEO of the Newsmax network. ""Mitt has money and organization but no charisma with the base. Newt has charisma, but little organization and possible money. Santorum connects to one part of the base and it will be a challenge for him all around."" Some would-be party reformers agree with this, and it kills them. ""I'd say the chances that President Obama will be reelected are better than 50-50,"" says Reihan Salam, a National Review writer and policy analyst. ""And I think that the nature of the primary race has made his reelection prospects much brighter. Santorum, in particular, is a candidate who, leaving aside the question of his substantive virtues or drawbacks, is a lightning rod for Postmoderns, media professionals, and many other influential people who will sway the way others vote."" In the base's version of theory--nicely calibrated to a possible November disaster--the election was never really winnable, and the movement will be able to blame the establishment if Obama wins again. It's not just the base that feels this way. ""I just got back from speaking to Federalist Society members at the University of Houston law school,"" says Ponnuru. ""When one of them asked, I said Obama has the edge. He didn't tell me I was crazy. Nobody has, lately--at least on that subject."" DEFCON 1: We are doomed. The darkest of the New Pessimists say that the election was decided four years ago. Obama's policies were designed to kick in and goose the economy around this time; the payroll tax cut--just extended this week--is the last of the goosing. ""The lack of a clear, compelling, and truly alternative vision of governance from Romney will doom him against Obama,"" says Nick Gillespie, editor of the libertarian hub Reason.com. (Disclosure time: I am a contributing editor of Reason magazine.) ""Note: I'm not talking about charisma--I'm talking about vision: what would the country be like under a President Romney? We all know that it would basically be the same as the one we're in now, alas. Of the Republican candidates still around, only Ron Paul offers a clear alternative to both the Democratic and Republican status quo, but he has failed to catch fire with voters the way I wished he would."" Paul's voters, generally speaking, are the most apocalyptic members of the GOP New Pessimism club. Their candidate is the new Thomas Jefferson, the would-be savior of the Republic. We can elect him--or we can kiss America goodbye. If the Republicans go with some other nominee, plenty of Paul supporters will walk away from the party. There's one more data point for the New Pessimism."	Why are conservatives so depressed?	['Paul', 'Perry', 'Romney', 'Christie', 'Obama']	[]
10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/now_that_rick_santorum_is_leading_in_national_polls_he_is_softening_his_social_conservatism_.html	"On Monday, the gods of campaign scheduling were in full-on prank mode. In Olympia, Wash., Gov. Christine Gregoire signed legislation making hers the seventh state where gays can marry. Less than an hour later, Rick Santorum arrived at the state capital to hobnob with defeated religious leaders. There he was: The sponsor of the Federal Marriage Amendment, the man who'd taken ""arrows in the back"" to battle gay marriage laws, the guy who was so hated by gay activists that his name had been turned into a frothy sexual slur. What would he say? He would tell everyone to be respectful and get along. ""There are legitimate reasons that people have to want ... to change the law,"" he said. ""And there are legitimate reasons that people have to want to keep the law in place."" He did not talk about a war on Christianity, or the need to abolish state legislators. ""There are ebbs and flows in every battle."" Later, at a heckler-hassled speech in Tacoma, Santorum barely mentioned the new law. Protesters--the local Occupy hitching post was a short walk away--shouted  him down whenever they could. Most stories about the rally led with the attempts to disrupt it, not the marriage material. The Rick Santorum who's soaring in primary polls looks a lot like the Santorum who lost his 2006 re-election bid by 18 points. Here is a difference: His culture war talk is softer, more implied. He talks up his welfare reform role and his doom-saying about Iran far more than he talks up his stances on homosexuality or Prop 8. He doesn't need to emphasize it, because the people who acid-test Republicans on social issues know they can trust him. He rallied for Terri Schiavo once; he doesn't have much else to prove. That's gotten clearer since the field was winnowed down to four people. A month ago, when 150 evangelical leaders met in Texas to get behind a candidate, Santorum won easily. ""Many, not all, social conservatives, continue to have doubts about whether Romney is a true social conservative,"" explained Richard Land, an attendee and president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. ""Between Santorum and Gingrich, Santorum was perceived to be the more consistently and reliably social conservative of the two."" He won that perception, and held onto it, even as his first political career imploded. He held onto it as the Great Recession came and the culture wars faded. How do we know they faded, even among Republican voters? In a new New York Times poll, only 47 percent of Republican voters say they're against any legal recognition of gay unions. In the 2008 entrance poll taken of Iowa caucus-goers, only 26 percent said that ""the economy"" was their top concern. In 2012, the number was 42 percent, with 36 percent saying ""the budget deficit"" was tops. In the most socially conservative electorate of the primary so far, social issues were looking less critical. Santorum convinced the people he needed, like the Family Leader's Bob Vander Plaats, that he was the truest, most electable, social conservative. He didn't need to rub it in. Compare how he's talked about these issues with the ways his rivals--some of them long gone now--have talked about them. When he was struggling in Iowa, Rick Perry put on a barn coat and cut a TV ad bemoaning the scourge of homosexuals and a war on Christianity. Rick Santorum used to talk like that. ""I have no problem with homosexuality,"" he said in the 2003 interview that produced the ""man on dog"" quote. ""I have a problem with homosexual acts."" He argued that sodomy laws served a purpose, because ""if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery."" Try and get Rick Santorum 2.0 to talk like that. In the final debate before the New Hampshire primary, when he was asked if he'd be a ""gay rights leader""--a pretty blunt trick question--Santorum said he'd ""be a voice in speaking out for making sure that every person in America, gay or straight, is treated with respect and dignity and has the equality of opportunity."" If his son told him he was gay, ""I would love him as much as I did the second before he said it."" In two new ads, his social conservatism is mentioned only in a long rundown of other reasons to vote for him. One mentions that he was ""one of the top 25 evangelicals in America,"" according to Time, but the point is left out there, context-free. The result of all this: polls showing Santorum as an electable national candidate. The strategists who worked against Santorum in 2006 are amused. He gave them length after length of rope, they hung him with it, and essentially, he hasn't changed. He still holds onto his criticism of homosexuality, for example--that it stems from the rise of the welfare state and loose morals. They have destroyed the American ideal of one-income households. Sex is meant to be a procreation-only pursuit, and they've ruined that, too. Santorum's Senate career lasted from 1995 to 2007. With one exception, the slowdown of 2001-02, his political career coincided with a period of huge economic growth. It was an ideal context for Santorum's ideas about the welfare state shrinking as more moral Americans took care of their own. In 2003, during a discussion of further welfare reform, Santorum suggested that ""making people struggle a little bit is not necessarily the worst thing."" In his 2005 book, It Takes a Family, Santorum suggested that many two-income households were materialistic. ""In far too many families with young children,"" he wrote, ""both parents are working, when, if they really took an honest look at the budget, they might confess that both of them don't really need to, or at least may not need to work as much as they do."" How does Mitt Romney take advantage of that? He hasn't tried yet. His argument against Rick Santorum is all about the former senator's resume, and support for earmarks--stuff  libertarians care about, nothing cultural. The digging into Santorum's theories about contraception has only just begun. Since he's risen in the polls, he's tried to genericize that issue, too, attacking a contraception mandate as the ""government trying to control your life,"" not as some battle in the culture war. How long can this new Santorum keep that up?"	Santorum Used To Talk About Homosexuality, Gay Marriage, and Abortion. What Changed?	['Perry', 'Romney']	['gay']
11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/super_pacs_are_making_the_presidential_election_more_competitive_transparent_and_fair_.html	"The call came in from the ""blocked"" number, and like a fool I answered it. ""Mr. Weegal? Why-gell? Hi, I'm calling on behalf of Russ Feingold and the Progressives United PAC."" If I made a donation, I would help the former senator combat corporate personhood and save America from the Citizens United decision. The super PACs would be humbled. Feingold could continue accusing the president of ""dancing with the devil"" when he courts the Supers. The solicitor seemed like a very nice person, with a lousy job; I don't donate to political causes. (There is a hint for you here, Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty.) Unfortunately for the cause, it's getting harder to argue that super PACs have horribly degraded our elections. In this first presidential election since the dawn of the supers, they have actually--and probably by accident!--given us a more competitive, transparent Republican primary. They are, in a sense, a good thing for our democracy. Start with the ""competitive"" part. Subtract the super PACs, and Mitt Romney would have outraised his Republican competitors by a factor of at least 2-1, in most cases 5-1. In 2011, Romney's campaign raised $56.5 million and spent $36.6 million. His closest competitor, Ron Paul, raised $25.9 million and spent $24.0 million. The two of them, who'd built national fundraising networks in 2008, raised more than the rest of the Republican field combined--$80.5 million to roughly $73.6 million. Add in the super PAC money and the advantage fades. Romney's campaign had outspent Newt Gingrich's campaign by a 7-2 margin and outspent Rick Santorum's by a 19-1 margin. According to the Sunlight Foundation, which has tracked the super PACs all year, the Romney-centric Restore Our Future PAC outspent the pro-Gingrich Winning Our Future PAC only 2-1. It outspent the Santorum-philic Red, White and Blue fund by slightly better than 8-1, which was just what the PAC needed to spend to get its candidate into an Iowa tie. ""Take away the super PACs, and Santorum would have probably had to drop out after Iowa,"" says Bill Allison, editorial director of the Sunlight Foundation. ""Gingrich might have had to drop out after South Carolina."" The super PAC critics aren't moved by the election results: The PACs are rotten and unfair. In the words of Democracy Now producers, the PAC money comes from a ""secretive coterie"" of donors. In the terrific coinage of Mother Jones editors, it's ""dark money,"" a Lovecraftian monster that moves from state to state, dissolving the foundations of the republic. It is too secretive. Most campaign money is. But here's the twist: There's more information out there about super PAC donors than there is about virtually any other kind of campaign fundraising. Maybe it's the novelty, maybe it's the size of the checks, but the rise of the super PAC has come with constant, clickable scrutiny from the Fourth Estate. The best example of this: Winning Our Future and Sheldon Adelson. When the New York Times' Nick Confessore and other reporters started chasing rumors that Adelson's network backed Gingrich, the casino magnate (net worth $22 billion or so) came under close scrutiny. Every major newspaper profiled him. At press events, Gingrich was asked about him. A quick Lexis-Nexis search tells us that Adelson has been mentioned on 189 news broadcasts since the start of 2012, almost all of them in relation to the Gingrich money. What about Rick Santorum's savior, Foster Friess? The cowboy-hatted billionaire has given louder and prouder speeches about his campaign money than any tycoon since George Soros. He's given interviews to the New Republic and the Washington Post. He introduced Santorum at last week's Conservative Political Action Conference. Friess has acted like a venture capitalist, putting seed money in a product and then shouting from the mountains about how more people should buy in. The big fear about campaign money is that it corrupts the candidates who have to beg for it. ""It's simply wrong for our democracy,"" says Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign watchdog group Democracy21, ""that an individual or his spouse can give $10 million to a particular candidate and thereby potentially buy corrupting influence at the expense of the electorate."" But that worry applies better to the shadowy bundler than it does to the megabucks super PAC donor. Corruption can't grow in the sunlight. The people giving big to super PACs are famous. I didn't fully understand how famous until I tagged along with Gingrich at a speech to Aloma Baptist Church in Florida, when a parishioner asked him to explain why he was taking dirty money from the gambling industry. Gingrich explained that he and Adelson had a simpatico, guns-a-blazin' view on Israel. Is it corruption if the candidate tells you what he'll do for the donor? If only the rest of the campaign finance system worked that way. Allison and Wertheimer, who worked very hard to cure my Pollyannish take on the cuper PAC, point out that the smaller donations, and the ones newly, legally laundered through 501(c)(3) groups, are handy hideouts for corruption. ""Take Solyndra,"" says Allison. ""There's not a single story that mentioned how an Obama bundler invested in this solar company that got a huge government loan guarantee. That only happened when the thing went bankrupt."" This is fixable. Maybe. House Democrats have introduced a new version of the DISCLOSE Act, the reform bill that would require total transparency on PAC funding. It's probably doomed--the Chamber of Commerce doesn't like items like a requirement for CEOs to appear in the commercials--but it's the kind of reform Republicans frequently claim to want--total donation freedom, total transparency. Our super PAC education, so far, has consisted of fat checks matched with information about the check-cutters. We know more about those guys than we know about the bundlers, who've been passing money under the table for years. So which of those systems is worse for our democracy?"

He walked deliberately through the crowd. Here was Caesar returning from the wars. Tomorrow Gingrich will speak again at the same gathering, but the conservative who most deserves the dramatic, fist-pumping greeting is his presidential rival Rick Santorum: the lonely warrior who has triumphed without playing a soundtrack of self-regard, without the ready millions of Gingrich's gambling-magnate patron, and despite more derision from the elite media than Gingrich has faced. Has Rick Santorum eclipsed Newt Gingrich as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney? Santorum didn't just pull off a hat trick in Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri, he trounced Newt Gingrich, besting him by more than 20 points in each state. Those victories appear to have been the start of a conservative rallying toward a single candidate. If that's so, Gingrich should take the advice he was just a week ago offering Santorum: Get out of the race now to ensure that there is a single conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. Rick Santorum's success Tuesday was an embarrassment to Mitt Romney, but the good news for Romney is that it set up a dynamic that benefits him. Gingrich and Santorum will continue to split the anti-Romney vote, giving the front-runner an even better chance to win future contests. But if there were ever a sole alternative to Romney, that person would pose a more serious threat. Here's how one GOP strategist put it: ""The longer conservatives stay split, the harder it is going to be for us to [beat Romney]. And I think that we risk not being able to beat Obama unless we get a conservative."" That strategist was Newt Gingrich. He followed up by saying, ""I have to win the nomination."" Gingrich's argument for prevailing is that he has people power over Mitt Romney's money power. It's a dubious claim since his super PAC has received $10 million from a single Las Vegas couple, but let's forget that for the moment and pretend it's true. The Gingrich strategy is that the grassroots will rise up and propel his candidacy because they know Romney is not a true conservative and they like Gingrich's conservative message. That is a powerful pitch. It makes Romney's money seem like a liability--it may make him look strong but it's not authentic strength. The message also boosts Gingrich's allure: He will ride aloft the passions of the conservative masses. It's a good strategy--and it's happening! The problem for Gingrich is that it's happening to Rick Santorum. Usually the former speaker would blame the subway-riding elite media for this phenomenon, but if there's a candidate who has been counted out even more than Gingrich it's Santorum. (Of course, this could be a part of the media's diabolical plot to keep the race interesting, but that would have required infiltrating the electorates of the three states that voted for Santorum, which we're just not organized to do.) The former Pennsylvania senator won without a big war chest and he did it with the ""little engine that could"" spunk that has characterized his candidacy. Gingrich, in the same period, has only soured his brand. His post-Las Vegas press conference was full of bitterness. ""The way he has revived himself in the past,"" says GOP pollster Whit Ayers, ""is as a big picture visionary talking about uniting the party around his vision as opposed to the angry Newt whining about attacks on him."" The good news for Mitt Romney is that Newt Gingrich is unlikely to follow his own advice. He will take the stage at CPAC on Friday looking to reignite the spark that once propelled his campaign. However it goes, Newt will stay in the race and keep splitting the anti-Romney vote. If he really wants to do Romney a favor, he'll start attacking Santorum. And even if Santorum steals the spotlight at CPAC, why would Gingrich get out? He Gingrich is at his best when people are predicting his doom. Indeed, perhaps he is sinking himself so far beneath the shale in order to make his rebirth all the more dramatic. But if conservatives have already moved on and picked Rick Santorum as their true conservative champion, then this year the Survivor song remembered may be the band's less well-known anthem: ""The Search Is Over."""

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/santorum_s_big_victories_what_will_front_runner_mitt_romney_do_now_.html	"Mitt Romney sure hopes there's a safety net. His campaign needs it. His cautious and measured run for the presidency has been thrown off stride by Rick Santorum's victories Tuesday in Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri. The GOP nominating race has become a clash of vampires and zombies. Candidates like Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich appear to die only to rise again, while Mitt Romney walks around not quite alive. In the wild narrative authored by cranky voters (who must not have heard the smart people who declared the race over months ago), the newest plot line is the battle between Rick Santorum, a candidate defined by his conviction, and Mitt Romney, one who has been defined by his lack of same. Santorum's win was a surprise, but in a way the story is not new. If there has been a constant in the Republican race, it has been that Mitt Romney is a sickly front-runner. Conservatives don't trust him, which has made it hard for him to gather the party and mount a forceful challenge against Barack Obama. Throughout his 2012 campaign, the virus of conservative doubt suddenly kicks in whenever he has appeared strong . Both Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have benefited from this malady. Romney has so far been able to medicate this problem, by spending money to make his opponents seem unpalatable and by working to turn out his vote. When he doesn't spend the money, the virus returns. In flyover events like the ones last night, where Romney did not invest much money or effort, there was no groundswell of Romney fanatics rallying to his cause. But there is a passionate core of the party looking for someone loud and proud to speak for them. Romney has never been that guy. The more those voters are told to line up behind Romney, the more they revolt. The three states that voted last night were thick with the social conservatives whom Romney has struggled to court. These bouts of Romney anemia are to blame for the fact that there is no momentum in this race. Winning a contest doesn't seem to help you very much in the next contest. Another contributing factor has been that the two men fighting to be the conservative alternative to Romney have not been able capitalize on the weakness. Romney is still the favorite to win the nomination. He has the money and the organization and the staff to win. He's in a scramble to take care of the tactics that will help him in the coming weeks, but he's got an organization that has always planned for a long fight. Romney now has some time before the next contests, which are not in evangelical-heavy states, and he showed after South Carolina that when he is focused he can be ruthlessly efficient. Santorum, by contrast, has to translate the firehose of cash and attention he'll now get into effective effort. He wasn't great at doing that after Iowa. Romney also benefits from the vote-splitting between Santorum and Gingrich, which will continue--although Newt Gingrich will have to do something to remind everyone that he's still in the race. Attacking the elite media and subway riders probably isn't going to cut it. They didn't vote in those three states last night. Gingrich has styled himself as a grass-roots politician speaking for real people, but Rick Santorum is that candidate. Santorum is also an ideas candidate in a way that Gingrich is not. While the former speaker has lots and lots of ideas, Santorum has stuck to his argument about rebuilding America's manufacturing sector in a much more focused way. His advocacy for the link between the strength of the family and the economy has also been constant. Romney will now turn his guns on Santorum. He has a good case to make: Are Republicans really going to nominate a senator who has no executive experience to replace a president whose signature failing--as many in the GOP see it--is his lack of executive experience? Especially when he himself is a Washington outsider and a proven leader? The question for Romney now is whether he opens up a two-front war against his opponents. This morning a press release from the woozy staff in Boston attacks Gingrich. In recent days, the Romney campaign has picked up its attacks on Santorum as a promoter of pork-barrel projects when he was in Washington. Attacks like these have taken their toll on Romney. His negative rating with independents has gone up. As the race plods on--and Nate Silver thinks it will plod on quite a lot--it hurts Romney because he gets attacked by his opponents and he's got to engage in behavior that voters might not like. In late January an ABC/Washington Post poll showed that Romney's unfavorable rating among independents had jumped 17 points to 51. Santorum argues that he is the conservative who can draw bright contrasts with Obama. That ideological message resonates in caucuses, but it hasn't in bigger contests where voters have thought more about electability. The constant refrain from voters I talked to in South Carolina and Florida who like Santorum but have gone with other candidates is that they just don't think he can take on Obama. In the contest of the anti-Romney candidates, Santorum doesn't have the punch Newt has. On the other hand he also doesn't have the baggage. He has a winning family story. Also: There is perhaps no greater attribute in conservative politics than sticking to your guns when everyone else counts you out. It's a political message. It's a biblical message. Santorum is the walking embodiment of that characteristic. Even his sweater-vest seems on message. Santorum worked hard in his victory speech to show that he could mount an effective attack against Obama, who he portrayed as a snob who thinks he knows better than regular people. That's a good political attack and it also plays into the social issues where Santorum is stronger, particularly the recent fight over mandating that Catholic hospitals provide contraception to employees. That fight is about religion, but it's also about the Obama administration working its way into every part of your life. The next big battleground will be the Conservative Political Action Convention in Washington this Friday. Santorum, Gingrich, and Romney will all be there. It was at that gathering of die-hard conservatives in 1975 when Ronald Reagan made his case that the party needed to nominate a candidate of bold colors and not ""pale pastels."" That's the argument Santorum and Gingrich are making about Romney. Romney has his own historical echo that can comfort him. It's not unheard of for front-runners to lose like this--Reagan, Bush, Bush, and John McCain all lost contests. McCain lost 16 contests. Despite the cliche that Republicans fall in line, it's actually a messy party. The GOP has had lots of establishment/conservative fights--Eisenhower vs. Taft, Rockefeller vs. Goldwater, Nixon vs. Rockefeller, Dole vs. Buchanan. Romney today is on the opposite end of the phenomenon that helped him four years ago. Conservatives upset with the establishment choice need somewhere to go. In 2008, they picked Romney in Colorado, where he won the state going away as the conservative alternative to John McCain. That's also why he won in Minnesota in 2008. Only about half as many people turned out to vote for Romney in Colorado as they did in 2008, and he came in third in Minnesota, where he also received far fewer votes than last time. Now he's John McCain, and Rick Santorum is playing Mitt Romney. Unfortunately for Romney, who has so often been criticized for inhabiting so many different variations, he can't be himself and the Mitt Romney of 2008."

In an increasingly diverse state where 47 percent of voters chose Obama in 2008, the new maps looked likely to hand the GOP 10 of the state's 14 seats in Congress. Perhaps even more significantly, they were drawn so as to give Republicans a shot at a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the state legislature, allowing them to pass constitutional amendments unilaterally. They achieved this in part by ""packing"" the state's black voters (who overwhelmingly vote Democratic) into a handful of districts in order to make others more solidly white (and Republican). Fortunately for the state's Democrats, federal law seemed to offer a time-tested remedy. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark civil rights bill passed in 1965 to crack down on poll taxes and other discriminatory practices, requires Georgia and a number of other Southern states to get federal approval for any changes to their voting laws. Any that harmed minorities' chances of fair representation were to be thrown out. And that's exactly what Georgia Democrats expected Obama's Department of Justice to do with Republicans' new maps. Just two years earlier, it had invoked Section 5 to block two Georgia voter-verification laws. Liberals gleefully predicted the Republican gerrymanders would likewise be ""DOA at the DOJ."" The Republicans held a trump card, however: the threat of a lawsuit challenging the Voting Rights Act itself. If the Justice Department didn't clear their maps, they warned, they'd pursue their case and seek to have the VRA's Section 5 struck down by the Supreme Court. Five years ago, that threat might have rung hollow. Yet the DoJ quickly approved the maps. The state's Democratic and black leaders were stung by what they saw as a capitulation. ""The DoJ's decision was disappointing, because Republicans took it as an approval of their resegregation strategy,"" says Stacey Abrams, leader of the Democratic minority in the Georgia House. So why did the DoJ acquiesce? It's possible, of course, that it thought the maps were just fine. While many believe packing contradicts the spirit of Section 5, it's not prohibited per se. If anything, it provides near-certainty that at least some minorities will be elected to Congress and the statehouse. In Georgia, it's white Democrats who are likely to be squeezed out as previously diverse districts become whiter and more conservative. The upshot is that black legislators may end up as a powerless Democratic minority in the Statehouse. So is that racial discrimination, or just gerrymandering as usual? But Georgia is not the only state where the DoJ has disappointed Democrats by signing off on Republican-drawn redistricting maps. Virginia, South Carolina, and Louisiana all got green lights after adopting the same stance as Georgia: Approve or we sue. For Louisiana, it was the first time its state House of Representatives maps had ever won approval on the first try. And last month, the assistant attorney general for civil rights hinted the department might drop its Section 5-based challenge to a North Carolina town's election law. The real reason for that laissez-faire approach, Democratic leaders suspect, is that the DoJ is loath to test Section 5 in court. If so, there's good reason for its reticence. Over the past few years, the law has come under assault from conservatives across the country, who see it as an outdated federal intrusion on state's rights. The movement has been emboldened by the John Roberts-led Supreme Court, which in 2009 stopped just short of overturning it. The talk among legal experts now is that it may not survive another frontal assault. The obvious conclusion is that Attorney General Eric Holder is picking his Section 5 battles in a bid to spare a vulnerable law from destruction. But to call Section 5 ""vulnerable"" is to understate what is already happening in Georgia and other Southern states. A more sober appraisal would be that Holder is trying to salvage what's left of the VRA: By shying from the redistricting cases, the DoJ has already signaled that it is no longer willing to defend a robust interpretation of the law. Instead, it has focused its efforts on a South Carolina voter ID law, which many see as a straightforward affront to Section 5, and a lawsuit from Shelby County, Ala., that explicitly seeks judicial review of the section. The restraint may be prudent, but it also comes at a huge cost for Democrats. The maps in states such as Georgia will shape elections there for the next decade, dampening Democrats' hopes of turning the state blue as its demographics continue to become more diverse. DoJ-approved maps in North Carolina are an immediate setback in a state that voted Democratic in the 2008 presidential election for the first time since 1974. And even with the Department of Justice carefully choosing its ground, many legal scholars are convinced that Section 5's days are numbered. By those grim lights, the Justice Department's quiescence isn't saving the law--it's just buying time. No liberal wants to let one of the defining laws of the civil rights movement die on their watch. Instead, they're letting it waste away. Few would have predicted such a rapid demise. For decades after its passage, the VRA enjoyed broad support, at least outside the Southern states targeted by Section 5. (Nine states--Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia--are fully covered by the law, while seven others are partially covered under the formula, which is based on voting in the 1964 election.) It was credited with ending the legal whack-a-mole game in which these states passed discriminatory laws, then withdrew them and passed new ones as soon as the federal government sued. As Slate's Dahlia Lithwick has noted, on the long road to rectifying racial inequality in the United States, there always had been a chorus of wee voices asking, ""Are we there yet?"" Yet as recently as 2006, Congress responded with a resounding ""no."" Legislation to renew the Voting Rights Act for 30 years passed with flying colors in the House; the vote in the Senate was 98-0. The VRA's future appeared secure. That changed when the Supreme Court veered right under Roberts. In a 2009 case out of Texas, several justices voiced strong misgivings about Section 5, wondering why it still applied to some states and not others. (It's a fair question: Indiana and Wisconsin, among others, have passed voter ID laws similar to those the DoJ blocked in Southern states.*) The court stopped short of striking it down, but its oral arguments were seen as a warning to Congress: Fix this law, or we're eventually going to kill it. Apparently unwilling to risk fracturing the coalition that supported the status quo, Congress did nothing. And now the Department of Justice appears to be tiptoeing around on the basis, not of a ruling, but of mere oral arguments made by justices in the Supreme Court. To NYU law professor Samuel Issacharoff, who wrote an influential paper in 2004 calling Section 5 ""a victim of its own success,"" that's as it should be: When SCOTUS speaks, the DoJ is wise to listen. In the eyes of Democrats in Georgia and other Southern states, the Justice Department has already ceded too much ground. Yet that assumes that if it did take the fight to the Supreme Court, the DoJ would have a realistic chance of prevailing. UC-Irvine law professor Rick Hasen doesn't think that's the case. That the Roberts court would overturn key parts of Section 5 in the face of a direct challenge, Hasen believes, is a near certainty. The real question, he said, is how sweeping the ruling would be--and whether other civil rights laws would drop like dominoes in the fallout. If the court strikes down Section 5, it will likely be on the grounds that there's not enough evidence of ongoing racial discrimination in the covered states to justify federal meddling in their electoral processes. But if that's true, then what's to save Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which applies nationwide? Both sections rest on the assumption that the government still has an important role to play in redressing racial wrongs. And while the cases are quite different, it's the same fundamental premise that forms the legal basis for affirmative action--which the Supreme Court has decided to tackle in the current session. Roberts and others on the court have made it clear they just don't think racism is that big a problem anymore. So what will happen if the VRA is gutted? It's true that the country, including the South, has changed since 1964, and no one expects states to bring back poll taxes. Rather, the main result would be to give state-level political majorities more leeway to rig voting rules in their favor, even when that means diluting the influence of minorities at the polls. That would be a shame, and it would slow the process of political change in states like Texas and Georgia as minorities make up an ever-larger share of the population. But in the long term, it may not amount to the worst-case scenario that some civil rights activists fear. Through strategies such as packing, Republicans have long managed to work the VRA to their advantage anyway. And even voter ID laws won't hold back the tide of minority influence at the polls for long. For a time, the South Carolina case appeared as though it could be on track to reach the high court this year. Hasen now believes the Shelby County case, backed by three Republican attorneys general, is the best bet to win the sweepstakes, perhaps reaching the Supreme Court next year. By that point, of course, even a win for the Justice Department wouldn't change the outcome of the battles it has already forfeited.

Correction, March 1, 2012: This piece originally misidentified Ohio as a non-Section 5 state that has passed a voter ID law similar to South Carolina's. Ohio's House of Representatives did pass a voter ID bill in March, but it stalled in the state Senate and never became law. (Return to corrected sentence.)"	Is the Voting Rights Act Already Dead?

We know this because Rick Santorum says so. When he finishes a speech--one that's at least twice or three times as long as Romney's--he gives his audience an opening for questions. ""I always like to take a few questions,"" said Santorum on Sunday, speaking at a church in Davison, Mich., to a crowd that occupied every carpeted inch of the small room's balcony and stairs. ""Unlike a lot of other candidates--I want to hear what you have to say. Not just what I have to say. And by the way, I don't read from a script!"" Applause. ""I don't preselect the audience."" More applause. ""I don't read from the teleprompter!"" Loud, knowing, conspiratorial applause. ""Of course, all those things scare the living daylights out of the Washington, D.C., establishment. They want it to be scripted. They want to write the script!"" Santorum had just slapped Romney, with a special bonus drop kick of Barack Obama. (You're not a 2012 Republican candidate if you don't make a teleprompter joke--or five.) The risks, at this speech, were extraordinarily low. The first question from the crowd was: ""Gas prices, Rick. What'll you do about 'em?"" The second was about what he'd do to end abortion, ""the genocide of the next generation."" Santorum whacked the softballs into the ionosphere, and every reporter in the room had time to ponder: Yeah, why doesn't Romney do this? A Romney aide who'd been tracking Santorum tried to convince me that the former senator was weakening himself with his lecture-length events--why, as many as 10 percent of voters left before he was done! But there's no actual evidence that this hurts Santorum. If Mitt Romney loses the Michigan primary, he will face a crisis of Dunkirkian proportions, with questions about which campaign staffers he's about to sack, and new calls for the Mitch Daniels Charisma Machine to come in and save the party. If Romney wins here, just by a little, it'll be the same crisis, with slightly fewer explosions. A narrow win would mean that Romney effectively lost to Santorum on Election Day and tumbled over the goal line, clutching a box of absentee votes between bandaged arms. Neither of these situations is ideal, for either Romney or Santorum. At a glance, the 2012 Republican primary looks a lot like the 2008 Democratic race. But that campaign pitted a well-liked candidate who would be the first African-American president against a well-like candidate who would have been the first female president. Neither ran a particularly negative campaign. Go and check out the most brutal ad that Obama aired against Hillary. He criticized her because the New York Times, ""her hometown paper,"" said she was ""taking the low road."" That was it. With precious little ideological or policy space between them, the candidates waged war over whether the Democrats should nominates a figure of hope or a pragmatist. Now, look back at Romney-Santorum. When Santorum brags about his audacity, he's copying every insurgent who's ever put his name on the ballot. But Santorum actually means it. He no longer picks culture war fights, the way he did when he lost his Senate seat. He picks contrast fights, over everything. The Santorum Theory of 2012 is this: Voters have figured Barack Obama out and will reward a conservative and punish a moderate. In Davison and elsewhere, Santorum's Exhibit A for the theory is the health care law. It's unpopular. It's ""the No. 1 issue."" A new swing state poll in USA Today proves that voters hate it. ""Why would the people of Michigan,"" he asked, ""put up someone who won't make the fundamental argument at the core of this election, and give that issue away?"" What about a secondary issue, climate change? A total scam, Santorum said, and Romney fell for it. ""I didn't buy the game that the left was playing,"" he said, ""to try and get more money from people so they could take more power."" At another weekend event, in Traverse City, Santorum lampooned the media for asking why the most prominent Catholic in Republican politics once ""wanted to puke"" when he heard John F. Kennedy give his 1960 religion speech. Santorum explained: ""Total separation"" of church and state made him sick. ""That's not America,"" he said. ""That's France!"" Perhaps some front-running candidate could take this, flip it, warn voters of danger up ahead. Mitt Romney is not that candidate. Romney's ads in Michigan, and his Super PAC's ads, attack Santorum for undue fealty to the Tea Party. A radio spot that loops on Detroit-area conservative talk radio ticks off ways that Santorum spent money--the bridge to nowhere!--and  adds ""ka-ching"" cash register sound effects. When the GOP destroyed the Democrats in 2010, voters told exit pollsters that they wanted the new Congress to cut the deficit and slash taxes. Surely, they'll do it again! You win elections when you convince voters you'll act fast on the stuff that makes them angry, and you blot out the rest of the ideological noise. That's not how Republicans see it anymore. In Traverse City, a Santorum voter who'd gone for Romney last time explained his conversion by blaming the media. In 2008, he said, the fourth estate never vetted Barack Obama and never asked hard questions about Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers. He would never have voted for Romney if he knew he decreed a universal health care mandate in Massachusetts. The media let him down. Now that he knew better, he could vote for Santorum and expose Obama for what he was. If a Republican establishment still exists, this is its nightmare. The front-runner who wants to play moderate if he wins--the guy who said today that he refuses to ""set my hair on fire"" and go brutal on Obama--isn't reacting well to pressure. He looks weaker, and polls weaker, than he has for months. The voters who picked him in Michigan four years ago can explain it. They were told that a ""moderate"" candidate, who didn't offend people, would win. He didn't win. Now they want revenge. At his Davison rally, one voter put this to Santorum in one short question. ""Unlike John McCain, will you go after Obama without treating him with kid gloves?"" Santorum grinned at that one. ""What do you think?"""	The Battle for Michigan: Why Romney Is the Loser--No Matter What	['Obama', 'Romney', 'Kennedy']	[]
17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/mitt_romney_and_rick_santorum_are_offering_a_different_version_of_the_same_message_to_michigan_voters_.html	"Mitt Romney reminds voters at every campaign stop in Michigan that he is a local boy. He points out school friends, the cemetery where his parents are buried--his father picked the plot because it was the cheapest--and talks about vacations they took in his family's rambler. In Traverse City on Sunday, he delighted the packed house on how he stole his first kiss from his wife Ann on a beach down the road. It seems to be working. ""He's a lot less stiff,"" says Bill Vettel after hearing Romney speak Saturday at a college in Flint, Mich. ""He's more like someone you could like."" Sunday, after a well-attended Traverse City rally, Marve Schrebe is energized by Romney's performance. ""If he would come on television and make a presentation like this one and unleash his soul, it would be great!"" Rick Santorum can't claim local roots, but he speaks to voters where they live, channeling their anger and frustration with government. His audiences shout out in agreement as he highlights the Obama administration's disrespect for people of faith or its disregard for the Constitution. They react with gasps when he lists the most recent offenses to the traditional American way of life. ""I like his values and passion,"" says Marge McCulloch. Most voters who support Santorum say the same thing: They like his personal qualities. Trust me, I'm one of you. Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum are offering a different version of the same message. The polls in Michigan show that the race is essentially tied. Both candidates say they are the true conservative. They both promise to tell the truth. They say their opponents will waiver under pressure. Why should a voter think either one is on the level? A shared connection--either of conviction or background--might make the difference. He is one of us. He won't let me down. In the battle to pitch themselves as the true conservative, Santorum clearly makes the stronger case. In Traverse City Sunday night, he was introduced to the crowd as a ""warrior for life."" The first half of his hourlong speech was a defense of religion in public life. That morning he had defended his comments that John Kennedy's speech about the separation between church and state had made him want to throw up. ""That is France, not America,"" he said of Kennedy's claim. ""Look what happened in France. A group of people who now no longer have to respect anybody's rights, it's whatever the government says you have the right to is what you have the right to. [It] results in tyranny."" That's the mindset of the Obama administration, he claims. ""They are also going to force people of faith to adopt their secular values, that if people of faith don't agree with the secular values of this administration then you will be punished."" Santorum praises the Tea Party and wraps himself in their message of returning to the Constitution, but it's a bit of sleight of hand. Tea Party supporters are almost totally focused on shrinking government. That's not Santorum's message. His pitch is about values. ""He is a Christian,"" says Art Bak, the owner of a flag company. ""He upholds Christian principles our country was founded on."" Scott Johnson, who wrote a check to Santorum for $100, said he wants Santorum to help ""bring back the old United States."" Santorum is pugnacious, describing a president who sniffs at the things they hold most sacred. ""The President of the United States said the other day that every child in America should go to college. What a snob."" Santorum says the administration is mocking them. ""You will be fined. You will be held up for ridicule,"" he says of health care provisions that conflict with religious views. ""Never before in the history of this country have we seen anything like this. Yet the president sort of laughs it off."" A Romney staffer attending the Santorum event quips that he didn't talk about jobs for the first half-hour. It's true, and Santorum can hardly blame the media for making him talk about social issues. He's clearly choosing to hammer away on social issues in Michigan. It makes sense, though. He's setting the hook. With an audience alive to the mingled threats from the Obama administration's overreach, he then pivoted to Romney, explaining why he is too weak for such a dire moment. He won't be able to draw a contrast with Obama because Romney's Massachusetts health care plan, support for the Wall Street bailout, and belief in global warming make him too similar. That's what makes Santorum more electable. ""I like this term resolute that he used the other night,"" he says, speaking of Romney. ""Maybe he doesn't understand what the term resolute means. But it means that you're supposed to have sort of a resolve, a consistent pattern of beliefs."" Santorum's reasoning about Romney is reaching his audience. ""Mitt Romney has too much baggage,"" says Bob Hammond, a 63-year-old civil engineer. ""If Mitt Romney is the candidate, the comparisons between Romneycare and Obamacare are too great. It wouldn't be a very good distinction."" Santorum goes on for over an hour. His argument is methodical, but he feels like a talk show host filling time. He cycles through one outrage after another and sometimes seems to be just riffing, showing the audience how clever he is. ""Imagine if we had insurance that covered food,"" he said during an extended lope through an analogy about government intervention in private choice in the health care market. ""And you paid--you know, instead of Blue Cross and Blue Shield, you had Blue Cow and Blue Pig ... .You think we have an obesity problem now?"" He tries to make a virtue of his lack of polish, making a clear reference to Romney's overly precise campaign. Santorum says his personal approach is a more authentic one. ""I never have to worry about what I say because I will say what's [in] my heart. I might not say it the most articulate sometimes and I understand that, but I have no teleprompters. I answer questions from the public in front of cameras. I answer questions from the press every day. I don't hide. I don't hide from the public. I don't have structured events where only my friends are in front of me to take questions. When someone doesn't agree with me, I tell them that answer even if they don't want to hear that answer because you know what, they're entitled to the truth."" Across town two hours later, Romney draws about 150 more people than Santorum's 500 or so. He is sharp and relatively brisk, speaking about a third as long as Santorum. He makes the same point about the threats to the American Dream. He recites verses from ""America the Beautiful"" to kindle patriotic sentiment as he has for months now. The language echoes Santorum's language: ""The creator had endowed us with our rights, not the state, not the king but the creator and that we would be a state that trusted in God. We would be one nation under God."" But at a Santorum event, the audience would have cheered the use of the word God, seeing it as an argument against those who would deny His place in the American experiment. At the Romney rally, the line gets no response. It's boilerplate, not bomb throwing. Romney voters care about electability, which is why the candidate makes the pitch explicit. ""I'm the only guy in the race who can beat Barack Obama."" After his events, Romney's ability to beat Obama is cited by every voter I meet. The biggest reaction Romney gets is when he says, ""This is a president who is out of ideas, out of excuses, and in 2012, he's going to be out of office."" It's not that Romney delivers the line that well. People are just excited to imagine a world without Obama. Romney appears to be making some headway by highlighting Santorum's ties to Washington. Santorum says Romney is just a manager who wants to tinker with Washington instead of change it. Romney makes the same charge. ""My team is the people of Michigan and America and I'm going to fight for you. If you want to send someone to Washington who is working around the edges to make little changes here and changes there and work with this subcommittee and that subcommittee, then there are plenty of other people to choose. But if you want someone who will fundamentally change Washington, and bring us more jobs and less debt and smaller government, then I'm your guy."" Santorum is also too conservative for some Romney voters. ""He is way out there. He's as far right as Obama is left,"" says Ann Vettel from Flushing, Mich. ""I'd love him for my minister, but he talks too much about personal things. Personal things don't run the United States."" Both candidates are pitching radical change, but Mitt Romney's is a far more comfortable brand of radicalism. It doesn't come in radical packaging. It doesn't seem off topic. He's talking about jobs and spending, not whether colleges turn people into radical atheists or some speech President Kennedy delivered 50 years ago. If Mitt Romney doesn't win Michigan, it will be devastating. He has so many advantages in the state. He has much more money, a better organization, and biographical ties. Rick Santorum's lack of discipline and weak debate performance also give Romney an opening. If he can't win here, his argument about how those advantages will help him capture future states will seem absurd. Even if Romney is able to win in a safe state--which, in truth, may now qualify as a comeback state--the questions about his candidacy and ability to appeal to conservatives will not die in Michigan. In states where he doesn't have personal ties, his appeal has come across with all the sincerity of a LinkedIn invitation. No one ever became president without his party regulars thinking he is one of them."	If Mitt can't connect with Michigan Republicans, who can he connect with?	['Obama', 'Romney', 'Kennedy']	['god']
18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/the_republican_national_convention_will_not_be_a_brokered_convention_.html	"Disney may be in Orlando, but in Republican Party politics, Tampa is the home of Fantasyland. That's where the GOP convention will be held the week of Aug. 27. As the Republican race appears more likely to stretch into spring (or beyond), journalists and political operatives have started to imagine make-believe scenarios for what might happen if GOP delegates show up with funny hats, pins, and suntan lotion but no confirmed nominee. It is still early--there are still 48 contests to go--and a lot can happen on the campaign trail between now and August. But while we're thinking of hot days in western Florida, one thing is certain: No matter who the nominee is, there is going to have to be a reconciliation between populist conservatives, evangelicals, and establishment Republicans. GOP leaders are going to have a tough time putting on their show for the watching world if they can't finesse these differences. Here are the three most likely scenarios, in declining order of madness. Pure Chaos: A Brokered Convention Usually it takes three martinis and a long night to get people to ruminate about a brokered convention, but it's happening. Under this scenario, a white-knight candidate arrives either late in the nominating process or in Tampa. Of course, this person does not yet exist. Jeb Bush, Mitch Daniels, and Chris Christie have all said they're not interested. Oh sure, they could be convinced to enter the race, but that doesn't change the logic that kept them from running in the first place. Whether it's a lack of will, the wrong issue positions, or something else, whatever kept them out of the race in the first place is going to come out. And when it does, this hero candidate is going to have to dampen those doubts while also trying to build an organization, introduce himself to the press, and adjust his body clock to the intense physical and psychological challenges of the white-hot moment. None of these characters is so universally beloved that they won't set a brush fire among certain constituencies. Brokered conventions were more common 60 years ago. When the party bosses decided what to do, the rank and file knew no different. Now there are no party bosses and the prevailing feeling in the Republican Party is that no one wants to have any elders tell them what to do. And the original slate of candidates, who will have slogged through almost every state, will not sit politely and applaud the new choice. The chaos would be beamed live across the land for four days to independent voters and swing states--hardly the image the GOP wants to project. Managed Chaos: A Contested Convention Under this scenario, none of the four candidates gets to Tampa with the 1,144 delegates they require to clinch the nomination. That means they would have to cut a deal that elevates one of them as the party's candidate. This would probably be a late-breaking deal after emissaries from various camps snuck in and out of parking garages trying to avoid the press. The late hour would add to the degree of difficulty. Supporters would feel sold out. There would be lots of stories about how they're not going to follow their candidate's lead and support the nominee. All of this would be breaking at show time. To quell the crowds, the chosen man would have to give a stunning convention performance like John Kennedy in front of the Texas delegation in 1960 when he joked that Lyndon Johnson was so useful in the Senate he should stay there. There isn't a Kennedy in the bunch. Richard Nixon also did some of this party stitching in 1960. After working out a deal with the moderate Nelson Rockefeller, he spoke to conservatives in the platform committee in Chicago who accused him of selling out. ""I have heard some people say 'if I don't get what I want I'm going to go home and sit it out,' "" he said, ""and my point is: how stupid can you be?"" But Nixon was far more blunt with the Tea Party activists of his time than any politician would be today. In 1976 Gerald Ford orchestrated a moment of excitement at his contested convention when he called Ronald Reagan to speak, surprising everyone. Still, Ford lost. Planned Chaos: A Nominee Arrives in Tampa The most likely scenario is that a nominee arrives in Tampa with the delegates he needs. But, in this election season, that won't spare him trouble. It's not just that bruised feelings will have to be managed between the winner and his vanquished rivals. He will also have to unite the party behind his candidacy. That's been the challenge before, but perhaps never with such a weak field of potential nominees. The story of this campaign, in part, is that the best men did not run. The continued chatter about Daniels, Bush, and Christie confirms the weakness in those that did. So the eventual nominee, whoever he is, will face some immediate challenges. How to manage the disappointment in the other camps? How to ensure that they leave Tampa united and ready to take on an incumbent president? For Mitt Romney, the problem will be exciting the delegates and the conservative pundits. It hasn't been an easy prospect for other GOP nominees, even some who had a stronger hand to play. Think, for example, of the chaos that has been created by nominees striving to repair the breach by generating excitement in the party base. In 1992, George Bush's convention planners let Pat Buchanan speak. His firebrand call for a cultural war defined the event--and the party--in a way that the Bush team never intended. In 1996 and 2008, the GOP nominees used their vice president picks to electrify the party base. But the undisciplined Jack Kemp--a fervent supply-sider--was never a good match for nominee Bob Dole, who had been a deficit hawk his whole career. John McCain excited the party's base and convention-goers with his pick of Sarah Palin. Of course, the choice also led to chaos in his campaign. In 2004, the George W. Bush team used their convention to present a moderate rather than conservative face to the country. Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Arnold Schwartzeneger all spoke in coveted prime-time spots. You could imagine the this year's nominee wanting to do something similar, especially as some in the party fear that extremism in the primaries has pulled the GOP too far to the right. But is that option available to Mitt Romney? With a right flank suspicious of his conservative bona fides, he'll be under far greater pressure to show support for movement conservatives. If he doesn't give them pride of place, there will be grumbling. There's always grumbling. Hillary supporters grumbled about their candidate getting proper deference at Barack Obama's convention. Sure, but Democrats were always going to rally around the first African-American nominee. Also, Romney-grumbling will be different: The grumbling will be of the same order that has dogged Romney throughout his campaign. Simply giving Rick Santorum, Michelle Bachmann, or Sarah Palin 15 minutes in the spotlight is not going to make hard-core conservatives who already distrust Romney suddenly believe that he's going to promote their values. If Rick Santorum or Newt Gingrich is the nominee, there will be a different challenge. Party regulars will be happy, but all of the Republican strategists who warn that nominating one of these two men would alienate independent voters--thereby sinking the party's chances in the presidential race, as well as in House and Senate contests--will continue to talk to reporters like me. The Chaos Neutralizer: Barack Obama The good news for any Republican is that the great unifying figure will be the sitting president. The desire to replace Barack Obama will bring Tea Party supporters and establishment Republicans together around a common enemy. Of course, a deep disgust with the incumbent president wasn't enough to oust the reviled Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. Then again, if the economy stays soft, it might just be enough in 2012, even for a party as divided as the GOP."

One of his advisers suggested to the Washington Examiner's Byron York that he is, and that Mitt Romney is getting absolution. ""Why is Mormonism off limits?"" York quotes the adviser as asking. ""We're having to spend days answering questions about Rick's faith, which he has been open about. Romney will turn on a dime when you talk about religion. We're getting asked about specific tenets of Rick's faith, and when Romney says, 'I want to focus on the economy,' [the press says,] 'OK, we'll focus on the economy.' "" In this Lenten season we are called upon to be generous of spirit, so let's start there. The Santorum campaign is under siege. Mitt Romney and his backers are dropping millions of dollars in ads on his head. He's being called to account for everything he's said for his entire career in an atmosphere that doesn't allow for reasoned discussion. The press accounts of some of his recent comments, like his remark about Obama's phony theology, have cast him in the worst possible light before letting him clarify. Now, this claim is nuts. Rick Santorum isn't being asked about his faith. He's being asked about statements that have come out of his own mouth about contraception, prenatal screening, and man's dominion over earth. Even if we stipulate that the press is asking a disproportionate number of questions about these issues--instead of, say, his manufacturing plan or position on Syria--the questions I've heard haven't been about papal infallibility or the Catechism. When the press want to ask gotcha questions about doctrinal matters, they ignore everything the candidate actually talks about and ask about evolution--as they regularly did with Mike Huckabee during the 2008 race. This is a dodge. And when you make a dodge of faith, you cheapen it--not the least because you make the plea seem like just another political move. It's not the first time in this election season. While in South Carolina, Anita Perry said of her husband's suffering campaign: ""We are being brutalized by our opponents and our own party. So much of that is, I think ... because of his faith."" Forgive me Father: hogwash. Perry had rough treatment not because of his faith but because he was a bad presidential candidate. It was particularly striking that Mrs. Perry used this shield because it was Robert Jeffress, one of her husband's supporters, who threw the dirtiest religious barb in the campaign. He accused Romney of being a member of a ""cult,"" who should be shunned by Christians. That's what makes the Santorum adviser's claim about Romney's faith so preposterous. Again, in the spirit of Lent, we'll assume the adviser wasn't bringing up Romney's faith in order to unsettle voters by reminding them of it. Mitt Romney has not tied his personal faith to his public policy positions the way Santorum has, yet he has been asked repeatedly about his faith during his presidential campaigns. It was such an issue in 2008 that he had to give a special speech on the topic to address the issue. It is true, as the Santorum adviser claims, that Romney pivots back to talking about the economy when asked about his religion. But that's just campaign discipline. Romney switches back to the economy when asked what breakfast cereal he prefers. Santorum doesn't pivot because he can't: The questions he gets aren't about his faith. They're about things he says. Why? Because, in part, Santorum is appealing to evangelical voters. It's hard to pivot away from answering for your own remarks by saying they're not germane. That brings us to Satan. Rick Santorum's comments about the Father of Lies from 2008 are in the news. Is it unfair to ask Santorum about these remarks? No. If Rick Santorum would like Mitt Romney to answer for remarks he made about abortion long ago, it's fair for Santorum to have to answer about more recent remarks about Lucifer's dominion over America. Maybe he was asked too many questions about Satan, but that's a sin of excess, not a fixation on faith. It's dangerous to make too much of one unnamed adviser's remarks, but this claim is not dissimilar from the wider complaint within the Santorum camp that he is being unfairly targeted because of his socially conservative views.  Rich Lowry of the National Journal defended this perspective in a recent column, arguing that the excessive scrutiny was due to the fact that Santorum ""is a standing affront to the sensibilities and assumptions of the media and political elite."" That is firmer ground. Calling Santorum a ""standing affront"" overstates the case, but the newsrooms on the coasts are not filled with people who share his worldview. But the idea of a left-wing conspiracy loses steam when you recognize how many conservatives are pointing out the shortcomings of Santorum's campaign and his handling of social issues. Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post, who was a Santorum booster before it was cool, precisely identifies his excesses; John Podhoretz in the New York Post explains why Santorum's moralism will be unattractive in a general election; and Peter Wehner in Commentary makes a similar case. With so many conservatives making astute political observations about Santorum and his socially conservative views, either the liberals have had a recruiting boon or there's something to the scrutiny Santorum is getting that goes beyond ideology or religious bigotry. Santorum isn't suffering for his faith. He's being held accountable for what he says."	Is Rick Santorum Suffering for His Faith? Hell No.	['Perry', 'Romney']	['abortion']
21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/investor_peter_thiel_is_the_billionaire_behind_ron_paul_s_presidential_campaign_.html	"The previous 24 hours had been rough on the political tycoons. Foster Friess, the cowboy-hat wearing backer of Rick Santorum, appeared on MSNBC twice: once to joke about women preventing pregnancy by putting Bayer aspirin ""between their knees,"" once to apologize. Sheldon Adelson, whose previous $10 million investment in Newt Gingrich hadn't netted much, spun the media 'round again by promising $10 million more. Frank VanderSloot, a national finance co-chair of Mitt Romney's campaign, was filleted by a Salon report on his Bond villain-esque habit of hushing up critics with lawsuits. This news cycle was sputtering out when Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of PayPal, the $2.6 million-angel for a Ron Paul Super PAC, arrived at the Grand Hyatt in Washington, D.C. His audience: hundreds of young libertarians, most of them dressed as if they expected to be ambushed by job interviewers, overcrowding every inch of hotel carpet. They were trapped in America's least libertarian city for the third annual Students for Liberty conference. Thiel was the first-night keynoter, assigned the heavy task of pulling college kids away from the hotel bars. This proves to be easy. Thiel, athletic and intense, moves quickly through the crowd, rarely recognized. He's guided by Alexander McCobin, the president of Students for Liberty, dressed in a three-piece suit, grinning and small-talking as he walks. McCobin had co-founded the group in 2007, when he was one of the dozens of Koch Summer Fellows (yes, that Koch) who live, intern, and network in D.C. [Disclosure time: He interned at Reason when I worked there.] Tonight, he'll give Thiel an alumnus of the year award, even though Thiel had graduated from Stanford Law School 20 years ago. By the time SFL was producing alumni, Thiel was on the board of Facebook and extraordinarily wealthy. ""We take a broad-based view of what 'alumnus' means,"" says McCobin. A better description might be ""role model."" Thiel is what the hard-working objectivist wants to be when he grows up. When he's introduced at last, and the students hear how much Thiel made from the PayPal sale--""$1.5 billion""--they ooooh with respect. Thiel, as he wrote in 2009, is  ""committed to the faith of my teenage years,"" and now he's rich. That's heady stuff for a teenager to hear. It's what makes Thiel's support so important to Paul. The Endorse Liberty PAC, the one that Thiel supports, is as idiosyncratic as everything else in the Paul sphere. While Adelson and company have plowed their cash into TV ads, Endorse Liberty has focused on long YouTube documentaries about Paul--the latest runs more than 13 minutes--that explain his entire philosophy. In Nevada this month, when I asked Paul about his support from Thiel, he says he'd never actually met the guy. For someone he had never met, Thiel is incredibly generous. In January, the billionaire forked over $1.7 million to Paul's PAC; this was on top of $900,000 he gave a month earlier. All of this is oddly believable. Thiel doesn't even say that he's trying to elect Ron Paul. ""The campaign really is for 2016,"" says Thiel, chatting for a little while before his speech. ""I think we're just trying to build a libertarian base for the next cycle."" Thiel sits through a short program. His name is mispronounced as THEEL--it's  supposed to sound like the color, teal--but he doesn't react, and he takes his podium, a standing ovation before he even speaks. ""It's an unusually libertarian movement,"" he says. ""For the first time in perhaps 80 years, we have a chance to move the country in a more libertarian direction, with a less intrusive government, in both social and economic areas. ... It's an interesting counterpoint to debate in the 1930s, which the libertarian side, the laissez-fair side, lost very badly, about what caused the Depression. Somehow the New Deal won, and it keep building on its victories."" Thiel talks for 20 minutes, without notes. Unlike the other candidates' ""sugar daddies,"" he likes to write at length about what he thinks. He repeats some of the concepts from a four-month-old essay he gave National Review. ""Clean technology has been an increasingly toxic term in Silicon Valley,"" he says, ""for companies that don't work."" Lots of politicians will say that about ""clean technology."" Thiel goes much further. Bad stimulus investments have only been the latest of several bubbles, all phony, all distractions from a slowdown in innovation. ""The only way we have progress in the advanced countries is through technological innovation,"" he says. ""If you want to contrast computers with biotech, well, take a video game--take Farmville, for a random example--and let's say you say, well, we have to make this game subject to FDA scrutiny. We have to determine whether they are safe and effective. Does it do anything bad to your brain? Does it actually improve your brain function? We have to do a 10-year study, with a control group, and if you change one line of code you have to start all over again. I would submit if you apply the standards you have in biotech to video games, you would not have a video game industry."" The government is wrecking the future and putting off the apocalypse with phony bubbles. ""The current bubble,"" he says, ""is probably big enough to get Barack Obama re-elected."" It's a downer of a speech, but when it's over, students sprint to a microphone to lob questions. Thiel takes them while holding an arm over his face to block out the blinding stage lights. A bunch of the questions are about the possibility of starting competing currencies. Thiel likes one of the concepts he hears--an alternative, gold-backed money produced by a company like Google. ""If you really wanted to create an alternate currency, it would have to be gold-based,"" he says. ""There are enough people who already believe in gold that you could probably get it to the tipping point. Starting completely from scratch is a lot harder to do. I have a lot more thoughts, but I'd say--you probably want to go with gold. Woo-hoo! Another student wants Thiel to answer for something. When he created PayPal, one of the goals was to take financial transactions out of the government's greedy paws. What happened to that? ""What I think is true of the way we negotiate with terrorists is also true of the way companies negotiate with governments,"" says Thiel. WOO! ""Yeah: You never compromise, except in every specific instance. So, when you look at PayPal or Amazon, or Vis, or all these people, the question you have is: Were they doing this because it was a deeply felt ideological thing, that they had to do this? Or was it because the government had its screws on them? There's sort of this liberal/libertarian argument: Companies are bad, and not to be trusted. I tend to think we need to put it against the background of insane regulation."" How insane? ""The average American commits three felonies a day."" Some Ron Paul supporters talk about the election as a choice: salvation or doom. Paul wins, and we survive. Paul loses, and Chinese Communists sell us off for parts. Thiel, who is ostensibly doing more than anyone else to help Paul win, is already looking past the election. It is teaching moment, maybe, that can convince more people to drop out and innovate. He is serious about that. If you want to drop out of college to innovate, he has a scholarship for you. If you want to try to fix the current American system, well, best of luck. ""I'm sort of skeptical of how much voting actually works in the first place,"" says Thiel. ""I used to think that it was really important to directly change the political system, to convince people of things. I still think it's intellectually very important. Occasionally, you get some converts that way. But it's really an inefficient way of doing things. One of the things I like about technology is that when technology's un-regulated you can change the world without getting approval from other people. At its best, it's not subject to democratic control, and not subject to the majority, which I think is often hostile to change."" Thiel has invested in a presidential campaign; he's also invested in a plan to build floating sovereign island nations. This is a donor who likes to plan for the future."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg_is_ready_to_speak_out_on_the_danger_of_super_pacs_.html	"In 18 years on the Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has written more than 200 opinions on a number of important topics, including major opinions on everything from copyright law to abortion rights to employment discrimination. But in the area of campaign finance, she's authored only one inconsequential two-paragraph concurring opinion--in one of the Supreme Court's recent cases striking down parts of the McCain-Feingold law--in which she distanced herself from a more far-reaching dissent of Justice Stevens. She's been a reliable vote to uphold reasonable campaign-finance laws, but this has hardly been her signature issue. Last week, however, Justice Ginsburg issued a short statement that hinted she is ready to speak out more boldly. She, like many Americans, appears concerned with the rise of super PACs and the disturbing role money is playing in the 2012 campaign season since the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Citizens United v. FEC.  Justice Ginsburg likely won't have the votes to overturn Citizens United, but she soon will be in a position to expose the disingenuousness at the ruling's core. As Dahlia Lithwick recently explained, late last year the Montana Supreme Court thumbed its nose at the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. In Citizens United, Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, held that the federal law barring corporations from spending their funds on election ads violated the corporations' First Amendment rights. The Montana court nonetheless upheld a state ban on corporate campaign spending, finding that Montana's history of corruption justified the ban. Everyone expects the Supreme Court to reverse the Montana case, likely on a 5-4 vote. But the big question is how the court will do so. Opponents of the Montana law went for broke before the Supreme Court: In addition to asking the court to put the Montana ruling on hold pending the usual process for seeking Supreme Court review, they asked the court to reverse the Montana court without even hearing any argument. Last Friday, the court agreed to stay the Montana ruling, but the justices did not short-circuit the usual process. The court will accept full briefing on whether or not to hear the case, and then it will decide what to do. Court watcher Tom Goldstein believes a full hearing is fairly likely. Justice Ginsburg agreed that staying the Montana ruling was the right course, because lower courts are bound to apply Supreme Court precedent even if it is wrong; it is for the Supreme Court to fix its own wrong precedents. But then she added these words in a statement for herself and Justice Stephen Breyer with respect to the stay: ""Montana's experience, and experience elsewhere since this Court's decision in Citizens United, ... make it exceedingly difficult to maintain that independent expenditures by corporations 'do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.' A petition [to hear the case] will give the Court an opportunity to consider whether, in light of the huge sums currently deployed to buy candidates' allegiance, Citizens United should continue to hold sway."" In this short statement, Justice Ginsburg quoted from the least defensible part of the Citizens United opinion. As I explained in October, according to the Supreme Court, the only government interests that can justify limits on campaign money against First Amendment challenge are the prevention of corruption or the appearance of corruption.  (This interest is what explains the constitutionality of limits on contributions to candidates.) In Citizens United, Justice Kennedy, writing for the court majority, resolved as matter of fiat what had appeared to be a factual question about independent spending and corruption: ""We now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption."" He further declared that ""[t]he appearance of influence or access [coming from unlimited corporate spending] will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy."" Justice Kennedy presents the issue of corruption and the appearance of corruption as a matter of fact, and the Montana court took Justice Kennedy's on his words and said, ""Ok, let's take a look at the facts"" in Montana. There is a large history of corporate spending corrupting the political process here, so our state's laws are justified. With last week's statement, Justice Ginsburg has signaled that she or one of the other justices opposing the Citizens United case will use the Montana case to expose the fallacy of the Citizens United argument. Although Justice Kennedy indeed stated the issue of corruption and independent spending as one of fact, we know it is a fiction. As former FEC chair and campaign-finance opponent Brad Smith explains: ""In fact, Citizens United's holding that independent expenditures are not 'corrupting' is not a statement of fact, but a statement of law. In this respect, it is similar to contractual doctrines that imply consent where consent is truly a fiction; or criminal doctrines that throw out confessions that were freely given, on the grounds that they were not probative because the accused was not properly 'Mirandized.'"" The explanation reveals a great deal. If a doctor gives emergency CPR to an unconscious person, the doctor cannot be sued later for battery even though the person was touched without consent. Though this principle is sometimes referred to as consent ""implied in law,"" in reality, it is the law excusing the lack of consent. In other words, a fiction. Similarly, the statement in Citizens United that independent spending cannot corrupt or undermine the public's confidence in the electoral process is a fiction which defies common sense. In fact, the greatest danger of super PACs is not that they will influence the outcome of elections, but that contributions to these groups will skew public policy away from the public interest and toward the interest of the new fat cats of campaign finance. The public, too, seems greatly concerned about money this election season. Citizens United is not even consistent with the court's own recent actions. In Caperton v. Massey, Justice Kennedy and the four Citizens United dissenters recognized that a $3 million contribution to an independent group supporting the election of a West Virginia Supreme Court justice required that the justice recuse himself from a case involving the contributor supporting his candidacy. The Caperton Court pointed to the ""disproportionate"" influence of that spending on the race and at least an appearance of impropriety. It is also in tension with the Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold the laws barring independent foreign spending in U.S. elections. If such independent spending really ""does not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption,"" as Justice Kennedy wrote in Citizens United, what's the danger if the Chinese or Iranian government wants to flood tight congressional races with millions of dollars? If the court were being honest in Citizens United, it would have said something like: We don't care whether or not independent spending can or cannot corrupt; the First Amendment trumps this risk of corruption, at least when the spending comes from corporations and not foreigners. But the court didn't say that, because it would have faced even greater criticism than it already has. So it dressed up its value judgment as a factual statement. Justice Ginsburg seems poised to use the Montana case to expose the false premise at the heart of the Citizens United case. If we are lucky, she'll convince one of the justices in the Citizens United majority of the error of his ways. At the very least, she will speak truth to power."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/republicans_and_democrats_are_using_the_contraception_debate_to_make_the_other_side_appear_radical_.html	"The political debate over contraception has allowed members of each political party to entertain fantasies about the private excesses of the other. I'm not talking about sex. We know that this election will be about taxes, the size of government, and America's place in the world. We know there will be energy, education, and defense policy speeches. We see all of that coming in slow steady steps. But what quickens the pace of presidential campaigns and sends it into crazy corners is the secret reveal: the moment where one candidate or party slips and gives us a window into their entire world-view. With the contraception debate, both parties are exposed. For Republicans, the original Obama contraception policy--which required Catholic hospitals to cover their employees who used it--is  an example of what they've been complaining about all along. The White House will pass policies in the dead of night that infringe on your most sacred beliefs. They were caught this time, but there are hundreds of other secret offenses in the works, plots yet to hatch that will trample on our rights as citizens. You don't need to think that Barack Obama is evil to worry about these plots. He thinks he's actually trying to ""help."" As Sen. Scott Brown put it, ""Basically the government is saying, 'Just do what you're told, and leave the moral questions to us.' "" The Democratic mind has even more kindling to fire the imagination. This week House Republicans held a hearing on contraception but invited no women to testify. Foster Freiss, Rick Santorum's key financial backer, joked that women used to prevent pregnancy by putting an aspirin between their knees. Santorum has promised that as president he will use the bully pulpit to speak out against sex for purposes other than procreation. ""One of the things I will talk about that no president has talked about before is ... the dangers of contraception in this country, the whole sexual libertine idea ...[Contraception's] not OK, because it's a license to do things in the sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be."" In response, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray wrote in a fundraising appeal: ""I feel like I woke up this morning on the set of Mad Men. ... Republicans have set their time machine for the 1950s."" Whoever paints the darker fantasy has the political advantage. Ardent supporters already believe the worst about the other side. It's the independent voters who are at stake. They want government to focus on the big things--the economy, education, defense--and not go too far in either direction. In this election, the choice is between President Obama (the overreach you know) and the GOP nominee (the overreach you don't know). If that's the case, it should be good news for Romney, who argues that he will be a better general election candidate than Santorum. Romney is a man of convictions--he's devoted to his wife and his religion. He is also a man of malleable views. The wax gets softer the hotter the politics. An independent voter--who wants to see progress and not ideological fights--can easily imagine that a future President Romney would compromise at the first sign of controversy. That is not true of Rick Santorum. He is far more likely to stick to policies that match his socially conservative views. That is the liberal caricature--but also the fervent belief of Santorum's own supporters. Santorum has risen to the top in large measure because he has been a brave advocate for hot-button issues like contraception. When he was in the House and Senate, he was the point man on social issues, fighting the good fight when other issues grabbed the public spotlight or other politicians were too afraid to step up. He has won some measure of support because he promises not to bend to the New York Times or lose his focus once in office. Santorum's views on social issues are not the sum total of the Santorum campaign. As Dave Weigel points out, Santorum is working hard to show he has appeal beyond the social issues. But he can't downplay his cultural positions too much because that would be just the kind of cowardice traditional politicians engage in when they get in office. It is a tradition of politics that you try to scare up the secret text your opponent reads at night to expose him as a closet radical. That's why Newt Gingrich mentions community organizer Saul Alinsky in nearly every speech. It's what John Kennedy's opponents saw in the Catholic Church, and it's surely the subtext of some of the fascination with Romney's Mormonism. Whether there's a secret revealed in the contraception debate will be apparent in about nine months."

That's because you too can be a Kittitian and Nevisian for the not-so-low price of $250,000. All you have to do is hand over the cash. Why would you want such a thing? Well, for residents of developing countries gaining access to a potential exit strategy in case of political instability is valuable. Some members of the old Egyptian elite, for example, might wish they had a nice island to flee to. For the rest, the islands' lack of income taxation may be all the inducement needed. As for the islands themselves, every bit of export earnings helps, especially since this particular form involves virtually no sacrifice on the part of the native-born. Indeed, the fact that the rather meager benefits the islands offer command such a high price naturally raises the question of whether a country that people actually want to move to--the United States of America, say--should get in on the game. After all, lots of people want to come here. They want to come so badly that we spend more than $5 billion a year trying to keep them out. They want to come so badly that they pay thousands of dollars to coyotes to help them sneak past Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol. Having made the dangerous journey, they then work without proper papers or legal rights. Surely people willing to pay for a dangerous and illegal cross-border trip would be happy to pay somewhat higher amounts for the safety and convenience of a legal work permit. What's more, a program to sell work permits would open us up to a much larger potential market of buyers. Illegal immigration is heavily tilted toward Mexicans for the obvious reason that Mexico is adjacent to the United States. But Mexico is hardly the poorest country on earth. Indeed, once you adjust for cost of living, Mexico turns out to be above average. The really poor parts of Latin America are further south, but it's hard to sneak over here from Guatemala or Peru. To say nothing of India which, despite the hype, is still home to hundreds of millions of people living in soul-crushing poverty. And consider that many medium-skilled residents of middle-income countries around the world--people for whom the illegal immigrant lifestyle lacks all appeal--might still want to come to the United States if there were a legal way to do it. As you may have heard, the outlook for Greece and Portugal doesn't look so hot at the moment. The strict economic logic of the situation calls for Greeks and Portuguese to migrate to more stable northern Eurozone countries like Germany and Finland. But for a whole range of cultural and historical reasons, Houston is probably a more immigrant-friendly location than Helsinki. There's no grand tradition of moving across the ocean to seek the Finnish Dream. How many people might want to come? And how much could we charge them for the privilege? The answer, on both scores, seems to be a lot. Michael Clements from the Center for Global Development points out that the State Department's Fiscal Year 2010 diversity lottery for visas attracted 13.6 million applications for 50,000 visas. And that was a lottery that everyone knows you have very little chance of winning, held during the depths of a massive U.S. recession. In a separate 2008 paper, Clemens along with Claudio Montenegro and Lant Pritchett estimated that ""the wages of a Peruvian worker willing to work in the United States are about 2.6 times as much as the same person would make in Peru,"" a result that's about average for the 42 countries they were able to obtain sufficient data for. There is, however, a great deal of variation--for a typical Haitian the figure is 7 times as much. The slots, in other words, are in high demand because they are both scarce and valuable. Selling them would be a sensible approach. In a 2011 paper for the Institute of Economic Affairs, Gary Becker suggested a flat fee of $50,000 per immigrant. This is a rather steep bill for a low-income worker, but he points out that lending arrangements could be easily arranged to allow a migrant to pay off his fee over a period of years. For logistical reasons, it might be better to organize payments the other way around--have Congress set a number of slots, and then auction them off. This way we could start with the kind of small-scale program people are likely to be more comfortable with and see what happens. Turn the 50,000 diversity slots into an auction (or several separate regionally segmented options) and then decide based on the results whether we want to expand our offerings. My guess is that when the revenue starts flowing in, people will be surprised by how high the bids are and public support for immigration will increase. Revenues could be split between the federal government and whatever local jurisdiction the immigrant moves to. There should be no shortage of people eager to pay for the privilege of working in the United States. Gallup's polling suggests that 700 million people would like to permanently relocate to another country, of which 165 million name the United States as their top choice. Some of the remaining 535 million would doubtless be willing to accept us as a second-best alternative. And more to the point, a very large number of people might want to come and work here for a few years and then return home to re-engage with extended family and take advantage of the lower price level. An influx of workers would displace some Americans from their current jobs, but on net should boost employment as new people will spur demand for homes, clothing, food, transportation, and all the rest. The potential fiscal gains from selling access to the U.S. labor market are not, in my view, even close to being the most important part of the case for more liberal immigration laws. But they might be a good place to start. Americans spend a lot of time feeling besieged these days. It's worth noting that one of the problems weighing heavily on the national conscience--the overwhelming desire of foreigners to come live and work in our country--should be viewed as an asset. If everyone decided America was a terrible place to be, the illegal immigration problem would go away but we'd hardly be better off for it. We, the native born citizens of the United States, are sitting on a gold mine much more valuable than anything St. Kitts has to offer. We ought to put it to use."

Mitt Romney, who says he is ""severely conservative,"" would presumably point at history with a shotgun. The ad-libbed phrase in Romney's speech to CPAC last Friday was new, but the style was familiar. Romney is an assertion candidate rather than a persuasion candidate. He declares something and voters are meant to believe that it is so. If they don't, his instinct is to say it more--he used the phrase ""conservative"" 25 times in that same speech--or with greater emphasis--in this case adding the most extreme antonym to the word weak that can be found in the thesaurus. (Remember when he tried to match Gingrich's Obama-bashing by promising he'd stuff capitalism down Obama's throat? Dreadful.) Anyone who has used a raised voice with a foreigner in the hopes it will make them understand can sympathize. But this hasn't worked with movement conservatives who have consistently been suspicious of Romney. Romney is working hard to connect with this group, but the challenge doesn't end there. Romney's inability to persuade is a threat to his claim that he has the skills to beat Barack Obama. Even if Romney can win the Republican primary, as the smart people in politics assume he still will, he'll have to rely on more than forceful assertion to woo independent voters who are looking for a good reason to cast their votes one way or the other. But until then, Romney will continue to strain to win over conservatives. In the last PEW survey, where he is tied with Santorum among Republicans nationally, he trails among the party base--among Tea Party voters, conservatives, and evangelical voters. In an American Research Group poll, he now trails Santorum in Michigan, one of Romney's strongest states. The conservative complaints are well known. They don't like Romney's support of the individual mandate in the Massachusetts health care plan he championed and his shifting position on abortion. Most of all, conservative antagonists worry that he lacks conviction. No matter what he says now, he'll sell out conservatives in office, so the thinking goes. He can proclaim he is a severe conservative as forcefully as he once did that he was a progressive. To solve this problem Romney has offered another proclamation, saying he has been ""as consistent as human beings can be."" That's a bold claim--and utterly unpersuasive. Romney has tried several ways to remind voters that he is a conservative. He talks about his record in Massachusetts--balanced budgets, a rainy-day fund, and efforts to stop same-sex marriage. ""I wanted to make sure that people remember the real Mitt Romney, not the one being fabricated by my opponents,"" he told the National Review Online about his CPAC speech. He talks about his more than 40 years of marriage and his faith. It's a good case but not a slam dunk. Voters who pick his rivals say they are looking for a man who appeals to the heart. Records or position papers don't matter so much. They're looking for a candidate who reflects their world view, can channel it, and shows that he will be a warrior for that world view in the general election. This is what voters across primary states say about Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. It's hard to accomplish that with assertions. For a while it looked like assertion was all you'd need against Barack Obama. The vote was going to be a referendum on the incumbent. The bad economy meant the voters' judgment would be harsh. Romney was a business guy. He'd show the country his resume and they'd elect him to turn things around the way he had at the Olympics. The only thing that could save Obama would be an improvement in the economy or an opponent who was objectionable. Right now the numbers are moving in Obama's favor. The economy is looking a little healthier. The Dow average is headed for a record and 243,000 jobs were created last month. And Romney's numbers are getting worse with voters who need a little persuading. In the most recent Washington Post poll, independent voters had an increasingly negative view of Romney. A recent recent NBC/WSJ poll found a 20-point increase in unfavorable impressions of Romney among independents. In a PEW poll out today, the damage is just as stark. In November, Romney was beating Obama among independents, 53-41. Now those numbers have reversed. Obama is beating Romney 51-42 among independents. That's a net 19-point swing in a period of heavy GOP-primary activity. How is Romney going to fix his persuasion problem? First, he's going to have to ignore a lot of the advice he's going to get. There's nothing worse than being the candidate everyone is competing to diagnose. There are enough days between now and the next contests on Feb. 28 in Michigan and Arizona that pundits and GOP strategists are going to get a few laps around the patient's bed. The competition to offer fresh cures for the troubles with Romney's candidacy is going to lead people to suggest everything from leeches to dietary changes. Romney's first task will be to resist changing too much: that will only invite more charges of inauthenticity. Still, there is some evidence in Romney's recent past that suggests he can solve this problem. He knows how to connect with voters not when he speaks to them but when he becomes an advocate for them. When he says, ""I love this country, I hope I made that clear. I didn't say that as directly as I'd like to: I love America,"" he is not going to ride that assertion into anyone's heart. It sounds like George H.W. Bush's famous ""Message: I care."" But in Haleaja, Fla. recently, Romney fired up the crowd in the same way Gingrich and Santorum do. Protesters tried to interrupt his speech. Romney shouted to be heard over them. ""We will stand for freedom. We will stand for opportunity,"" he yelled, pointing his finger at the protesters and hollering. ""You can speak as long as you want to. We will not be shouted down by those who would try to change America. We will stand for the America we love."" The crowd, which had tried to out-shout the protesters, went nuts when Romney led their charge. Another example came during the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries when Romney was under fire for his career at Bain and for not releasing his tax returns. For days he gave unsatisfying answers to questions about each. He mumbled. He complained that Newt Gingrich was attacking him the way the Democrats would. It sounded like whining. Finally in Florida Romney found his voice, repeatedly hammering Gingrich for trying to punish him for being successful. The distinction was that he went from being defensive to fighting for a GOP principle. When voters repeated that answer back to me in the following days, what they liked was hearing an idea they already believe in, forcefully put. The distinction for candidates is sometimes simply the difference between saying you hold a position and letting people hear your reasoning for it. When Al Cardenas introduced Romney to the CPAC crowds last Friday, he read from Romney's press release as governor opposing same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. It was an argument about changing the nature of marriage and it was more effective than Romney's assertion minutes later that he had fought same-sex marriage as governor. What Romney said as a presidential candidate wouldn't stick in anyone's mind. What Cardenas said he'd said as governor would. It is a safe assertion that Mitt Romney is never going to out-perform Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich as the embodiment of conservative passion. He doesn't have to. He simply needs to show that he has access to some of that passion, so that voters can focus on his other good qualities like his leadership experience and his lack of Washington ties. Two qualities that he can simply assert."	If Romney Is Going To Win This Election, He'll Need To Do More Than Shout at People	['Romney', 'Obama']	['abortion']

Just 15 minutes or so. Nobody's panicking. Richard Mourdock just refused to take a taxi from Reagan National Airport, and his arrival at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) depends on the whims of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. ""He's cheap!"" says Diane Hubbard, Mourdock's grassroots director. ""This is how he is. It's one of the reasons I work for him."" Mourdock arrives, hauling his own luggage, and hands it off. He's given a binder of his CPAC duties, and his guest speaker badge. ""They were giving me the stink-eye as I walked in without that,"" he says. I point out that the hotel's been prepping for invasions by the Occupy movement; maybe they put him on the watch list. ""Good call,"" he says. ""I have that militancy about me."" No, he doesn't. Mourdock is a fit 60-year-old man, average height, with thick eyebrows hovering over a hawklike nose. He looks a bit like the actor Dan Hedaya--Nick Tortelli, Carla's ex-husband, on Cheers. He's been Indiana's state treasurer since 2006. Since early last year he's been running against Sen. Richard Lugar, first elected in 1976, one of the GOP's last elder statesmen. Mourdock is a favorite with the GOP's most conservative base, having already won the endorsements of the Tea Party Express, Citizens United, and most of the other groups that humiliated incumbent Republicans in 2010. The humiliation often starts at CPAC. This is the conference where right-wing challengers introduce themselves to true believers and unbelieving reporters. Every conservative insurgent--Rick Santorum is just the latest--quotes an old Ronald Reagan speech about the need to distinguish themselves from liberals with ""bold pastels and bright colors."" Reagan said that at a CPAC. What are the bold colors in a race against Lugar? This is a tricky question. His biggest recent sins have been voting for Barack Obama's two Supreme Court nominees, allowing Obama to use his image in some 2008 campaign ads, and serving in Washington too long. He doesn't make a fuss when liberals act out. He doesn't draw contrasts. ""You need to draw contrasts,"" says Mourdock. ""I haven't endorsed, but I think our strongest presidential candidates are Santorum, then Gingrich, then Romney, in that order--because Santorum draws the contrast."" Right now, though, nobody recognizes him. If they do, they give him space. He's completely unbothered by the early-morning crowd of activists as he's guided up an escalator and over to ""Blogger's Row."" Finally, once he gets to the mezzanine, he runs into Josh Gillespie, a blogger for Hoosier Access. ""It's good to see you,"" says Gillespie. ""We'll catch up.""Hoosier Access is one of the conservative sites that has tracked Mourdock's campaign from a perspective of please-please-please-let-this-guy-win. If Mourdock has a good CPAC, he'll meet a bunch of these people, do friendly media, and meet potential donors. On Saturday, at 3 p.m., he'll give a speech to the CPAC ballroom from the stage where now-Sen. Marco Rubio and now-Rep. Allen West introduced themselves to the national press. Until then, it's all about small meetings. ""Last year, the first time I'd come here, I showed up and I hadn't made a formal announcement,"" he says. ""It was great to ask people: If I made the run, would you be able to help? Obviously, I got a lot of encouragement."" Audrey Mullen, the publicist who is showing Mourdock around CPAC, leads him into the blogger's room and scopes out the writers. Larry O'Connor, the editor of [Andrew] Breitbart.tv, wants Mourdock for an interview, but he needs ""five minutes to get my Internet connection up."" Moe Lane, a blogger at RedState, has time right now. Mourdock went to the conservative mega-blog's conference, the RedState Gathering--the one at which Rick Perry announced that he would run for president, neglecting to say that he'd completely blow it. Lane pulls him into the hallway, away from the chatter of bloggers complaining that their damn wireless isn't working, and points his video camera. ""How do you feel about the 2012 elections?"" asks Lane. ""I'm thrilled,"" says Mourdock. ""I'm running against a 36-year incumbent. When we started this race, people thought I was crazy. Our polling data are fantastic."" ""How do you feel about the conservative grass roots?"" ""They are fantastic."" Mourdock does four of these interviews in 20 minutes. He gets roughly the same questions, and gives basically the same answers. How can he win the general election? Well, the Democrat he'd be running against, Rep. Joe Donnelly, spent $1.7 million to barely win in 2010, while Mourdock won 63 percent of the vote in his re-election as state treasurer. He gives the same answers on-camera as he gives in just-talking chats, and slips loose the same secret-sounding nuggets. Psst: His polls have Lugar under 45 percent. Keep this between us. When he gets a breather, Mourdock grabs fresh fruit from the breakfast table and watches Sen. Jim DeMint speak on a closed circuit. ""He's pledged that he wouldn't endorse against incumbents this year,"" says Mourdock, as DeMint rattles off all the senators he helped elect in 2010. No big deal; Mourdock is about to head to Capitol Hill to meet possible congressional supporters. He has a little time to explain why he became a conservative. ""Watching Reagan and just starting to see things revive again--he was making America so proud of who we were,"" he says. ""I started reading a lot, reading Milton Friedman and William Simon, folks like that."" Did he have some eureka moment? ""You know, I think I probably did. I'm a geologist. Odd thing, to be a state treasurer and never have taken a finance or an accounting class. But as a geologist, you learn very quickly that all wealth comes from the earth. What we mine, what we grow, what we harvest. Reading Friedman's stuff made all of that come together."" Nowadays, no Republican politician claims to want his job. Mitt Romney has spun a fantastical tale in which his 1994 race for Senate was a sort of experiment, to test how much he loved the private sector, and his decision to serve one term as governor had nothing to do with the polls showing him losing. Mourdock has his own odd story. He made a career at Standard Oil. He ran for Congress twice, in 1990 and 1992. ""I was ahead,"" he remembers, ""and then George H.W. Bush said 'Read my lips again,' and people would show up at your events and say 'Ugh. A Republican. Not votin' for him.' "" He'll tell these stories, and then explain that he feels ""dread"" when he flies into Washington. ""I look at that Capitol and I ask, why do I want to work there?"" So why did he ever want to work there? ""I think that the first time I went to Washington, I saw those columns and billowing flags, and thought: This is a place where the big problems get solved. That's changed. That's really changed."" The best example of this--one of the reasons some Mourdock fans cite for their fandom--is the auto bailout of 2009. The government's plan saved Chrysler from bankruptcy, but bankruptcy would have meant that pension funds, like Indiana's, would have been paid back. The bailout changed that; Mourdock likes to say that it ""tore up 150 years of bankruptcy law."" He sued, and he didn't win. Every conservative hero needs an origin story. Marco Rubio has the war against the stimulus. Mourdock has the auto bailout. Rubio's story was instant Tea Party fanfiction; Mourdock's story is complicated, a little boring. But the movement's wonks love it. And any contrast can be spun into a Hero's Journey. That's what's happening all over CPAC, among conference-goers who are obsessed over the presidential race. Conservatives need to know two things about candidates:"	Could This Man Be This Year's Conservative Champion?	['Perry', 'Romney', 'Rubio', 'Hill', 'Allen', 'Obama']	[]
27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/why_the_republican_primary_will_not_end_anytime_soon.html	"Political reporters make for lousy gravediggers. Find a primary, pick a day, and I can point you to a story pronouncing the campaign ""over"" or ""almost over"" or over, pending the judgment of a proverbial Fat Lady. Let's make it easy and start last month. On Jan. 10, as Romney was winning New Hampshire, NPR quoted a Republican strategist who counted the margins and pronounced the race ""over."" On Jan. 18, the Los AngelesTimes informed us that South Carolina's primary ""could essentially end"" the Santorum and Gingrich campaigns. Two days later, NBC News told us that a Romney win in the first southern primary would make him ""the de facto nominee."" When Romney lost, we got pre-Florida primary headlines like ""Can Mitt Romney recover from his South Carolina 'disaster?' "" Days later, Howard Kurtz was tap-tapping about the ""distinct possibility"" that the media would ""bury Newt Gingrich for the third time"" in Florida. No one was talking about Rick Santorum until yesterday, when the Wall Street Journal saluted Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri for ""puncturing Mitt Romney's claim to be the unstoppable front-runner."" My old colleague Jack Shafer once praised ""horse race"" coverage of presidential politics. ""Every political reporter I know,"" he wrote, ""yearns to cover a deadlocked presidential convention."" It's true. So why has every single primary spawned dull, topsy-turvy--and ultimately wrong--stories about how it ""Marked the End"" of one candidate or another? Tuesday's caucus-goers have done us a real solid, forcing the media to confront the truth: The Republican race will last until April at the very least. And it's in everybody's interest--Candidates! Voters! Reporters! Whatever David Gergen is!--that it drags on that long or longer. We know the race will last to April thanks to pure, heartless algebra. The 2012 Republican nominee will need to win 1,144 delegates. The number of delegates semi-officially pledged to candidates as I type this out: 161. The number of delegates that will be pledged by the end of Super Tuesday, one month from now: 662. Rick Santorum could take every single delegate away from Mitt Romney (Good luck in Massachusetts!) and be barely halfway to the nomination. It feels slower than the last primary. Because it's much, much slower. A catastrophic and months-long leap-frog competition forced 21 states into 2008 Super Tuesday primaries or caucuses. By Feb. 5, 2008, 1,069 of the GOP's delegates--41 percent of the total--had been chosen. It was a fluke, no one wanted it to happen again, but it turned out like a childhood trauma in reverse. So much fun was had, the ""this can wrap up in a hurry"" concept stuck around. But it can't wrap up in a hurry. In his much-derided Saturday night press conference, as he shot beady stares at reporters and mocked them for their questions, Newt Gingrich explained exactly what his strategy was. ""Our commitment,"" he said, ""is to seek to find a series of victories which by the end of the Texas primary will leave us about at parity with Governor Romney and from that point forward to see if we can't actually win the nomination."" It might seem far-fetched, but it's actually possible. The reverse--Romney somehow scaring everyone out of the race before the South votes--is impossible. Three Southern states vote on Super Tuesday, and three more go during the month of March. Only when Texas votes, on April 3, will so many delegates have been awarded that the also-rans might not be able to catch up. ""We have an Arizona debate and two more debates after that,"" argued Gingrich's sarcasm-loving spokesman R.C. Hammond. ""Twenty percent of the delegates are decided in March. We go from the March contests into the state of Texas where we have the endorsement of--oh, that's right, the governor!"" If this election was always going to drag, why is every primary covered like a championship football game with a public execution at halftime? This is a good question. The knock on political reporting is usually that it reads too much like sports journalism--winner, loser, game change, weather could affect the outcome. Sports reporters don't cover the first two games of a season and declare a Super Bowl winner. (I should say most of them don't.) The political press has been assuming Mitt Romney's money and organization will eventually wrap things up for him, and so any early victories make the wrap-up come faster. This isn't doing Romney any favors. As the Tuesday numbers came in, Politico's embed Reid Epstein pointed out that Romney had done no ""avails""--free-for-all media rap sessions--in Nevada, Minnesota, or Colorado. In general, Romney's done fewer events and more fundraising than his rivals. He spent 19 days in Iowa, much of that right before the caucus. Rick Santorum spent 105 days there, Newt Gingrich spent 64, and Ron Paul spent 47. Admire Romney's vote-per-visit ratio, or compliment his largely gaffe-free early state campaign, but he's been having an easy ride. ""It's good to have guys running against you as foils,"" says Republican strategist Mike Murphy, who's worked for Romney in the past. ""If I were him I wouldn't mind losing a caucus or two to reposition myself for the general election."" Last night, he lost two--Colorado and Minnesota--along with the Missouri primary. He'd won both Colorado and Minnesota in 2008. Oh, sure, the turnout was pathetic. In Minnesota, a state where 2,910,369 votes were cast in the Obama-McCain race, less than 50,000 Republicans showed up for caucuses. But Romney had won more than one-half that number in 2008. He didn't turn out as many people. The campaign confidently says that he didn't bother, because there weren't delegates at stake. I remember the last time a campaign was in that position: 2008, when John McCain's campaign locked away the nomination, leaving Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama free to fight and organize in states Obama ended up winning. State Republican parties could have moved up these primaries. They didn't. Republican voters could have fallen in unconditional love with a candidate. They haven't. No one can bottle this race up. It will drag on as long as the candidates, Foster Friess, Sheldon Adelson, and Peter Thiel want it to drag on. Gravediggers, put down your shovels!"

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/clint_eastwood_s_halftime_in_america_chrysler_ad_was_it_good_for_obama_.html	"Did the first Obama re-election ad run during the Super Bowl? You might have missed it since the president wasn't even mentioned. It was a Chrysler ad, although even that wasn't obvious. Instead, more than 111 million viewers were greeted by that tough-talking American icon Clint Eastwood as he delivered what amounted to a locker room speech to the country. ""It's halftime in America,"" he intoned, as the New York Giants and New England Patriots went in for their midgame break. He heralded the auto industry's revival and said it is a model for a nation poised for a comeback. By the end of the stirring message, pollsters could probably have found a majority of the country ready to elect the city of Detroit president. Since the Motor City is not on the ballot, the president would like you to consider him as a possible substitute. The message of last night's ad closely follows Obama's own re-election pitch--which is maybe why the president's top strategist, David Axelrod, liked it so much. In many speeches, Obama argues that his intervention is what helped revive the ailing American automobile industry. He is also making a larger pitch that America is on a comeback. Mitt Romney and the Republican primary field argue the revival can only begin when he's out of office. Whether President Obama or his eventual Republican opponent wins this argument will determine who wins in November. Whatever the president's official re-election slogan, the unofficial one is ""Bin Laden is dead and GM is alive."" In early 2009, the president agreed to an $85 billion bailout of GM and Chrysler. Both companies have come back to life, though not to their previous greatness. In 2011, Chrysler earned $183 million, compared with a loss of $652 million in 2010. Obama uses the revival of the auto sector to make a larger case for his manufacturing-based economic plan that was at the heart of his State of the Union address (and therefore his re-election campaign). ""The fact that GM is back, shows the kind of turnaround that's possible when it comes to American manufacturing,"" Obama said at a visit last week to the Washington Auto Show, making the same connection Eastwood does in the Chrysler ad. Obama risks overpraising himself, even as he takes pains to credit the workers at the companies. (He also stretches the truth to keep from crediting George W. Bush, who started the bailouts.) But in a battle with Romney, Obama has a strong political case to make. As the car industry was crumbling in 2008, Romney wrote a New York Times op-ed arguing that a federal bailout meant ""you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye."" He preferred a ""managed bankruptcy""--not death, as Obama has suggested. The Obama administration said such an approach would not have worked because capital markets were frozen, which meant there was no money for GM and Chrysler to fund their bankruptcies privately. Four years later, Detroit's revival complicates Romney's central argument that Obama doesn't understand how the economy works. Romney must explain why, despite the seemingly good result, Obama's policies didn't help, or they didn't help as much as other policies could have. It is a different version of the same dilemma Romney faced last Friday when the news that 243,000 jobs had been created in January made it momentarily harder to attack Obama's stewardship of the economy. Most of the time, Romney has a relatively easy argument to make when he suggests that Obama is out of touch with America's hard times. Polls show that nearly 70 percent of the public thinks the country is on the wrong track. Romney can use that fact to slam the president when he makes the faintest positive noises, as the candidate did after the State of the Union, when Obama claimed America was getting healthier. Romney replied by saying that idea belonged in ""Fantasyland"" (He was engaged in the Florida primary at the time, so allusions to Magic Kingdom-styled parks may have seemed apt.) Romney regularly praises America. ""I love America's hymns,"" he says at every stop before reciting some phrases from ""America the Beautiful."" But in Romney's world, America's essential greatness is being blocked by Obama and his policies. We're not at halftime and about to rally. Instead, it's late in the fourth quarter, the team is down by a half dozen touchdowns, and the quarterback is waving to his wife. But, as everyone knows, it's hard to argue with Clint Eastwood. ""This country can't be knocked out with one punch. We get right back up again, and when we do, the world is going to hear the roar of our engines. Ya, it's halftime in America, and our second half is about to begin."" If Clint agrees with Obama--that America is on the edge of a return--how can Obama be wrong? Of course, Chrysler was quick to say the ad was not political. It would be dumb if they'd planned it to be--you need Democrats and  Republicans to buy your cars. But Chrysler doesn't get to decide what's political. By playing on the themes of American greatness during a presidential election year, they're necessarily embracing political themes. The best news for Obama and his campaign team is that the admakers calculated that the country was so receptive to a pitch for a Detroit-like comeback that they made it the central thrust of the ad. The bad news for Obama is that--despite his rhetorical gifts on the campaign trail--he may not be able to rally Americans around this message as effectively as Dirty Harry can. The people who run presidential campaigns tell us that successful candidates need to offer an optimistic vision of the future. For months, President Obama has been trying to find a way to argue that despite the dark times, things are looking up, and Americans can be counted on to rally. That was denounced as laughable by his critics. The notion, they said, was proof of how clueless Obama is. If Obama can tap into the same energy the admakers were trying to access, he will have found the voice he's been stumbling to project. Then, Romney might find himself on the defensive, arguing why he's not betraying a lack of faith in the American spirit. Because, if Clint Eastwood says America is ready to stand up, who is Mitt to say otherwise?"	Clint Eastwood's Pep Talk: Did the American Icon Just Give Obama a Big Boost?	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/mormons_help_romney_win_nevada_.html	"LAS VEGAS--""It's a very scripted process,"" warns Mary Burgar, our caucus captain. ""I apologize in advance if it looks like I'm reading from something. It's because I'm reading from something."" No complaints. There are nine voting Republicans in this classroom decorated with old newspaper covers for the Durango High School journalism class that usually meets here. The instructions for the presidential caucuses are written on a white board, next to the documents Burgar will read aloud. Three tow-haired boys entertain themselves quietly as their mother takes notes. A 10th Republican walks in right after 9 a.m. and joins us at one of those all-in-one desk-chairs that are uncomfortable when you're a teen, unbearable when you've reached middle age. ""How many voters are in our precinct?"" asks Monica Johns, sitting next to her husband, Rick. ""There are 181 voters,"" says Burgar. ""So, we'll need to assign four delegates."" ""One hundred and eighty-one!"" says Monica. ""Why aren't the neighbors here? We should T.P. their house!"" This is only the second time Nevada has held a caucus at the start of the nominating process. It's still learning. The local GOP, spooked about fraud, has set up voter ID stations at two points on the high school's perimeter. Reporters have been issued oversized PRESS badges that theoretically allow them access to the caucus sites. It apparently wasn't enough for Ashley Powers, a Los Angeles Times reporter at a nearby precinct, who was branded a ""spy"" and chased out of the room like some Boris Karloff villain who'd frightened the villagers. But the voters of precinct 6729 are too nice for that. Burgar asks who wants to serve as a state Republican delegate, warning that it means a six-times-a-year meeting and a $40 fee. ""It says it costs more after this date,"" she reads, ""but it doesn't say how much."" Four voters quickly volunteer. All four are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and all of them support Mitt Romney. ""Is that fair?"" asks Monica Johns after she volunteers. ""Should someone who doesn't support Romney get to be a delegate?"" ""I can't,"" says April Withers, the mother of the three distracted boys. She's going to support Ron Paul. ""My husband works in North Dakota. I don't know where I'll be when the convention happens."" It turns out that only the Romney supporters have time to serve as delegates. The caucus meeting continues. Everyone is offered time to argue why a thinking American must support So-and-So for president. Ron Paul's voters go first. ""I was thinking about going for Gingrich,"" explains Al Becker Jr., who keeps his sunglasses on as he talks. ""I was thinking, maybe, Ron Paul's austerity agenda was too harsh for the times. But then I talked to a young person, and he said he supported Paul because we needed to sacrifice now and he was ready to sacrifice. So, Ron Paul. That's all from me."" April Withers balances one of her sons on her knee. ""I feel like Ron Paul's the only one who promises a future for my children,"" she says. ""Being told who's gonna win, or who's the only choice, doesn't influence me,"" says Joseph Gray. ""I'm going to vote for Santorum."" ""He seems to be a godly man,"" says another Santorum supporter. ""I don't think President Obama can be elected dog-catcher anyway,"" says Gray. Four more caucus-goers speak out, all for Romney. ""He's taken jobs and done them well for no pay,"" says Dawson White, a Mormon businessman. ""It might seem funny, but I like the fact that he has so many grandkids. I don't think he can help but care about the future."" Royce Rasmussen, a Mormon who travels to sell cleaning equipment, makes a more fiscal pitch for Romney. ""My costs have increased between 7 and 9 percent, just to be abreast of the rules and regulations to run a business,"" he says. ""I've got a bank meeting in March--I have no idea how to make a forecast for the new year. I'm voting for Romney""--he turns his head to the woman next to him--""and I hope my wife does, too!"" Withers speaks up. She'd detected some people ruling out Paul because of his foreign policy. ""If you look at a pie graph of how many years we've been in wars, it's only a sliver that we haven't,"" she says. ""I just can't imagine him as a president,"" says Monica Johns, apologetically. ""Going in there and negotiating with other leaders--can't really imagine that."" ""I want [Paul] to tutor the other candidates in the Constitution,"" says Rasmussen. ""He could do both,"" says Withers. ""He's going to be remembered as the modern Thomas Jefferson."" She doesn't want to give up on the foreign policy. ""The terrorists aren't just attacking us because they hate our way of life."" ""No,"" says Gray, ""they're angry at us because their God tells them to be!"" Withers isn't going to win. ""You should watch the movie From Freedom to Fascism,"" she suggests. ""Google it; you can watch it on YouTube."" As she wraps up, three stragglers and a kid walk in, sit down, and grab papers to vote with. The balloting takes less than a minute. Romney: nine. Paul: two. Santorum: two. The new arrivals, all Mormons, had voted for the winner. ""Eight of the nine votes for Romney were [Latter-day Saints],"" says Rasmusssen, strolling out to find the delegate table. He thanks the Ron Paul supporters: ""This was a very polite discussion!"" Some of the Mormon couples chat on the way out; we are in a 400-strong Mormon ward in the near western suburbs of Vegas, where the Strip is visible from any third or fourth floor. In 2008, 26 percent of the Republicans who caucused were Mormon. On the way out, as the delegates write $40 checks, it's obvious that the pattern is repeating itself. ""One of the guys in my [caucus] room was named Norm Romney,"" says George Rivers, who, despite a Brigham Young University degree and a Romney ballot, is not Mormon. ""Would you know it? He's Romney's second cousin."" Inside the school, I hadn't been able to get a good cellphone signal. Outside, the signal comes back, and tweets flood in about the 5-1, 7-1, 10-1 margins that Romney is winning in Clark County. If you had looked at the Nevada vote in 2008 and guessed what would happen if Romney and Paul ran again, you would have guessed exactly this: a big Mitt win, a libertarian surge. It's a fluke of the primary schedule, a result of some pre-2008 maneuvering by Sen. Harry Reid to empower his state, and it was always going to empower the Mormon candidate and the ""End the Fed"" guy. On Saturday, in small rooms and friendly conversations, Nevada Republicans were squeaking shut the door on anyone not named Romney."
