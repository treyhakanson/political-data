First, agree with President Obama's most popular national-security decisions (ending the Iraq war, pulling out of Afghanistan by 2014, imposing sanctions on Iran, and sending drones after terrorists) while at the same time hammering repeatedly, though vaguely, on the need to restore American ""strength"" and ""leadership."" Second, spin those Etch-a-Sketch knobs toward the middle with ferocious energy. Hence Romney's emphasis on peace, his pledge of no-more-Iraqs, and his endorsement of a ""comprehensive strategy"" to help the Muslim world build civil societies (while offering no specifics, or even general propositions, on what this strategy would involve). You'd never know that his top foreign-policy advisers are neo-conservative holdovers. On Benghazi, Romney backed off completely, said nothing. Even on Syria, the one issue where he has gone after Obama with some substantive backing, he eased up, saying that he would not support a no-fly zone against Bashar Assad's forces or engage in any sort of U.S. military intervention--leaving open the question of what he would do that Obama hasn't.* Third, veer the discussion to domestic policy, especially the persistently high unemployment rate, at every opportunity. In sum, Gov. Romney seemed in over his head, as he has every time he's spoken out on foreign policy (hence his determination to speak on other things as much as possible), and, perhaps knowing he would be, he adjusted his debate strategy accordingly. And yet, while President Obama came off as thoughtful and decisive by comparison, and made frequent note of Romney's flip-flopping (""you're all over the map"" was a favorite phrase of the night), he, too, engaged in long spells of evasion. The clearest takeaway from the night--nothing new, but still sad--is that it's probably impossible for American politicians to have an honest discussion about foreign policy, especially in an election year. The moderator, Bob Schieffer, asked good probing questions of Obama and Romney: What would you do about Syria? How do we influence Pakistan? How do you pressure China on things like currency manipulation without sparking a trade war? What deal would you accept with Iran in negotiations on its nuclear program? If you regard an attack on Israel as an attack on the United States, wouldn't that policy deter even a nuclear Iran from aggression, as it deterred the Soviet Union for several decades? Both candidates bunted all these pitches, or simply refused to swing. Iran was the subject of deepest dishonesty, especially on Romney's part. First, he said that he would seek to dissuade Iran from building nuclear weapons ""through peaceful and diplomatic means."" Then, not a minute later, he said that he would indict President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for ""inciting genocide"" and turn Iran's diplomats ""into pariahs."" (How do you pursue ""diplomatic means"" without diplomats?) Obama at least had a record to defend on assembling an international coalition to impose truly crippling sanctions on Iran. But he also said the only acceptable deal would be one where the Iranian leaders agreed to ""end their nuclear program."" Presumably this means ending all uranium enrichment. This just isn't going to happen, and Obama surely knows it. First, even Iran's few reform politicians support a nuclear program (though not for nuclear weapons). Second, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--which all the sanctions and U.N. resolutions are said to enforce--allows countries to enrich uranium up to a certain point. If a deal is possible, most experts agree, Iran would have to retain the right to enrich up to 5 or 15 percent. (Weapons-grade uranium is enriched to about 80 percent purity, and once a lab gets to 20 percent, the step to weapons-grade is a short one.) All successful negotiations allow the other side a way out--unless what you really want is regime change. Obama's deal doesn't allow a way out. Does he want regime change? The president also played it loose on Afghanistan, saying that the Afghan security forces will be able to contain the Taliban when we leave in 2014. Maybe they will, but it's far from certain. Obama got a break, though, when Romney agreed with him. Remarkably, Romney unconditionally agreed with the 2014 timetable (after saying, a few weeks ago, that he would withdraw then only if commanders said it was safe), said everything was on schedule, and even praised Obama's troop surge. At least this should prove (hawks everywhere, take note) that there is no mainstream political support for continuing the Afghan war any longer. Romney was most annoying for repeating, over and over, the shibboleths that he must know are false: that Obama began his term with a worldwide ""apology tour"" (he invoked the phrase twice Monday night), that Obama supports a $1 trillion military budget cut that his own defense secretary says would be ""devastating"" (such a cut would be the result of congressional sequestration), that Obama sat silent while the Iranian protesters begged for U.S. support (in fact, most of them didn't want overt support, fearing the mullahs would accuse them of being CIA spies, as indeed they had when Bush's secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, offered them $75 million in aid), and that the U.S. Navy has fewer ships than anytime since 1917. At least Obama had a nice retort ready for that one. ""We also have fewer horses and bayonets,"" he said, adding that the governor ""hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works"" and that, for instance, we now have things like aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines, and other weapons that could blast the navy of a century ago--or (he could have gone on to say) any other country's navy today--to smithereens. But Obama's more telling rebuttal came toward the end of the debate, in response to Romney's complaint that China was walking all over us with its unfair trade practices. Obama responded that his administration has successfully sued China for violating trade rules many times and that, as a result, a major U.S. tire plant no longer has to compete with cheap tires dumped on the market and a steel plant in (ahem) Ohio is now shipping its goods to China. It was one of several reminders, over the course of the evening, that foreign policy isn't really an issue in this election, however much it should be. It is, after all, one of the very few realms where young men and women are sent to kill and die, national survival is potentially at stake, and presidents have the power to do pretty much whatever they want.

Now they're nearly pulling even, with voters trusting Obama over Romney by only five points, 47-43. That's an 11-point drop for Obama since September, most likely due to the consulate attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. Obama and Romney had a sharp exchange of words on that topic during last week's town hall debate, and it's clear that voters are increasingly directing the blame toward Obama. If Romney can continue to depict Obama as weak on international affairs, he may well seize voters' confidence as a future commander in chief. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope.

Tonight's debate--which will focus on foreign policy--is a double superlative: it involves the most important issues which a president has more control over than any other and the political stakes are the highest. Serious political consequences have a tendency to consume intelligent argument, which means the debate could end up feeling like the larger campaign where the fracas has little to do with the actual issues. Think back to the last presidential debate's confusing exchange of blows over Libya. Now imagine 90 minutes of that. The foreign policy debate welcomes platitudes. The president wraps himself in the office and the challenger can paint a fantastical vision of the world without fear of being called out. Romney advisers say that in the first few debates voters warmed to him because it sounded like he had a plan. They didn't know exactly what that plan was, but he sounded confident and that was enough. That voter reaction is especially likely in the foreign policy debate, where the listening audience is going to be making their opinions based on which man sounds like he shares their values, looks comfortable in the commander in chief role, and seems to be telling the truth. Those qualities may or may not have anything to do with the specific questions asked of the candidates. The debate takes place at a dead even political moment. According to the Real Clear Politics' average of the polls, it's tied. A new CBS national poll has the race tied. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC poll has it knotted at 47. If this is the case, both men have something to lose and something to gain--if they are willing to reach for it. This is their last big chance to change the dynamic in those key battleground states with a single shot. How the campaigns read the polls may determine their strategy. The Romney campaign would like us to ignore every poll but the Gallup daily tracking poll in which Romney is ahead by 7 points. If that's what they really believe, then we'd expect a different Romney than the one who seized on the president's remarks about Libya in the last debate. Anxious to score points, Romney lost his way by focusing so precisely on the president's words. If he's really got a solid 7-point buffer, he merely needs to look presidential, make his case for a world of clarity, and commit no unforced errors. Why should he risk the race by pressing his foreign-policy case too forcefully? He might look intemperate, and even in the best circumstances what he stands to pick up might not be that great. Voters care more about the economy, and foreign policy is typically the incumbent's turf. In that reading of the polls, all Romney has to do is make sure his tie is straight and that he does nothing to accidentally scare swing state voters. How does Obama's team see this third encounter? The president battled back in the second debate, but not enough to make up all the ground he lost in their first meeting. The Pew poll shows that the president's foreign policy advantage has dropped, along with his poll numbers. A month ago Obama led Romney by 15 points on foreign policy, now he only leads by 4. That may very well be the result of Romney's overall surge--people are seeing him in a more favorable light so they see him more favorably across all questions. Whenever both men drill down on a topic and seem particularly passionate, think about the voters in battleground states. So if the scuffle is over Libya, think about trust and suburban women. Romney wants you to think that the president isn't being honest with you about the chain of events. Obama wants you to think that Romney is so politically craven that he won't be a good steward of the office. He's driven by politics, not a core set of values. When you hear about China, think about Ohio blue collar workers. When you hear talk about defense spending, think about Virginia; the state is the No. 1 recipient of federal defense dollars. In the key swing district of Hampton Roads, 45 percent of the economy is tied to the military. If the candidates are using foreign policy as a proxy to appeal to battleground-state voters, it means the substance is going to be a good distance from reality. Every president faces a foreign-policy crisis pretty early into his administration. When he does, he must adapt his thinking to conditions as he finds them, rather than to conditions he pretended existed when he was campaigning. John F. Kennedy campaigned against the ""missile gap"" with the Soviet Union. Then he got into office and found out the United States had more ICBMs than the Soviets. Promises made in these debates are quickly undone in office. Bill Clinton was going to get tough on China, but then handed Beijing most-favored nation status. George W. Bush was going to have a humble foreign policy and eschew nation building, right before he invaded Iraq and tried to build a new nation-state there. Barack Obama has his own surprises. He learned that a covert cyber-war was underway with Iran. He learned that having plans for Afghanistan was far different than getting a reluctant Pentagon to implement those plans. And he learned that the world is a messy place. When he came to office, Obama's advisers articulated an especially rosy view of the world. Problems could be solved simply by having the president arrive in some foreign capital to address the people. After Obama's 2009 ""Cairo speech,"" in which he outlined his view for relations with the Muslim world, his then-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel heralded it as ""one of the most significant foreign policy speeches,"" saying the president ""did 20 years' worth of work ... for advancing America's interests ... We are no longer the issue in that region of the world.""  Well, it's 2012 now and the United States is still the issue in that part of the world. After all, it's American embassies--not European embassies--that are being attacked. Not only does a president's national security view change once in office, but much of foreign policy-making is shrouded from the public that it's hard to know what to zero in on. If we really wanted to get to the heart of how these two men will lead, we'd ask them more questions about the attributes required to handle these issues, instead of asking them to repeat well-worn talking points. We'd ask them about what crisis they've been through and how it tested them, how they assimilate information, who'd they pick to be on their staff, and how quickly they adapt. Any moderator who asked those questions would be criticized as too airy, but they're the questions you'd ask if you think about what a president actually has to do in office. The New York Times reports that the United States is contemplating new talks with the Iranians over their nuclear program. This is likely to prompt a talk about talk. Gov. Romney will charge that the president is naive about the possibility of working with Iran. But the reality is that the president has not relied on talk alone. Obama has overseen a large-scale cyber-war against the country and has worked steadily with U.S. allies to squeeze the Iranian economy through sanctions. This is, by far, the most important immediate foreign policy question: Which man do you want to manage the delicate mess? On the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile showdown, we know that avoiding war requires patience, the willingness to deal with and sometimes ignore your advisers who come with biases of their own. The skirmishing about Libya will be more about trust than the troubled country itself. Is the president trying to hide something? Romney fixated on his language during the last debate, over-eager to catch him in a fib. Though Romney focused on the wrong phrase--Obama had said ""war on terror""--it was clear from the president was trying to dodge something. The voter asked Obama a direct question: Who was responsible for not providing security at the consulate? The president never answered, choosing instead to shame Romney for suggestion that he was acting politically. He better come with a better answer Monday night. Romney, for his part, has been so eager to criticize the president on Libya he has overshot his critique twice. At one point in the second encounter, he seemed to claim that the president's fundraising trip to Nevada somehow hampered the questioning of witnesses on the ground in Benghazi, as if the president were the one there holding the pen and notepad. He better come with a more credible line of attack. The debate over China will round out the list of the most likely foreign policy flash points. There are so many reasons that China should be an important issue, but the one that will matter most can be found in the key swing state of Ohio. Obama's ground generals in Ohio want him to talk about China because blue collar voters can be moved if one candidate can be blamed for helping China steal American jobs. Obama hit this hard in the last debate: ""When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Gov. Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China and is currently investing in countries--in--in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks. That's--governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China."" Romney's retort is that he will name China as a currency manipulator on the first day he's in office. (Of course, even Romney's surrogate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says that posture will start a trade war with Beijing, which will complicate all his other days in office.) But more to the point: Are voters in Ohio moved by the currency manipulation line? When Romney frames it as making sure China will play by the rules, he seems to be gaining some traction. In the Pew poll, Romney holds a 9-point lead over Obama on dealing with China's trade policies (49 percent to 40 percent). Among independent voters, Romney holds a 16-point advantage (50 percent to 34 percent). For 90 minutes Monday night, the candidates will tour the world. It might get confusing. They're going to cover a lot of time zones. After tonight, they're going to turn the telescope around and forget the rest of the world. They'll even forget 41 states in their own country in favor of the battleground states. Eventually, they might even make the whole contest about one state: Ohio. As Ohio goes, so goes the nation and the world."	In the Final Debate, Obama and Romney Have a Clear Line of Attack

It appears to be working: In Pennsylvania, women prefer Obama to Romney 57 percent to 39 percent, and Obama leads among women nation-wide by about 8.5 percent. That's no surprise, since women in swing states rank gender-related issues as their top priorities in choosing a candidate. Romney hasn't been underperforming among women--he ranks about even with previous Republican presidential candidates--but his latest comment, combined with his murky record on women's issues, has hurt his ability to close the political gender gap.

The campaign office is already almost full of people who want to meet their candidate for U.S. Senate. Thirty-odd student volunteers, most of them from the University of Wisconsin, sit in chairs and against the walls, decorated by handmade charts that show how many doors they've knocked on, by 8 x 11 print-outs of Joe Biden quotes, by a whiteboard decorated with the Obama ""O"" logo and an inspirational message. SMILE! You work for the President + Tammy! Baldwin has represented this college town in Congress for 14 years, coming there from the state Assembly, coming to the Assembly from the Dane County Board of Supervisors. The locals swear that Baldwin has a photographic memory for voters. I introduce myself. ""We met in the student organizing center during the Capitol protests!"" she says. ""I remember it vividly."" She's right. I'm inclined to believe the locals. It's three weeks before the election and Baldwin's narrowly winning a race she was supposed to lose. The Wisconsin seat is being vacated by Democrat Herb Kohl, an elfin retail-store tycoon who funded his own campaigns with the slogan ""Nobody's Senator but Yours."" (Republicans liked to shorten that to ""Nobody's Senator."") The Republican candidate is Tommy Thompson, who won his first election in 1966, and won a fourth and final term as governor in 1998 by a 21-point landslide before becoming George W. Bush's secretary of Health and Human Services. Six months ago, most projections of a GOP Senate takeover assumed that Thompson would defeat the liberal congresswoman from Madison. ""It's a closer race than I would have hoped for,"" says Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican who beat Russ Feingold in the 2010 wave. ""The polls show Tammy Baldwin ahead, and I don't think anybody was expecting that."" Thompson is 70 years old and looks it, and has adapted to the YouTube/Twitter era of campaigns with all the grace of Bobby Knight after a foul call. Baldwin is a natural. She's also a lesbian. And nobody in Wisconsin thinks that's hurt her. Scott Walker's state may elect the first openly gay senator in American history, and it's a total nonissue. It might even be helping Baldwin. In my long weekend canvass of Wisconsin, I utterly failed to find any voters who factored Baldwin's sexual preference into their votes. In a state that gave a 59 percent ""yes"" vote to a 2006 gay marriage ban, there's no palpable backlash against a well-known gay candidate. ""I don't think the people of Wisconsin discriminate against anybody, but I think we also hold the traditional view that marriage is between a man and a woman,"" says Johnson. ""I don't find that contradictory at all. I'd favor civil unions. I have no problem with that."" At a rally with Joe Biden in La Crosse, retirees Howard and Bernita Sheehan sounded surprised that anybody might ask the question. ""It doesn't come up anymore,"" said Bernita. ""People have gotten to know gay people. And we have Ellen Degeneres on TV. We have Rachel Maddow."" Howard felt the same way. He, too, had probably softened his views on gays and gay rights as he got older. ""Personally, I don't care for that gay marriage,"" he said. ""But that being said, why should I force my viewpoints on other people?"" Democrats, generally, were happy to answer the question but wondered why it was being asked. Republicans simply didn't know why it might matter. ""The person she's hoping to replace is also of the same persuasion,"" says Joyce Smith, a Thompson voter and volunteer in Racine. ""I don't think that matters."" Although it has often been rumored, Sen. Kohl has never claimed to be gay. He even voted for the Defense of Marriage Act. Baldwin's been out for her entire political career. In 1998, the year Baldwin won her House seat, the openly gay Marc Pocan ran for her Assembly seat. At the time, a Republican candidate for Assembly cut a radio ad attacking another Democrat for being endorsed by Pocan--warning that ""gays from Madison"" would be ""knocking on the doors"" of upstanding citizens. Those ads don't get made here anymore. Today, Pocan is running for Baldwin's House seat and winning it easily. (The redistricted WI-02 gave 69 percent of the vote to Obama-Biden in 2008.) It will probably become the first seat to be represented by two gay members in a row. Between the election and his swearing in, Pocan will celebrate his sixth wedding anniversary. We meet up at Fair Trade Coffee, near the local Obama for America/Baldwin campaign office. ""Fourteen years ago, when I ran for office, if there was an article about me someone would write 'dead faggot' across my face and send it to my home,"" says Pocan. ""Things like that. People like Ralph Ovadal--he's this guy who runs a church out of an old machine shed building--would come over and leaflet my home. And now it's almost a nonissue. I was in Lafayette County the other day. You can't buy a pair of pants in Lafayette County. There are no street lights. And I went to go speak to a group in Lafayette County, the Democrats down there, and I saw a woman with a PFLAG sticker."" It's more than a nonissue. There's no upside for the Republicans who talk about it. In early September, Thompson's political director sent out an email with video of Baldwin dancing at a gay pride parade. ""Clearly, there is no one better positioned to talk 'heartland values' than Tammy,"" he wrote. Thompson promised to demote him. It's not clear whether or not he actually did. Just as importantly, though, the Baldwin campaign blew off the story, letting Thompson get sucked into a media shame cycle. ""This is the time of year we usually start seeing people getting hit with anonymous fliers and smears in the mail,"" says Denis Dison, a spokesman for the Victory Fund, who promotes gay candidates. Baldwin, in her first Assembly race, was one of the first endorsees; the PAC has given $16,400 to her Senate campaign. ""This year has been remarkable for the absence of that."" After President Obama finally admitted the obvious and announced his support for gay marriage, Democrats waited for the downside. It didn't come. There was no notable dip in the president's polling. There was, however, a spike in donations from gays who were holding out until the president ""evolved."" This year, as in all of her re-elect years, Baldwin has collected checks from donors who see her as a rising gay star. The congresswoman's 2000 opponent even ran ads that portrayed a woman, meant to look like Baldwin, hoarding money bags labeled ""New York City"" and ""West Hollywood."" That would be hard to play in 2012, when millions of dollars worth of ads from outside groups like American Crossroads and the Emergency Committee for Israel are keeping Thompson in the game. And why even go there? ""One of the most positive transformations in American politics is that a candidate's sexual orientation is no longer the issue it may have once been,"" says the Human Rights Campaign's Michael Cole-Schwartz. ""Tammy's not pigeonholed as a gay candidate because her message is so much broader, and you haven't really seen efforts to marginalize her."" In Madison, among the students, I hear the first subtle references to Baldwin's sexual preference. A warm-up speaker says that electing her to the Senate will ""make history."" Laura Gladstone, a grad student who's signed up for extra canvassing, says it's ""super exciting"" to have a hand in, possibly, electing the first gay senator. ""I was with Russ Feingold about two or three weeks ago,"" says Baldwin. ""We were having a fundraiser for me in Milwaukee. And everyone was acting a little cautious. So Russ got up and said: 'Have you guys forgotten what it feels like to be winning? We're winning here!' Everybody started squaring their shoulders and puffing out their chests. I've stolen that line. I think people can taste this one."""	How Wisconsin Came To Embrace Gay Politicians

To hear the press tell it, the gloves came off on Tuesday night as President Barack Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney sparred, jabbed, and swung their way through a fiery second presidential debate. But for all the swirling dust, many outlets seem hesitant to declare a winner. Not so the latest Slate/SurveyMonkey poll. We posted our questions as soon as the Hofstra University stage went dark and collected (surprisingly decisive) responses until 9:00= a.m. EST on Wednesday. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Scroll down for a window into what the electorate is thinking just six days before the bell rings for the final round. While President Obama received lackluster reviews for his performance during debate No. 1, viewers saw a changed man on Tuesday--tough, spirited, and willing to chase down his opponent's evasions. (Thanks to the looser town hall format, both men also did some literal stalking of each other around the perimeter of the debate floor). When we asked, ""Who do you think won the debate, Mitt Romney or Barack Obama?"" Nearly 57 percent of respondents chose Obama. Only 18.9 percent named Romney the victor, 12.2 percent thought it was a tie, and another 12.2 percent were unsure. Next, we invited survey takers to rank each candidate on a scale of persuasiveness. Again, a large gap opened up between the two candidates. ""How effective do you think Mitt Romney was in last night's debate?"" we asked. The largest plurality, 33.1 percent, damned the governor with faint praise, calling him ""moderately effective."" Meanwhile, a combined 28.7 percent pronounced him either ""extremely"" or ""very"" effective, while 38.2 percent saw his performance as either ""slightly"" or ""not at all"" effective. Democrats should enjoy comparing those numbers to Obama's tally. Almost 40 percent of respondents found the incumbent ""very effective."" Another 20.9 percent said he was ""extremely effective,"" 25.8 percent called him ""somewhat effective,"" and only 14.4 percent judged him to be either ""slightly"" or ""not at all"" effective. Unsurprisingly, survey takers also observed a steep learning curve for Obama as a debater. When we asked whether the president acquitted himself better or worse in Long Island than in Denver, 52.7 percent replied, ""Much better."" (Another 35.8 percent said ""slightly better,"" and a sliver chose the remaining options, ""neither better nor worse,"" ""slightly worse,"" or ""much worse."") According to 39.8 percent of respondents, however, Romney was neither better nor worse than in the first debate--despite sinking a bit in the rhetorical quicksand during the Libya exchange. About 45 percent were less forgiving: They responded that the governor fought less skillfully last night than he did during the first scuffle. Again, expectations may matter a lot. More than 63 percent of survey takers said that the president exceeded their expectations on Tuesday, while only 24.9 percent could say the same for Romney. Most people--50.7 percent--attested that Romney performed exactly as they anticipated he would. Yet that most elusive demographic--undecided voters--remained largely untouched by either candidate's rhetoric. When we filtered our results to focus on respondents who had not made up their minds, we saw that Obama failed to gain much ground. Only 6 percent said the second debate had persuaded them to vote for the president.

The president had reason to be energized: On Tuesday the Supreme Court allowed early voting to continue in Ohio and rejected plans by the state's Republican legislature to cancel voting the weekend before the election. In 2008, about 100,000 Ohioans voted over the pre-election weekend, and early voters tend to skew heavily Democratic. This year, at least two of the state's most heavily Democratic counties are already turning out in force, giving Obama an early advantage in a critical state. If he can use his debate comeback to maintain this level of energy among the base, Obama may have Ohio in the bag before Election Day even arrives. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope.

""The fact that we have hostages in Iran, I mean, that was all we talked about,"" said Romney. ""And we had the two helicopters crash in the desert, I mean that's--that was--that was the focus, and so him solving that made all the difference in the world."" What sort of foreign policy crisis might break out in 2012? Whatever it was, ""if something of that nature presents itself, I will work to find a way to take advantage of the opportunity."" Romney got that opportunity on Sept. 11. Islamic militants attacked the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. It was, as Republicans would quickly point out, the first murder of an ambassador since the Carter years. The Romney campaign bobbled its first response, putting out a statement that claimed the administration ""sympathized"" with the attackers--the American embassy in Egypt had condemned a remarkably dumb video satire of Mohammed, which protesters in that country cited as their pretext. But in the weeks since, Romney and Republicans and the conservative media got more facts. Reporters revealed that the Benghazi consulate had asked for more security, that Stevens himself had said this on the day he died. The president's surrogates held back on calling the attack ""terrorism."" The story became ""Benghazi-gate,"" a tale of cover-ups and--in a phrase mimeographed by Romney spokesflacks like Dan Senor--""the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy."" And then it came up in a debate--and Romney whiffed. Kerry Ladka, one of the undecided voters chosen for the town hall forum, said that his ""brain trust"" had come up with a question: ""Who was it that denied enhanced security and why?"" The president gave a pat answer that Republicans were ready for him to give: He had immediately scrambled to investigate the attack, and ""we are going to find out who did this, and we are going to hunt them down."" Romney rose and ambled slowly toward an answer. ""I--I think the president just said correctly that--that the buck does stop at his desk,"" he said, ""and--and he takes responsibility for--for that--for that--the failure in providing those security resources, and those terrible things may well happen from time to time."" He didn't point out, as he could have, that the commander-in-chief had just dodged Ladka's question. He said that Obama's decision to proceed with a Sept. 12 fundraiser had ""symbolic significance, and perhaps even material significance."" Obama was ready for this, too. ""The day after the attack, Governor, I stood in the Rose Garden, and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror."" Romney saw an opening to embarrass the president. He homed in on him. ""You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror,"" he said. ""It was not a spontaneous demonstration."" Obama and Romney coolly exchanged fire over whether the statement was true, whether Obama had said this in the Rose Garden. It wouldn't be hard to check, really. But moderator Candy Crowley threw the flag. ""He did call it an act of terror,"" she said. Romney was ready to debate Libya, but not to debate, with a moderator, the wording of one sentence on Sept. 12. The exchange, as most viewers would see it, was lost. Republicans were dumbfounded. When the debate ended, I found Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who was standing mostly alone in the spin room. His House Oversight and Government Reform committee had been demanding Libya documents, publishing what it got from whistle-blowers, and bringing diplomats in to testify about the administration's failure. He held a copy of a Sept. 18 press conference transcript, in which Jay Carney failed to call the Benghazi killings ""terrorism."" He'd marked it up in blue pen during the debate. ""For the president to suggest that he was talking about a terrorist attack in Benghazi is totally off base,"" said Chaffetz. ""He was talking about terror in general, not terror specific to Benghazi."" Republican are right in this sense: The words ""terrorist attack"" didn't appear in the Rose Garden remarks. They're wrong in this sense: Obama referred to ""an attack on our diplomatic post,"" then promised that ""no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation."" It was unspecific, it was flowery, and it was forgotten. And that was the administration's problem. The subsequent cannonades of questions and documents and witnesses and punditry and timelines had formed into a glowing radioactive gruel, ""Benghazi-gate,"" in which the administration was simply hapless and ignorant and unable to say that terrorism exists. ""The fact of the matter is that I think he used the word TERROR,"" said former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge. ""The fact of the matter is seven days later, on David Letterman, he was still attributing it to a spontaneous reaction to that ugly movie. Oh, by the way--check out his speech to the United Nations! That's not on David Letterman, that's not in the Rose Garden, that's the international community. He talked about it being a spontaneous reaction to a movie."" Again, this is almost right. At the United Nations, the president said, in a banal sort of way, that ""there is no video that justifies an attack on an embassy."" But in the days after Sept. 11, there were more throngs outside embassies, using the video as a pretext. The Benghazi outpost was a consulate, not an embassy, and its attackers had, indeed, mentioned the video as a justification for the murder. At another point in the U.N. speech, the president said that ""the attacks on the civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America."" But Obama didn't say ""terrorism."" That was the nucleus of the Obama's-weak-on-terror case--the president has struck words and phrases like ""Jihadism"" and ""terrorism"" and ""global war on terror"" from the lexicon, proof that he doesn't take this stuff seriously. The Benghazi muddle had been the perfect vehicle for that argument. And now, there was a risk that voters would see the Sept. 12 Obama statement again and wonder whether the confusing post-attack reporters were all that contradictory. Republicans tried to pre-empt this by re-litigating ""acts of terror."" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus arrived in the spin room, conferred with Chaffetz and his marked-up paper, and insisted that Obama had been bailed out unfairly by Crowley. ""He didn't call it a terrorist attack in the Rose Garden,"" said Priebus. ""He didn't call it a terrorist attack in the Rose Garden. We've got the transcript of when Jay Carney, the president, time and again referred to this as a spontaneous attack."" There were six days left before the foreign policy debate, and this would haunt Obama. ""If you point-blank lie to the American people on something that's already a headache for you, it's not going to get any better."" They think the terror/terrorism difference--which Crowley admitted in post-debate interviews--is stark enough to make the headache worse. But it's hard to re-muddle something once it's been cleared up."	How Did Romney Blow His Chance To Attack Obama on Libya?

Gallup calculates the index based on how Americans rate current economic conditions and how many Americans say the economy is getting better. Of course, Democrats are the most optimistic and Republicans are the least, but independents have reported growing confidence over the past several weeks. Obama's latest ad push has capitalized on this trend. Three weeks from Election Day, it may be a well-timed boost. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.	Why Today Was a Good Day for Barack Obama
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/presidential_election_debate_barack_obama_is_taking_a_big_gamble_with_voters.html	"Is President Obama running on the economy rather than running away from it? For months, the Obama campaign never let more than a second elapse between a boast about the economy's progress and a declaration that they understood more work needed to be done. They didn't want anyone to think for a moment that they didn't know people were still hurting. The president and his team didn't want to look out of touch. They knew that no matter what the numbers might say, people were not feeling better. Now though, it appears there may be a subtle shift. With just three weeks before Election Day, the Obama campaign is making a bet that people are feeling better about the economy. In a new Obama ad released Monday, voters talk about the improved economy--a plant that added another shift, a store parking lot filled with customers. At the end, a guy with a buzz cut says, ""Stick with this guy."" Remember how much trouble the president got himself into for saying, ""The private sector is doing fine""? The Obama campaign still isn't saying that. The economy is nothing to be boastful about. But Obama strategists are taking a gamble that people are optimistic enough about the future that they might not want to blow it by changing presidents. Heading into the second debate, President Obama must pay careful attention to Mitt Romney. He must fact-check him, point out the fuzzy math behind his bold claims, and paint him as a stealth conservative. He's got to stop his gains with women voters. But the president's primary goal is still selling himself. He needs to offer voters some reason to stay with him. For months the Obama campaign has been trying to disqualify Mitt Romney. It worked through the spring and summer. More people had an unfavorable than favorable view of the Republican nominee. Now that ground has been lost. Voters have essentially the same slightly favorable view of both men. That puts Romney in a strong position with swing voters who supported Obama in 2008 but are ready to leave him. The Romney campaign has always been gunning for this group, knowing they could be swayed up until the end of the race. The president can't just frighten those voters back into the fold; he's got to make the case for why they should ""stick with this guy."" ""We're on a roll,"" says one Obama senior adviser, encapsulating the message. ""We're in the middle of a huge recovery,"" said Michelle Obama recently. It's risky. The Obama team can't spin people into thinking that the economy is getting better. At this late hour, people either feel it or they don't. If the Obama campaign is making the wrong bet, the argument for four more years will fall on deaf ears. What gives the Obama team some encouragement is not only that the unemployment rate is below 8 percent but that polling suggests people are slightly more optimistic. A Washington Post poll today showed 42 percent say the country is on the right track. That's the highest percentage in three years. It's hardly ""Happy Days Are Here Again."" But then again, George Bush was re-elected with the same level of tepid optimism. In the first debate, Romney dunked on Obama repeatedly and the president didn't do much to stop him. Obama didn't play much offense either. The president doesn't have an easily digestible five-point plan voters can look at to give them a peek at what the future will hold. But by arguing that the positions he took in the past are paying off, he can talk with passion about what he has accomplished, which solves one of his biggest problems from the first debate. When he talks about the fights he has already won, Obama has a chance to show voters that he'll be that passionate in the future, too. The town hall format will be unpredictable for both candidates. Both are trying to do two things: criticize their opponent while not appearing so aggressive that they turn off voters. That would be difficult in any debate--it's one of the many things Romney did well in the first contest--but in this case both candidates will be trying to get the balance right in response to a question from a voter in the audience. The more the candidate talks about his opponent's flaws the more he can be accused of not answering the voter's question. It's one thing to ignore a moderator, but when it's a voter, who can be a stand-in for the electorate, it's more perilous--especially when that voter displays his or her displeasure for all of America to see. Who has an advantage in the town hall setting? Neither candidate is particularly good at emoting in one-on-one conversations. Obama once made fun of Romney for responding to an Iowa woman's worries about her personal economic situation by talking about productivity, but the president is no smooth talker either. He once responded to a voter's question with a 2,500-word ramble that took 17 minutes. The town hall format is not all peril though. Each candidate has a chance to use the voters to make their bigger case. Mitt Romney, for example, could pivot off a weak Obama answer by looking a voter in the eye and explaining how specifically he would offer a different approach. President Obama has an opportunity to make something of Romney's lack of specificity by turning to a voter and (respectfully!) pointing out that Romney was trying to fool her. Any time a woman asks a question, move to the edge of your seat. Romney campaign polling after the first debate showed that he helped himself with women by talking about bipartisanship and his record of working with Democrats in Massachusetts. A new Gallup poll of battleground states shows Romney pulling even with Obama among women. The Obama campaign argues that Gallup doesn't measure likely voters properly. Could be. But Gallup would have to be really wrong for this finding not to be considered a bad sign with an important group Obama needs to do well with women in order to balance out Romney's advantage with male voters. We'll see what they really believe though when the president addresses issues that women care about or in how he frames economic questions. Female voters have been a constant preoccupation of the Obama campaign. In the first debate, Obama talked at length about his grandmother, herself an early working woman, to make the case for protecting Social Security and Medicare. Both Obama and Romney have a history of doing well when they are in a tight spot. Romney showed it in Round One. Now Obama has his chance. His back is against the wall. If he doesn't step up, he may be leaning against the exit door. Watch the latest episode of Political Kombat, pitting Joe Biden against Paul Ryan: Also in Slate, Kerry Howley writes that ""' debate' is probably too elevated a word for what we'll be seeing tonight,"" and David Weigel revisits the 2008 town hall debate between Obama and John McCain. Here are reasons for both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to be optimistic."	Why Obama Is Taking a Big Gamble Three Weeks Before Election Day
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/if_the_supreme_court_cuts_early_voting_in_ohio_it_could_swing_the_state.html	"Update, Oct. 16, 2:45 p.m.: Without any noted dissent, the Supreme Court has rejected Ohio's application for an emergency stay--thus ensuring that the three days of early voting on the weekend before Election Day, taken away by the Ohio Legislature but restored by a federal district court and affirmed by the 6th Circuit, will go forward. What explains the court's ruling, especially given the shaky constitutional reasoning I describe below?

 First, it is always a high burden to get emergency relief from the court. The justices may not have believed that any legal error here was worth correcting. What was at issue--whether 100,000 people voted on those days or chose another day (or cast an absentee ballot)--was perhaps not worth gearing up the machinery for a potentially difficult constitutional issue. More to the point, the court's conservatives, who would be most likely to disagree with the lower courts' reasoning, may have decided that there was not enough at stake about those last three days of early voting for the court to issue an opinion divided on ideological lines about voting in a state which could well be pivotal in the presidential election. A divided ruling would have thrust the court to the center of the election. The original Oct. 15 article is below: The Supreme Court will soon decide whether to reverse a federal court ruling requiring the state of Ohio to let its counties decide whether to permit early voting during the weekend before Election Day. With the presidential race tight in Ohio, and the presidency potentially turning on the state's electoral votes, the court's decision could help determine who will win the White House. While the Obama campaign has a strong policy argument for the extension of early voting to include this final weekend, its constitutional claim is a major stretch. In 2008, more than 100,000 voters--many poor, women, less educated, and minorities--cast ballots in Ohio during the weekend before Election Day. Voting in Ohio in 2008 was a great success compared with 2004, when long lines, especially in urban areas such as Cleveland, were common and discouraged people from voting. Early voting relieved the stress of Election Day. But the Ohio legislature, dominated by Republicans, cut back on the last weekend of early voting for 2012. Florida's Republican legislature did the same thing, likely out of a belief that this late period of early voting helps Democrats. Especially helpful to Democrats were ""Souls to the Polls"" programs to bus African-American churchgoers from Sunday services to vote. Indeed, Doug Preisse, chair of the Franklin County Republican Party and elections board member who voted against weekend hours for early voting, explained his reasoning in an email to the Columbus Dispatch. ""I guess I really actually feel we shouldn't contort the voting process to accommodate the urban--read African-American--voter-turnout machine. ... Let's be fair and reasonable."" When Ohio trimmed the time for early voting, it did so through a complicated set of legislative maneuvers that left only military and other overseas voters with the right to vote on that last weekend. This different treatment provided an opening for the Obama campaign to challenge the cutback: Why should the state take away the right to vote on this last day of voting for everyone except for military and overseas voters? The campaign claimed a violation of the constitutional guarantee of ""equal protection"" under the laws and said the state needed to restore the last weekend of early voting for all voters. In making the claim, the campaign has relied upon language from the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, which ended the disputed 2000 presidential election campaign: ""Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over that of another."" The Supreme Court in Bush held that equal protection was violated through Florida's different and shifting standards for counting disputed ballots. Still, the Obama campaign's legal claim in the Ohio case is bold, and it seems to go further than the courts have typically gone before. The Supreme Court long ago held that it did not violate equal protection to offer absentee ballots to some voters but not others. The court usually applies a flexible balancing test to judge challenges to regular election laws: Only severe burdens on the right to vote get strict scrutiny, while lesser burdens don't require a great justification by the state. And the court has never extended Bush v. Gore to varying rules for casting absentee or early ballots--indeed the court has not even cited Bush since it was decided. The Obama campaign concedes that there's no general right to cast an early ballot and agrees that the state could discriminate in favor of military voters when it came to the rules for casting overseas ballots given the additional burdens faced by these voters. Furthermore, Ohio's attorney general points out that the state sent absentee ballot applications to all eligible voters in the state. This all seems to suggest that the burden on Ohio voters in losing the last three days is not severe. Surprisingly, however, both a federal district court and the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit agreed with the Obama campaign that the selective cutback was unconstitutional. The district court seemed to endorse a ""non-retrogression"" principle: A state didn't have to provide early voting, but once it did it could not take it away without good reason. The court said that Ohio officials had not proved they needed the last weekend to get ready for Election Day, as the state had claimed. The district court also found that the state offered no good reason not to let all voters cast ballots if the state was already having the county election boards open the last weekend for the military and overseas voters. It ordered a restoration of early voting for that last weekend throughout the state. The 6th Circuit majority agreed with the district court on both the non-retrogression and disparate treatment issues, and it relied heavily on equal protection principles from Bush v. Gore. But the 6th Circuit provided for a different remedy: it said it was up to each Ohio county to decide whether to be open at all on the last weekend, but a decision to be open meant a decision to be open for all voters. Although in theory this means some counties could decide to close their doors to all voters on this weekend, including military voters, the Ohio secretary of state has said he will require uniform early voting hours throughout the state if he loses. The 6th Circuit's Judge Helene White issued a concurring opinion, offering different reasons. She disagreed with the majority that the inconvenience of not having the polls open on the last weekend before Election Day imposed a severe burden on voters: After all, anyone could vote on Election Day, other early voting days, or through an absentee ballot. But she said that extra early voting was constitutionally required in this case because of Ohio's poor performance in 2004, and evidence that early voting fixed the problem in 2008. If the polls were not open on that last weekend, Judge White reasoned, the burden could fall on poor and minority voters. Judge White is no doubt right as a matter of policy--Ohio's cutback of early voting could have a negative effect at the polls and was done for no good reason. Indeed, the Ohio legislature probably eliminated the last weekend of early voting for purely partisan reasons. The cutback on early voting makes it more likely that we will see problems on Election Day--including long lines and broken machines--which means even more election-related litigation. As a matter of constitutional law, however, Judge White's reasoning is the biggest stretch of all. The Obama campaign's case was originally based on the disparate treatment of classes of voters. Now it has morphed into a kind of general constitutional right not to dismantle a (relatively) well-run election system. As much as I wish our Constitution provided such a guarantee, I'm skeptical that a majority of the Supreme Court will find one lurking there now."

Now both candidates support virtually the same broad range of gun rights--but only Mitt Romney has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association, the powerful pro-gun lobbying group that once feared supporting a candidate who has very publicly endorsed strong gun control measures in the past. Recently the NRA revealed that it has purchased more than $1.3 million worth of anti-Obama television advertisements in the battleground states of Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, and Virginia.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/what_is_the_history_of_the_presidential_debate_seal.html	"While waiting for the second debate to start, I got a closer look at the eagle that hangs between the candidates. It has been making appearances at presidential debates at least since George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton squared off in 1992. I was struck at first by the fact that the eagle has its head turned toward the talon with the arrows in it. The eagle usually faces the olive branches. The warlike posture was fitting for that second presidential debate last week when it seemed like one of the candidates might reach for the arrows and impale his opponent at any moment. Or, in Romney's case, Candy Crowley. On the Slate Political Gabfest last week, we speculated about the origins of a phrase that appears at the bottom of the seal. It reads: ""The Union and the Constitution Forever.""  We asked our listeners and readers to weigh in with an explanation for this call to arms. We had a lot of responses, but the picture is still incomplete. Perhaps one of you can clear up the mystery by emailing us at slatepolitics@gmail.com. Here's what we know right now. The first use of this phrase we can find is in a sermon from June 6, 1853, by the Rev. Hubbard Winslow collected in the Annual Record of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. The reverend concludes his barnburner with those words. Nine years later, the New York Times quoted  the Rev. Francis Vinton, who ended his own sermon arguing for maintaining the Union with the same phrase. In Civil War recruitment posters, the eagle faces the arrows, as he does on the debate stage, but a different pro-union message appeared underneath: ""The Union forever!"" The first time I can find the image and the phrase appearing together is in a campaign handkerchief for the Garfield-Arthur Republican campaign of 1880. In the campaign of 1892, the Benjamin Harrison-Whitelaw Reid ticket used it on their handkerchief, too. But on these representations, the eagle's head is turned toward the olive branches--seems fitting for a country emerging from the Civil War. At this point, the trail goes cold for about a 100 years and turns up again on a bar of silver in 1973. In this depiction, the eagle's head is turned back toward the arrows, as it does on the debate stage. The Commission on Presidential Debates doesn't have a good answer for the origin of the eagle--they say it's an amalgam based on something they found in the Smithsonian Museum. We have faith that one of you out there will help provide us with the definitive answers about the origin of this phrase, its use, and how it came to be associated with that design."

Obama has won a slight majority of these endorsements. But his biggest vote of confidence just came from Ohio, where the Cleveland Plain Dealer praised the president's leadership and economic policies. The Plain Dealer joins the Denver Post, the Tampa Bay Times, and the Arizona Daily Star in opting for Obama. Each is a major newspaper in a swing state that Democrats are hoping to tip blue. There's some question as to how effective endorsements are in swaying undecided voters, but they may well be influential when coming from a respected, widely read paper. With a circulation of more than 400,000, the Plain Dealer is the 20th most widely read newspaper in the country--which means its endorsement could make the difference in Ohio's ever-narrowing race.

Some people are skeptical. They wonder: How could anyone still be undecided? But I know you are out there. I've met a few of you on the campaign trail--though there may only be enough of you to fit on a school bus. A Washington Post national poll tells us that there are 9 percent of voters who could change their mind. In the swing states, there are fewer. In a recent CNN poll conducted in Florida, 8 percent said they might change their mind. In a series of CBS polls in Colorado, Virginia, and Wisconsin, there were less than 5 percent who said they didn't know how they would vote or that they could change their minds. In a close election, you might be the key. Many of you like Barack Obama but are considering not voting for him again. But wait, rather than have me tell you what you're thinking, I'm going to stop there and not guess at what you, the undecided voter, are thinking. I'd like you to tell us. Please write to us at slatepolitics@gmail.com and, in a paragraph, explain why you're undecided between the two candidates. If we get enough good responses, I'll write about it. If not, I'll use it to inform future pieces. If we get no responses, we'll assume you don't exist and you won't get the holiday ham we send every year. Yours truly,

But Democrats have a reason to worry: Swing state poll averages are showing a small but undeniable advantage for Romney in the Electoral College. Real Clear Politics gives Romney 206 certain electoral votes compared with Obama's 201, and several swing states--Florida, Nevada, and Colorado--have been leaning increasingly Republican in recent weeks. Other polls show a similarly tight race, as Obama's numbers in Wisconsin and Iowa refuse to bounce back to their pre-debate levels. Gallup's odd poll may be an outlier, but Romney path to victory in the Electoral College is more feasible than ever. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_have_repeatedly_tripped_up_in_talking_about.html	"It has been more than a month since the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and no one has gotten the Libya question right. Not the president, not Mitt Romney. The most recent blunder was Romney's decision to attack President Obama during the last debate for not declaring the attacks in Benghazi ""an act of terror."" This has set off a heated argument about the difference between an ""act of terror"" and ""terrorism."" Conventional wisdom seems to be that the president is winning that debate--which may explain why Romney has gone quiet on Libya since he walked out of the auditorium at Hofstra University. Romney charged that Obama had not used the words ""act of terror,"" when in fact the president clearly had in his statement from the Rose Garden on Sept. 12. But Romney's loss wasn't clarity's gain. Indeed, the president is clinging to his Rose Garden transcript specifically with the intent of obfuscating his administration's fuzzy evolution on what happened and why. The third presidential debate is to be devoted to national security and foreign policy,  which should be the most important debate if you are serious about what a president actually does in office. A president holds more personal power to shape foreign affairs than he does domestic affairs. President Obama personally approves every action taken against those on a ""kill list"" of suspected terrorists. Despite his campaign rhetoric about engaging Iran, he embraced President George W. Bush's covert cyber operation against Iran's nuclear program, as David Sanger outlines in his book Confront and Conceal. So for the next debate we should get into big questions: What is the biggest crisis you've faced? How do you define the national interest? What is a sufficient justification for military action? What theory of human rights will determine the decisions you make about the use of drones? What is the greatest foreign policy threat facing the United States? Right now, the conversation is headed in the opposite direction. We are going small bore on Libya, delving into the tiniest questions and definitions of what happened there during a few hours one day in September. We're certain to get even smaller as Republicans seize on the president's comments to Jon Stewart: ""If four Americans get killed it is not optimal."" (True dat, Spock) Mitt Romney started the push to the picayune. He reacted prematurely after the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, asserting that a press release from the U.S. embassy in Cairo had been a drastic sign of U.S. weakness. The instinct to condemn the whole of U.S. foreign policy based on a one-paragraph statement is what you want to do as a politician. But it is the opposite of what the statesman wishes to project. Doing so, especially during a crisis, is a warning to voters, a suggestion that this person is not serious. In matters of foreign policy, a person playing the small game often doesn't appear to have the prudence, wisdom, and judgment that the job requires. That was Barack Obama's argument against Mitt Romney. Presidents don't rush in to score political points in a crisis. That's a style point, and style is part of diplomacy. But prudence is also a part of foreign policy. Perhaps the prudent political thing was to move quickly to hurt Obama, but the prudent move of a statesman is to think and consider. Presidents know that initial reports are almost always wrong. The president has consistently called for a more nuanced view of the world. That means a version of leadership that isn't based simply on taking bold action for the cameras. Sometimes ""leading from behind"" can be the smart way to go. Simply claiming that the president isn't showing ""leadership"" is not enough, though that was the essential claim in Romney's foreign policy speech at the Virginia Military Institute entitled ""The Mantle of Leadership."" There, last month, he said: ""It is the responsibility of our president to use America's great power to shape history--not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events. Similarly, whether a president uses the word ""terrorism"" or not can warp the debate. If the wording becomes the whole bundle, then you run the risk of forgetting the underlying issues at play. That is what appeared to happen to Romney at the second presidential debate. He was so fixated on the words that when the president proved--with the help of moderator Candy Crowley--that he had indeed uttered the phrase ""act of terror,"" Romney was undone. But the president is now taking advantage of the cover of words. Winning a verbal sparring match over whether he used the phrase ""act of terror"" doesn't address Romney's underlying point. There is a question about what the administration knew when. At first, administration officials said there was a protest. There wasn't one. When the president spoke in the Rose Garden on Sept. 12, he appeared to think that the ""act of terror"" had been provoked by a low-budget movie insulting Muslims. It's more costly politically for the president if his administration didn't know that terrorists were plotting and planning to murder U.S. officials than if the United States simply couldn't protect an embassy from a spontaneous uprising by an enraged mob. Everyone can see why the White House might have been inclined to embrace evidence that suggested this was not a premeditated attack. The president is stretching our tolerance for the malleability of language. In the second debate, Obama clearly wanted the phrase he uttered in the Rose Garden that day to mean something on Oct. 16 that it didn't mean on Sept. 12, when the president seemed to think the ""act of terror"" was a spontaneous attack. Without defining what he actually means, the president would now like people to think that by using this phrase he was alive to the idea that this could have been a planned attack. Romney's mistake was to remain so intensely fixated on the words themselves. By elevating the ""T-word"" to such significance, he allowed Obama to use it as a shield. The more intelligent debater would have probed what Obama's original statement told us about the president's original assessment of the attack. When Romney tried to follow-up, to get the president to own up, by questioning him, Obama twice wouldn't answer. ""Proceed, Mr. Romney,"" he said. Obama learned from the first debate when Romney seemed to be contradicting the positions he had taken in the campaign. It was Romney's turn to be struck dumb when the other candidate said something he wasn't prepared for. With one more debate entirely devoted to foreign policy, we haven't heard the last of Libya. Obama and Romney will have had nearly a week to come up with a better answer for Benghazi. Hopefully, when we hear it, it will finally have some ring of truth."	Why No One Has Been Right about Libya

But there's one place where that may not be the case: Florida. While Romney trails Obama by 35 percent among Hispanic voters nationally, he's only 6 points behind in Florida. Compared to Hispanic voters nationwide, more Hispanic voters in Florida think Romney will do a better job fixing the economy, directing U.S. foreign policy, and reforming immigration policy, and more think Obama has not kept his promises to the Hispanic community. The difference could be the state's high Cuban population, which supports Romney by a wider margin nationwide.

After recently taking the lead in Florida, Romney will spend nearly $3.5 million in the Sunshine State wooing elderly and Latino voters. That leaves $3.145 million for Ohio, $2.22 million for Virginia, $1.235 million for Colorado, about $1 million for Iowa, and several hundred thousand for every other battleground state. Intriguingly, Romney is also spending about $300,000 in New Hampshire, where Obama's lead has disappeared in recent weeks. If Romney can lure enough voters to turn just a few of these states red, he may keep this race close to the finish. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/second_presidential_debate_barack_obama_won_the_hofstra_debate_but_mitt.html	"In the seal of the United States, the eagle turns its head toward its right talon, which holds an olive branch, and away from the talon holding 13 arrows. It is meant to suggest a preference for peace. The eagle that hovered between the two candidates in the second debate had the same design, but for one difference: The eagle's head was turned toward the arrows. It was a fitting symbol for the pointed and sniping contest between President Barack Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney. It was a night of barbs, interruptions, and charges and counter-charges. ""Very little of what the president said is true,"" said Romney. ""It's not true governor,"" said Obama. ""Not true. It's not true."" During one exchange, Romney said, ""You'll get your chance. I'm still speaking,"" as the audience in the arena seemed to gasp. At another point, the two men got so close and huffy, I thought moderator Candy Crowley might just ask them to take it outside. It's a pretty good bet that undecided voters missed the important matter the boys were squabbling over--was it about a barbecue grill or the Lions and Bears football game? The debate was the only town hall-style contest in which voters posed questions. Just as the candidates seem to be speaking past the electorate, it often felt like they were speaking past the questioners. Both candidates avoided answering questions about gas prices. Romney continued to show an aversion to specifics in explaining his tax plan, and the president didn't do a great job of answering a voter who wanted to know what Obama was going to do to earn his vote. If you had to score a winner (and I am obligated by the memorandum of understanding to do so), you'd give the night to the president--barely. He was a forceful advocate for his policies, kept Romney on defense, and gave Democrats plenty to cheer. He probably stopped his slide in the polls. He looked like a person who would fight for the middle class. In the first debate, he had looked like a person who wanted to skip middle class and get out to recess. In Round 2, Obama's closing remarks about fighting for the 47 percent of the popular vote that Romney disparaged in that secret video were among his best of any debate he's done on the national stage. When you finish strong, you are usually in a good place. But Mitt Romney showed that his first debate performance was no fluke. He gave as good as he got, and he consistently offered a confident alternative to the weak Obama recovery. ""I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get,"" he said. ""You're going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can't afford four more years like the last four years."" Both candidates had bad moments: President Obama tried to reinvent his initial reaction to Libya in front of millions of people, and Romney tried to tell a story about women in his cabinet that was certainly off-key and perhaps not even true. In a CBS poll of undecided voters after the debate, the group split nearly in thirds, with Obama winning slightly with 37 percent over Romney's 30 percent. Thirty-three percent thought the contest was a tie. Voters in the CBS poll by almost 3-to-1 thought Romney could better handle the economy, but the president won by a large margin on the question of which candidate cared about the middle class. A poll of ""Wal-Mart Moms"" gave the edge to the president, but not by much. The CNN poll gave the president a victory by 7 percentage points. A race that was tied--or at least very close--may now be even more tied than ever. (Tied with a double knot?) It is as if the ups and downs of the last several months never happened. In a conversation with one of Obama's top lieutenants in Ohio last week, I asked what he could say in the second debate that he didn't say in the first. ""Outsourcing, offshoring, and autos,"" was the response, referring to Bain Capital's investment in companies that outsourced American jobs, Romney's use of offshore accounts, and his refusal to back the auto bailout. The president hit all those themes in the first 15 minutes. He also tied Romney to the very unpopular Republican Congress. He had the Midwest in mind when he mentioned his plan to create more manufacturing jobs, and the debate over the car bailout put Romney on the defensive. Each candidate accused the other of not telling the truth, and both of them offered us examples of what that looks like. Romney told a false story about the past, and Obama told a false story about the present. During a politically charged exchange about fair pay for women, Romney recounted the early days of his Massachusetts administration. ""I had the chance to pull together a cabinet, and all the applicants seemed to be men,"" Romney said. And I--and I went to my staff, and I said, 'How come all the people for these jobs are--are all men?' They said, 'Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.' "" In recounting how he went on a search for qualified female candidates, Romney remembered, ""I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women."" On its face, the answer is odd. Romney sounds a little out of touch with the inequities of the workplace. The notion that women had to be scared up from the bushes seems from another era. But the main point for a candidate whose veracity is a key talking point for his opponent is that the story may not be true. The Boston Phoenix has fact-checked the story and claims that the binder of women was presented to Romney when he came into office. He didn't appear to ask for it, as he claimed in Tuesday night's debate. Perhaps he asked for another binder. In the end, however, as governor, Romney did hire a lot of women. Romney was asked directly about how he was going to pay for his tax plan, and his answer was no better than it has been for months. He named no loopholes he would close but offered the faux-specificity of a $25,000 cap on deductions. This is a very small piece of specificity in explaining how he would pay for a $5 trillion tax cut. ""Governor Romney was a very successful investor,"" said the president. ""If somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up."" The president's tall tales came during a debate over Libya. The administration's story is changing almost daily about what happened, who knew what when, and who is going to take responsibility for it. The topic presents political peril for the president. He effectively took command, saying that all responsibility rested with him and that he would get to the bottom of who killed the four Americans, including the ambassador. He criticized Romney for using the issue to score political points and took umbrage at the suggestion that anyone in his administration would act politically. Then, he proceeded to act politically. That is, if you define acting politically as suggesting something that isn't true is true for the purpose of saving your job. Obama said, ""The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people ... that this was an act of terror."" Obama was trying to suggest that he had declared this a terrorist attack long before his administration actually did. For days and days afterward, administration officials would not claim it was a terrorist attack. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice famously refused to call it such on Face the Nation. The president was trying to reset the timeline. If you look at the president's statement in the Rose Garden, he does use that phrase, but it's a throwaway cliche. Indeed, it arguably wasn't about the attack at all, just a bromide about more general acts of terror. In any event, the president buried the lead in the tenth paragraph of his remarks. That's why none of the papers at the time reported that he had characterized any part of the attack as having to do with terrorism. When Romney called him on it, the president wouldn't answer. ""Please proceed, governor,"" he said, as if he were the moderator and not the fellow who was being called out. It was the verbal equivalent of putting your hands over your eyes and pretending no one will see you. In the end, this picture of the debate says it all--the two candidates pointing at each other in mid-sentence. The next debate is less than a week away. The topic will be foreign policy and national security. The eagle will hang between the two men there, too. But for that final debate, questions of war and peace will actually be central to the discussion, not just a fitting description of it. Watch the latest episode of Political Kombat, pitting Joe Biden against Paul Ryan:"	Obama Won Tuesday Night's Slugfest, but Both Candidates Got Bloody
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/second_presidential_debate_mitt_romney_fails_to_launch_a_foreign_policy.html	"In the few minutes devoted to foreign policy in Tuesday night's presidential debate, not only did Gov. Mitt Romney stumble, he gave President Barack Obama a boost. The moment came with a question about last month's attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including the ambassador. Did the Obama administration refuse a request for extra security from the embassy, and if so, who's responsible for that? Obama's initial answer was evasive. He said that right after the attack, he ordered his national security team to beef up security at embassies across the region, to investigate why the attack happened, and to hunt down the killers. He also accepted ultimate responsibility, saying that everyone in his administration worked for him. Rather than lunge at the gaps in this reply, Romney suddenly turned empathetic. ""These terrible things may happen from time to time,"" he acknowledged. Many days passed before the White House told us whether the incident had been a planned assault or the culmination of a demonstration, but he went on, this might have been the result of misunderstanding, not deception. Having taken a high road and established that he does understand the way the world works, that, yes, sometimes intelligence is imperfect in the aftermath of an international crisis, Romney could have sharpened his attack on Obama's overall policies in the Middle East. But instead, he took a swipe that was incredibly lame. ""More troubling,"" Romney said, was that the day after the attack, ""the president flew to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser,"" and then to Colorado for another fundraiser, when he should have been dealing with the crisis. You could practically hear trumpets blaring ""Hail to the Chief"" at the vast opening that this left the president. Obama, with a stern face and a barely suppressed tone of outrage, stated that the day after the attack, he stood in the Rose Garden and denounced the assault as ""an act of terror."" A few days later, he added, he greeted the caskets of the dead, grieved with their families. To say that anybody on his team ""would play politics"" on an issue like this, Obama concluded, ""is offensive--that's not what we do."" Romney then dug himself deeper, claiming that Obama took 14 days before he called the attack an act of terror. Obama replied, ""Look at the transcript."" Then, in a peak of drama, Candy Crowley, the CNN reporter who moderated the debate, interjected, ""He did, in fact, sir,"" prompting applause from the otherwise-stone-faced audience. In other words, Crowley said, Obama did call it an act of terror. Let's go to that press conference of Sept. 12. Obama did say, clearly speaking about the attack the day before, ""No acts of terror will shake the resolve of this great nation."" Romney was right that it took nearly two weeks before the administration released a definitive statement that the attack was premeditated and that it did not spring from a spontaneous demonstration. But he also allowed that sometimes it takes a while for the true nature of such an event to emerge. In short, Romney failed to make the attack stick. And he gave Obama an opening--a rare and unnecessary one in a town hall forum--to speak up as the commander-in-chief."	Why Does Romney Always Stumble on Foreign Policy?

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/_2012_presidential_election_wisconsin_is_a_key_battleground_between_barack.html	"WAUKESHA, Wis.--Candee Ardnt hands me the oversize button, the one she made herself. An image of Mount Rushmore on a clear day has been altered, with the faces of the presidents replaced by Rep. Paul Ryan, Gov. Scott Walker, former Gov. Tommy Thompson, and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. The text reads Wisconsin GOP: 2012 Rock Stars. She made them for the Republican National Convention, but she unloaded more at yesterday's fundraiser at the Harley Davidson Museum--minimum ticket price $250--with all four of the heroes, raising money for Thompson's current U.S. Senate race. ""It was a wonderful event,"" she says, inside the college gym where Ryan's holding his first Wisconsin event in weeks. ""They talked about how Tommy had mentored all of them and helped them into politics. I think he's going to win. And I think we're going to break the streak this year. I think Romney's going to win Wisconsin."" Every day since the first presidential debate has felt, for Republicans, like Indian summer. But the thermometer's really been pulsing in Wisconsin. Crushing Democratic dreams have become a semipro sport here, ever since 2010, when the party lost nearly everything on the ballot. Republicans faced down protests over their collective bargaining reforms, and won. Democrats got enough signatures to force a summer 2012 recall election against Gov. Walker. They lost. They even lost a state Supreme Court seat and a state Senate seat when delayed ballots from Waukesha County came in and broke their hearts. And it was in this city, on Oct. 9, 2008, that the McCain/Palin ticket made its final visit to Wisconsin. ""Think about everything we've been through!"" says Brad Courtney, the state Republican Party chairman, warming up the crowd for Ryan. ""On June 4, the polls had the race between Gov. Walker and Tom Barrett dead even. But it was the Republican ground game, the sleeping giant that kept people going."" At this point the enthusiasm level rises from ""happy"" to ""unreasonably giddy."" From the day the recall was set until voters cast their ballots, Walker consistently led in the polls. It seemed like every union in the country was beating down doors in Wisconsin, and that was almost true, but Walker was able to outspend the Democrats 2-1. On Election Day, the same voters who gave the governor a 54-46 win told exit pollsters that they'd probably vote for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney, 51-44. If Mitt Romney struggles to win Ohio, this state shimmers in the desert as the next-best chance at a GOP pick-up. Democrats know this, and they're trying not to blow it again. They're convinced that the Walker wins are unrepeatable, for a bunch of reasons, and that they've finally--after half a dozen state elections--figured out why they lost. They enter the final three weeks with a narrow poll lead, the same or better as the numbers right after Wisconsin's own Paul Ryan joined the GOP ticket. I arrived in the state on Friday and drove to La Crosse, a college town with nearly 52,000 people, one of the liberal population centers in rural western Wisconsin. Vice President Biden made his first post-debate appearance in the school's Valhalla room, in front of a crowd that was half diehards and half students. The motorcade closed off most routes of escape, so when the speech ended, I joined a group of retired teachers from Tomah, Wis., at a nearby sports bar.* They'd had sweet places in the front of the room, where Biden worked the rope line. They all got kisses on the cheek. It took some doing to find out what made them worry about the election. ""I've got a mother who lives on Medicare and I'm worried about cuts,"" says Lavonne Spiers. ""I'm worried about David Koch getting added to the Pledge of Allegiance,"" jokes Karen Riggs. The teachers volunteered when they could in the run-up to recalls. Then they retired. According to some estimates, the American Federation of Teachers lost 35 percent of its membership after Walker took over. Some of them dropped out of politics, but some of them used their new time to canvass. ""We were weekend warriors,"" says Joanne Klinker, working through a basket of bar popcorn, ""and now we're committed."" On Saturday I drove to Racine, a city in Paul Ryan's district with a poverty rate roughly twice the statewide average. Bush won the surrounding county twice; Obama won it on an 8-point swing. The Republican ""victory center"" is nestled in an anonymous office park, next to some legal offices, and not terribly busy. On the drive from the outskirts into the city, I see a white Dodge van deposit, then collect, a group of black teenagers canvassing for Obama votes. The 2008 Obama landslide was built on white votes and a surge of black votes, and Democrats think that the second factor didn't click in 2010 and the recalls. The Obama/Democratic victory office is, by far, the most bustling space in a downtown full of empty storefronts and early-closing restaurants. Eighty-four volunteers from the Chicago suburbs have come to train and canvass. Their trainers include a bunch of retired teachers and veterans of the anti-Walker protests. These are people who've lost and lost and think they now know how to win. New volunteers learn how to talk to voters, and what to do if they meet people who clearly need convincing. It's summed up in jargon on the wall, which counts almost everybody in the city as a potential Obama vote. If motivation and definitely Obama supporter, have sign pledge card.
 If lean Obama, undecided, or lean Romney, then persuasion w/ values. Kelly Gallaher, 49, shows me around the office as she describes the days she spent protesting the Walker budget bill. ""I spent 10 to 12 days in the Capitol,"" she says. Linda Boyle, a retired teacher and yoga instructor, says she protested in Madison for 14 days. ""You learn to get dressed like a fireman,"" says Gallaher, She lifts up her arms as if shaking off her outfit. ""You take it off in one go, you sleep, you wake up, you put it back on."" ""I had a pair of yoga pants ready for every day I collected recall signatures,"" says Boyle. ""You get superstitious. 'This was the outfit I wore when I got 100 signatures! I'm going to keep wearing it.' "" The hardcore Democrats here lost all of the Walker-era elections that the media focused on. But they point out that they won the special Senate race in LaCrosse, and they won the one in Racine. The other side learned new skills, but so did they. Boyle says she was ""humbled"" by the signature-gathering marathons. The June 4 exit poll found that 60 percent of voters only favored recalls if they were being held to punish major crimes. That, say Democrats, was a thumb on the scale for Walker, unlike anything Republicans have this time. But the Republicans beat them. The crowd in Waukesha on Monday is only marginally smaller than the one that greeted Biden in La Crosse, and school's out for the day--there's no throng of curious college students to goose it. Neither party thinks this election will look like 2008, when Obama won 59 of Wisconsin's 72 counties. It looks like 2000 or 2004, elections so close that Republicans have memorized the margin of George W. Bush's defeat. Mark Graul, a Republican consultant who ran Bush's second Wisconsin campaign, concedes that Romney isn't beloved by Republicans, not the way that the Methodist former president was. But the base is genuinely terrified of Obama. And beating $21 million worth of union money in those recalls tuned them up, too. ""I worked on so many campaigns where we'd be two or three points ahead going into Election Day, then lose,"" says Graul, who managed the Bush campaign here in 2004. ""That's just no longer the case. We've caught up."" Correction, Oct. 16, 2012: This article originally misspelled the name of the town of Tomah. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

A recent poll shows Obama leading Romney by two points in the Copper State, garnering 77 percent of the state's Latino support and overwhelming Romney in the state's two most urban counties. Obama lost the traditionally Republican state by 9 percentage points in 2008, and Democrats have been understandably reluctant to devote their time and money to winning Arizona's 11 electoral votes this year. But a heated Senate race to replace John Kyl's seat has brought the state back to contention, as Democratic candidate Richard Carmona took an unlikely lead over his Republican opponent last week.  As North Carolina continues to slip out of reach for Democrats, Obama may be looking to Arizona to shore up his quest for 270 electoral votes. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

Much of the shift is likely due to last week's presidential debate: 5 percent of those polled claim to have switched allegiances to Romney following Obama's lackluster performance, while 2 percent of former Obama supporters are now undecided. Capitalizing on the momentum, Republicans have also surpassed Democrats in requests for absentee ballots in Florida, although Obama still leads among in-person early voters. If the Sunshine State tilts any more to Romney, it may no longer be right to call it at swing state at all. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.
