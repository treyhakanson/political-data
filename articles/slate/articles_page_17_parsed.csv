This week's gathering, which kicked off two days before Florida's Republican presidential primary, is grim. Sen. Marco Rubio, the candidate favored by many of the pundits, reporters, and organizers on hand, is facing extinction. Donald Trump, who is poised to deliver Rubio's death blow, is on track to win the Republican nomination. I've been coming to this conference, the Faith Angle Forum, for years. I've never seen anything like this mood. These people--evangelicals, Bible-believing reporters, conservative media stars--detest Trump. They feel him tightening his grip on their people and their party. The moderates already feel lost. David Brooks, the New York Times columnist who has been preaching compromise to hardline Republicans, is here. He laments at one point, ""I'm representing a political ideology that's dead."" The Christians, meanwhile, sense that they're in a battle for souls, and they're losing. Three weeks ago, when Rubio was rising in the polls, a pro-Rubio super PAC likened the young senator's battle against Trump to the struggle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. The analogy has proved apt, but not in the way Rubio's supporters intended. Everyone at the Faith Angle Forum is thinking about you-know-who, even when they don't say his name. At breakfast, an attendee explains to me why Hillary Clinton lavished excessive praise on Nancy Reagan: because in the current context--meaningful glance--people are looking back at the Reagans with nostalgia. At lunch, Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard confesses that his book on Jack Kemp, the Republican presidential candidate who tried to broaden conservatism by using the free market to solve the problems of minorities, isn't selling so well in the present climate. Most of the people who come to Faith Angle are theologically or politically conservative. But they're not authoritarian. In Monday's opening presentation, Jamie Smith, a philosopher at Calvin College, dismisses simplistic religion by observing, ""As soon as you have cable, fundamentalism is dead."" Michael Cromartie, the conference organizer, punctures sectarianism with a joke: ""The problem with theocracy is, everybody wants to be Theo."" These people oppose Trump for many reasons. They condemn his viciousness. They scorn his arrogance. They reject his ""nativism, religious prejudice and misogyny."" In side conversations, one conservative journalist says Trump is a menace to the First Amendment, and another excoriates Trump's ""proto-fascism."" During the conference, the Deseret News--whose editor, Paul Edwards, is a regular at Faith Angle--publishes an editorial denouncing Trump's ""hate-filled diatribes against Muslims and undocumented immigrants."" The editorial reminds Mormons that ""incitement to mob violence"" once targeted and killed their own leaders. Many of the attendees and organizers are evangelical. For them, Trump's support among self-identified evangelicals is an embarrassment and a puzzle. Smith suggests that many of these voters are only ""nominal evangelicals."" They say they're evangelical because in South Carolina and similar states, that's what you're supposed to say. But they don't live a Christian life or even go to church. According to Cromartie, Trump's support among putative evangelicals plummets when the sample is narrowed to those who attend church at least once a week. It sounds as though Smith and Cromartie are just making excuses. But they go further. Smith calls out the ""straight-up xenophobia"" among Trump's supporters. ""Their religious identity is a stalking horse or code for something else,"" he argues. Evangelicalism, Smith suggests, can be used as a fig leaf to ""cover your American nationalism."" He accepts pastoral responsibility to confront the underlying prejudice, through ""theological correction within the Christian community."" One thing you'll learn from a conference like this one, if you didn't know it already, is that there are thoughtful, responsible people in evangelical circles and in the right-wing media world. These people aren't yahoos. They don't even hang out with yahoos. But that's part of the problem: How can they reach the yahoos when they don't know them? Smith pokes fun at secular liberals who have no contact with devout Christians, but he seems totally unfamiliar with Trump's evangelicals. In a side conversation afterward, a conservative writer makes a similar confession: She interviews people at churches, but Trump's people don't go to church, so she doesn't meet them. Liberals, it turns out, aren't the only elites who are out of touch with today's angry white voters. A pall of despair seems to have descended on the attendees here. A few are sympathetic to Sen. Ted Cruz, but most prefer Rubio, and they're bracing for his destruction. In a conversation at the bar after dinner, several are interested in what the GOP could become if, instead of turning to Trump's anger or Cruz's absolutism, it pursued a more hopeful message and a more ethnically diverse coalition. The conversation turns to the final days of the South Carolina primary, when Gov. Nikki Haley, a daughter of Indian immigrants, and Sen. Tim Scott, a black American, campaigned with Rubio across the state. Today, that moment seems lost. When we gathered here in Miami a year ago, more than a dozen Republicans were lining up to run for president, and I told Cromartie to bet on Rubio. When we convened again in the fall, Rubio was surging, and I told Cromartie what a lucky dog he was that his guy would be the nominee. This time, I told Cromartie that unless six pollsters were wrong by 20 percentage points, Rubio was toast. Cromartie was crestfallen. What depresses the Faith Angle crowd isn't just the perversion of Christianity or the demise of Republican sanity. It's the emergence of sycophants such as Gov. Chris Christie, Ben Carson, and Jerry Falwell, Jr., who are luring conservatives and evangelicals to Trump. The conference attendees view these men as fools or sellouts. Kathleen Parker, a Washington Post columnist who often comes to Faith Angle, says they must pay: ""The only real strength of Trump's candidacy has been to expose and shame the cowards and opportunists among us. Remember them."" Maybe she's right. Maybe the 2016 campaign will turn out like the Harry Potter stories: The Dark Lord rises, the Death Eaters come out to embrace him, and in the end, he is defeated, and his acolytes are punished. But maybe, in real life, where we have no magic wands, the cowards and opportunists win."

How did we get here? Read on. ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win,"" goes the line attributed to Mahatma Gandhi. Typically, you'll find this pearl adorning a classroom or splashed across a motivational poster. But last month, on the eve of Super Tuesday--when a dozen states cast ballots for the Republican presidential nomination--you could find it on Donald Trump's Instagram page, the caption to a photograph of a massive rally in Alabama the day before. Perverse as it may seem for the belligerent real estate magnate to channel even apocryphal Gandhi wisdom, the line is apt. First, we did ignore him--as a buffoon who wouldn't survive past the summer. Then, we laughed at him--as a buffoon who wouldn't survive through fall. Eventually, Republicans began to fight him, terrified of his traction with voters. Now, he's winning, with more votes and delegates than anyone left in the field. On the eve of another critical Tuesday slate of votes, Trump is on the verge of an even greater victory. Polls show him in command both in the smaller states that will award their delegates proportionally, and in the larger, winner-take-all prizes of Ohio and Florida. By Wednesday morning, Trump could be a stone's throw from the Republican presidential nomination. We've learned, by now, not to underestimate Donald Trump, but we're still struggling to understand his rise. Why now? Why, when the United States is stronger and wealthier than it's been since the Great Recession, are some voters suddenly receptive to nativist demagoguery? How is Trump--who has been described as a proto-fascist, if not an outright fascist--just a few steps away from leading the Grand Old Party? For some on the left, Trump is the result of decades of divisive politics--the inevitable outcome of a Republican political strategy that stoked white racial resentment to win elections. ""Trump's campaign can best be understood not as an outlier but as the latest manifestation of the Southern Strategy, which the Republican Party has deployed for a half-century to shore up its support in the old Confederate states by appeals to racial resentment and white solidarity,"" writes Jeet Heer in the New Republic. For some on the right, Trump is the grassroots response to Republican elites who have abandoned their working-class voters to the whims of laissez-faire capitalism. ""[T]he Republican Party, and the conservative movement, offer next to nothing to working-class Trump supporters,"" writes Michael Brendan Dougherty in the Week. ""There are no obvious conservative policies that will generate the sort of growth needed to raise the standard of living for these working-class voters."" These explanations aren't mutually exclusive; each touches on an important element of the Trump phenomenon. The Republican Party does have a tradition of harnessing white racial resentment to win elections, from the infamous ""welfare queen"" rhetoric of Ronald Reagan to Newt Gingrich labeling Barack Obama the ""food stamp president"" during the 2012 presidential election. GOP elites have failed to offer solutions to struggling working-class whites, who have suffered keenly from the collapse of the industrial economy. And it is true that rapid, disorienting economic and cultural change has led a substantial group of Americans to turn to someone who disdains feckless politicians and pledges to restore the country's strength. But none of these theories answer the question why now. Each of these forces has been in play for years. Wages for working-class Americans have long been stagnant, and the collapse of job opportunities for workers without a college degree was apparent in the 1990s, long before the Great Recession. What's more, economic and social decline--as well as frustration with foreign competition, which Trump has channeled in his campaign--isn't unique to white Americans. Millions of Americans--blacks and Latinos in particular--have faced declining economic prospects and social disintegration for years without turning to a demagogue like Trump. Race plays a part in each of these analyses, but its role has not yet been central enough to our understanding of Trump's rise. Not only does he lead a movement of almost exclusively disaffected whites, but he wins his strongest support in states and counties with the greatest amounts of racial polarization. Among white voters, higher levels of racial resentment have been shown to be associated with greater support for Trump. All of which is to say that we've been missing the most important catalyst in Trump's rise. What caused this fire to burn out of control? The answer, I think, is Barack Obama. There have been some conservative writers who have tried to hang Trump's success on the current president, pointing to his putatively extreme positions. But in most respects, Obama is a conventional politician--well within the center-left of the Democratic Party. Or at least, he's governed in that mode, with an agenda that sits safely in the mainstream. Laws like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Affordable Care Act weren't impositions from the far left; they were built out of proposals from the right and left, passed by a majority of Congress that was elected to pursue solutions on health care and the economy. Barack Obama is many things, but conservative rhetoric aside, he's no radical. We can't say the same for Obama as a political symbol, however. In a nation shaped and defined by a rigid racial hierarchy, his election was very much a radical event, in which a man from one of the nation's lowest castes ascended to the summit of its political landscape. And he did so with heavy support from minorities: Asian Americans and Latinos were an important part of Obama's coalition, and black Americans turned out at their highest numbers ever in 2008. For liberal observers, this heralded a new, rising electorate, and--in theory--a durable majority. ""The future in American politics belongs to the party that can win a more racially diverse, better educated, more metropolitan electorate,"" wrote Harold Meyerson in the Washington Post after the 2008 election. ""It belongs to Barack Obama's Democrats."" For millions of white Americans who weren't attuned to growing diversity and cosmopolitanism, however, Obama was a shock, a figure who appeared out of nowhere to dominate the country's political life. And with talk of an ""emerging Democratic majority,"" he presaged a time when their votes--which had elected George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan--would no longer matter. More than simply ""change,"" Obama's election felt like an inversion. When coupled with the broad decline in incomes and living standards caused by the Great Recession, it seemed to signal the end of a hierarchy that had always placed white Americans at the top, delivering status even when it couldn't give material benefits. In a 2011 paper, Robin DiAngelo--a professor of multicultural education at Westfield State University--described a phenomenon she called ""white fragility."" ""White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves,"" she writes. ""These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium."" DiAngelo was describing private behavior in the context of workplace diversity training, but her diagnosis holds insight for politics. You can read the rise of Obama and the projected future of a majority nonwhite America as a racial stress that produced a reaction from a number of white Americans--and forced them into a defensive crouch. You can see the maneuvering DiAngelo describes in the persistent belief that Obama is a Muslim--as recently as last fall, 29 percent of Americans held this view, against all evidence. It is a way to mark Obama as ""other"" in a society where explicit anti-black prejudice is publicly unacceptable. Consistent with this racialized fear and anxiety is the degree to which white Americans now see ""reverse discrimination"" as a serious problem in national life. For its American Values Survey, the Public Religion Research Institute asks respondents whether ""discrimination against whites is a significant problem."" In last year's survey, 43 percent of Americans--including 60 percent of working-class whites--said discrimination against whites had become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities. The anxieties DiAngelo describes, and the fears cataloged by the American Values Survey, have real political impact. In a 2014 study, political scientists Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson tried to measure ""perceived status threat"" from a shift in racial demographics, surveying how people responded when informed that California is now home to more blacks, Hispanics, and Asians than non-Hispanic whites. In other words, how do white Americans react to unrelated political questions when exposed to news of a ""majority-minority"" future? The results were clear. ""Making the majority-minority shift in California salient led politically unaffiliated white Americans to lean more toward the Republican Party,"" wrote Craig and Richeson. Likewise, ""making the changing national racial demographics salient led white Americans (regardless of political party affiliation) to endorse both race-related and relatively race-neutral conservative policy positions more strongly."" The Obama era didn't herald a post-racial America as much as it did a racialized one, where millions of whites were hyperaware of and newly anxious about their racial status. For example, during a Marco Rubio rally before the New Hampshire primary in February, I spoke to a voter who, in her way, gave voice to this hyperawareness. ""I think he's divided this country in many ways,"" said Lori, an older white woman, of Obama. ""I know in a lot of places in America there's a divide in color ... like, when I walk up to someone in the stores""--she looked at me to emphasize what she means--""I feel that they're wondering if I like them. ... I didn't feel that before. I was accepting of everyone, and I hate that he brought that."" This isn't the first time in our history that whites have worried about losing their pre-eminent status. In the early 20th century, massive Southern and Eastern European immigration, as well as Chinese immigration in the American West, fueled nativism and white racism, and helped lead to the resurrection of the Ku Klux Klan. The revived Klan organized millions of white Americans in a movement against immigrants, blacks, and religious minorities like Catholics. This, along with a broader nativist movement, had an enormous impact on American politics--entire states, like Indiana, were controlled by Klan-backed politicians while national lawmakers passed harsh, restrictive immigration laws. Our current burst of nativism and racial anxiety is proving to be a similarly potent force. ""The election of the country's first black president had the ironic upshot of opening the door for old-fashioned racism to influence partisan preferences after it was long thought to be a spent force in American politics,"" wrote Brown University political scientist Michael Tesler in a 2013 paper titled ""The Return of Old Fashioned Racism to White Americans' Partisan Preferences in the Early Obama Era."" For Tesler, ""old-fashioned racism"" isn't a rhetorical term; it refers to specific beliefs about the biological and cultural inferiority of black Americans. His work suggests that there are some white Americans who, in his words, have ""concerns about the leadership of a president from a racial group whom they consider to be intellectually and socially inferior."" Other research points to the degree to which Obama's election seems to have exacerbated racial animus among white voters. In a paper titled ""The Impact of Anti-Black Racism on Approval of Barack Obama's Job Performance and on Voting in the 2012 Presidential Election,"" a trio of researchers found a substantial increase in the number of voters with anti-black attitudes, which rose from 47.6 percent in 2008 to 50.9 percent in 2012. ""The proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes,"" they write, ""was 32 percent among Democrats, 48 percent among independents, and 79 percent among Republicans."" What does anti-black racism in the Obama era have to do with Donald Trump, who crashed the 2016 campaign with a wave of anti-Latino rhetoric? Trump may have started this campaign by denigrating Latinos and Muslims, but his first appearance in the Obama era was in the context of anti-black racism. In 2011, Trump took the ""birtherism"" conspiracy--the belief that Obama is foreign-born and thus an illegitimate president--and turned it into a full-fledged movement. Even now, his supporters believe Obama is illegitimate--62 percent say he is a Muslim, and 61 percent that he was born in another country. I spoke to a voter who echoed this sort of othering anti-Obama rhetoric in Las Vegas, at a Trump event the day before the Nevada caucuses. ""In my opinion, Obama is the most anti-American president that I have experienced. He bows down to every other country. He puts other countries before America,"" explained Martin, a staunch backer of the real estate mogul. More recently, anti-black racism has returned to the fore, with behavior that attracts those who would like to see the old racial hierarchy restored. He shares racist memes on Twitter and has built a symbiotic relationship with white nationalists, refusing a chance to repudiate former Klan leader David Duke during one interview and offering his son for an interview with a white-nationalist radio host. And in recent weeks, Trump supporters have attacked black protesters at his rallies. At an event in North Carolina, a protester was punched in the face by an audience member, while another yelled a racist slur. Afterwards, Trump condoned the behavior. ""He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back,"" he said, despite no evidence of any attack from the protester. ""That's what we need more of."" In St. Louis, Missouri, a Trump rally collapsed into scuffles between supporters and opponents, with multiple arrests. At a Kentucky rally--the same day Trump promised to defend supporters in court if they fought with demonstrators--two protesters were assaulted by members of a white-supremacist group. On Friday evening, demonstrators in Chicago held a mass rally against an impending Trump event, forcing the campaign to cancel. Trump blamed the ensuing melee on ""thugs."" None of this is to discount the material facts behind Trump's appeal to working-class whites. The collapse of the industrial economy in the wake of the Great Recession caused real devastation. The middle class has been losing ground for a long time, and there are few jobs for people without college degrees--or at least, few jobs that hold a path to mobility. Even in places where new factories have cropped up, unions are sparse and wages are low, following a race-to-the-bottom among the towns and cities that vie for the remaining manufacturing jobs. When economic desperation meets hopelessness--as we saw in the 1980s, when an earlier wave of deindustrialization ravaged the inner cities--the results are tragic. The effects of these trends were highlighted in a widely analyzed study released last fall that showed rising mortality rates among middle- and working-class white Americans, the group that makes up Trump's main body of support. Princeton University professor Anne Case and co-author Angus Deaton found that white working-class Americans are increasingly dying from suicide, alcohol abuse, and drugs. ""In 1999,"" writes Case for Quartz, ""people in this group died from accidental drug and alcohol poisonings at four times the rate of Americans with a bachelor's degree or more. By 2013, they were dying at seven times the rate of their better-educated peers. In 2013, they also committed suicide at more than twice the rate of people with more education, and died from alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis at five times the rate of those with a college degree."" These spikes in mortality are so large that, for whites aged 45 to 54, they've lowered overall life expectancy. Young whites, meanwhile, face rising rates of addiction and a corresponding increase in mortality. Canvas a Trump event and you'll meet people who have seen these changes up close. They are teachers, police officers, small-business owners, and city employees who hold the closest thing to middle-class jobs in the rural towns and older suburbs where Trump draws his most ardent support. In the Michigan primary, for example, Trump won most of his votes from voters with incomes less than $50,000; in New Hampshire, he dominated among voters making less than $100,000. Everywhere, in fact, Trump is winning Republicans with modest middle-class incomes. These somewhat better-off Americans have seen their friends and family fall into dependency, whether to drugs or alcohol or welfare. They are both sympathetic to this plight--which is why Trump's call for more help for veterans and seniors resonates with them--but also frustrated and angry. The country, and its leaders, made a promise: If you worked hard, you would get ahead. But that didn't happen. Instead, for millions of Americans, it was the reverse: They worked hard and fell behind. They're afraid, for themselves and for their children. Trump speaks for them. ""What do we all want?"" Trump asked at a rally on the eve of the Nevada caucus. ""We want security. We want a strong country."" Those who feel insecurity most acutely have turned out to back the real estate mogul en masse. With that said, perceptions of race inform their embrace of Trump as well. In the recent past, holding the favored spot in our racial hierarchy brought benefits. As historian and political scientist Ira Katznelson details in When Affirmative Action Was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America, being white was traditionally a pathway to middle-class security, the key that won access to vital mortgage and education programs, as the federal government worked to build a white middle-class in the middle part of the 20th century. Even after the civil rights movement and the end of formal discrimination against black Americans, it was still true that being white and middle-class offered protection from the worst of our economy's ravages. Drugs, ghettos, and dependency existed among whites in pockets of the country, but they were popularly understood as black and Latino problems, not white ones. Now, that isn't true. Now, middle-class whites face addiction and dependence, which adds a racial element to economic anxiety, as the security provided by whiteness no longer exists for many Americans. There are objections to this narrative. It's possible, for example, that Obama's decision to push forward with liberal policies and to galvanize a liberal base produced an inevitable partisan backlash, of which Trump is part. Had Obama governed more moderately, had he tried to find a space in his coalition for white working-class voters, then Trumpism might have stayed in the deep. But this analysis ignores the extent to which Trump reflects specific choices by Republican and conservative elites. From indulging anti-Obama conspiracy theories to attacking him as an enemy of the United States, conservatives chose to nurture resentment and anxiety and distill it into something potent. You can draw a direct line to the rise of Trump from the racial hysteria of talk radio--where figures like Rush Limbaugh, a Trump booster, warned that Obama would turn the world upside down. ""The days of [minorities] not having any power are over and they are angry,"" said Limbaugh to his audience. ""They want to use their power as a means of retribution."" It also ignores the degree to which these voters likely would have found this hypothetical partnership inimical to their conception of their interests. Even if Obama had reached out, they would be mere partners in a larger coalition, when what they want is to be its driving force. Trump speaks to that desire, signaling--in ways subtle and otherwise--that he plans to ""Make America Great Again"" by making the white American worker the center of his universe. Throughout our history, a substantial minority of whites has responded to America's always-shifting racial and economic terrain with a primal fear of being dominated, of finding themselves at the bottom of the hierarchy. It's one of the strongest forces in American life, and politicians and demagogues of many partisan stripes channeled it long before Donald Trump; it's so strong that researchers have found a direct and robust connection between a given county's proportion of enslaved people before emancipation and its present-day Republican vote share. The more slaves held in a given area, the more Republican votes. The good news is that movements like Trump's tend to fade away. The bad news is that, even in defeat, they are influential. One antecedent to Trump--Alabama Gov. George Wallace--never won a national party nomination. But he had massive impact on the direction of national politics, giving Richard Nixon raw materials for his ""Southern Strategy"" of racial resentment that would shape and define American politics for the next four decades. For Americans opposed to Trump, it's tempting to believe that his base is a shrinking part of America; that these are the death throes of racial reaction. Eventually, goes the thinking, they'll fade from view too. That is wishful thinking. America is a diverse country. But it's still a predominantly white one, where a Trumpist movement can still encompass millions of voters. And ""eventually"" might be a while. In the space between now and then, Trumpism--the potent mix of open prejudice, nationalist aggression, and heterodox economic policy--could thrive. In fact, it likely will, since the trends that produced Trump--a brittle economy, an ailing white working-class, an insecure white middle-class, a rising nonwhite population, political gridlock, and growing minority political power--are ongoing. Given the more than uphill climb he would face in a general election, Trump the person might have an expiration date. But Trumpism will enter the firmament of modern politics, a powerful current that will shape the future of the Republican Party, and the Democratic one too. Trump came on the stage as a clown. But whenever he leaves, he'll do it as a new icon of a familiar movement in American life."

Where the heck are the bagpipes? Don't Canadians always travel with bagpipes? I know I do. The next thing in evidence: Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau. In Canada, she is allowed to have a hyphenated last name. How late 20th century! The first lady with two last names hasn't been permitted here in Washington since, well, you-know-who tried it. But most of all, I was overwhelmed by the feeling that Trudeau is now in the exact place where President Obama used to be. And that both of them find this very confusing. Many, many pixels will die today, skimming over the surface of Trudeau's visit. His good looks (which are good) and the baby toss on the White House lawn (which was delicious) and the Canadian designers sported by Michelle Obama and Gregoire-Trudeau at the state dinner. And also baby Hadrien (because swoon). But all of that is beside the real point. Which isn't so much that the two men are in love, as that Obama gets to see what might have been, had he been allowed to just be. You can joke all you want about the budding bromance between the two heads of state, but what I saw and heard in Obama's speeches welcoming Trudeau--whose hopey-changey message must feel like a visit from the Ghost of Elections Past to Obama--is a sense that it's still possible to believe in democracy, that politics is a noble vocation, and that good can still come of elected office, at least if your name is Trudeau and not Obama. Whether this is about race, or political legacy, or the difference between Canadians and Americans isn't clear to me. But Trudeau swept into elected office on the same enormous wave of optimism and tolerance that brought Obama to the White House in 2008. Except the Canadians gave Trudeau a chance. When Trudeau won election back in October, he made reference in his victory speech to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the ""sunny ways"" approach Laurier tried to bring to bear on an ugly national mood of religious and linguistic intolerance that was threatening to pull Canada apart at the time. On election night, Trudeau spoke of optimism and respect. ""Wilfrid Laurier talked about sunny ways. He knew that politics can be a positive force, and that is the message Canadians sent today,"" Trudeau told supporters in Montreal. ""Sunny ways, my friends, sunny ways. This is what positive politics can do."" In referencing ""sunny ways,"" Trudeau was responding at least in part to his predecessor Stephen Harper's ugly election-year politicization of Canadian Muslims and the niqab. Before the election, Harper had made a point of saying that Muslim women should not wear the religious face covering at their citizenship ceremonies because it's ""offensive"" and it's ""not how we do things here."" Trudeau was quick to condemn Harper's decision to attack minority women, arguing right before the election that ""no election win [is] worth pitting Canadians against Canadians."" While the U.S. election of 2016 plays out as a festival of misogyny, Trudeau quietly seated a Cabinet last fall that was half women, explaining when queried, ""because it's 2015."" His Cabinet also includes two Sikhs, an Afghan refugee, and a native aboriginal leader. All of this was accomplished without anyone getting punched in the face because of the color of his or her skin. And baby panda porn notwithstanding, Trudeau's greatest media moment since winning election happened when--after pledging to accept 25,000 Syrian refugees as the rest of the world was closing its doors--he met the first batch of refugee families at the airport as they arrived and helped them find proper winter coats. In explaining his stance on the Syrian families, Trudeau said that the manner in which Canada treats refugees ""defines us as a nation."" By way of contrast, Obama proposed admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees this year, a move that met vigorous political resistance and was countered by GOP front-runner Donald Trump's call to ban all Muslim immigrants for the foreseeable future. How incredibly strange it must be for Obama to watch his neighbor to the north triumph on a message of tolerance and multiculturalism, feminism and pluralism, environmental protection and military modesty, just as the GOP debates rise to almost Popeye levels of ""bomb the shit out of them"" braggadocio and as Trump rallies become the newest place to go in America to get punched and shoved on account of your political views. Having watched Obama watching Trudeau this week, saying all the things Obama once said--at his victory speech, Trudeau said his Liberal majority government stood as proof that ""positive, optimistic"" politics are not just a ""naive dream""--I'm not clear whether he thinks Trudeau is lucky, or charmed, or merely being set up for years of face-punching to come. As the president has jokingly warned young Trudeau many times, this is a job that will turn your hair white. There's a hidden barb in there--it goes, ""They are going to kill you, Little Man."" The hidden punchline is: ""Maybe at the end of your term in office, everyone in your country will be clamoring to move here."" But mostly, I heard genuine affection and respect and a longing to return to a time when hope and change weren't obsolete campaign slogans. Instead of looking exhausted, Obama almost looked energized. In his toast to Trudeau at the formal state dinner on Thursday night, Obama almost choked up as he talked about his children and why service matters:"	Justin Trudeau Is What President Obama Might Have Been, if Hope and Change Had Lasted	['Harper', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

He looked calm, sensible, and presidential. His Republican rivals seemed to have given up. ""Maybe it shows I don't have to be so, let's say, flamboyant,"" Trump mused in a Friday morning interview on Fox News. The key, he explained, was that ""I wasn't really hit. ... When you get hit, you have to fight back."" This was a perfect illustration of how not to debate Trump. If he wraps up his party's nomination, only one person will stand between him and the Oval Office. That person--in all likelihood, Hillary Clinton--can't afford to repeat the mistakes Trump's Republican opponents made on Thursday. When she takes the debate stage against Trump, she has to make clear how dangerous he is. Here's how to do it. 1. Understand what Trump is, and expose it. Every candidate has a character flaw. The flaw isn't the whole person, but it captures what's wrong with him. Marco Rubio, for example, is a coward. Ted Cruz is a liar. Trump is a child. He's narcissistic, insecure, and petulant. Those are three very bad traits to combine in a president. If you let Trump skate through a two-hour debate without revealing these traits, you've failed. To draw out Trump's inner child, you have to poke it. You have to injure his pride. When he feels wronged or threatened, he can't control himself. He hits back, and he gets personal. He hurls insults: loser, choke artist, Lyin' Ted, Little Marco. He tells his rivals they should get off the stage because they're low in the polls. His outbursts are unbelievably puerile. In one debate, he said to Ted Cruz: ""I know you're embarrassed. I know you're embarrassed. ... I'm relaxed. You're the basket case."" This behavior puts off lots of viewers, including independents and Republicans. And Trump doesn't just lash out at his opponents. He heaps scorn on candidates who have already left the race. He attacks moderators such as Megyn Kelly and Hugh Hewitt (""very few people listen to your radio show""). He even picks fights with the audience. Just get him started, watch him throw a few punches, and see how many people he can antagonize. 2. Bring out his insecurity. Trump is obsessed with his image. Long before he told us about the size of his Donald, he was bragging in every debate that his poll numbers were bigger than anyone else's. He refuses to admit he lost Iowa. In every speech, he crows about how much money he's made. To certify his intellect, he reminds audiences that he went to the Wharton School of business. This self-preoccupation alienates many people. But to a debate opponent like Hillary Clinton, it would also be useful in another way. Remember how frustrating it was to debate Barack Obama in 2008? His ego was impervious. You couldn't rattle him. Trump is Obama's opposite: He can't stand it when anyone thinks ill of him. So when you raise a topic that's bad for him, such as Trump University, he latches onto it. Trump has to get not just the last word, but the last 200 words. He goes on for minutes, explaining sordid details viewers hadn't even heard before. And the best he comes up with at the end is, ""I've won most of the lawsuits."" Take advantage of this defensiveness. Raise issues that Trump can't resist addressing, though they can only do him harm. Here are two good ones: (A) Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Nobody except for hardcore Trump supporters believes this, but Trump keeps insisting it's true. It shows he's either lying or delusional. Get him going on it. (B) Atlantic City. Ask him about how he abandoned the city and stuck taxpayers with the tab. He always defends this episode by bragging about how cleverly he timed his exit and used bankruptcy laws to protect his company. His version of the story is bad enough. Let him tell it. 3. Put his belligerence in context. Trump is running as a strongman who will shake things up. In the context of Washington gridlock and corruption, that sounds good. Your job is to focus attention on areas where a wrecking-ball president would be a really bad idea. This should be easy, because the first job of any president is national security. Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric (""Islam hates us"") and ideas (barring all foreign Muslims from entering the United States) would antagonize allies we need against ISIS. His threats to impose stiff tariffs on China and Japan would provoke trade wars. Blackmailing Mexico (""The wall just got 10 feet taller"") and changing America from the world's policeman to the world's thief (""Take the oil"") don't sound terribly smart either. Americans also don't want a bullheaded president trampling civil liberties. If they don't care about torture or targeting foreign civilians, remind them of Trump's threats to ""open up"" libel laws and ""close up"" parts of the Internet. Point out his fondness for iron-fisted tyrants in Russia and China. When you combine these observations with the violence and loyalty pledges at some of Trump's rallies, the thought of a resolute leader who imposes his will makes a lot of people queasy. 4. Communicate the breadth of his bigotry. A majority of the population isn't black, Mexican, or Cuban American. Most Americans aren't Muslim or Seventh-day Adventist. Half aren't women. But when you line up Trump's slurs and innuendoes against all of these groups, voters writ large begin to realize he'll smear anybody (even if some dismiss this bigotry as Trump fighting political correctness). Trump isn't a Klansman. He's a salesman for whom prejudice is just another marketing tool. 5. Don't get bogged down in policy disputes. Trump's tax and budget numbers don't add up. He's a military ignoramus. He has no real plans for health care or education. Of course you want to talk about these things. Don't. Trump's Republican opponents pressed these issues against him in several debates, without effect. Debating policy with Trump just makes him look presidential. His fatal flaw is temperament, not substance. And there are so many damning things to talk about--his scams, his bankruptcies, his aspersions against Latinos, all the countries he has already offended--that every minute you spend on the mere impracticality of his so-called plans is a minute you could have devoted to something worse. 6. Be the adult. The hardest trick to pull off, and the most important, is to provoke Trump without looking petty yourself. You can't bicker with him onstage, as several Republicans have done, or sink into a pleading tone, as Jeb Bush did. When Trump goes after you personally, you have to be what he isn't: poised, calm, rational, mature. You get to stand opposite him as a direct point of contrast. You can do what no one else can do: expose the absurdity of a Trump presidency by modeling what a president should be. In the Republican debates, one candidate got this right: Carly Fiorina. She rebuked Trump without matching him. She chose her words sparingly and kept her voice even. She let Trump's insults and dominance displays alienate the women watching at home. She used his taunts, her understanding of foreign policy, and the force of her counterexample to eviscerate him. But she wasn't you, Madame Secretary. She didn't have your experience, your money, or your political machine. And she didn't get to face Trump one on one. You do. Go get him. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 presidential election."	Here's a Manual for Hillary Clinton on How to Debate Donald Trump	['Cruz', 'Trump', 'Long', 'Obama']	[]
4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/is_hillary_clinton_likable_enough_to_beat_donald_trump.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. In the Democratic debate this week in Miami a reporter from the Washington Post asked Hillary Clinton a blunt question. Citing a poll result that only 37 percent of Americans consider her honest and trustworthy, the journalist asked, ""Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?"" Clinton looked pained and responded with some emotion. ""Look, I have said before and it won't surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me ... not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people's lives, and hope that people see that I'm fighting for them."" It was a poignant moment. After a quarter-century on the national stage, Clinton can no longer console herself that voters just haven't gotten to know her yet. They know her very well, and a solid, unmovable mass of them simply do not like her. The battering she has taken over her use of a private email server as secretary of state and the pseudo-scandal regarding the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi have reinforced the belief that she is less than truthful. Averaging various polls, her favorable/unfavorable rating now hovers at around 40-53. A 13-point negative gap in favorability would bode badly, were she not facing the prospect of a likely Republican nominee with a 28-point gap. This was the week that Clinton hoped to turn her full attention to running against Donald Trump. Instead, she found herself not yet finished with the primaries. In Michigan, where polls showed her beating Bernie Sanders by 20 points, she ultimately lost in a tight race. Even if Sanders outperforms expectations in a similar way in next Tuesday's big primaries in Ohio and Florida, he faces prohibitive odds of winning enough delegates to gain the Democratic nomination. But with a technical chance, he remains in the race, raising other issues that damage Clinton's credibility. In Wednesday's debate, Sanders again hammered at her refusal to release the text of speeches she delivered to Goldman Sachs, for which she was paid $225,000. It may be that even as a little-loved and not-fully-trusted politician, Clinton won't have to do much to defeat Trump in November. Less-educated white men, who constitute his only reliable base of support, are shrinking as a share of the electorate. In 2012, Mitt Romney lost the presidency while winning 62 percent of the overall white male vote. So long as black and Latino people come out to vote, Trump might need something closer to 70 percent of the white male vote to win. All the polls currently show Clinton beating him handily in a head-to-head matchup. But given the way Trump has defied rational expectation thus far, those around Clinton can't risk being complacent. To be confident about defeating him in the election in November, she will have to figure out how to accomplish two tasks that are difficult: Address her own intractable unpopularity, and deflate a poisonous windbag who has so far proved impervious to criticism. Those advising Clinton believe that the negative strategy will be the easier. Attacking Trump on a daily basis will not be a job for Clinton herself. For that, she will have a formidable team of supporters: her husband, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, as well as whomever she chooses as a running mate. The Democrats will also seek help stopping Trump from others, ranging from Warren Buffett to Oprah Winfrey to Republicans like Mitt Romney. Come midsummer, Clinton's surrogates will be traversing the country warning voters about how dangerous Trump is. All will be seeking ways to get under Trump's skin, the most effective of which appear to be casting doubt on his claims of success in business and undermining his wild exaggerations about his own wealth. The challenge of remaking Clinton's own image will be much tougher. Trump and his allies will yammer unceasingly about the FBI investigation into her alleged security infractions, warning that she could be indicted at any time--remotely possible, but unlikely. She will have some chance to show a softer side at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July, which follows her pregnant daughter Chelsea's due date for the Clintons' second grandchild. Instances of warmth may ensue. But trying too hard to humanize Clinton could backfire, as it did in 2000 with Al Gore's attempts at a makeover when he ran for the Democrats. A wiser strategy would be to reinforce what people do like about Clinton. Whether or not they fully trust her, large majorities of voters view her as competent, decisive, and prepared for the job of being president. Politicians don't need to be beloved in order to be successful. A measure of respect is sufficient."	Is Hillary Clinton Likable Enough to Beat Donald Trump?

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/bernie_sanders_and_hillary_clinton_s_immigration_shuffle.html	"The strength of the Hispanic vote in the Democratic primary is going to serve as a determinative force in the remainder of the contests between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Florida's vote on Tuesday, for one, will hinge largely on Hispanic voters. If Clinton can pull off the sizable win that's expected of her there, she can crush whatever momentum Sanders built following his surprise win in Michigan. Or, if Sanders is still trailing Clinton by low triple-digits in pledged delegates by the time the California primary rolls around in June, a big win there could instantly erase his deficit. What we saw in Wednesday's Univision/Washington Post Democratic debate between Sanders and Clinton was a demonstration of how far to the left Democrats have moved on immigration policy in the past 10 years as Hispanic voters have become such a critical portion of the Democratic base. The face-off exposed what are now perceived as blemishes on both Sanders' and Clinton's records from the 2000s, blemishes for which they will each have to answer as the campaign hurtles, eventually, through California. And their disavowals of the previous positions will only heighten the eventual Democratic nominee's contrast with either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz heading into a general election whose outcome hinges heavily on Democrats turning out Hispanic voters. Much of the first half of the debate was focused on issues of immigration and the rights of undocumented immigrants. Both candidates had their strong moments, but they also each took lumps based on previous statements and positions they made when the Democratic Party was much more split on immigration issues--and when the party, frankly, was more conservative. Clinton was asked about comments she made on a 2003 radio program in which she said she was ""adamantly against illegal immigrants,"" explaining how, if you ""come up to Westchester, go to Suffolk and Nassau counties, stand on the street corners in Brooklyn or the Bronx, you're going to see loads of people waiting to get picked up to go do yard work and construction work and domestic work."" It was the sort of harsh tone towards undocumented immigrants you no longer hear in national Democratic Party politics. Rather than address those comments, Clinton simply explained that she sponsored the DREAM Act in multiple congressional sessions and voted for the 2007 comprehensive immigration bill co-written by Sen. Ted Kennedy. This deflection allowed Clinton, and the moderators, to pivot to Sanders' vote against that 2007 comprehensive immigration package and the path to citizenship included in it. The moderators showed a clip of Sanders on Lou Dobbs' CNN show in 2007--recall that Dobbs was the media's pre-eminent anti-""amnesty"" voice during that debate--saying, ""if wages are going down, I don't know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now."" Even as recently as 2007, the Democratic coalition was split on immigration reform, with opposition coming from major labor unions. Sanders took labor's side back then. By the 2013 reform effort, labor--and Sanders--had come around on the issue and supported reform. Sanders chalked his 2007 ""no"" vote to abuses in guest-worker programs that were ""akin to slavery."" He makes a strong point about H-2 guest-worker abuses, but that wasn't the whole story of his opposition to the package, and Clinton called him out on it. ""I think it's very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farm Workers, Dolores Huerta, and [other] leaders of the community would have promoted a bill that promoted modern slavery,"" she said. ""That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill."" Clinton also confronted Sanders for a 2006 vote for a fringe amendment to protect the Minutemen, a fringe vigilante border-patrol group. Sanders responded that it was ""horrific"" to suggest he would ever support such a group. (Sanders' spokesperson has told BuzzFeed that Sanders voted for it because he was told it was a ""meaningless thing."") One of the most difficult moments of the night for Sen. Clinton, though, was a perfect microcosm of the prominent role Hispanic voters now play in the Democratic coalition. Univision moderator Jorge Ramos--the most powerful Latino journalist in the country--asked Clinton to ""promise tonight that you won't deport children and that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record, and this time could I get a yes-or-no answer?"" Clinton artfully avoided giving a direct answer, instead, saying things like ""I do not have the same policy as the current administration does"" regarding its raids on families with children. ""But again, yes or no?"" Ramos followed up. ""Can you promise you won't deport children who are already here?"" ""I will not deport children,"" she finally said, looking uncomfortable as she said it. It was an impressive display of questioning from Ramos and one that puts Clinton in a box should she have the opportunity to govern. Would-be President Hillary Clinton will be smoked in Hispanic media if her administration deports one child who is already here illegally, and you could see her recognize this as she said it onstage. This is not the sort of questioning on which leading Democratic candidates would cave in the 2008 election. But that was a different Democratic Party.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/bernie_sanders_shock_michigan_upset_of_hillary_clinton.html	"Hillary Clinton was supposed to win the Michigan Democratic primary on Tuesday night by roughly 21 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. That average was comprised of any number of surveys that we now know to have been--each and every one of them--""crap polls,"" to use the proper political science term. Bernie Sanders won a narrow victory against Clinton in a race that FiveThirtyEight had projected Clinton had a 99 percent chance of winning. ""If Sanders winds up winning in Michigan, in fact,"" Nate Silver wrote Tuesday night as the surprisingly tight results began rolling in, ""it will count as among the greatest polling errors in primary history."" Well, there you go. Michigan is unquestionably Sanders' biggest win so far. It also demonstrated that he has made some necessary progress in expanding his coalition. The Sanders campaign had hoped that Northern black voters would be more receptive to his campaign message than black voters have been in the South. They were. In Mississippi, where exit polls showed 64 percent of Democratic primary voters were black, Clinton cleaned up with a full 90 percent support among black voters en route to a colossal 67-point victory. In Michigan, however--where black voters comprised a smaller but hardly insignificant 24 percent of the Democratic primary turnout--Sanders earned 30 percent of the black vote to Clinton's 65 percent. Sure, Clinton still led Sanders among black voters by a greater than two-to-one margin. But the results show that if Sanders can make even marginal progress among black voters in states outside the South, as he did in Michigan, this will be a considerably closer nominating race. Expect next week's Ohio Democratic primary, to conjure just one immediate example, to be a closer race than forecasted. The problem for Sanders is that even if he's shown that he can win big states outside the South, he's not showing that he can win them by much. Hillary Clinton has already won delegate-rich states like Texas and Georgia by large margins, basically wiping out whatever pickups Sanders has had, and she's run up the score in smaller contests largely based on support from black voters. As a result, she had already amassed a daunting lead of more than 200 pledged delegates heading into Tuesday night. (That doesn't even count her enormous margin among superdelegates, but Clinton's goal is and should be to win a majority of pledged delegates.) Winning the big prize on Tuesday night helps Sanders mostly in terms of horse-race narrative purposes: showing the world that he's not dead yet. But between Michigan and Mississippi, Sanders on net will lose ground to Clinton in the delegate race Tuesday night.* As of this writing Sanders is projected to take 63 delegates from Michigan to Clinton's 53. In Mississippi, however, Clinton is projected to take 28 delegates to Sanders' 1, as Sanders only barely crossed the state's 15 percent minimum threshold. These numbers will change a tad as the final votes are tallied, but right now they show Clinton netting 17 delegates between the two. Modest victories, no matter the size of the state, are not going to cut it for Sanders. He needs big victories in big states to cut hard into the pledged delegate lead that Clinton has accumulated. Even if he is able to pull off another squeaker in Ohio next week, Clinton is set to swamp him in the demographically and culturally different--and larger--state of Florida. Winning 30 percent of black voters in Michigan is a move in the right direction, but Sanders needs to start winning majorities of all demographic groups in places like California, New York, and Pennsylvania--all while continuing to win the smaller contests in places like Kansas and Oklahoma that he's had success with. Sanders' Michigan win was impressive and a total surprise. The fact that Sanders gave an impromptu press conference in Miami outside a hotel Tuesday night, rather than a victory speech in Detroit, tells you just how surprised his campaign was with its success, too. But victories like these on their own will not do it for him. He needs to take whatever narrative momentum he gains from tonight's win and snowball it into something much larger--a complete inversion of the way the contest has already played out, really. Otherwise, Sanders will serve, at best, as the Clinton of 2008: the candidate who got into a big hole early and was never able to dig out. *Correction, March 9, 2016: This article originally misstated that Idaho and Hawaii were holding their Democratic caucuses on March 8.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/the_gop_should_rally_around_ted_cruz_to_stop_trump.html	"One of the many problems with the Republican establishment's current ""everyone stay in"" strategy of blocking Donald Trump's presidential nomination is a limit of imagination. It envisions preventing Trump from reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination on the first convention ballot. It doesn't consider, however, what it would mean to try to deny Trump the nomination if he still has a significant delegate lead heading into the convention. Mitt Romney, the most notable supporter of this strategy, explained how it works in his anti-Trump speech last week. ""Given the current delegate-selection process,"" Romney said, ""this means that I would vote for Marco Rubio in Florida, for John Kasich in Ohio, and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state."" All three candidates stay in, then, and divvy up the work of defeating Trump depending on who is nearest to him in any particular contest. As Romney said, the big test for this strategy will be the winner-take-all contests in Ohio and Florida on March 15. But even if Rubio and Kasich can topple Trump in their respective home states and deny him those delicious 165 winner-take-all delegates, Trump will still be far ahead of both Kasich and Rubio. And Ted Cruz, the only candidate who's close to Trump in the current delegate count, won't gain any ground. The ""everyone stays in"" strategy, as elucidated by Romney and other anti-Trump leaders, might be a viable theory for stopping Trump's march to 1,237. But even if it gets from A to B, it offers no clear insight into getting from B to C: wresting the nomination from the delegate leader heading into the convention without spurring an uprising or a third-party bid. The party's real goal shouldn't just be to stop Trump from hitting 1,237. It should be for one of the remaining candidates to seize the delegate lead from him before they head into the convention, since the only fair outcome of a contested convention--one that each faction can swallow as equitably determined--is one in which the leader heading into Cleveland comes away with the nomination. The anti-Trumpers' goal, then, should be to ensure that Cruz is the delegate leader heading into the convention. Cruz is the only candidate close to Trump in terms of delegates and states won. Trump has won 12 states and 384 delegates to Cruz's six and 300. And the movement among anti-Trump voters appears headed in Cruz's direction. Even though Saturday night's four contests (Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Kentucky) posed more of a challenge to Trump than expected, Trump's support itself did not collapse. As the New York Times' Nate Cohn shows, Trump more or less hit his projected percentages in those states. The contests were only close because Cruz drank Rubio's milkshake. Cruz's surprise win in Maine--even if it was ""just a caucus""--indicates, too, that his brand of evangelical Tea Party conservatism may have a better chance of breaking out of the South than previously imagined. It will be important to see if Rubio's voters continue to migrate towards Cruz in Tuesday's contest in Michigan, a mostly blue Midwestern state. One Michigan poll released on Monday, from Monmouth, shows Cruz surging into second place with Rubio in a dismal fourth. If Rubio loses Florida, where he was already trailing and where a national Cruz surge may well deliver the final dagger, the GOP establishment will have little justification for trying to make Marcomentum happen anymore. Rubio already trails Trump by about 230 delegates; losing his home state would instantly jump whatever his margin is after this week's contests by 99 delegates. If Trump can put away Ohio, Rubio's deficit balloons by another 66 delegates. And if Trump wins Florida and Kasich wins Ohio, Rubio will be left fighting for the bronze medal with Kasich while Cruz and Trump hash it out at the big boys' table. If Rubio is finished after Florida, it's hard to say whether it would help Cruz more to keep Rubio in the race to some undetermined date or have him drop out. The point is that whatever action Rubio and the party establishment take would need to be done in the service of Cruz if the goal really is to prevent Trump from winning the nomination. But would the establishment even prefer Cruz to Trump? Cruz's Senate colleagues hate him, and with justification. Cruz's three-year, cynical strategy as a senator has been to use his colleagues as a foil against which to build his anti-Washington brand. But the purported thinking in January that the GOP establishment would somehow prefer Trump to Cruz was the product of a different, pre-voting time in which the establishment believed it had more options. There was more leeway to get cutesy with scenarios that would eliminate both Cruz and Trump by feigning to prefer the latter: by arguing that, say, it would have been wise to knock out Cruz in Iowa so as to pave the way for an establishment candidate to defeat Trump one-on-one. That didn't happen. Now that the choice really is narrowing to either Trump or Cruz, we're seeing a different story. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who hates Cruz, is absolutely on Cruz's team in a situation where Rubio's hopes are nil (the situation we're almost in). ""At the end of the day, I know what I'm getting with Ted Cruz,"" Graham said on Sunday's Meet the Press. ""If Ted is the alternative to Trump, at least he's a conservative Republican."" And Romney has said that he would ""absolutely"" support Cruz over Trump for the nomination, because he is a ""real Republican."" Cruz exists on a recognizable political spectrum. But that doesn't even get to the root of it. More importantly to people like Romney and Graham is that Cruz is competent and capable of serving as president without ending the world. Responsible people, no matter their policy differences, can envision Cruz getting through any given day in the White House with the world still intact. With Trump, you can never be quite sure that he won't initiate a nuclear holocaust because, say, the president of China made a passing joke about his hair. Cruz might be too far to the right to win a general election, but Trump is unstable, embarrassing, and frightening. The worst case scenario for Republicans with a Cruz nomination is a defeat with dignity that at least gives movement conservatives their man; the worst case scenario for Republicans with a Trump nomination is either a humiliating loss or a frightening win that invites the apocalypse. Cruz is looking more and more like the only vehicle available for stopping Trump. The party should do what it can to give him the delegate lead heading into the convention.

""It is the Republican Party whose failings now threaten the well-being of American democracy,"" neoconservative Robert Kagan wrote in the Washington Post last week. ""Can party leaders now rise above the party to save it?"" The next day in the Post, conservative columnist Kathleen Parker chimed in: ""The death of this party--of know-nothing ugliness and outright fascist rhetoric--might be a blessing, a cleansing of the palate before a resurrection of the party of limited government and individual liberty."" At the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, this weekend, the Christian right radio host Steve Deace told me, ""It grieves my soul that Trump is being successful by playing to the stereotypes that liberals have of conservatives."" Certainly, Trump was not popular at the annual gathering of conservative activists and politicians. He came in a distant third in CPAC's straw poll, with 15 percent of the vote. (Ted Cruz won with 40 percent, and Marco Rubio won a rare second-place finish with 30 percent.) Had he not canceled his scheduled appearance on Saturday, some activists were planning to walk out of his speech; he almost certainly would have been booed. Yet after spending three days talking to many conservatives at CPAC, I've concluded that the opposition to Trump is not nearly as staunch as we might expect. Most of the Trump opponents I spoke to didn't see him as a paradigm-shattering threat to the Republic. They simply saw him as their less-preferred presidential candidate. That's why it's a mistake to view the GOP as entirely polarized between the Trump and not-Trump wings. Kellyanne Conway, the conservative pollster and president of a pro-Cruz super PAC, told me that Trump is the second choice of most Cruz voters. ""The one-two punch of Trump and Cruz has shown that this is a conservative populist party,"" she told me. Of Mitt Romney's warning about the dangers of Trumpism, Conway says, ""If Gov. Romney really thought his message was going to be so resonant among the conservative faithful, he would have delivered it here at CPAC. But then he would have risked being booed. And he would have risked running into a movement that's fairly unified in its thirst to beat Hillary Clinton in the fall."" In other words, despite the protestations of aghast intellectuals and religious purists, conservatives will eventually fall in line behind Trump if that's what it takes to win. I thought Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a central figure in right-wing organizing, might express qualms about Trump. After all, Norquist is an advocate of immigration reform; his wife is a Palestinian Muslim, and he is loathed by Islamophobes for his efforts to bring Muslims into the Republican Party. In the course of a 45-mintue conversation, however, he was far more disdainful of the anti-Trump forces on the right than of Trump himself. ""There's a difference in the conservative movement between structures and people that actually move votes, and people who like to write op-eds and give speeches and are on TV and pontificate,"" he told me. ""A chattering class that doesn't move votes is unhappy that this other guy who goes on TV for a reality show moves more votes than they have."" In the end, Norquist says he's comfortable with any of the four remaining Republican candidates. ""I think if you look at any of the guys running for president, none of them will steal your guns, they'll all cut taxes, they'll all do entitlement reform on means-tested entitlements,"" he says. ""They have a different temperature on the way they speak about immigration, but at the end of the day, you're going to have border security and more guest-worker programs. Anybody's better than Hillary. The counter-argument is a little tough to take from somebody who just thought it up last week."" At CPAC, the real anger was reserved for Republican elites who might try to manipulate a brokered convention to anoint a candidate from the party's establishment. ""The state of the Republican Party is not sound,"" right-wing pundit Michelle Malkin announced from the CPAC stage, her lips curled in contempt. She accused ""D.C. power brokers"" of engaging in a ""fragging"" against the conservative grassroots. ""GOP elites who always demand that conservatives hold their nose won't do it themselves when they don't get the choices they want,"" she said. In the end, though, I think Malkin is wrong: Most GOP elites will hold their noses and vote Trump if that's what it takes to stay in power. On Friday evening, I wormed my way into a group of middle-aged establishment conservatives--veterans of the George W. Bush White House and high-level Republican congressional staffs--who were drinking at the CPAC hotel lobby bar. One of them was pro-Trump, and two were opposed to him. I asked one of the Trump foes if he fears violence if Trump is denied the nomination at the Republican convention. He rolled his eyes like it was the most melodramatic question he ever heard; to him, whatever happens, this is not a potential emergency situation. ""I just want to beat Hillary,"" he shrugged. If fascism is really coming to America, conservatives are not going to be on the front lines against it. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/why_donald_trump_can_get_away_with_skipping_cpac.html	"The attendees of 2016's Conservative Political Action Conference are not particularly surprised that Donald Trump has chosen to drop out of his scheduled speaking slot on Saturday amid rumors that protesting conferencegoers might walk out of his speech. ""Interestingly enough, and this is just a coincidence, my son said last night, '[Trump]'ll skip,' "" Steve Stechschulte, director of the Ohio chapter of the Convention of States, told me at CPAC on Friday shortly after it was announced that Trump was skipping. ""He predicted it. Because of the walkout thing."" The Trump campaign announced midday Friday that it would be adding an event in Wichita, Kansas, prior to that state's Saturday caucus before departing for Orlando, Florida. ""Because of this,"" Trump's campaign said, ""he will not be able to speak at CPAC as he has done for many consecutive years."" There had indeed been chatter of a conservative walkout during Trump's speech on Saturday. William Temple, a fixture at conservative conferences who dresses in Revolutionary War costumes and, as he told my colleague Michelle Goldberg on Thursday, considers Trump a ""Mussolini-like figure,"" was going to lead the charge. Temple did the same during Jeb Bush's speech at CPAC 2015. The Bush walkout was not especially noticeable, though, and this one might not have been any splashier. One can't imagine that paying customers, many of whom traveled great distances, would have wanted to skip out on a typically entertaining Trump show en masse, no matter how nauseating the prospect of him as their standard-bearer would have been. One group of college students from Miami University of Ohio were totally bummed. ""For real?"" they said when I broke the news, as we were waiting in a hallway logjam ahead of Gov. John Kasich's speech. Only one of the five was seriously considering him as a candidate, but they all ""definitely wanted to see his speech."" Sam Holdeman, director of the Michigan College Republicans, was similarly disappointed that Trump couldn't come out. ""There's a lot of young millennials here, so I feel like it would be a great opportunity to really get involved with all the young kids. So I don't know why he skipped out, I really don't. I think it's very unfortunate."" He similarly chalked it up to the possibility of a walkout or ""large booing."" Saul Anuzis, the former head of the Michigan Republican Party who twice ran for chairman of the Republican National Committee, is a Cruz supporter and naturally didn't think much of Trump's decision to flee to Kansas. ""You've got an outsider like Trump, who's a populist who's switched on a lot of positions that people are concerned about, so they want to learn more,"" Anuzis said. ""And the fact that he's not willing to show up and address the pre-eminent conservative group in America, right in the middle of primary season, I think is a horrible sign."" He added cheekily that Trump's mistake, of course, was ""good for us,"" meaning Cruz. After I finished speaking with Anuzis, Cruz's chief of staff, Paul Teller, slipped me his card but didn't have anything else to add. Anuzis ""said it perfectly,"" he laughed. Winning the support of movement conservatives isn't as central to Trump's success as it is to Cruz's hopes for slowing that success. To skip CPAC in the middle of a contentious presidential primary would be a major impediment to most Republican presidential candidates' chances, but the strength of Trump's coalition rests with disaffected white, working-class voters, not the sort of ideological conservatives who demand their candidates be able to quote Friedman and Hayek off the top of their heads. As Stechschulte said, there's no way that skipping CPAC--and the general impression that Trump is hiding from the conservative grassroots--is going to matter to his ""rock-ribbed supporters."" Michael Navjar, sporting a red ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"" cap and a T-shirt bearing the flag of Texas, was one of the few truly dedicated Trump supporters I've talked to at CPAC. I broke the news to him that Trump had canceled his appearance. Was he upset? Absolutely--at CPAC. ""It's CPAC's fault,"" Navjar said. If they couldn't stop the walkout from happening, ""why should he [come]?"" Navjar seemed to believe that there was some serious foul play going down against Trump at CPAC. He pulled up a photo on his phone of a red-and-blue bumper sticker that read ""Make America Great Again""--but in support of Ted Cruz's campaign. How are ""they,"" whoever they are, allowed to steal Trump's slogan? It's just a set-up here, he said. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/donald_trump_s_terrifying_and_distinctly_american_authoritarianism.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. In 1935, Sinclair Lewis published It Can't Happen Here, a novel today more referred to than read, which imagined fascism coming to the U.S. The movement's leader is Buzz Windrip, a populist demagogue who promises ""to make America a proud, rich land again,"" punish nations that defy him, and raise wages very high while keeping prices very low. You can't read Lewis' novel today without flashes of Trumpian recognition. Windrip is a demagogic huckster, ""an inspired guesser at what political doctrines the people would like,"" who understands how to manipulate the media and considers the truth an irrelevancy. His constituency of economically dispossessed white men moos at his xenophobic nationalism and preposterous promises. After he wins the 1936 election, Windrip moves to assert control over the press, lock up his opponents, and put competent businessmen in charge of the country. Though the novel is in truth not a very good one, Lewis develops it around a key insight: that if fascism came to the US, it would be as a variation on American themes, not European ones. The American man on horseback would be more Huey Long than Benito Mussolini, a folksy opportunist rather than a red-faced ideologue. Lewis was shrewd in guessing that an American fascist leader would likely declare himself an opponent of European fascism. This is a point that some of those accusing Donald Trump of fascism--including many on the right--misunderstand. Sure, Trump may retweet the odd quote from Il Duce and wonder why anyone would object. Admittedly, his rallies teeter on the edge of racial violence. Again this week, black protesters were forcibly ejected from his events with the help of white supremacist thugs. True, the world leaders Mr. Trump admires are the dictators, not the democrats. Certainly, he sounds like a dictator himself. But Trump does not draw on traditions of European totalitarianism or even appear to know anything about them. He is not consumed with historical grievances; he's not an anti-Semite; he hasn't tried to build a mass party; and he doesn't demand the restoration of tradition or an old moral order. Indeed, as a reality TV star and cyberbully on his third wife, he is himself a good illustration of the breakdown of any moral order possibly remaining. Rather, Trump represents what autocratic attitudes look like in a modern American context. He is unfriendly toward the free market, the free press, and the free exercise of religion while paying lip service to these values. He is xenophobic, conspiratorial in his worldview, admiring of violence and torture, contemptuous of the weak, and unwilling to tolerate criticism or peaceful dissent--but all in the name of correcting excesses of tolerance. Various global and historical comparisons shed light on his style and thinking: Peron, de Gaulle, Silvio Berlusconi, Vladimir Putin, and others. But Trump isn't importing Latin caudillismo or Russian despotism. He bullies those who resist him in the contemporary vernacular of American celebrity culture. This is why those arguing that Trump's policies are more moderate than those of his rivals Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio miss the point. Trump's authoritarianism is an amalgam not of left and right but of wacko left and wacko right: He thinks that George Bush was to blame for 9/11 and that Muslims should be barred from the U.S. Believing both of those things does not make Mr. Trump a centrist--it makes him an eclectic extremist. When it comes to policies, he actually has none in the conventional sense. The conflict in the 2016 campaign is no longer Trump versus his Republican opponents; it is now Trump versus the American political system. That system is on the verge of missing its best opportunity to spit him out. Since Super Tuesday, the GOP's reaction to Trump has been mildly heartening, with anti-Trump ads on television and principled politicians like Mitt Romney denouncing him amid torrents of personal abuse. Three cheers for Sen. Lindsey Graham, who says Trump is a ""nut job"" and that the GOP has gone ""batshit crazy."" Fellow Republicans have taken to calling Chris Christie, who cravenly endorsed Trump last week, a ""Vichy Republican."" But this is all probably too little, too late. If sane Republicans fail to derail Trump, that job will fall to Hillary Clinton and the November electorate. Fifty-five percent say they would never vote for Trump, according to a YouGov poll. Nonetheless, there is now a nontrivial risk that he could win the election. The American founders designed a constitutional order to prevent the exercise of tyrannical power. But the country has arguably never had to contend with a dictatorial president, as opposed to a president's dictatorial acts. One can believe in the efficacy of the system without wishing to see it tested in this way. An America in which Trump can represent one of the major parties feels like a very different country from the one many of us thought we lived in. Like a lot of people, I was much too complacent. It can happen here, and it might. *Correction, March 4, 2016: Due to a photo provider error, this article's photo caption originally misstated that Milford was in Iowa. It is in New Hampshire."

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/john_kasich_is_trying_to_destroy_the_gop_to_save_it.html	"John Kasich finally enters the primary spotlight on Tuesday night as a critical player, at least in his home state of Ohio. Recent polling in the Buckeye State ahead of Tuesday's winner-take-all, 66-delegate Republican primary shows the governor either tied or narrowly leading Donald Trump. A dead heat in one's home state doesn't sound like anything to brag about, because it isn't. But given that polling trends are in Kasich's favor and the fact that he has the machinery of the Ohio Republican Party and Marco Rubio's (unrequited) support, he is well-positioned to edge out Trump. More importantly, Kasich is in far better shape to win his home state on Tuesday than Rubio is his. In the unusually important race for a distant third-place finish in overall delegates before July's Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Kasich would begin to catch and eventually surpass Rubio if the senator drops out after a likely roasting in his own home state. For Kasich, eventually overtaking Rubio in delegates would position him as the only remaining ""establishment"" candidate in a race tumbling toward a contested convention. Don't be confused by Kasich's grinning, cheery attitude. For him to do what he needs to do to win the nomination, which is presumably the reason why he's still bothering to run for president, he would have to shatter the Republican Party, ostensibly in order to save it. Right now Kasich is fourth overall, trailing Rubio by 100 delegates. After Tuesday's contests, a majority of delegates will have already been allocated, and Cruz and Trump combined can be expected to continue eating the lion's share of what's left. That will make it nearly impossible for Kasich to catch up to either Cruz or Trump in the delegate count, but he can certainly surpass Rubio. Kasich closes two-thirds of the gap between him and Rubio just with an Ohio win and a Trump win in Florida. If Rubio then drops out, Kasich could try to build his delegate count in remaining moderate or establishment-friendly states like Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, Indiana, Oregon, Washington, and most importantly, California. The bronze medal--and what remains of the ""establishment"" imprimatur heading into a possible contested convention--would be his. Then it would be a matter of what function Kasich intended to perform from his third-place perch with his few hundred delegates. It could be that he's just staying in the race to help the anti-Trump wing of the Republican Party deny the race-baiting mogul delegates. If his intentions were purely selfless, though, he would drop out after winning Ohio and start working--along with Rubio, and everyone else--to boost Cruz's chances in a one-on-one contest against Trump. But dropping out after winning Ohio and witnessing Rubio crash and burn in Florida would be both highly weird and something that Kasich has shown no indication of doing. He apparently still fancies the prospect of winning the nomination through the only remaining available route for him. ""Could you think of anything cooler than a [contested] convention?"" Kasich said earlier this month at the Conservative Political Action Conference. One can imagine vast numbers of people who can think of cooler things than a contested Republican convention. For starters: Trump voters, who so far represent a strong plurality of Republican voters and against whose preference such a convention would be orchestrated. Also: Cruz voters, who may not like the idea of a Trump nomination but understand that the GOP establishment wouldn't have much use for him in a contested convention scenario, either. Here is the ugly way that such a scenario might play out to the benefit of John Kasich. The party establishment, as represented by 1,237-plus delegates, would dismiss both Trump and Cruz as unacceptable, despite them finishing first and second in the delegate count and together representing the preferences of a majority of Republican voters. Unless the party migrates back to this joker, or to some other ""white knight"" option, Kasich would be the party's default man. The image of the party leaping past Trump and Cruz and nominating an establishment-approved distant-third-place finisher in a cycle defined by hatred of the political establishment would in and of itself lead to party-destroying levels of rage among GOP voters. The hilariously corrupt process through which such a circumvention of Republican popular will would be accomplished would intensify that anger tenfold. In a Bloomberg Politics piece published Monday morning, Sasha Issenberg takes an early look at how individual campaigns would attempt to wrangle free-agent delegates in the absence of official party ""brokers."" Though the national GOP establishment has been defanged as a political force, state-level party establishments are still competent political forces. As Issenberg writes, state party establishments--led by the 31 sitting Republican governors--are able to stack delegations with friendly faces malleable to top-down pressure. Delegates will be Republican Party loyalists, and their votes can be bought with promises of advancement within the Republican Party or say ... money. ""There is nothing in the RNC's rules that prohibits delegates from cutting a deal for their votes,"" Issenberg writes, ""and lawyers say it is unlikely that federal anti-corruption laws would apply to convention horse-trading."" Noted billionaire Donald J. Trump would seem likely to have the upper hand if it comes down to winning delegates through pure cash bribes. But delegates who side with Trump in a contested convention also risk reprimand from local and state party organizations. Kasich's path to the presidential nomination involves winning his home state and perhaps a handful more, racking up a few hundred delegates, getting the party establishment to change certain rules at the convention to allow his name to even be entered for the nomination, and then using the full corrupt heft of various party establishments to offer money and jobs to delegates in order to corral a majority. It would also mean leaping past the two top delegate earners as allocated by voting. All of this would be defended as allowed within the Republican Party's ""rules,"" which will not be an acceptable excuse to Republican voters who already believe that the official GOP is a rigged, corrupt institution. One can hardly think of a better validation of that view than a Kasich nomination and the substantially undemocratic strings that would have to be pulled to get there."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/against_liberal_schadenfreude_democrats_shouldn_t_be_gleeful_that_the_gop.html	"If you had told liberal Americans six months ago that the Republican presidential front-runner would be Donald Trump, the most common reaction would likely have been some combination of pragmatic glee and existential horror. Trump is the least electable Republican presidential candidate in a generation, a sinister demagogue who would almost certainly lose to Hillary Clinton in November. But Trump's demagoguery also frightens liberals, and many centrists: His success has revealed an ugly side of America, full of prejudice, suspicion, and hate, all of it terrifyingly on display Friday night at his canceled rally in Chicago. And yet, as the campaign has worn on and Trump has emerged as the leader in the delegate count, another liberal reaction to his rise has emerged: schadenfreude. Trump's nomination could very well lead to the collapse of the Republican Party, which many liberals view as an increasingly debased institution that deserves not merely to lose elections but to be permanently vanquished. Even more satisfying to liberal rubberneckers is the idea that the Republicans have been the architects of their own demise--that this is a classic case of chickens coming home to roost. A party that for decades fomented and benefited from racial resentment is now seeing its political future potentially collapse thanks to the very forces it nurtured. ""Chickens, Home to Roost"" was actually the title of a Maureen Dowd column in which she opined, ""The most enjoyable thing about the Trump phenomenon has been watching him make monkeys out of a lot of people who had it coming."" Even the conservatives who have stood up to Trump and attempted to slow his march to the nomination were, in the past, Trump enablers. Mitt Romney made nice with Trump out of political expedience well after the latter's ""birther"" attacks on Obama. William Kristol remains a steadfast admirer of the Bush administration's policies on ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" which Trump has been criticized for supporting under their proper name, torture. They are both fine examples of a party that long ago lost its soul in the process of losing its way. Haven't these men earned this comeuppance for their hypocrisy--and is this not a moment for liberals to rejoice in the karmic justice of it all? Certainly the GOP and its supporters deserve to be called out for the party's often ugly past and for setting the stage for Trump. But those liberals who find themselves rooting for Trump, in the hope that his continued success will only further damage the GOP, are playing with fire--and putting their self-satisfaction ahead of the interests of the country. Even if you despise the Republican Party and what it stands for, Trump is a different beast. His violent rhetoric, which seems to have infected everyone from his ardent supporters (who have turned his rallies into spectacles and, increasingly, melees) to his campaign manager (who is accused of assaulting a reporter), is uniquely frightening. He must be defeated at all costs. Try to imagine a Trump presidency the day after a major, 9/11-like terrorist attack. There is simply no telling what the man would or could do. He has already threatened to go after his enemies if elected, promising a sort of Nixon-but-worse approach to governance. In the event of terrorism, how far would he go to curb civil liberties? What insane foreign policy idea would he dream up and pursue? Sure, George W. Bush curtailed civil liberties and invaded Iraq. But that's the point. Trump is a more hateful person than Bush and threatens to be even less bound by democratic checks and balances than Bush was. Even without an attack, Trump could move the United States closer to what Fareed Zakaria has called an ""illiberal democracy,"" a country with regular elections but little regard for the people or the institutions of state, which the leadership can ignore at will. (The current list of countries with illiberal elected leaders stretches from Russia to Turkey to India.) Recent American history has not featured a candidate who, if victorious, could fundamentally alter the country's character in such a way. Some schadenfreude-soaked liberals will argue that Trump could never get elected. Maybe so, though the Republican establishment was not long ago just as smug in such a conclusion. But even if Trump doesn't win the presidency, it's not clear that a shattered Republican Party is good for liberalism, or the country, however satisfying it might be. In the short term, Hillary Clinton is likely to benefit. But there is no guarantee that whatever emerges from the rubble of Republican collapse will be any better, or any less hateful, than what came before it. Two-party systems require two healthy parties. Rot would increasingly infect the Democratic Party if it had no real opposition. It's easy to calculate the well-being of a country by looking at its entitlement spending or investments in infrastructure; you could even argue that Trump might be marginally better on these issues than a conservative firebrand like Ted Cruz. But how do you measure the effect on a nation's character of Muslims going on Facebook to express fear about what a Trump nomination would mean for their safety, or children wondering aloud whether their mixed-race parents will face discrimination in Trump's America. (I am using examples from my life, but everyone has their own.) These things don't show up in Government Accountability Office reports, but they matter. And they are worth remembering when you're tempted to laugh at the latest Trump stunt or insult. At least until the primary season is over, the only true opposition to Trump can come from his fellow Republicans. They have hardly covered themselves in glory as of late, and, collectively, they are partially to blame for the beast that has been unleashed on us all. But the distance from ""the Republicans had it coming"" to ""the Republicans are all as bad as Trump"" is too close for comfort. Trump is a unique danger, and any pleasure we take in his rise should be balanced by taking stock of the real threat he poses."	It Was Once Easy For Liberals to Root for Trump to Blow Up the GOP.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/donald_trump_is_right_we_ve_had_enough_debates.html	"The morning after the surprisingly civil 12th Republican debate, Donald Trump woke up and said, ""I think we've had enough debates."" ""I think it will be nice to finish off with [Thursday's debate]. ... It was just a really nice way to finish off the debate season. But I really think it's enough debates. I don't think there's any reason for the debates,"" he added. He makes a strong case. I don't say that just because I, personally, am tired of covering debate nights. That's only a modest 80, 85 percent of it. It's because, as Trump said Friday morning, ""[H]ow many times do you have to give the same answer to the same question?"" It's not just that candidates have made their positions on the issues clear by this point. It's that they've made their cases--substantive, stylistic, and comparative--fully. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Trump have used every argument for their own candidacies and against the others' candidacies that's available to them. The Republican presidential primary has been fully litigated. A recognition that everything that's going to be tried has been tried was implicit in each candidate's self-presentation Thursday night. Rubio has tried being Hopeful Marco, Angry Foreboding Marco, and Sassy Insult Marco. The latter two Marcos didn't work for him. Neither did Hopeful Marco, really, but it was the one that established his thus far unmet potential. He returned to it Thursday night as his last, best hope for translating that potential into real support. He spoke convincingly about the need not to alienate Muslims. When the topic turned to the anger of the electorate, he called on the party to use ""the anger to motivate us, not to define us,"" and he somehow parlayed that into one of his starry-eyed riffs about the glory of America. ""My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky. One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon,"" Rubio said. ""You know what he said when he saw that? He said, 'Americans can do anything. Americans can do anything.' There is no problem before us we cannot solve, and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation."" When Rubio wasn't saber-rattling against various foreign entities, he stuck to these largely inclusive, albeit cheesy, set pieces. He did not bother to mock Trump, only disagree with him, and he and Cruz largely avoided their usual bickering about who is the real amnesty-lover. They've already been through it, time and time again. Cruz, meanwhile, continued making his point that he is the one true conservative on the case. When he did attack, it was, as usual, to call out Trump for his heretical anti-conservative positions or his previous support for Democrats. He criticized Trump, again, for ""funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment,"" which makes it ""very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington."" Trump responded with something about how Cruz supports amnesty. Later, Cruz hit Trump, again, for saying that ""he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal"" or that he ""wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians."" Trump responded, again, that he is a deal-maker and that his goal is to make the best deals in all possible deal-making scenarios. Kasich once again showed that he is the most qualified candidate in the field. Whether you agree with him or not, he is far more fluent in domestic and foreign policy issues than the others. Majorities of Republican primary voters will likely continue to not care. But the case has been made. The 12th debate may have been the first in which you did not see any candidate attempt a game-changer or deploy some dramatic tactic intended to shake up the race. After 12 debates, everything--every revelation, every stylistic maneuver--has been tried. The remaining primary voters have their choice among hopeful conservative Marco Rubio, pure conservative Ted Cruz, experienced John Kasich, and whatever Donald Trump is. It was a two-hour closing argument. See more of Slate's Republican primary coverage."	"Donald Trump Thinks ""We've Had Enough Debates."" He's Right."	['Trump', 'Cruz', 'Israel', 'Rubio', 'Kasich']	[]

How should anti-Trump Republicans respond? Trump's rivals, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich, have all pledged to support the Republican nominee. This has put Rubio and Cruz in particular in an awkward position, as both have warned that Trump, among many other bad things, is a man who cynically preys on the hopes of the weak and vulnerable. Unless Rubio and Cruz are willing to concede that these charges are overblown, it seems more than a little odd that they'd be willing to put them aside come November. Granted, they may well believe that a Democratic victory would be worse than a Trump victory. But there are many other Republican voters--tens of millions of them, potentially--who will disagree and who will hold their noses and vote for a Democratic presidential candidate, will choose to abstain, or will vote for a minor-party candidate. It is this last possibility that I find most intriguing. In the new issue of National Review, Ramesh Ponnuru argues that Trump's conservative opponents must at least consider backing a third-party conservative. ""[T]he most important reason to back a conservative third-party run is not to affect the outcome of the November elections,"" writes Ponnuru. ""It's to demonstrate that conservatism stands for something better than Trump."" But who would be willing to take on the thankless task of mounting a third-party challenge? I am increasingly convinced that Mitt Romney, Trump's most scathing Republican critic, is the man for that particular job. Romney is known for his risk aversion, and it is admittedly difficult to imagine the GOP's 2012 standard-bearer launching an independent campaign. Running as a third-party candidate would be expensive, and to say that Romney would be an underdog would be an understatement. Romney has already exposed himself and his family to intense scrutiny and the exhausting grind of a presidential campaign on two occasions, so his loved ones would surely question his sanity. By standing against Trump, he would invite a level of vitriol that would make his last bid for the presidency look like a breeze. Nevertheless, Romney should run. And if he were to run as himself--a pragmatic problem solver with a long record of success in business and in government--there is a chance, albeit a slim one, that he might actually succeed. There are a huge number of voters who are desperate for a different candidate. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey reported that two-thirds of registered voters can't see themselves supporting Trump while 56 percent feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. Among Republicans, 43 percent hold a negative opinion of Trump, and a quarter believe that a Trump victory would ""mostly bring the wrong kind of change."" In a Trump versus Clinton race, anti-Trump conservatives might be tempted to find a hard-right candidate to serve as their champion, but they'd be wise to find someone who could plausibly attract centrist voters and who would have some meaningful base of support. Romney fits the bill perfectly. Romney's experience as a corporate turnaround artist was used against him in 2012, but it would surely help him in a race against Trump. Indeed, Romney could argue that he is the only candidate who understands what it would take to rebuild America's industrial base and to punish China for turning a blind eye to intellectual property theft. During his 2012 campaign, Romney was cautious in making the case for economic nationalism, partly because it was anathema to many elite conservatives. In the season of Trump, Romney would be free to make this case more vigorously. Then there is Romney's potential appeal to devoutly religious voters. The GOP primaries have illustrated an underappreciated divide: Though Trump has fared well among voters who don't go to church regularly, he has won relatively little support among those who do. It could be that more observant Christians see Trump's professions of faith as insincere in light of the colorful life he's led and that they recoil from his arrogance and chauvinism. Regardless of why these voters have rejected Trump so far, Romney's squeaky-clean image may prove more appealing in a three-way race. Many believed that Romney's Mormon faith would alienate evangelical Christians in 2012, but exit polls found that he actually won 79 percent of the evangelical vote. It is also easy to imagine Romney winning states in the mountain West and the Great Plains, which have thus far proven resistant to Trump's charms. Why would Romney be a stronger third-party candidate than, say, Michael Bloomberg? As a self-made billionaire entrepreneur, Bloomberg is everything Donald Trump pretends to be, and his presence in the race would have done much to deflate Trump's claims to greatness. The trouble is that Bloomberg would be unacceptable to conservatives. Though Bloomberg sees himself as a no-nonsense centrist, his faith in technocratic fixes--such as his effort to regulate away plus-sized sugary soft drinks--and his views on social issues place him firmly on the center-left. The former New York City mayor ultimately concluded, correctly, that if he were to run for president against Trump and Clinton, he'd likely help elect Trump, as his views on immigration and gun control are all but identical to those of the presumptive Democratic nominee. Given the central role immigration has played in this election, a third-party candidate would do well to stake out a position distinct from that of the GOP and the Democratic Party. In Miami this week, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders said they would not deport unauthorized immigrants with clean criminal records. Essentially, they seem to be suggesting that there is no need for immigrants to go through the proper legal channels, provided they are nonviolent. It is not difficult to imagine such a policy setting off a migration wave that would match those seen in Germany, Sweden, and other European democracies over the past year and that has contributed to a sharp increase in anti-immigration sentiment in those countries. Trump, in contrast, has called for mass deportation of unauthorized immigrants currently residing in the U.S. The vast majority of Americans would favor a position between these two extremes. Here is where Romney could step in. Though Romney was staunchly opposed to amnesty for unauthorized immigrants, his approach was less draconian than Trump's. Romney was quick to remind voters that he favored sensible reforms that would make life easier for legal immigrants while also cracking down on those who enter the country unlawfully. This is a stance that would be broadly acceptable to right-of-center voters, but it might also appeal to some Democrats. If you don't think Romney has it in him to break ranks with the GOP, consider that he made a point of breaking with party orthodoxy when he ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1994. In a debate with Ted Kennedy, Romney noted that he had been an independent in the Reagan-Bush years and that he was ""not trying to return to Reagan-Bush."" In his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, Romney often seemed to be fighting his own instincts to fit the demands of Republican primary voters. As a third-party candidate, he would have a much freer hand. He could try taking a page from his father, George Romney, who ran for governor of Michigan as a centrist reformer, a race he won by a comfortable margin. The elder Romney devoted his time in office to bettering the lives of Michigan's poorest citizens, including the children and grandchildren of black migrants from the Deep South. During his short-lived 1968 presidential campaign, he promised to spark an economic revival in the inner cities, rural communities, and American Indian reservations that had been left behind by the postwar boom. If Mitt channeled George's inclusive spirit in 2016, he could offer a way forward for the post-Trump right. Just as the death of the Whig Party led to the rise of Abraham Lincoln's Republicans, an independent Romney campaign could pave the way for a new center-right party free of the GOP's baggage. There is one final reason Romney could prove to be an impressive third-party candidate. Trump has profited enormously from free media coverage in the GOP primaries. But in a general election, he will be facing a well-funded Democratic opponent. Though Trump insists he has the ability to fund his own campaign, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest his net worth is not nearly as awe-inspiring as he claims. Some Republican megadonors are making peace with the idea of Trump as the party's nominee. Others, however, see him as a profoundly dangerous figure. One could imagine at least some conservative donors defecting from the GOP and supporting Romney, particularly if they believe he has a shot at pulling off an upset. Do I believe that Mitt Romney will run for president yet again? No, I do not. But I believe he should. He would be a formidable candidate if he chose to join the campaign, and he would give anti-Trump conservatives a reason to fight this fall. See more of Slate's Republican primary coverage."

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/why_the_gop_establishment_was_so_determined_to_make_marco_rubio_happen.html	"For the past few months, the fate of the republic, or at least of the Republican Party, has seemed to hang on Marco Rubio. Even now, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that remains the desperate view of a swath of the party's eminences grises and billionaire benefactors. They still imagine themselves, and their candidate, as the noble protagonists in a twilight struggle against the forces of proto-fascism and yokelism. Only by spending wildly and forcing the nominating process into the backrooms of a brokered convention can they save their party from a descent into unprocessed insanity. Marco Rubio's whole career had been building to this moment. He was long viewed as the party's salvation--or as the cliche goes, he's the Republican Obama. On paper, he made for a compelling messiah: demographically useful, salable to the ultras yet charismatic enough for a general, and, on top of everything else, intellectually adept. Of course, that elite faith in Rubio now seems comically misguided. He looked both puerile and ineffectual--like Little Marco, actually--in his flailing efforts to take down the bully. Donald Trump's hostile takeover of the party is a pretty fair summation of the recent history of the Republicans, the volcanic explosion of all the nasty sentiments that the party nurtured over the decades. But it's also telling that Marco Rubio came to represent the establishment's idea of sanity. Despite his sheen, there's nothing remotely moderate about Rubio. It would be a mistake to think of him as a denizen of the center-right. His agenda, both domestic and foreign, is at least as right wing as Ted Cruz's program, if not more. His vision lacks much of Donald Trump's overt cruelty, but in its own way it would terrifyingly remake American government. As the establishment mounts a final, doomed effort to prop up the Rubio campaign, it's worth examining the object of their devotion and what he reveals about his backers. Rubio would have easily been the most radical nominee in Republican Party history. Where John McCain and Mitt Romney faked some of their severely conservative campaign forays, Marco Rubio is a true believer. He became the face of an establishment that has drifted so far to the right that it might never return. ""No one's going to force me to stop talking about God."" Marco Rubio felt like he had caved to the forces of political correctness. During his long tenure as speaker of the Florida House, he bit his tongue and betrayed his heart. But on his way out the door, he was determined to speak out. ""It had taken me too long,"" he later wrote in his memoir, An American Son. For his valedictory address in the fall of 2008, he would turn the dais into a pulpit and deliver the sermon he regretted never preaching. ""God is real,"" he declared, ""God is real. I don't care what courts across this country say, I don't care what laws we pass--God is real."" The address culminated in a rousing peroration about the necessary presence of religion in the public sphere. ""God doesn't care about the Supreme Court of Florida,"" he said. ""He cares about them. But he doesn't care about their rulings. And he doesn't care about the Supreme Court of the United States. You can't keep him out."" The speech wasn't a stray musing. Earlier that year, Rubio went to work on behalf of Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign--hardly the expedient choice for a career-minded politician from South Florida. (Jeb Bush, by contrast, had endorsed Mitt Romney.) Huckabee was an evangelical preacher who touted himself as a ""Christian Leader"" with a ""biblical worldview."" A YouTube clip shows a boyish Rubio leading a group of placard waving volunteers on a New Hampshire street corner. ""Quite frankly this has become more like a movement,"" he tells the camera. Two years later, the very same home-schoolers who formed the backbone of the Huckabee campaign provided the earliest foot soldiers for Rubio's 2010 Senate bid. Rubio's religious life has been unfairly tagged as evidence of his desire to please everyone. It's true that he's hardly charted a linear path to church. As a child in Las Vegas, he enthusiastically immersed himself in Mormonism--reading canonical texts, visiting the holy sites in neighboring Utah, and becoming a fanboy of the Osmonds. Back in Florida, he urged his family to return to Catholicism with the same conviction. ""Football and religion. Those were his things,"" his cousin Michelle told Rubio's biographer, Manuel Roig-Franzia. In recent years, he's dialed up his devotion, while still leaving his doubters with the impression he's hedging his bets. ""I have come home to Rome,"" he has said. ""One of the great treasures of the Catholic faith is the ability to go to Mass everyday."" It's a ritual he has performed with that precise regularity for long stretches of his adult life. He subscribes to Magnificat, a magazine that supplies him with daily meditation. And he has boasted about his use of contraception, or lack thereof: ""I can tell you that none of my children were planned."" But while Rome is home, he's maintained a weekend cottage in the Southern Baptist Church. On Saturdays he takes communion; on Sunday he attends Christ Fellowship, his wife Jeanette's church of choice. The decision might be theologically tricky to justify, but Rubio explains it like this: ""I don't think you can go to church too often or spend too much time in fellowship with other Christians, whatever denomination they confess."" In his telling, Rubio is a particularly receptive pilgrim. He seems to be always receiving messages from the Lord--they appear regularly in his self-effacing memoir. A job offer comes his way, just as he's on his knees praying for God's help. In the early flailing days of his Senate campaign, he discerns signs from God that urge him forward. ""I felt as if God were sending me a message."" He hears that message in the singing of 3-year-olds and sees it on a keychain he serendipitously finds on a table. It contains a laminated verse from the book of Joshua: ""I've commanded you to be brave and strong, haven't I? Don't be alarmed or terrified, because the Lord your God is with you wherever you go."" We're accustomed to Republican nominees mouthing the slogans of the culture war, without fully believing them or soft-pedaling them with an eye toward the November electorate. When George W. Bush ran his evangelical friendly campaign, he told his story of spiritual conversion and spoke in the rhetoric of uplift, rather than dwell on the prospects of social apocalypse. Rubio, by contrast, is a happy culture warrior, or perhaps a glum one. ""Without faith at the core of our society, you fall into an era of moral relativism,"" he told the Center for Arizona Policy, a group that supports conversion therapy for gay kids. When asked about the Obergefell decision enshrining gay marriage, he told the Christian Broadcasting Network: ""We are clearly called in the Bible to adhere to our civil authorities. But that conflicts with also our requirement to adhere to God's rules. So when those two come in conflict, God's rules always win."" Though Rubio remains the favorite son of the GOP establishment, on the social issues, you couldn't slide a sheet of cigarette paper between him and Ted Cruz. They would both restrict abortion so thoroughly that they wouldn't exempt victims of rape or incest. ""I personally believe you do not correct one tragedy with a second tragedy,"" Rubio argues. This puts him in stark contrast with George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. When it comes to gay rights, his stance extends far beyond denunciations of the court's marriage decision. He has stridently opposed gay adoption--which Mitt Romney supported--and he has fought anti-discrimination legislation. ""I'm not for any special protections based on orientation."" He has promised to reverse Obama's executive orders committing the country to non-discrimination. ""On my first day in office, they're gone."" Like Cruz, he believes that Christianity is on its way to being criminalized by the commissars of tolerance. These are arguments that he crafts with hyperbolic fervor, far more than the art of the pander demands. ""We are at the water's edge of the argument that mainstream Christian teaching is hate speech, because today we've reached the point in our society where if you do not support same-sex marriage, you are labeled a homophobe and a hater. So what's the next step after that, after they're done going after individuals? The next step is to argue that the teachings of mainstream Christianity, the catechism of the Catholic Church, is hate speech. That's a real and present danger."" ""Only One Nation on Earth ..."" Marco Rubio struggled to find his place in the world. As a kid, he repeatedly asked to be transferred to new schools, never quite settling comfortably. When his family moved from Las Vegas back to Miami, he was mocked for his ""American"" accent. His fellow students deemed him a gringo. Rubio felt ""that he didn't belong anywhere,"" McKay Coppins has reported. Solidity was a precious commodity, and he clung to his paternal grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia. For much of his adolescence, Rubio sat at his feet and studied. Pedro would perch in an aluminum chair on his front porch, smoke a cigar, and launch into soliloquies for Marco's benefit. During the summers, Marco would listen for two hours at a time. ""My grandfather was my mentor and my closest boyhood friend,"" Rubio would later recount. It's easy to see why Rubio would have taken so much pleasure in these talks. They were passionate and learned. Pedro was a reader with strong opinions. For the most part, these were the opinions of a Cuban exile. Pedro was a hardliner in the Cold War, who considered the United States the indispensable protector of light and good in the world. In his view, the global fate of freedom hinged on the willingness of the United State to play its allotted role. By the fifth grade, Rubio had internalized his master's teaching so thoroughly that he wrote a paper praising Reagan for saving the American military from years of malign neglect by the feckless Jimmy Carter. When Marco Rubio arrived in the Senate, he made these ideas the core of his political identity. They weren't especially fashionable at the time. The Tea Party represented a backlash against the George W Bush era. Rand Paul aspired to be the defining politician of that era and his skepticism about the use of force abroad seemed to reflect the swelling hostility to neoconservatives and their idealistic interventionism. Rubio made it his mission to be the spokesman for the backlash against the backlash. Rubio surrounded himself with the neoconservatives who had fallen out of favor. He sought out Robert Kagan and Elliot Abrams for counsel. Joe Lieberman became a mentor; the two co-bylined an op-ed urging the toppling of Qadaffi in Libya. For his foreign policy adviser, Rubio hired Bill Kristol protege Jamie Fly, who advocated a preemptive bombing campaign against Iran. It's easy to see why they gravitated to Rubio. He mastered his subject with wonkish depth and ideological passion. And when he spoke about America's role in the world, he could sound just as lyrical as his grandfather: ""There is only one nation on Earth capable of rallying and bringing together the free people on this planet to stand up to the spread of totalitarianism,"" he bellowed at last year's CPAC gathering of the faithful. What irked Rubio most was that America had shelved its commitment to freedom in the Western hemisphere, especially in its campaign to dislodge Castro. Well before Obama restored relations with Cuba, Rubio worked behind the scenes to punish public officials who betrayed any hint of softness toward Castro. He blocked Jonathan Farrar, the former head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, from becoming the ambassador to Nicaragua. Rubio scuttled his nomination on the basis of petty offenses. Farrar had had the temerity to permit State Department officials to stay at the state-owned Hotel Nacional, rather than in a U.S.-owned guesthouse. Now that Cuba has reopened the American embassy in Havana, Rubio has emerged as the face of the opposition. He would stomp on this policy, ending diplomatic relations and imposing a new batch of sanctions. Unlike Trump and Cruz, who have disavowed large chunks of George W. Bush's foreign policy, Rubio still believes fervently in the necessity of nation building. Where his rivals speak with the cold inflections of realism Rubio drapes his foreign policy in idealistic commitment to the promotion of democracy and human rights. Of course, Rubio has issued the requisite disavowal of militarism--""I don't want to come across as some sort of saber-rattling person""--but he also promises a foreign policy that would make conflicts more likely. ""I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace or outer space,"" he has said. Rubio has promised that he would declare the Iranian nuclear deal illegitimate. To fight ISIS, he wants to send American soldiers into conflict--a step none of his remaining rivals favors. He has also suggested sending Special Forces to Yemen, where they could lend a hand to Saudi Arabia's bloody sectarian intervention. Rubio is willing to commit these resources because he considers the conflict in the Middle East downright apocalyptic: ""This is a clash of civilizations. There is no middle ground on this. Either they win or we win."" ""My parents lost their country to a government, I'm not going to lose mine."" Nobody would have described the young Marco Rubio as an intellectual. College was a long, painful awakening from his never particularly achievable dream of becoming a professional football player. Despite his own academic indifference, Rubio the politician has gravitated to intellectuals. He ascended in Florida politics under the wing of Jeb Bush, a joyous enthusiast for Big Ideas. As he prepared to become Florida speaker, he held ""Idearaisers"" across the state, sessions with voters to brainstorm new initiatives. During his first year in government, he committed himself to learning the conservative catechism. He read Atlas Shrugged twice in quick succession. As a senator, Rubio has cultivated the most self-consciously intellectual wings of conservatism. More than any of this cycle's presidential candidates, he likes to let you know the big book tucked under his arm. For a time, Rubio proudly toted Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy everywhere he went and trumpeted his tutorial with the former secretary of state: ""I listened to him like a student."" The acknowledgements for his book American Dreams is a directory of the young-ish policy entrepreneurs with greatest cachet on the right. It name checks: Yuval Levin, Ross Douthat, Oren Cass, Reihan Salam, the architects of reform conservatism. There were both personal and political reasons for Rubio to gravitate to the reformicons. These intellectual gurus wanted to liberate the Republican Party from its slavish devotion to tax cuts for the rich, reorienting its policy priorities to the working class. There was an implicit critique of the hard libertarian edge of the Tea Party in much of their critique--and more explicitly a brutal analysis of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, which was so easily tagged as plutocratic. For Rubio, the reformicon program was an extension of his own empathetic paycheck-to-paycheck narrative. It made him a creature of his times, rather than a parrot of crusty nostrums, and it allowed him to turn his struggles with debt into a talking point, as opposed to a skeleton in his closet. Of course, there was no way that he could (or would want to) directly confront the problem of income inequality, given what he'd learned from Ayn Rand and his intention to win the nomination of Charles and David Koch's party. But he could at least gesture toward the problem. His tax plan featured a $2500-per-child tax credit, a benefit for families of modest means. This nod to inequality won him the plaudits of pundits. And they were right to see his plan as redistributionist--they just emphasized the wrong direction in which the money flowed. After complaints from mainline conservatives about his plan's insufficient slashing of rates, Rubio has redoubled his efforts and proposed a gargantuan cut, far beyond anything George W. Bush ever contemplated. Three times as large, in fact. It would eliminate all taxes on capital gains, dividends, interest, and inherited estates, thereby reducing federal revenue by 25 percent and padding the plutocracy. Jonathan Chait tabulates it like this: ""This isn't ""buy a new BMW every year"" type money for the one percent. It's more 'Scrooge McDuck swan dive into a pile of gold' type money. Paris Hilton's descendants would be able to go several generations deep into the future without anybody working a day in their life."" * * * Why did Rubio receive a relative pass for his deeply held radicalism? He wielded the same biography that brought him to these hardline positions as a force field. His life story became the stuff of marketing. He harped on his youth in order to separate himself from the tired old establishment. His working-class roots were the populist plot points that he used to sell less-than populist policies. ""If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck?"" In other words, he presented the most vapid version of his life's story--a version that scrubs the more contentious truths about his life story, so that both conservatives and moderates can see whatever they find most comforting. Marco Rubio's demise will be read as the sad death of establishment-minded conservatism. The obituaries will bemoan the collapse of the center; they will express panic at the helplessness of reason in the face of powerful new extremes. But where Donald Trump, the vessel of white nationalism and enemy of free speech, poses one terrifying new threat to the republic, Marco Rubio represented another. He took the primary tenets of the George W. Bush presidency and fattened them up or pushed them further to the ideological extreme. Where Donald Trump would face internal resistance to his program, Marco Rubio would have delivered his to a unified party with the conviction of someone who really, truly means it. That his political promise has ended in such crushing humiliation is reason to cheer."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/how_ted_cruz_can_beat_donald_trump.html	"Donald Trump's delegate lead in the Republican presidential primary is not particularly vast. It is definitely vast over also-rans Marco Rubio and John Kasich, regardless of whether they win their respective home states of Florida and Ohio on March 15. Ted Cruz, however, is only trailing Trump by about 100 delegates, a not insurmountable margin. Though twin Trump victories in Florida and Ohio--and the 165 winner-take-all delegates that would come with them--would be devastating to the anti-Trump cause, a split decision would still leave enough space for Cruz to catch up. What it's going to take, though, is a leap-of-faith among anti-Trump leaders that comes with the risk of ceding Trump a 1,237 majority of delegates heading into the convention. As I've written, the strategy of keeping all four Republican candidates in the race through the primary calendar could block Trump from hitting 1,237 prior to the convention, but it would also likely ensure Trump would enter Cleveland with a large delegate plurality. That sets up a scenario, to be broadcast on live television, in which party leaders attempt to give the nomination to a distant second-, third-, or fourth-place finisher (or some other White Knight). It would not be a pretty look, and delegates might not be comfortable going along with it. With Rubio collapsing nationally--and with his disastrous results in Tuesday's primaries--and Kasich improving his performance but too late in the game--and still with zero wins on the board--Republicans are going to have to choose between Cruz and Trump. Cruz has been showing signs of late that he can win outside the South. He won Maine's caucuses this past Saturday and posted a win in the Idaho caucuses Tuesday night. In Michigan, he finished in not-shabby second place. The really important number for Cruz, though, was buried deep within that state's exit polling. In a hypothetical head-to-head Michigan contest between Trump and Cruz, Cruz bested Trump by a narrow 43-41 percent. (Rubio, meanwhile, trailed Trump 41-46 under such a scenario.) If Cruz could consistently beat Trump in the remaining contests, with anti-Trump votes finally unified around a single, albeit imperfect far-right candidate, he would be able to close the gap with Trump. Anti-Trumpers appear to be mostly out of luck in Florida. Rubio is collapsing, and Cruz is catching up with him. So many voters have already likely cast their ballots in early voting for Rubio, though, that it might not help Cruz enough for Rubio to drop out before next Tuesday's contest. Conservatives are left to conjure up fantastical scenarios in which Cruz should endorse Rubio in Florida as part of some longer-term deal. Whatever. What we're staring at is a split Cruz-Rubio vote that awards Trump 99 delegates and ends Rubio's campaign. Cruz, meanwhile, should pray that Kasich wins Ohio, recognizes that he's performed his ""favorite son"" duty of denying Trump 66 delegates, and drops outs. This could be wishful thinking, but if enough party poobahs put enough pressure on enough leading figures to rally around Cruz, it could work. If he has the party's best interests at heart, this is what Jeb Bush will push for when he meets with the remaining non-Trump candidates this week. If all of this were to go right for Cruz, he would need to start winning across the map. There aren't many pure winner-take-all contests this cycle, but there are some: Arizona (58 delegates), Nebraska (36), Montana (27), Delaware (16), and South Dakota (26). Cruz would need to win most if not all of those. He would need to take delegate majorities in proportional or hybrid winner-take-most races in states like North Carolina (72), Missouri (52), Oregon (28), Washington (44), Maryland (38), Utah (40), Indiana (57), and, of course, California (172). And Cruz would need to mitigate his losses in the Trumpy Northeastern states of New York (95) and Connecticut (28). New Jersey (51), unfortunately for Cruz, is a pure winner-take-all state. It's hard to get much more granular than this since there's such little polling data available for the states that vote after March 15. Even if there was significant polling in the out-states, it wouldn't measure the race as a one-on-one contest between Trump and Cruz. That's where the leap of faith comes in. If anti-Trumpers really believe that they constitute a majority of the party, and that Trump does have a ceiling, they should put it to the test. If Cruz can earn consistent majorities over Trump after March 15, there are enough winner-take-all and winner-take-most states out there for him to either overtake Trump with the delegate plurality--or come close enough that jumping past Trump at the convention wouldn't be so conspiratorial. The risk here--and it is a significant risk--is that Trump is the one who earns consistent majorities against Cruz in the remaining states, and the removal of the split vote factor allows him to round up 1,237 delegates by the convention. All that would show, fairly enough, is that Trump has control of the majority of the party and deserves to be the nominee. Why not let the voters decide that one way or another?"

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/marco_rubio_needs_to_drop_out_before_florida.html	Both Chaucer and Shakespeare wrote of the medlar fruit, which comes, appropriately enough, from the medlar tree. The special distinction of this fruit, and the reason for its appearance in literature, is that it goes rotten before becoming ripe. It is, in short, an excellent metaphor for Marco Rubio. After his humiliating fourth place finish in Mississippi (with the no-longer-running Ben Carson not far behind him), and another fourth-place finish in Michigan, Rubio's campaign is essentially finished. This was pretty clear after his dismal showing on Super Tuesday, and it was hammered home by his abysmal debate performance last week. Rubio's consistently poor showing has been so surprising to so many political pundits (myself included) that his campaign will likely be remembered as one of the most disappointing of the past several election cycles. After Tuesday night's big losses, Rubio is left with very few options. But he does have one final opportunity to help stop Donald Trump: drop out immediately. Trump once again had a very good night on Tuesday, despite recent headlines about declining poll numbers and a lower ceiling of support. And Ted Cruz's second-place showing in Mississippi and essentially tied-for-second-place finish in Michigan entrenched the sense that he is the anti-Trump candidate. (One interesting exit poll finding, from Michigan, showed Cruz beating Trump 44-39 in a two-person race.) Yes, Kasich was bunched up with Cruz in Michigan, and might win his home state of Ohio next week. But after that he will be short on money and support. He has shown himself incapable of winning anywhere to date, and for most of the campaign he has been so irrelevant that his rivals have not even bothered to attack him. Which is why Rubio should do everything he can to boost Cruz, the only non-Trump viable candidate, immediately. This means dropping out before his home state of Florida's March 15 primary, even if he could win it. Recent polls in Florida have shown Rubio in second place, but his support nationwide is falling like a rock. There was a non-Trump case to be made, a week or so ago, that Rubio should stay in to deny Trump Florida's winner-take-all delegates, despite it meaning a more crowded field. But the most recent poll of Florida has Cruz five points behind Rubio; given the different trajectories of their campaigns, and Rubio's further anti-momentum from Tuesday night, it seems reasonable to conclude that a Cruz victory without Rubio in the race may be as likely as a Rubio victory with all three of them still running. If Rubio wins Florida, that's just one victory for him. If Cruz can win Florida, he'll add to his not-insignificant delegate total. Admittedly, a Cruz win in Florida is not a very likely scenario, in part because many early voters have already cast their ballots for Rubio or Trump. But a Rubio exit would allow Cruz to pick up at least some of Rubio's support nationally, which he has already been doing all week. Upcoming states like Missouri and North Carolina are much more likely to go to Trump in a crowded field; if Cruz can pick up many of Rubio's votes in these states, he could win either of them. Rubio's immediate departure would also give Cruz a more direct shot at Trump at Thursday's debate and over the next week on the campaign trail. Given how poorly Trump performed in the last debate when he faced sustained attack, this could be the only strategy, however tenuous and unlikely, to take him down. Rubio spent the past 10 days of the campaign saying that Trump could not be the nominee of the party; in all likelihood, Trump is going to be the nominee no matter what Rubio does. But there is still a tiny chance to prevent that outcome, and it may hinge on Rubio getting out of the race. If he does so, Rubio would prove that his vacuous and disappointing campaign had at least one small bit of purpose to it. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary.

He has recorded a message for the John Kasich campaign in Michigan that, unconventionally enough, doesn't express direct support for John Kasich. That may be because he also recorded a robocall for the Marco Rubio campaign in Michigan. The twin goals, theoretically, would be to vault Kasich past Trump for the gold medal in Michigan while helping Rubio cross the 15 percent threshold for collecting delegates. (Right now, Marco Rubio is in fourth place in the state.) Romney also recorded robocalls for Rubio in the remaining Tuesday voting states of Idaho, Hawaii, and Mississippi. Huh. To put it generously, it's not clear that Romney's attempt to siphon delegates from Trump is moving the masses. If anything, his speech last week seemed to encourage more voters to back Trump. Romney should be credited for speaking his conscience, even if doing so only reinforces the prevailing anti-establishment mood of the cycle. But can we be so sure that speaking his conscience--and standing up for the supposed dignity of the pre-Trump Republican Party--is really all that he is doing? Romney appeared on Meet the Press this weekend to talk about how horrible a human being Trump--one of Romney's most high-profile endorsers in 2012--is. He explained that he would support Rubio, Kasich, or even Ted Cruz over Trump. As a final question, moderator Chuck Todd asked him if he would accept the nomination at a deadlocked convention in Cleveland if drafted."

That used to be a question for historians. Now it's a process you can watch in real time. In recent days, Donald Trump has been casting aside moral constraints on torture and violence against civilians. At his campaign rallies, crowds have cheered him on. What kind of country would the United States become if Trump and his followers get their way? Just listen as Trump spells it out for you. 1. Torture. Since November, Trump has said he would approve not just waterboarding, but ""a hell of a lot worse."" That's a change from George W. Bush's administration, which justified waterboarding on the grounds that it wasn't torture. Trump dismisses the taboo against torture altogether. ""Let's assume it is"" torture, he said of waterboarding at a campaign event in South Carolina on Feb. 17. It's still ""absolutely fine,"" he concluded, and ""we should go much stronger."" 2. Retribution. Other Republicans, such as Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, argue that brutal interrogation methods are justified only to prevent an attack. Trump rejects that constraint. On Nov. 23, he told a crowd in Ohio that waterboarding extracts useful information from terrorists, but that even if it didn't, he would approve it, and ""more than that,"" because ""if it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway, for what they're doing to us."" 3. Collective punishment. In a Trump administration, you don't have to be a terrorist to be targeted for retaliation. You just have to be related to one. On Dec. 3, Trump said of terrorists, ""You have to take out their families."" When Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Trump to explain himself, Trump replied, falsely, that wives and children of the 9/11 hijackers had been sent home before the attack to ""watch Daddy tonight on television knock down the World Trade Center."" He continued: ""There has to be retribution. And if there is not going to be retribution, you are never going to stop terrorism."" 4. Hostage taking. Trump says he would target terrorists' family members because they're the people terrorists care about. On Dec. 6, he said on Face the Nation that although terrorists ""say they don't mind dying ... I can tell you this: They want their families left alone."" At a Republican debate on Dec. 15, he added: ""I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think, because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives."" The audience applauded. The next day, Trump repeated that terrorists ""care more about their families than they care about themselves"" and that he ""would do pretty severe stuff"" to a terrorist's wife. The crowd roared its approval. 5. Religious war. Trump routinely demands payback against ISIS for killing Christians. ""The enemy is cutting off the heads of Christians and drowning them in cages, and yet we are too politically correct to respond in kind,"" he wrote in a USA Today op-ed on Feb. 15. Often, Trump mentions that ISIS kills other people, too. But the only victim group he identifies by name is Christians. 6. Weakness. If you don't accept torture or targeting civilians, Trump says you're soft. In the Dec. 15 debate, Jeb Bush said these ideas were ""crazy."" Trump replied that Bush was ""a very nice person. But we need tough people."" In another debate on Feb. 6, Cruz rejected torture and waterboarding. Trump called Cruz's answer ""really weak."" At a rally in New Hampshire on Feb. 8, Trump gleefully told the crowd what a woman in the audience was calling Cruz for his answer: ""She said he's a pussy."" 7. Level playing field. Trump views laws and scruples as foolish impediments. At a rally in Florida on Saturday, he complained that in the war on ISIS, ""We're playing with two sets of rules: their rules and our rules."" At a press conference that night, after winning two primaries, he went further: ""It's very hard to be successful in beating someone when your rules are very soft and their rules are unlimited."" He vowed to loosen American torture laws ""so that we can better compete with a vicious group of animals."" In an interview that aired Sunday on Face the Nation, Trump reinforced this point: ""We are playing by rules, but they have no rules. It's very hard to win when that's the case."" He pledged to ""strengthen the laws so that we can better compete.""

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/the_real_difference_between_hillary_clinton_and_bernie.html	"We're at the point in the Democratic primary where there's little to learn from additional debates. This was true on Sunday, when Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders faced off in Flint, Michigan, ahead of the Michigan primary on Tuesday. Going into the event, we knew that Bernie Sanders would announce his stand against the ""millionaires and billionaires"" and call for ""a government that works"" for the people, ""rather than Wall Street or corporate America."" Likewise, we knew Hillary Clinton would hesitate on big questions, instinctively choosing the more cautious option when confronted with a tough challenge. When an audience member asked Clinton what she would do to keep jobs in the United States rather than being shipped overseas, she replied with small measures to nudge manufacturers in her direction. ""We're going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America,"" she said. Sanders, by contrast, took a broad swing. ""Look, I was on a picket line in [the] early 1990s against NAFTA because you didn't need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour,"" he said in a broadside against trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement that have been backed by Bill Clinton. We even knew there would be occasional conflict between the two candidates, as they skirmished for command of the stage (compared, it should be said, to the outright battle royal of the latest Republican debate). ""Bernie refused to cede the stage to Hillary on multiple occasions,"" wrote my Slate colleague Josh Voorhees, ""and he went out of his way to press her on her refusal to release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street institutions like Goldman Sachs."" But, as viewers, we can learn from debates even when they cover familiar ground. And the Flint debate, in particular, illustrates an important difference between Clinton and Sanders that's often overlooked in coverage of the two candidates but that goes a long way in explaining their campaigns and their positions. In short, Hillary Clinton is running to lead Democrats, and Bernie Sanders is running to lead liberals. Primaries obscure this, but parties are far more than their voters. They are the volunteers that give time, the donors that give money, the local and state officials that build organizations, the recruiters that find candidates, etc. They are also loose coalitions of groups and interests that work in tandem for common goals and, equally, work against each other for particular gains. Some are more powerful than others, and that influences the broad direction and shape of the parties. In addition to chief executive and commander in chief, the president of the United States is also the leader of his or her party. And as much as anything else, the president has to navigate these groups and interests, as well as communicate with other party members, from congressional leaders to local and state party officials. It's why, to that point, the vice president often takes the lead in campaigning and fundraising for down ballot races--it is a show of commitment from the White House to the broader Democratic Party. Ambitious lawmakers do the same, campaigning for candidates and colleagues around the country. It's why Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, stumped for Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes in 2014. Or why West Virginia's Joe Manchin did the same for Louisiana's Mary Landrieu. Presidential candidates hold a unique role. As prospective leaders of the national party, they set the tone for everyone on the ballot. What the presidential candidate (or nominee) says affects how House, Senate, and gubernatorial candidates shape their campaigns. Which brings us back to Hillary and Bernie. In the last hour of the Flint debate, a questioner pushed the candidates on fracking. Clinton equivocated. ""[B]y the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place,"" she said. ""And I think that's the best approach, because right now, there [are] places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated."" Sanders, by contrast, was more direct: ""My answer is a lot shorter. No, I do not support fracking."" You can read this as political cowardice from Clinton and courage from Sanders; or as evidence of their ties to entrenched interests (or lack thereof); or of Clinton's cautious moderation and Sanders' ambitious liberalism. But I think you can also read it as a reflection of their different positions in the Democratic primary, and their different goals as candidates. Hillary Clinton, a prominent leader from the ideological center of the Democratic Party, is running to lead the Democratic coalition as it exists. She wants to lead the party as much as she wants to be president. Which makes her more attentive to traditional party building--she's pledged to devote resources to boosting state parties and candidates--and more cautious with her rhetoric. Liberals in the Democratic coalition are opposed to fracking, but many rural and purple state Democrats aren't. Clinton doesn't want to alienate either, so she tries to satisfy both. Bernie Sanders, by contrast, comes from the left wing of American politics with a nominal attachment to the Democratic Party--until his run for the presidency, he didn't identify as a Democrat. He's not as concerned with the usual party building and coalition maintenance. He wants to change the terms of the institution that is the Democratic Party and put ideological liberals at the fulcrum of Democratic politics, in the same way that ideological conservatives sit at the center of Republican politics. And so, his appeals are broad and expansive. He doesn't worry about details as much as he focuses on energizing like-minded voters. Rather than trying to satisfy Democrats in conservative places, Sanders is trying to reduce their influence by attracting sympathetic voters (his ""political revolution""). The problem for Sanders is that ideological liberals are one faction among many, and they compete for influence with party stalwarts like union members and black Americans, who offer support based on transaction--what can you do for the interests of our specific group--as much as belief. To win on his terms, Sanders has to grow the space for ideological politics in those groups and satisfy its more moderate and conservative members. This is hard (I call them ""stalwarts"" for a reason), and it's why Sanders has had a hard time in states where they play an important part. But the problem for Clinton is that the Democratic Party isn't just a loose coalition of interests. It's more liberal than it has ever been, with a much larger space for progressive politics and action. And as Sanders has shown among white Democrats in the Northeast, and among young Democrats nationwide, that space is growing. This makes Clinton--a transactional politician who sits at the ideological center--an uncomfortable fit, who appeals to stalwarts and interest groups (like banks and industry) far more than voters who choose on ideology and belief. This isn't a clean division. On guns, for example, Sanders has had to play the transactional politician to win in Vermont while Clinton has taken an ideological tack as a way to damage Sanders with liberals and tarnish his appeal as a purer politician. And this isn't a conversation of ""pragmatism"" versus ""idealism."" Ideological solutions can be pragmatic--advocates would say this for the ""public option"" in health care reform--while Clinton's Democratic centrism represents a particular ideology of market capitalism as much as it exists to bridge party divides. But if you're looking for a way to describe the current state of the Democratic race, this is it: a presumptive coalition leader versus a prospective ideological one.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/the_gop_is_still_too_cowardly_to_stand_up_to_donald_trump.html	Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the United States. He seeks power through intimidation and revenge. He exploits sectarian divisions for political advantage. He has few scruples and little regard for human rights or the Constitution. And to gain control of this country's executive branch, including the armed forces, all he has to do is win a presidential election. If he wraps up the Republican nomination, which now seems quite likely, only one person will stand between him and the greatest power on Earth. I don't think Trump will win the general election. But in the race for the Republican nomination, I've been wrong about him every step of the way. He has won 10 out of 15 primaries and caucuses, has a big lead in the delegate count, has no viable opponent, and is gathering endorsements from Republican governors and members of Congress. These developments should shake our complacency about the United States as a free country. Even if Trump loses, historians will ask how he got this far. And one answer will be the moral cowardice of the Republican Party. By Thursday night, the Republican race had narrowed to four men: Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Gov. John Kasich. They met on a debate stage in Detroit. Bret Baier of Fox News posed this question to Trump:	The GOP Is Still Too Cowardly to Stand Up to Donald Trump	['Trump', 'Kasich']	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/ted_cruz_sounds_like_ronald_reagan_he_d_be_more_popular_with_voters_if_he.html	"I've been trying for months to put my finger on what exactly it is about Ted Cruz that I find so frustrating. I think I've finally figured it out. Cruz's rhetoric is stuck in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was riding high. You almost get the impression that the exceptionally bright Texas senator hasn't had a new thought in decades. The only things Cruz says on the stump that would be out of place in that era, when he was in middle school, are his references to repealing Obamacare and defeating ISIS, for which we could easily find early '80s equivalents. Cruz has taken Ronald Reagan's line from his first inaugural address that ""government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem"" and made it the basis of his entire campaign. In the Liberty University address last March that kicked off Cruz's own presidential bid, he ran through a litany of ways he would get government off our backs, mostly by slashing regulations and taxes and defending Second Amendment rights and religious liberties. These are all very important things to do, to be sure. But Reagan's anti-government message was rooted in the context of his time: Reagan said that ""in the present crisis, government is not the solution,"" not that government is never the solution. Later on, recognizing that America is not just home to government-loathing libertarians, Reagan added, ""it's not my intention to do away with government,"" and that ""government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it."" In short, Reagan believed that government ought to be restrained and limited, but also that it had a vital role to play in improving the lives of Americans. Cruz, in contrast, struggles to do anything other than rail against the federal leviathan. As Yuval Levin, editor of National Affairs, has argued, ""he proposes himself as the one who would take us back to a time when the country grasped that conservative ideas could help address our problems."" These out-of-date talking points are doubly frustrating, because this really ought to be Cruz's moment. In Thursday night's Fox News debate, he was masterful. Cruz dismantled Donald Trump for his contradictory stances on immigration, and he made Trump look small by scolding him as one would an insolent child. Of all Trump's remaining Republican rivals, it is Cruz who has had the most success, having bested the GOP front-runner in five states. Nevertheless, there is a lingering fear in anti-Trump circles that Cruz is too unappealing to be the GOP standard bearer, and that he can't hang in primaries that aren't dominated by the hard-right, church-going Christians who are his most devoted supporters. The reason, I suspect, is that he's just not very modern. Cruz's chief rival for the affection of Republican regulars is still Marco Rubio, a man who is roughly the same age as Cruz, yet who seems much younger. Though Rubio is very nearly as orthodox a conservative as Cruz is, his sunnier disposition, his wit, and his emphasis on his lower-middle-class, aspirational roots make him seem more broadly appealing. It's easy to understand why Cruz's conservative nostalgia might appeal to older GOP primary voters, who remember the Reagan era as the prime of their lives. But the world has changed a lot since the Gipper left office. The United States is older, more urban, and more diverse. The share of children raised in single-parent families is much higher, and the economic prospects for non-college-educated men are far bleaker. The rich are richer and the poor are in many respects more isolated. Rubio has made an attempt to adapt to this landscape, and to speak to the challenges it raises. His attempt has been imperfect to say the least, but he has at least made an attempt. Cruz hasn't done the same. Cruz's Reaganite prescriptions aren't entirely irrelevant circa 2016. Overhauling the tax code really could spur investment, and thoughtful deregulation may well lead to more competitive markets and more flourishing startups. But does Cruz really believe that repealing Obamacare will lead to a renaissance for manufacturing employment, as he seemed to suggest on Thursday night? The idea strains credulity. I am coming around to the view that Cruz is better placed than Rubio to prevent Trump from winning the GOP presidential nomination, and I found it encouraging that Cruz and Rubio spent more time attacking Trump in this latest debate than they did going after each other. Anti-Trump Republicans have been pushing for a Cruz-Rubio alliance, and it looks as though just such an alliance might be coming into shape. To be at the top of the ticket, however, Cruz must make it clear that he understands America in 2016, and how different it is from America in 1986. He's made some tentative gestures in this direction, talking up the idea of ""opportunity conservatism,"" a government-shrinking agenda of school vouchers, expanded gun rights, and labor market deregulation designed to better the lives of the poor. The truth, however, is that this agenda is unlikely to prove all that inspiring to voters outside of Cruz's very conservative base. A better tack might be for Cruz to declare himself a believer in a more inclusive, big-tent conservatism. Given Cruz's deep affection for the Constitution and the principle of federalism, he ought to emphasize that by reining in the federal government, he aims to free state and local governments to pursue their bliss. His mission would not be to impose Texas' more austere vision of government's role on California, or California's more activist vision on Texas, but rather to ensure that both visions can rise or fall on their merits. The beauty of this approach is that it so clearly aligns with what Cruz actually believes--that a one-size-fits-all government is a poor fit for a sprawling continental republic of 320 million. As an added bonus, running as the candidate of a more robust federalism would send a signal to more socially moderate Republicans that he is willing to let them live in peace. That is just the kind of reassurance that might get big-money donors to open their wallets, and rank-and-file voters to pull the lever for a man who's working so hard to channel Reagan."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/rubio_cruz_and_kasich_say_they_d_support_trump_as_nominee.html	"Here is a small sampling of what non-Trump Republican presidential candidates had to say about Donald Trump in the lead-up to Thursday night's debate in Detroit. ""[P]eople will wake up,"" said Marco Rubio in a Sunday interview with John Dickerson of CBS News' Face the Nation, ""and we're not going to allow a con artist to take over the party of Lincoln and Reagan."" ""Listen, if Donald becomes president, who the heck knows what he would do? Even Donald doesn't know what he would do,"" said Ted Cruz, in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. ""And I think the challenges facing this country are too grave to roll the dice and risk losing the Supreme Court for a generation, risk yet more economic stagnation and risk on foreign policy allowing radical Islamic terrorism to continue to rise and threaten America."" ""Apparently, he refused to disassociate himself from white supremacists,"" said John Kasich during a town hall in Ohio. ""Every day it's another thing. That's just horrific, right? We don't have any place for white supremacists in the United States of America. It doesn't make any sense. He really needs to make his position clear, and he ought to do it quickly."" Between the three men, you have a scathing indictment of Trump: He's a con artist who defrauds ordinary Americans; he's unfit to do the basic duties of the president of the United States; he associates with the worst elements in our society. Obviously then, neither Rubio nor Cruz nor Kasich would support Trump if he won the nomination. Obviously, for them, a candidate this reckless and destructive shouldn't be elevated to the presidency, even if he shares an R next to his name on the ballot. ""I'll support Donald if he's the Republican nominee, and let me tell you why,"" said Rubio, when Fox News moderator Bret Baier press him on that question at the end of Thursday's debate. ""We must defeat Hillary Clinton."" Cruz said the same. ""Yes, because I gave my word that I would. And what I have endeavored to do every day in the Senate is do what I said I would do."" And while Kaisch took his time with his answer--deploying a strange, circular metaphor--he eventually affirmed his colleagues on the stage. ""Look, when you're in the arena, and we're in the arena. And the people out here--we're in the arena, we're traveling, we're working, we spend time away from our family, when you're in the arena, you enter a special circle,"" he said. ""And you want to respect the people that you're in the arena with. So if he ends up as the nominee--sometimes, he makes it a little bit hard--but, you know, I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president."" Earlier, I criticized Mitt Romney for making his moral argument against Trump subordinate to his electoral one--that the real estate mogul would lead the Republican Party to crushing defeat and place Hillary Clinton in the White House. At the same time, Romney's speech--a forceful attack on Trump as a threat to democracy--was an unprecedented step, the closest thing we've seen to a complete disavowal of Trump. And in small ways, it filtered down to the Republican presidential candidates. Rubio, for instance, hammered Trump on his business record while Cruz went after him for supporting Democrats. Romney, it seems, had given new life to the anti-Trump effort, days after the demagogic reality TV star dominated Super Tuesday. With those final answers, however, the effort fell flat. No, they weren't the worst part of the debate--that goes to the brief exchange on lead poisoning in Flint, where Rubio praised Gov. Rick Snyder for his handling of the crisis, despite growing evidence of neglect and incompetence, with deadly consequences for the city's residents--but they deflated Romney's anti-Trump argument, revealing the extent to which it's a hollow exercise and undermining every legitimate attack they made during the night. As long as Rubio, Cruz, Kasich and the rest of the Republican Party are willing to support Trump as the nominee, it doesn't matter what they say or how they insult him--Trump retains his stature as a legitimate figure in the Republican Party. Which, as he accumulates votes and delegates, makes him harder to stop. Despite two hours of arguing, the Republican presidential candidates said little about public policy. Indeed, watching their debate, you'd have no sense of the nation's problems, from wage stagnation and inequality to climate change and criminal justice reform. But one thing is clear: The anti-Trump movement is overrated. If he wins the nomination, Republicans will fall in line, more eager to win the Oval Office than stop a dangerous strongman.
