Tim Pawlenty has issued a definitive statement: ""I think President Obama was born in the United States."" Jerome Corsi, who can append ""#1 New York Times best-selling author"" to his name thanks to his ""swift boat"" quickie in 2004, is already promoting  Where's the Birth Certificate? Why won't birtherism go away? The standard answer is this: because Barack Obama won't release proof of his citizenship. Sorry, no dice: He did release proof of his citizenship, in June 2008--and it helped birtherism go mainstream. There were attempts to prove, via the work of amateurs with pen names, that the Certificate of Live Birth that Team Obama had put online was a forgery worthy of MI-6 or Clifford Irving. There were complicated legal theories about how Obama couldn't be a citizen even if he was midwifed by Betsy Ross, because his deadbeat dad had saddled the future president with British citizenship. And most of this happened before Obama was sworn in, when a stupid person could hope that the Supreme Court would nix the inauguration. So why won't birtherism go away? After all, lots of crackpot movements and theories go away. The all-wars-are-for-oil side of the left-wing anti-war movement shrunk to fit a pencil case after Obama was elected. Glenn Beck's ratings surged high enough to get him two unofficial biographies and the covers of Time and Fortune, and now they're sagging so low that Fox News is hinting it may drop him. Once some obsession or movement either wins or loses all hope of winning, its adherents find other things to do. But birtherism is with us, now more than ever. It used to be odd and unprofessional to ask a politician whether he had any doubts about the president's American birth. It was in the ""kook question"" category. There's theoretically nothing stopping a reporter from raising her hand at a press conference and asking a presidential candidate whether, say, he thinks the Bilderberg Group engineered the financial crisis so its members could buy up foreclosed homes and turn them into meth labs. A question about Obama's birth certificate used to be in that same category. Now it isn't. Is this unfair? Trump--whose campaign may qualify as a massive, ""I'm Still Here"" publicity stunt--is responsible for the sudden acceptability of the question. On The View, he reminded viewers that he went to ""the best schools,"" so he knew that documents are forged all the time, and he didn't trust what he'd heard about Obama. Even after Tuesday, when he finally released a scan of his 1946 birth certificate to ABC News, that claim hung in the air. It echoed what some birthers still say; it gave them wider uncritical media exposure than they'd gotten since Lou Dobbs left CNN. One reason Trump has been able to do this is that two schools of birtherism have developed since 2008, and one of them has become a surprisingly comfortable place for conservatives to lounge. There have always been Orthodox Birthers. They start with the belief that Obama cannot be eligible for the presidency. They trust evidence they find online--an erroneous report about ""Obama's grandmother"" saying he was born in Kenya, for example--which stays online forever, just like amateur diagnostic reports of how crashing planes couldn't possibly have brought down the Twin Towers. If that evidence is challenged, they look to theories about what the founders thought ""natural born citizenship"" meant. Phil Berg, the attorney who filed the first birther lawsuits and who held a ""March on Washington"" in 2010, says Obama lost his citizenship because a school form from Indonesia calls him Indonesian. Another theory says Obama can't be president because his father was Kenyan and that made his son a British citizen by default. (This theory would disqualify Trump, whose mother was Scottish.) What Trump is embracing, and Corsi is selling, is Reform Birtherism. It's deductive. ""There's something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like,"" said Trump last week. ""I don't know what is on the document,"" said Corsi in 2009. The truth is unknowable, because Obama is hiding something about his birth documents. This is all obtuse, because unless the state of Hawaii has issued a false document and the Honolulu Advertiser and other media were defrauded when they printed Obama's 1961 birth announcement, there's more proof of his origins than there is proof of most things. If the president lost his original paper certificate at some point, he's in the same boat as Greta Van Susteren, who confessed as much in an interview with Trump. So why bring this up? If Trump is actually running for president, he's doing it because polling indicates that at least 27 percent of Republicans have doubts about Obama's origins. There are probably going to be more Republicans primary voters who have these doubts than think abortion should be illegal. So being a Reform Birther is saying you're in solidarity with state legislators who are demanding birth certificates from the next presidential candidates. This is pretty pathetic, even for a presidential campaign. Those legislators, and the voters they're pandering to, don't really know what they're talking about. Mae Beavers, a Tennessee state senator, has introduced a bill that would require a ""long-form birth certificate"" from 2012 candidates. She appeared on a radio show to discuss it and was asked what a ""long-form birth certificate"" was. She didn't know; she had just modeled the bill after what other states had done. What does someone like Pawlenty have to gain when he dismisses all of this? Quite a lot, actually. Millions of Republicans may doubt Obama's citizenship--but millions more don't, or don't care. Many of the Republicans who do have doubts don't actually know or think that Obama should be kicked out of office on a technicality. The Republicans who can shape elite opinion--this does not include Corsi--hate even thinking about this. If an investigation proved that Obama had gotten into Columbia and Harvard Law with mediocre grades, he might only win as many presidential elections as George W. Bush. Lots of Republicans think that birtherism is a good way for the White House to make their party look crazy. With his definitive statement, Pawlenty appeals to those Republicans. He appeals to the political media, too. He's jumped one of the lowest bars in politics--but he's jumped it, and some other Republicans still haven't, or won't. Pawlenty wins a stamp of approval--not crazy!--that's incredibly easy to earn. Soon some other candidates will go for that stamp. They have a lot of time. The birthers aren't going anywhere."

1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/shut_up_everybody.html	"The de-front-paging of Andrew Breitbart from the Huffington Post is the latest of several successful Color of Change campaigns with a 1-2-3 strategy: Pick ""race-baiting"" conservative. Demand that the conservative lose his platform. Melt the phones and inboxes until victory. (The group is still featuring the Breitbart scalp on its website, with a picture of the man looking like Saturn devouring his son.) Breitbart's not happy, but only some of his animus is directed at Color of Change, a racial-diversity umbrage machine co-founded in 2005 by James Rucker and Van Jones. It had marshaled 43,000 calls to HuffPo demanding that the front page be Breitbart-free, but that's what it does; that's not what offends him. He's more irritated at the way the story was covered. On CNN, he points out, Howard Kurtz didn't even mention that there was a pattern, that ABC News had bounced Breitbart from an election show after a Color of Change campaign. ""We're two for two against Breitbart,"" says Rucker. But that's the point--it's a campaign. As far as Breitbart's concerned, Kurtz had soft-pedaled that story, too. ""His piece was such a hack job, it was ridiculous,"" Breitbart says. The irony is that one of the two items Breitbart wrote for the Huffington Post--the not-at-all-controversial items that had nothing to do with the de-front-paging--was about NPR's terrified response to James O'Keefe's sting videos of two of their executives. NPR, Breitbart wrote, was ""collateral damage"" in the war over coverage of the Tea Party movement. And that's basically how Color of Change and the rest of the left-wing organizations who wage campaigns against conservatives think of Breitbart. ""We see his role as going out there and creating misinformation from scratch,"" says Eric Boehlert, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America who has waged a long, mostly Twitter-based campaign of traded insults with Breitbart. (At one point in 2010, Breitbart grew out his beard, stood in front of foliage, snapped a photo, and changed his Twitter avatar to look like Boehlert's.) ""He's not passing on Republican talking points or something like that, but in general, he's part of the GOP noise machine."" There is a liberal campaign aimed at getting conservatives off the air, off the Huffington Post front page, off Fox News. It's as blatant as the conservative campaign to dismantle the liberal media. The blatancy is actually becoming the point. On Saturday, after but unrelated to the Breitbart incident, Politico's Ben Smith reported that Media Matters for America had ""all but abandoned its monitoring of newspapers and other television networks and is narrowing its focus to Fox and a handful of conservative websites, which its leaders view as political organizations and the 'nerve center' of the conservative movement."" Media Matters had always packaged itself differently than the right's Media Research Center and Accuracy in Media. It said it was looking for misinformation, not bias. But in 2009, there was a sense that the left was getting rolled and ambushed. (The forced White House departure of Van Jones in September 2009 was seen as the last straw.) Conservatives had always claimed that Media Matters was an attack-dog group, not an accuracy group--so it became an attack group. Conservatives claimed that the group was funded by George Soros when it wasn't, so in October 2010 it accepted $1 million from Soros, who asked that Media Matters ""hold Fox News accountable."" Slowly, Media Matters became what the right claimed it had always been. It was like watching Bruce Banner get picked on until his eyes turned green and he started smashing things. Nobody has explained this better, or confirmed the fears of Breitbart and his ilk, quite like Van Jones. Last September, a year after his White House exit, he gave a speech at the Facing Race conference that was captured--of course--by Breitbart.tv. In it, Jones bemoaned the fact that liberals ""got 60 votes in the Senate"" and ""Speaker Pelosi, not some right-wing Democrat,"" yet still couldn't pass most of their agenda. ""There's other systems of power that we were not taking seriously,"" said Jones. ""They have to do with the media. They have to do with the racial discourse in the media. That's the next frontier."" You can see why Breitbart would look at that, and the October 2010 campaign to get him off ABC, and this month's Huffington Post campaign, and accuse the left of a plot against conservatives with him as collateral damage. ""This has nothing to do with Breitbart's views or his language,"" says James Rucker, Color of Change's co-founder. ""It's about a level of deceit from Breitbart that's basically anti-journalism. If you're a legitimate news outlet, you want folks that deal with facts. You don't want someone like Breitbart in your roster. And there are consequences to what he does, because he's able to take down Shirley Sherrod. ACORN, for all its faults, was the biggest registrar of low-income black voters, and he takes that down."" Breitbart, who tried and failed to resolve the Color of Change issue with the Huffington Post last week, says that the organization buckled because its editors were buckling. That's the dream. That's the bizarre version of what Media Research Center is able to do, and what its offshoot, the Parents Television Council, is able to do, when they hound the media for publishing left-wing opinion or flimsy stories that go easy on liberals. This reality is becoming pretty transparent. We know that partisan stuff-- controversial stuff--is good for ratings and good for clicks. We know who's working the refs to make the media pay a price for those ratings and those clicks. That doesn't mean we have to like it."

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/bachmann_overdrive.html	"Pollster and political guru Frank Luntz flew to Iowa last month to conduct a survey for Fox News. Twenty-six Republicans, likely to vote in the next caucuses, were shown video clips of 11 politicians who might run for president. They twisted dials, scored from 0 to 100, to rate the candidates. One of the clear winners was Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann. ""There's a very strong message that the people want us to hear,"" said Bachmann-on-video. ""No.1, it is get rid of the big spending, which leads to big deficits, which kills jobs. And then No. 2, we don't want the federal government to control private industry or own private industry."" The Iowans couldn't twist their dials fast enough. ""She hit 90 at the end,"" said Sean Hannity. ""Those are solid numbers for anybody."" Luntz explained that the voters liked Bachmann's talk about business and constitutional principles. ""Sarah Palin came in with significant support,"" said Luntz. ""But after these voters watched Michelle Bachmann, Palin's numbers came way down and Michelle Bachmann's numbers shot up."" The focus group pruned the field. Mitt Romney was dumped early, as was Mitch Daniels (""boring""), as was John Thune (this was before he withdrew from the race). They dumped Palin but kept Bachmann because ""they thought that she was more direct and less polarizing,"" Luntz said. Bachmann was their third choice, right after Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich. The moral of the story: Don't write off Michele Bachmann. Oh, the temptation is there. After CNN broke the news that the third-term representative was taking steps toward a presidential bid, Republican strategist Mike Murphy assured Time magazine readers that she was a kook: ""As I tweeted a few weeks ago, Michele Bachmann makes Sarah Palin look like Count Metternich."" It took mere hours for Fox News to locate one of her former chiefs of staff--her fifth--and confirm that he backed that other candidate from Minnesota, former Gov. Tim Pawlenty. But how many votes does Mike Murphy have in Iowa? Early primary and caucus states are the places where the candidates who appeal to activists can catch fire, and where, if they're lucky, they can force the rest of the candidates to move closer to them. This is why Michele Bachmann can dramatically affect Republican politics in 2011 and 2012 if she commits to a run. Let us count the ways. The Roving Eye of the Media. Bachmann is one of the most-covered, most-quoted Republican members of Congress. This phenomenon began in October 2008, when she appeared on MSNBC's Hardball and mused about Democrats being investigated for anti-American thinking. It took on weight in 2009, during the rise of the Tea Party, as Bachmann rose from back-bench obscurity by one-upping her leadership on criticisms of President Obama. No one had to prod Bachmann to accuse Obama of engineering the ""final leap to socialism,"" or saying the Serve America Act was effectively creating ""re-education camps."" According to Lexis-Nexis, since that first Hardball= appearance, Bachmann has been discussed on 127 episodes of the show. Bachmann's arrival as a possible 2012 candidate sucks up some undetermined amount of media attention that would have otherwise gone to help introduce Pawlenty or another candidate. We don't know who that helps. The most-covered candidate of the 2010 cycle, according to Pew, was Christine O'Donnell, the quotable but hopeless U.S. Senate candidate in Delaware. That cut both ways for Republicans--it kept the spotlight away from some other flawed candidates, but it directed grass-roots money and energy into a lost cause when a lot of other conservatives could have used it. The Tancredo Effect. In every presidential cycle there's a politician with a relatively small base--Dennis Kucinich, Tom Tancredo--who gets into the race not to win but to yank people closer to him on his pet issue. Bachmann is more credible than most candidates who try this. She raised $13.5 million for her gimme re-election in 2010. That's more than Mike Huckabee raised for his presidential candidacy from the day he entered to the day he won the Iowa caucuses in 2008. For now, though, Republican strategists view Bachmann as a Tancredo-type candidate who can force her issues into the debate. Strategists I talked to on Thursday basically agreed that Bachmann would drive the field to the right, because she'd done it before, criticizing Republicans in 2010 for not immediately signing up for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and casting a lonely vote against one of the short-term budget bills this year because it didn't defund ""ObamaCare."" Oh, yes: Congress. After Bachmann bailed on a leadership contest in January, my colleague Noreen Malone wrote that Republicans had missed a chance to contain her. If she runs, Bachmann will be the only member of the House--the seat of Republican power right now--running the Lincoln Day and straw poll circuit. Her statements on the stump will be as prominent as anything Majority Leader Eric Cantor or Speaker John Boehner say. Having seen them wince when reporters asked them to respond to Bachmann's alternative State of the Union speech, or her claim of a ""slush fund"" in the Affordable Care Act, I can guess how excited her presidential race must make them. ""Mr. Speaker, a member of your caucus, who is running for president, said in South Carolina today that your budget does not go far enough to scale back Social Security spending. What's your response to that?"" Palin Methadone. When Dana Milbank fulfilled a pledge to spend a whole month ignoring Sarah Palin in his columns, he joked that Bachmann was his ""methadone."" There is a Palin-shaped hole in the 2012 campaign, and the campaigns of people like Rick Santorum and Tim Pawlenty get a lot easier if Palin doesn't run. But if Bachmann runs, a lot of Palin's voters may gravitate to her. I haven't been to every Tea Party rally, so I could have missed one, but I've seen far more handmade Bachmann signs than I have Draft Santorum foam hands. Bachmann and Palin are lumped together for an obvious reason--they're high-powered Republican women. But as that Luntz focus group showed, Bachmann is taken more seriously than Palin in some circles. While Palin is a pundit who communicates through social networks and Fox News, Bachmann has a vote in Congress and daily vulnerability to press ambushes. There are millions of Republican women who, in the age of Palin, like the idea of another female candidate. If Palin does pass on the 2012 race, what happens if she endorses Bachmann? This has been a sleepy, late-starting campaign so far. Today we may have seen its first serious dark-horse candidate."	Michele Bachmann for president? Among Republicans, she's more popular than you think.
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/fore_more_years.html	"Golf season has returned, and with it jokes about the president's obsession with the game. Newt Gingrich has accused President Obama of cowering behind his putter in crisis. ""It strikes me that the more difficult [the world] gets, the more the president golfs and the more the president hides,"" he said. Golf jokes are a hardy presidential perennial. Democrats made so much fun of Eisenhower's frequent outings that Kennedy had to hide his regular golf matches for fear of catching the same grief. (Kennedy kept many things hidden.) Presidential golf jokes may be the laziest of all political humor, with the possible exception of jokes about presidential vacation time. Jokes about presidential appearance are also lazy, but they're just cheap shots: Golf jokes are not only intellectually lazy, but like teleprompter jokes, they encourage the audience to be lazy, too. No one has to bother thinking about what a president actually does. Why do we care about this dumb joke? Because it is politically potent. You'll probably be hearing variations of it a lot during the 2012 campaign. More important, we should care because it exposes a larger problem in the way we view presidents and evaluate candidates. For presidents who can never escape their job, we should encourage golf playing, not mock it. A president's critics always go for the golf joke because it irritates people at a gut level. And the gut level is where you need to go if you want to pick up votes. To say a president is wrong on some policy issue or another is only so damaging. To suggest he is so clueless that he's lining up his putt while the world burns is what really gets a voter outraged. If you're a working-class voter, you may even get irritated that a guy getting paid with your taxes is playing what's seen as a rich man's sport. Gingrich, apparently unconcerned about drawing attention to his own past extracurricular activities, adds a special twist: Obama is a coward. The only evidence he needs for this charge is that someone (it doesn't have to be him, though he is happy to oblige) accuse the president of not doing everything he can on a given issue, and a few pictures of the president golfing or on vacation. And these two pieces of evidence--like ""Hail to the Chief"" and the presidential seal--come with the job. Gingrich hopes that golf will become a symbol for a vast catalog of problems with Obama. Every time you see Obama golf, Gingrich wants you get enraged. If things really work out for Republicans, golf will start coming up in David Axelrod's focus groups, and maybe Obama's advisers will have to suggest to the president that he stop playing. Obama should resist--and, regardless of party, we should all want him to. The presidency is a prison. Your every move is watched and tended by the Secret Service, your opponents, and the media. Even when you're ""having fun,"" you do so in quotation marks. At parties or a baseball game, you're watched to see if you're having a good time. If you play basketball, your on-court demeanor is analyzed for clues to your leadership style. You don't drive. You can't keep a diary (they can be subpoenaed). You can't smoke (the kids are watching). You can't take a stroll through your old neighborhood. All of this distorts the mind. The golf course is one of the few places a president can escape the pressures and physical limitations of the office. George W. Bush was smart enough to have a ranch that allowed him to get out from under the scrutiny of the press. He was inside a perimeter, so the Secret Service could back off a little. You don't have to like golf to recognize that being able to walk in relative freedom and hang out with friends is an obvious pleasure and escape. The more tightly someone is confined, the more necessary it is to escape. One of the great problems for any president is a loss of perspective. A distraction, even for a moment, from the constant and attention-shredding duties of the day is one way to gain perspective. So back to Gingrich's joke: For it to have potency requires a nutty view of the presidency. First you must think the president's most important job is to be like a castle guard--always in a specific place and constantly on watch. This may seem absurd, but this is the way we think about presidents. If the economy has not improved, the chief executive should be in the office doing something, even if it's hitting the refresh button on his browser. And second, you have to think that what a president does in public is the most important thing he's doing. He gets no credit for anything he does in private. Presidents are never off the clock and never more than an arm's length from the most sophisticated communications equipment on the planet. If presidential golf were so all-consuming that he couldn't be interrupted by the duties of being leader of the free world, we'd have a lot more men running for office. A president's job is to have a vision, convey that vision to others, and make the hard calls when they come to him. It's about making smart decisions, not how many hours a president spends making a decision. Libya is a perfect example. Obama has been engaged in the Libya decision-making process, courting allies, making sure any U.S. action had United Nations support. Lots of his critics, on the left and right, wish he'd decided not to intervene. If he'd gone that way he would have had plenty of time to golf and kept the United States out of a confused and seemingly open-ended mission. An early decision to intervene, of course, would also have freed up some alone time. His position on Libya isn't going to get more attractive (or clear), no matter how little golf he plays. Gingrich's position on the matter has had its own  internal confusion  without any intervening rounds of golf by the former Speaker. It's Obama's worldview, not his golf, that bothers Gingrich and others. How the president's worldview affects U.S. policy is something that is shaped not just by his public statements, but in scores or hundreds of private meetings and conversations each day. Focusing on how he does or doesn't spend a Sunday afternoon is a distraction. The president's critics also tell us to ignore Obama's pretty speeches and other public actions and focus on what he believes. That's good advice we should probably stick to--even when the golf joke seems too good to resist.Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/too_late_and_too_weak.html	"The GOP's cartoon image of President Obama is that he's slow, indecisive, and deferential to foreigners, so there is much snickering in the Republican ranks over the president's Libya policy. He allowed the French--the French!--to lead the international campaign against Qaddafi. And inside the Obama administration, according to some reporting, it was the women in his foreign policy team who pushed for stronger action. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who announced Monday he was forming a presidential exploratory committee, played the French card. ""When we have President Sarkozy dictating the pace and terms and conditions for security initiatives in the world, we know that we've entered a new era in terms of America's place and leadership and vision for security around the world, and that concerns me greatly,"" Pawlenty told supporters on a conference call. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., worked the gender angle: ""I don't know how many people have died as we wait to do something. Thank God for strong women in the Obama administration."" Sarah Palin called the president's approach to Libya ""dithering."" Newt Gingrich dubbed him the ""spectator-in-chief."" This reinforces the general critique that President Obama is too languorous on all issues. People already disappointed that he has not turned around the economy will take these Libya charges as just more evidence of his chronic sluggishness. As a specific foreign policy critique, though, the political upside of these Republican attacks is small. Certain interventionists in the GOP may be unhappy about Obama's pace, but most Americans are not anxious for a protracted Libyan intervention. And there's no Republican challenger whose foreign policy credentials are so sterling that this moment provides a rationale for their candidacy. And the cautious Obama is actually the one voters chose in the 2008 election--a president who would be deliberate, focused on international cooperation, slow to take military action, and wary of a longer commitment. Voters seem to sympathize. Republicans have attacked Obama regularly as weak, but voters give him his highest marks on handling foreign affairs and the war in Afghanistan when asked to rate him on his domestic and foreign policy performance. Republicans criticized his handling of the protests in Egypt, but the voters did not. The 2012 GOP presidential hopefuls who criticize Obama would like voters to measure the president against an ideal. They suggest that if the president had been decisive and called for military action earlier it would have destroyed Qaddafi and transferred power to a new benign government. Republicans say that Obama is a follower. The president and White House aides say that they are leading, but in a new way, one that is sensitive, for example, to anti-American sentiment created by the last time America made a mess of things by acting too rashly in Iraq. Still, the administration's policy has raised new questions for which it doesn't seem to have answers: What is the specific goal of the mission? When will it end? Why was Congress marginalized? Potential administration allies such as Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., said the policy lacked ""clarity."" Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, once Obama's foreign policy tutor, raised a series of basic questions that should already have been answered about whom the United States is supporting in Libya and whether this commits the United States to future interventions. The biggest question is: How do you keep the mission as limited as Obama made it seem in his news conference Monday when your Secretary of State is also saying ""Qaddafi must go."" This is the messy business of reacting to fast-moving events, say White House advisers. They detail the rush of meetings and phone calls that took place over the last few days securing support for the United Nations and Arab League resolutions, ensuring international cooperation and legitimacy for the operation. On Monday the president made the comparison to the previous administration, arguing that building a coalition was necessary because ""in the past there have been times where the United States acted unilaterally or did not have full international support. And as a consequence, typically, it was the United States military that ended up bearing the entire burden."" The president and administration aides stressed the limitations of the mission. It was an international effort to address a humanitarian crisis spurred by Qaddafi's actions, not an aggressive intervention. Aides are also working in other ways to expand the context in which its actions would be judged. When National Security Adviser Tom Donilon briefed the press on Sunday, he didn't start his discussion of the Middle East with Libya. He started by talking about the constitutional referendum in Egypt, the message being that the administration has its eye on a broader picture. The administration is signaling that an initial phase of heavy U.S. military operations will last only a matter of days. After that, U.S. planes will join other nations to maintain the no-fly zone but command will transfer to other coalition partners. If Qaddafi isn't deposed or forced to flee, then he could become a chronic condition. The tug of war will continue over whether Obama could have caused a different result by acting sooner, but the audience for that debate will be small. Qaddafi is not an imminent threat likely to capture people's attention. In the spring of 1999, John McCain improved his presidential chances by arguing for intervention in Kosovo. Today's crop of GOP candidates are seeking to do the same, but none of them has the strong foreign policy credentials that make them obvious leaders. The most interesting GOP response to the Libya challenge so far has been from Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour. He declined to attack the president. ""Whenever our men and women are involved in military action, every American stands with them and supports them as I do,"" he said. ""This is not the time to critique what the administration has done or will do."" Barbour's defense and foreign policy positions have been distinctly less neoconservative than many of his opponents. Barbour has called for defense cuts and questioned the ongoing mission in Afghanistan. Barbour may be pitching to deficit-conscious and isolationist Tea Party members, but it's also a message that could work in a general election where he will try to make the case that he's non-ideological and pragmatic. If he's able to do that, it'll be a neat trick. It's also Obama's strategy. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/dont_make_me_pull_this_car_over.html	"Sen. Chuck Schumer took to the Senate floor today to throw a drowning man an anvil. In order to avoid a government shutdown, Schumer advised House Speaker John Boehner to abandon Tea Party-backed Republicans and their inflexible requests to cut the budget for 2011 by $61 billion. Political motivations aside--Schumer's advice was meant to make Boehner's job harder, not easier--Schumer has a point. Boehner does have a Tea Party problem. In the most recent vote to continue funding government operations, 54 House Republicans voted against their leadership. Of course, a week ago, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid saw 10 Democrats vote against President Obama's proposal for spending reductions. Schumer's speech was an effort to make the GOP look like the party in chaos. But both parties are unsettled. One thing we'll learn from the remaining fight over the 2011 budget is which party is better at handling its problem children. Boehner lost 22 percent of his caucus in Tuesday's vote. What does that mean? Nothing at the moment. The opposition to the second continuing resolution, which funds government operations until April 8, didn't imperil the underlying vote. That means some of the 54 representatives were free to vote against it--to get attention from their leadership or, more likely, to send a signal to their constituents about their anti-spending rigor. That was also the case when 39 House Democrats voted against Obama's health care plan last year and when more than 100 voted against his requests for funding for the war. Democrats argued at the time the defections were a sign of a broad majority--members could vote in ways their constituents demanded, but the larger goals of the party were not imperiled. Still, the question remains: How many members are there in the shutdown caucus in the House? The White House, Democratic Senate staffers and representatives from the speaker's office have been negotiating for weeks in quasi-secret on a final number of spending cuts. When a deal is announced and John Boehner tries to sell that to his caucus, how many members would rather shut down the government than compromise on the amount of spending reductions for this year? The number isn't 54. But it's not 20, either. There are two issues: Republicans who won't vote for a final bill unless it contains ""riders"" related to health care, abortion, and funding for the EPA; and those who think anything less than the $61 billion in cuts is too little. One House leadership source put this number at 25. The number is no doubt more. The pitch to convince the hard cases is that a government shutdown would be too damaging to the party and an awful way to start the new GOP control of the House--and that there are more episodes of this budget fight to come in which additional concessions can be won. Boehner can lose only so many votes before he starts needing votes from conservative Democrats. Schumer is trying to make Boehner look like a captive to his most ideological members. The Tea Party is not popular nationally. Also, by focusing on the ""riders,"" Democrats seek to reframe the GOP from being a party taking a hard line to improve the economy to being a party obsessed with ideological fights outside the economy. This does put some pressure on the House GOP. Boehner and House leadership don't want to look as if they are ruled by these members or as if they're not focused on the economy. If the House GOP wants to signal to the nation that the adults are in charge, it cannot look like the party that is ruled by Michele Bachmann. In the Senate there are also signs of dysfunction. Ten Senate Democrats voted against the White House measure to reduce spending in the remainder of this fiscal year by $6.5 billion. They said that wasn't enough. (An 11th, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, voted against the cuts because they are too much.) In his Tea Party warning, Schumer cited a few press accounts of conservatives who said the Republican leadership was being too timid in budget negotiations. None of it was as bold as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's remarks about Obama, delivered on the Senate floor. He accused Obama of failing to lead  on cutting spending to reduce the deficit, a key charge in the GOP playbook. Other Democrats in the Senate are pushing from the other side. They are desperate for the president to engage in a fight with Republicans over these big cuts, and he won't. The signs of discord are big and small. Obama warned members of Congress not to throw around loose talk about a government shutdown. Schumer used the term nine times in his remarks. Still, Reid will have an easier time getting enough of his members to rally around a compromise set of cuts than John Boehner will. The moderate 10 who said the president's initial cuts were too small will almost certainly rally around the deal that comes out of negotiations because it will contain sufficient cuts. A few liberals might leave because the cuts are too big, but if the compromise deal worked out over the next three weeks is one that is worked out with Republicans, there will be a majority made up of both parties for the final vote. If Schumer's gambit works, Boehner and other Republican leaders will accept a compromise that is closer to what Democrats want for fear of being seen as captive to their most extreme members. In doing so, they will anger the party's Tea Party base, which is good for Democrats who like to see their opponents squabble. Boehner's escape route is to argue that Democratic leaders aren't serious about cutting spending, which is why some members of their own party are going against them. In this game of chicken, to avoid a crackup each side will first have to stop the fight in its front seat. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

Why is that? Ask Tea Party activists what they think about the Republican-run House passing a three-week continuing resolution. Try not to ask them when they're driving. ""If we really believe we are against Obamacare, this is the vote,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. ""If a member votes for the continuing resolution, that vote effectively says, I am choosing not to fight."" ""Local tea party coordinators are overwhelmingly opposed to the short-term 'punt' by Republicans,"" said Tea Party Patriots co-chairman Mark Meckler on Tuesday, before the vote. Only six House Republicans opposed the last CR. Fifty-four of them voted against it this time, as it passed with the help of Democratic votes. The Nay-saying Republicans were egged on by the Club for Growth, the Family Research Council, and other loud members of the movement. They are not angry about the spending; if this passes the Senate, $10 billion will have been cut from five weeks of projected spending, a cut without precedent. They are angry that the short-term funding measures don't include the ""defund the Left"" measures House Republicans put in there, like zeroing out funding for Planned Parenthood and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In Bachmann's case, she believes that the Congress failed in one of its final chances to defund the implementation of the health care law. Eric Cantor said on Monday that he'd like for this to be the last CR, and that the next vote should fund the government through the rest of the fiscal year. That sets the stage for another battle. The Tea Party is used to winning those; this week, it hopes, is a fluke. The Don't-Tread-on-Meter drops one point, to 40. What Is the Don't-Tread-on-Meter?It will track the progress (or lack thereof) of the Republican House of Representatives, and the Republican conference in the Senate, in fulfilling the promises they made to Tea Party activists. The meter will hit 100 if and when the GOP does absolutely everything it promised. You can now add the Don't-Tread-on-Meter to your blog or site. Just click the button in the lower right of the widget to get the code."	Continuing resolution: Republicans fund the government three more weeks, angering the Tea Party.
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/gently_gently.html	"After President Obama's Friday news conference, this much is clear: He is only going to go so far, and he's going to take his time getting there. He spoke about gas prices, Libya, and the federal budget, and in each case, whatever flashes of action he might have been offering were wrapped a grandmother's vase of description, explanation, and other verbal care. At times it was hard to discern whether he was proposing any action at all. On Libya, for example, the president said, ""We are tightening the noose on Qaddafi."" Strong language--except that when he outlined the steps being taken--a NATO meeting slated for next Tuesday, for example--it didn't quite match the language. Even when talking about horrific violence he was almost elliptical. ""The idea that when Qaddafi said that they'd be going door to door hunting for people who are participating in protests--you know, that implied a, sort of, lack of restraint and ruthlessness that I think raises our antenna,"" he said. This is the Obama way to which we've become accustomed. It will not satisfy critics who call for action to show that the president is engaged in current affairs. He doesn't play that game much. He opened the press conference to announce that military ships were headed to Japan to help in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, but when talking about the ongoing issues he faces, there were few sharp declarations. Each answer had a formula: Step back to explain the measures that were taken before, outline the steps taken since, and present the options available in the future for possible decision making. Obama repeatedly stressed that he weighs sending forces into battle very carefully. The message of the entire news conference was about balance. He said he had pushed for oil exploration, as Republicans want, but he'd done it ""responsibly."" He wants ""prudent spending cuts."" That's a message the White House thinks independent voters want to hear: not partisan but thoughtful. The deliberate approach--some answers went to 10 minutes--was at odds with the signals being sent from the president's aides before the press conference, which was that there would be some clear lines drawn. Obama had called the gathering to show, in part, that he was on the case. If you're worried about prices at the pump, the president's answer was, ""There are no quick fixes."" He didn't use those actual words, but that was the upshot. He explained that the payroll tax cut he worked out with Republicans last year put $80 a month (or 23 gallons at current prices) into people's paychecks, which should cushion the blow of higher prices. He described efforts his administration is taking to increase domestic energy production and called for comprehensive energy legislation. He is prepared to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cushion any price spikes that might come from an interruption in oil flows, but he's not going to do that just yet. ""It's teed up,"" he said. On the budget, Democrats in Congress have been asking the president to pressure Republicans in negotiations over funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year. He went gently, much as he did in the negotiations over extending the Bush tax cuts last year. He called on both sides to work together. Instead of saying ""get it done,"" the president builds the case and then concludes, ""We should be able to get it done."" It's not an order as much as it is an indirect application of pressure from the weight of evidence. Obama said House Republicans shouldn't expect to get 100 percent of their demands. That's a pretty low bar for most Democrats. Obama did defend Pell grants and the Head Start program, adding specifics to his general remarks earlier in the week . He also gave a general direction to Republicans. The president has accused Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin of trying to use emergency action to address budget shortfalls to pass ideological legislation. Obama warned Republicans in Washington about doing the same thing. ""Let's not try to sneak political agendas into a budget debate,"" he said. In Washington this is like saying let's not sneak meat into a steakhouse. Making the suggestion isn't going to do much. You've got to block the door. The president isn't ready to go that far yet. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	Obama's press conference: He was measured, careful, and hesitant.
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/cairless.html	"There was a specter haunting the House Homeland Security Committee's hearing Thursday on ""radicalization in the Muslim community."" That specter was CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations. As the hearings began, with huge lines of spectators and journalists still trying to get in, committee chairman Rep. Peter King said that there really wasn't any way to save Muslims from extremism as long as CAIR got taken seriously. ""Moderate leadership must emerge from the Muslim community,"" said King, who was presiding over the hearing after three months of hype and outrage about its very existence. ""This means that responsible Muslim-American leaders must reject discredited groups such as CAIR, which was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the terrorist financing case involving the Holyland Foundation."" King was referring to the scandal and trial that brought down what was, for years, the largest Islamic charity in the United States. In 2009, the Holyland Foundation's founders were handed life sentences in prison for illegally sending money to Hamas. That scandal, arguably, got less coverage than King's battle with CAIR from the day he announced the hearing to the day he finally put it on. ""In the lead-up to this hearing,"" said King, ""I found it shocking and sad that the mainstream media accepted CAIR's accusations""--that King's hearings were a sham--""as if it were a legitimate organization."" The media, hurriedly typing and taping everything in the room, wasn't writing about CAIR today. No one from CAIR was at the hearing. King hadn't invited them. ""I think it might have been helpful if we were invited,"" said Corey Saylor, CAIR's legislative director, after the hearing. (CAIR put together a potemkin ""testimony"" anyway.) ""So many of the attacks they leveled at us already have responses that have been out there for months."" The attacks got aired at the hearing, but the responses--which CAIR critics have dismissed many, many times already--didn't get aired. That was what King wanted. There wasn't much on display that couldn't be seen on a good night of Fox News programming, albeit with a bigger presence of carping, emotional Democrats. And that was a surprise. On Tuesday, in one of the many comments King gave to Politico about what would happen in the hearing, he said he wanted skeptics to expect something like ""the hearings that Bobby Kennedy had into labor-union corruption in the late 1950s."" He was referring to the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, which met for four years (Kennedy was chief counsel) and called more than 1,000 witnesses to uncover corruption in unions. Union leaders showed up to defend themselves. They didn't do a great job of it. Outside the hearing room, the people lining up were worried about a head-butting contest like that. Zak Delwahi, a Johns Hopkins student who wore a pin combining the American and Saudi flags on his jacket, said he wanted to witness ""history,"" but thought the hearing set a terrible precedent and would probably make Muslims more fearful. ""I've seen TheGodfather, Part II,"" he said. ""I know that these hearings are mostly for show, but that they're geared toward starting confrontations."" King's hearing went for another approach, sidestepping the chance to grill ""discredited groups"" in front of streaming CNN cameras. Instead, as King would say after the hearing, the goal was to break down ""a wall of political correctness on an issue that has to be addressed."" If that sounds like an awfully minor task for a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, it is. And as Adam Serwer pointed out, two relatively controversial thinkers invited to speak at the hearing were ditched because of--well, let's call it ""political correctness."" The witnesses who did testify were Abdirizak Bihi and Melvin Bledsoe, whose sons had been radicalized and recruited into terrorism, and M. Zuhdi Jasser, a doctor who has pointed to evidence from the Holy Land Foundation trial to argue that the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical interests want to install Sharia law in the United States. The fathers' testimony was riveting. Bihi said that religious leaders threatened him with ""eternal hellfire and damnation"" if they tampered with his son's decisions. Bledsoe said that radical Muslims were trying, and in some cases succeeding, to recruit young black men by telling them that they were living hopeless lives and they could do something about it by becoming terrorists. His son's imam, he said, encouraged him to head down that path. Democrats were largely unimpressed. Rep. Jackie Speier compared the witnesses' level of expertise to the expertise she might have in pedophilia, since she volunteered at her Catholic Church. ""While I appreciate the anecdotes of those who have spoken,"" she said, ""I don't think they're particularly enlightening."" Bledsoe, encouraged by sympathetic Republicans, had a response to that. ""I'm wondering how they [Democrats] got on the commission to speak about some of the things they speak about,"" he said. ""Most of the people talking on the other side are talking about political fear. That's what I mostly hear here. There is a small population that we're talking about, Islamic extremists, we're worried about stepping on their toes, and they're talking about stamping us out."" In one respect, though, Speier was right. Jasser, who has appeared in two documentaries to lay out the connections between peaceful-sounding Muslim groups and terrorists, didn't go there in front of the committee. Republican attempts to make direct connections between peaceful-sounding Muslim groups and the horror stories of the witnesses hit a wall, largely because Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca (a Democratic witness) kept arguing that it was better to work with groups like CAIR than to call them terrorists. ""Basically, you're dealing with a terrorist organization,"" said Rep. Chip Cravaack, a Republican freshman from Minnesota, ""and I'm trying to get you to understand that they might be using you, sir, to implement their goals."" ""Thank you for asking that question,"" said Baca, ""but it seems more like a possible accusation."" The accusation didn't hold up. Remaining Republican questioners were limited to asking what, as members of Congress, they could do to figure all this out. In a short press conference after the hearings ended, flanked by his witnesses, King pronounced the day a success. The next hearings, he said, might focus on radicalization in prisons. (The Senate's Homeland Security has held hearings on this issue with less fanfare.) In media terms, the hearings were a success, even if Rep. Keith Ellison's teary opening testimony was bound to take over some of the coverage. But if King wants to nail the people behind radicalization, why not bring in CAIR next time? ""The fact is that CAIR was named a terrorist co-conspirator in a terrorism funding case,"" said King. ""I hope the media would realize that, rather just taking CAIR handouts and reporting them as they'd report on the Knights of Columbus."""	Radicalization in the Muslim community: Why Rep. Peter King's hearings fizzled.

The channel's CEO resigned today after an outgoing fundraiser and executive, Ron Schiller, was caught on tape waxing poetic about NPR's fading need for federal money and its coverage of the Tea Party, Muslims, and environmentalism. (Schiller resigned on Tuesday.) It was a fantastically successful sting for Shaughn Adeleye and ""Simon Templar,"" two reporters for Project Veritas, the undercover video operation that James O'Keefe launched in the wake of his even-more-successful ACORN sting. (Simon Templar is also the name of the identity-changing hero of The Saint.) It was also the third news-cycle-throttling undercover political sting of the year. In January, pro-life activists went incognito to embarrass Planned Parenthood and help Republicans build momentum to end its federal funding. In February, a Buffalo alt-weekly writer posed as ""David Koch"" to sucker Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker into talking about his secret plans for winning the debate over an anti-union bill. If you think these stunts are ramping up, you're right--the undercover sting has become a certain method for bringing coverage to an undercovered issue and collecting the scalp of some official who hides behind press secretaries. O'Keefe's ACORN sting was the first of seven undercover black ops staged by him or his organization so far. Not all have been successful. To understand how to pull off a sting, it helps to know their recent history. ""Turkmeniscam""Release date: June 24, 2007Stinger: Ken SilversteinTarget: Lobbyists in Washington, D.C.What happened: Silverstein, then the Washington editor of Harper's, set up a fake firm called the ""Maldon Group,"" which was looking for D.C. lobbyists to help it build political connections. APCO, Cassidy & Associates, and other lobbying shops quoted him the prices they wanted in order to help the Maldon Group, which claimed to have close ties to the corrupt government of Turkmenistan, get into the halls of power. Silverstein expanded his investigative article into a book in 2008.Scalps: The firms were embarrassed, but not fatally. In 2009, Silverstein announced that he was fed up with political journalism and took a fellowship at the Open Society Institute and a job at Global Witness.Rating: 3 out of 10. No one lost his or her dirty business, except Silverstein, who got bored with his. The ACORN StingRelease date: September 2009Stinger: James O'Keefe and Hannah GilesTarget: Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)What happened: O'Keefe and Giles visited eight ACORN offices in the summer of 2009 with a simple ruse: He was an ambitious, clean-cut pimp who wanted to hide his profits and business from the IRS, and she was one of his prostitutes. Most of the volunteers they talked to, especially at offices in Philadelphia and Baltimore, helped them out, although some appeared to think they were helping someone in a rotten situation, not enabling a potential crime.Scalps: Less than a year after Democrats had robustly defended ACORN from charges of voter-registration fraud, the party couldn't have abandoned it faster. The House and Senate voted to ban ACORN from receiving taxpayer funds. The group fought back, with support from allies on the left. O'Keefe and Hannah Giles were sued by ACORN over the secret tapes they'd made. A former Massachusetts attorney general probed ACORN and found no criminal wrongdoing. But without funding, ACORN fell apart and filed for bankruptcy. Rating: 10. The target was destroyed, and a new brand of conservative undercover journalism was born.  The HUD StingRelease date: March 2010. (Executed the year before.)Stinger: James O'Keefe and Joe BaselTarget: The Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentWhat happened: O'Keefe and Basel got meetings at HUD offices in Detroit and Chicago and asked how, exactly, they could set up a kickback scheme using the Obama administration's housing credit. In at least one interview, they were told that they could misreport the sale prices of houses on forms. They took the footage to the Detroit Free Press and found no interest.Scalps: None. After Wired's Noah Schachtman reported on the forthcoming sting, the videos were not released.Rating: N/A The CAIR StingRelease date: Oct. 29, 2009Stinger: Chris Gaubatz and P. David GaubatzTarget: The Council on American-Islamic RelationsWhat happened: Chris Gaubatz, a young conservative activist, pretended to be a Muslim and got an internship at CAIR. He copied confidential documents for his father, and the results were published with fanfare in his book, Muslim Mafia. The Gaubatzes said they'd found proof that CAIR supported terrorism. Three House Republicans called for an investigation of whether a Muslim intern was able to operate as a spy on the Hill.Scalps: None. The scandal fizzled. CAIR won back its ill-gotten documents. There was no investigation on the Hill.Rating: 2. Getting members of Congress onboard was impressive, but the lack of sensational video made this sting a dud. The Landrieu Senate Office Sting Release date: None. (Stingers arrested January 25, 2010.)Stinger: James O'Keefe, Stan Dai, Joseph Basel, and Robert FlanaganTarget: Sen. Mary LandrieuWhat happened: The senator had voted for health care reform, and news reports claimed that her office had not been returning the phone calls of angry constituents. O'Keefe and his colleagues intended to show that the phones worked after all, implying that Landrieu simply didn't want to answer the calls. O'Keefe entered a New Orleans district office and waited for Basel and Dai. When the two men arrived dressed as phone repairmen, security guards stopped all three and arrested them on charges of entering federal offices on false pretenses with intent to commit felonies. Scalps: The stingers pleaded guilty in May 2010, getting probation, small fines, and 75 to 100 hours of community service. The phones at Landrieu's office continued to work.Rating: 0. A disaster in every way but one O'Keefe has used to trip up reporters who lazily misreport the details of it. The Census StingRelease date: May 2010Stinger: James O'KeefeTarget: The U.S. CensusWhat happened: O'Keefe was hired as an employee of the U.S. Census. He did not use a fake name. He showed up for work, grinded out 16 hours on the job, then filed paperwork claiming to have done 19.5 hours. He also videotaped the trainers telling new employees that this was the way to do it and that they'd be paid for lunch breaks. When someone expressed surprise at this, he was told, jokingly, not to ""open up a can of worms.""Scalps: None, really. Census directors claimed that they'd stepped up security. ""No hire will be allowed into the field without passing a fingerprint process,"" Census Director Robert Groves said, after the stories broke. ""Any name check that discovers a mismatch between name, date of birth, sex, or Social Security Number will stop processing of applicant."" They didn't change the payment process.Rating: 2. The story got huge play--it broke on Good Morning America--but there was no great outcry to reform the Census-taking process, which at this point was starting to wind down. The CNN StingRelease date: Sept. 29, 2010Stingers: James O'Keefe, Izzy Santa, Ben Wetmore, Jonathon BurnsTarget: Mainstream MediaWhat happened: CNN correspondent Abbie Boudreau was covering James O'Keefe for a report on conservative activism. On Aug. 10, O'Keefe suggested that Boudreau meet him alone. On Aug. 17, Boudreau came to the agreed-uponlocation but was warned by Santa that she was going to be the victim of a sting, with O'Keefe letting her onto a boat with--according to a leaked planning memo--""condom jar, dildos, posters and paintings of naked women, fuzzy handcuffs.""Scalps: None. Plenty of humiliation for the alleged conspirators, however, even though they said they'd scrapped the seduction plan.Rating: -1. A backfire that made CNN look good. Teachers Unions Gone Wild! Release date: October 2010Stingers: James O'Keefe, Christian Hartsock, Shaughn AdelyeTarget: The New Jersey Education Association What happened: The videographers saddled up with hidden recording devices and partied with teachers at a boozy conference. They were caught in vulnerable moments. Alissa Ploshnick was caught riffing on how it was impossible to fire tenured teachers. NJEA Associate Director Wayne Dibofsky alleged voter fraud during the 1997 Jersey City mayoral election.Scalps: Gov. Chris Christie cited the videos as proof that teachers unions, whom he'd been grappling with in a long-running battle, were out of control. Ploshnick was suspended for nine days and denied a salary increment for her comments on the video, and returned to work on Nov. 12.Rating: 4. No long-term damage, but it strengthened conservatives' hands as they went after teachers unions in New Jersey and other states. The Lila Rose Planned Parenthood StingRelease date: February 2011Stingers: Lila Rose and Live ActionTarget: Planned ParenthoodWhat happened: Anti-abortion activist Lila Rose got two actors to pose as sex traffickers, who secretly taped their interactions with clinic managers. They asked about medical care for prostitutes as young as 14 (who didn't exist) and about treatment for STDs. Planned Parenthood, warned about the possible stings, asked law enforcement to look into whether a sex trafficker was actually doing this.Scalps: One Planned Parenthood manager was fired. The organization announced that other employees would be retrained to deal with people asking for advice on illicit behavior. The Republican House added a rider defunding Planned Parenthood to its spending bill, but only 10 Democrats voted with them--a far cry from the wobbliness after the ACORN sting.Rating: 3. Too much of the same to attract media attention. The Koch StingRelease date: Feb. 22, 2011Stinger: Ian Murphy of the Buffalo Beast Target: Scott Walker, governor of WisconsinWhat happened: Murphy posed as David Koch, the billionaire industrialist, and spoke with Walker on the phone for 20 minutes. (Walker would later say he'd never met Koch, but the fact was that Koch employs thousands of people in the state and the Koch Industries PAC had donated $43,000 to Walker's campaign.) ""Koch"" egged Walker on to talk about ways to end the protests againsthis union-weakening budget repair bill. Walker listened and promised that he wouldn't cave and might try to tempt Senate Democrats--who'd fled the state to stop a vote--into returning early.Scalps: Wisconsin Democrats used a protracted debate over the Assembly's version of the budget bill to rip into Walker. State Democrats filed an ethics complaint about Walker's statements during the call, which is pending. Rating: 5 The NPR StingRelease date: March 7, 2011Stinger: James O'Keefe, ""Ibrahim Kasaam,"" and ""Amir Malik""Target: NPR What happened: Two men, Shaughn Adelye and ""Simon Templar"" posed as members of the ""Muslim Education Action Center,"" a charity founded by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, looking to donate $5 million to NPR. They met with NPR Foundation President Ron Schiller and executive Betsey Liley, and secretly taped a two-hour, free-wheeling conversation during which the NPR brass talked about Tea Partiers (""racist""), Jewish influence in the media, climate change, and other topics. Schiller said he was ""taking off my NPR hat"" before saying much of this.Scalps: Ongoing. Ron Schiller resigned from NPR and will not take a job he was offered at the Aspen Institute. Vivian Schiller (no relation) resigned as CEO of NPR. Additional NPR and Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding had already been cut from the House's version of this year's spending package; Democrats, led by the White House, want to add it back in, but there's a considerable amount of scrambling going on in the wake of this.Rating: 7. The goal of the sting was to get NPR brass to share their opinions of Muslims, Tea Partiers, and others, since they'd let Juan Williams go for saying (on Fox News) that he was occasionally fearful of Muslims. That succeeded completely. The goal of Republicans who are talking up the sting is to build momentum for defunding NPR. It remains to be seen whether the Schillers' scalps will change that."	James O'Keefe NPR video: A short history of political stings.
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/off_the_rails.html	"In the movie version of Atlas Shrugged, there is a scene in which Ayn Rand's libertarian heroes defy all odds, deploy some untold amount of private funding, and launch the fastest high-speed train in history over rails of experimental metal. ""The run of the John Galt Line is thrilling,""wrote the libertarian federal judge Alex Kozinski. ""When it crossed the bridge made of Rearden Metal, I wanted to stand up and cheer."" That's in the fantasy world. In the real world, libertarians aren't cheering for high speed rail but rather trying to stop it from being built. They are succeeding. In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich campaigned against a high-speed rail line funded by the stimulus, got elected, and turned down the funding. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker did the same thing, only more so--his anti-train campaign even had its own Web site. In Florida, the state Supreme Court has just approved Gov. Rick Scott's decision to reject $2.4 billion of federal funds to build a Tampa-Orlando rail line; the state was being asked to contribute only $280 million to finish it off. The funding was originally agreed to by Charlie Crist, one of the Tea Party's archenemies, so Scott's victory could hardly be any sweeter. But it could hardly make less sense to liberals. What, exactly, do Republicans, conservatives, and libertarians have against trains? Seriously, what? Why did President George W. Bush try to zero out Amtrak funding in 2005? Why is the conservative Republican Study Committee suggesting that we do so now? Why does George Will think ""the real reason for progressives' passion for trains is their goal of diminishing Americans' individualism in order to make them more amenable to collectivism""? ""You need to distinguish between Republicans and conservatives and libertarians when you look at this,"" says William Lind, the director of the American Conservative Center for Public Transportation. ""It's the libertarians who push this crap."" Libertarians, of course, have no problem with trains (see, e.g., Atlas Shrugged). They do have a problem with federal spending on transportation, as do many Republicans. Atlas Shrugged was published in 1957; Amtrak took over the rails in 1971. Since then, conservatives will sing the praises of private rail projects but criticize federally funded projects that don't meet the ideal. Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., for example, pushed a high-speed rail initiative through Congress in 2008. By 2010, he was denouncing ""the Soviet-style Amtrak operation"" that had ""trumped true high-speed service"" in Florida. In 2011, as the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, he is interested in saving the Orlando-Tampa project by building 21 miles between the airport and Disney World. This is about 21 miles farther than local Republicans want to go. For more than a decade, Lind and a conservative movement icon, Paul Weyrich, collaborated on papers about why conservatives should support rail. Their 2001 paper, ""Twelve Anti-Transit Myths: A Conservative Critique,"" actually tackled 34 ""myths"" about rail, including ""rail transit is a federal conspiracy"" and ""trains are noisy."" It ended with Lind and Weyrich declaring of their foes: ""THESE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT!"" Weyrich died in 2008, effectively cutting the number of conservative rail prophets in half. ""Conservatives used to be in favor of a civilized way of doing things,"" says Lind. ""Board a train and you don't have the TSA groping you. If you think our greatest vulnerability is a dependence on foreign oil, here's a way to get around that can run on coal or electrified rails."" But conservatives hear that spiel every day. They have a response that's part economics and part culture. The economics are simple: Trains cost too much. Randal O'Toole, a Cato Institute fellow who studies transportation and is constantly cited by rail skeptics, likes to compare the total federal subsidies-per-passenger of rail to subsidies-per-passenger on highways. Amtrak got $2.2 billion in pure subsidies in 2010 and carried 28.7 million people, for around 13 cents per passenger, although some researchers estimate the annual cost at closer to 30 cents. Highways got $42 billion in funds in fiscal year 2010, but far more people use them; the estimate puts cost at between 1 cent and 4 cents per driver. But there is another way to look at the numbers: Amtrak passengers pay more of the cost of their transportation than do drivers on the interstate. About 62 percent of Amtrak's operating expenses, according to the Department of Transportation, comes from fares. According to the Federal Highway Administration, the percentage of highway spending paid for by users--in the form of gas taxes and tolls--is headed below 50 percent. But that's only part of the conservative gripe about building new rail lines. They have two fiscal problems. One: The new lines will run over budget, because they always run over budget. Two: Not enough people will ever, ever ride them to make the numbers work. In Florida, Scott killed the Tampa-Orlando line in part because of the findings of a Reason Foundation analysis, conducted by transportation consultant Wendell Cox. Based on the results of a study tracking transportation spending over 70 years, he estimated that Florida's line would go ""between $0.54 billion and $2.7 billion"" over budget, with taxpayers eating the costs. On Tuesday, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the GOP's whip in the House, unloaded on the plans for high-speed rail in California, accusing planners of making up dreamy projections for ridership. ""Where they are building this? In the central valley. And they are saying 14 million people will ride?"" said McCarthy. ""In the central valley less than 750,000 people take a plane or train. They don't have enough money to build it now. They are trying to get the federal government to put so much in, but that doesn't finish the job. So we're going to have a train to nowhere."" The train advocate will say that the optimistic numbers are realistic. Amtrak ridership increases every year. Light rail and urban transportation projects, the ones most often derided as boondoggles, can overrun cost estimates, but they build ridership anyway--Seattle and Los Angeles are examples of that.  And then there's the threat of increasing gas prices, which train boosters point to for proof that we're going to want these lines eventually. The people who crunch the data--the people who are cited by everyone from Will to Walker--don't buy it. ""I've heard someone say, 'Well, Tampa-Orlando might not make sense today, but what about when gas goes to $8?'"" says Wendell Cox. ""If everyone wanted to go on it, there wouldn't be enough room! If gas goes to $8, it's still going to be more expensive to take the train than to drive. If gas prices double, I bet you'll see huge increases in fuel efficiency within two years."" Leaving aside the apparent contradiction--first rail doesn't make sense because no one would ride it, then it doesn't make sense because too many people would want to ride it--Cox's point is the conservatives' second play in their anti-rail argument: the cultural case against rail. Rail can't work because people don't want to ride it. Liberals want to fund rail because they want to change behavior. ""A lot of this has to do with Euro-envy,"" says Cox. ""People like to talk about how much better Europe is. I don't see that their quality of life is better in Europe. The fact is that we live in a dispersed society, and there's no set of circumstances where people are going to leave cars and take rail transportation."" O'Toole also cited Euro-envy as a big motivation for train boosters. It was not a coincidence that the first sizable high-speed rail projects were set to connect Disneyland and Las Vegas, and to connect Tampa and Orlando: Disney is popular with European and American tourists. ""The plan, again and again, seems to be: Get a cheap proposal, get people to buy in, then get to the point where you can't stop spending,"" says O'Toole. ""The goal in Florida, for example, was to build high-speed rail really fast. People will ride it. People will say, 'Woohoo! I want this in my state!' And since the federal government will fund most of the cost we'll have demand for it in Texas, demand for it in Iowa, and so on. Nobody will think about cost until it's too late."" He's certainly right that rail advocates want rail to take off. If or when it does, the rail lines will be able to run more on fares than on subsidies. And conservatives are certainly right that if the rail advocates get their way, they're going to change personal behavior. But that's what most government policy aims to do. Taxes are cut or raised, subsidies offered or canceled, laws passed or repealed, in the hopes that it will change behavior. And this brings us to the last time conservatives took a look at upping rail funding. Before and after 9/11, George Will was talking up rail as a way to take more people off planes and make America less vulnerable to terrorists. That argument has more or less vanished. Why? ""It helped that somebody bombed a train in Spain,"" says O'Toole. ""If you concentrate people in one vehicle, then the vehicle is vulnerable. You concentrate society, and it's vulnerable. So maybe it's not a good thing to concentrate people."""	Why do conservatives hate trains so much?
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/embrace_explain_or_evade.html	"When former Washington Mayor Marion Barry mounted his political comeback after being caught smoking crack cocaine, he tried to turn his difficulties with drugs into an asset. ""I'm in recovery,"" he said, ""and so is my city.""The pitch worked. * Barry was re-elected, offering hope to all politicians who face a less acute but similar problem: how to handle that one liability that could sink your campaign. There are three options: embrace, explain, or evade. In the last several weeks, we've seen examples of each approach from Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Mike Huckabee as they all have tried to put the best gloss on what might appear to be the weaker parts of their resumes. Though the campaign has yet to get underway, Romney has already tried two of these approaches. His problem is the health care bill he signed into law in Massachusetts. Conservatives don't like it because it's similar to President Obama's national plan, which   80 percent of Republicans oppose. Given that level of antipathy, it is a compulsory exercise in the Republican presidential competition to denounce Obamacare. Romney didn't at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month. The omission seemed like an extreme version of the evade technique: Romney was evading his own plan so thoroughly he wouldn't even talk about the Obama plan to which it had been compared. This naturally brought more unfavorable attention to Romney's plan. Next he tried explaining. Saturday in the crucial primary state of New Hampshire, he acknowledged he would have done some things differently in passing the law, though he didn't explain exactly what. Romney went on to say that what distinguished his effort from the president's is that he was acting as the governor of a single state.  Obama had overreached by imposing a solution on the whole country. This federalist argument isn't going to win over those who say Romney's plan is ""socialism,"" as Mike Huckabee called it. But Romney is never going to win over those doubters. He and his aides hope that it will be sufficient to satisfy those who merely have doubts but for whom the health care issue won't determine their vote. Romney's uncertain support for his own legislation does, however, raise questions about his ""authenticity,"" a problem that Slate named as his biggest liability in 2008. One Romney adviser pointed to John McCain's difficulty with immigration reform in 2008 as a possible analogy. Republicans were angry with McCain, but the issue didn't kill him because he had other attributes he could offer voters. (Romney should know: He's the one who tried to damage McCain on the immigration issue.) Romney's hope is that by offering himself as a successful businessman who knows what's necessary to get the economy producing jobs again, he can minimize the damage from his support for universal health care. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has been bolder with his liabilities. His successor, John Boehner, is trying desperately not to repeat the government shutdowns of the mid-'90s. Gingrich took ownership of those shutdowns in a Washington Post column and proclaimed them a success. By standing on principle, he said, he was able to get a balanced budget and reform welfare. He took a similar route with his personal liabilities. Twice divorced, he is an admitted adulterer with the woman who is now his third wife. Rudy Giuliani, who faced the identical problem, kept his wife largely out of the campaign. Gingrich has taken the opposite approach: His wife Callista is a full partner in the enterprise. Her photograph is almost larger than Gingrich's on his exploratory Web site, and as Ben Smith points out, her name was the first word Gingrich uttered when he announced he was going to think about preparing for a presidential run. The benefit of taking control of your liabilities is that you define them on your own terms before your opponents and the media do. Mike Huckabee will have to once again face questions about Maurice Clemmons, who was serving time in an Arkansas state prison for burglary when Huckabee granted him clemency. Clemmons went on to murder four police officers in Washington state. At a session with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor recently, Huckabee grabbed his decision with both hands:"	Health care, adultery, murder: How Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Mike Huckabee are handling the issues that could sink...
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/there_will_be_cuts.html	"If you want to get a rise out of a congressional Republican, ask him whether he thinks the budget debate will end in a government shutdown. Go ahead. Ask. ""The only people talking about shutdown are media and Democrats,"" said an exasperated Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., in a scrum with reporters this week. ""I find that very interesting. Oh--them, and also Wisconsin state senate Democrats."" On the other side of the Hill, Republicans say the same thing. Freshman Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., responded to the question by describing how it came up at a town-hall meeting in his district. ""Even in that audience,"" he said, ""which was made up of a lot of moderates from my district--even they were willing to admit that whenever they turned on their televisions and heard somebody talking about a shutdown, the somebody was a Democrat."" It's unanimous: The shutdown talk is a Democratic distraction tactic. Republicans don't want to shut the government down, no matter what some of their more battle-ready members said before the election, or as late as last week. This is not just the GOP's line. It also has the benefit of being true. The party is getting most of what it wants right now by taking advantage of the existential dread of a government shutdown and of the Democrats' failure, in 2010, actually to pass a budget. They're not getting everything they want, but in conversations this week, Republicans suggested that they could get most of it without shutting down anything. ""I think the ability to finish out a CR from here to September is important,"" said freshman Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. ""But if the Senate's not willing to cut spending, and if it's only willing to cut spending two weeks at a time, then so be it."" Gardner quickly pondered his choice of words, which got Speaker of the House John Boehner in trouble, albeit on a different issue. ""I'd rather not say, 'So be it,' "" he said. ""Those words seem to have taken on a life of their own."" He was just being honest. The fear of a shutdown was telegraphed so long in advance that it lost its ability to scare, like some 3-D sequel to  Jaws. The point of a possible shutdown, as some Republicans first discussed it, was to force the Obama administration to accept spending cuts. When Newt Gingrich floated the possibility of a shutdown 11 months ago at an appearance at the Heritage Foundation, he said the 1995-96 government shutdown had actually gone the GOP's way and led to a balanced budget. There's no balanced budget on the horizon right now. What Republicans want are cuts-- the biggest cuts they can possibly get. They have figured out that they can get sizable cuts by running right up to the line of crisis, then getting continuing resolutions passed. That was what happened this week. Republicans had offered a two-week continuing resolution that funded the government while cutting $4 billion from discretionary spending--education, transportation, health and human services, the usual suspects. And it passed. Republicans aren't saying that weeks and weeks of short-term continuing resolutions are ideal--nobody thinks this--but the resolutions are a way to get what they want despite controlling only one chamber of Congress. This is easier than a shutdown and more popular. Polling on the threat of a standoff, with its attendant imagery of federal parks closing their doors and Social Security checks sitting unsent in vaults, doesn't look good for anyone. Last month's  Washington Post poll on the possibility asked voters whom they'd blame for a shutdown. Thirty-six percent said Republicans, 35 percent said the president, and 17 percent said both. Republicans, on-message, insist that Democrats want the crisis to happen to help Obama. Democrats, on-message, insist that Republicans are Sam Peckinpah characters who can't be reasoned with. ""Both sides have studied what happened in 1995 as if it was the Holy Grail,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ""I understand that. The country's aware that there's more to this than dickering over a two-week agreement."" I talked to Wyden in the early afternoon; he speculated that the White House could regain the initiative here by defining its goals. ""This next round, the White House has an opportunity to frame this debate in terms of pro-growth economics and an agenda the country can rally to,"" he said. ""If not, it's going to look like, oh, a short-term deal, then more people in suits stand around and bicker, then another short-term."" A few hours later, the White House went in another direction. Gene Sperling, the head of the president's National Economic Council, announced that the administration could accept $6.5 billion more in cuts. There was no specifying what the cuts would be. But there would be cuts. Republicans are taking a lot of ground as they fight this out. They are not taking everything. Their seven-month continuing resolution, passed last month, includes riders that ban Planned Parenthood funding and strip funding to implement the Affordable Care Act and other riders that fulfill promises they made on the trail. The continuing resolution that passed this week doesn't include these. That's the reason Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. opposed it, and that will be a reason some of their members oppose these CRs. But there's no serious talk of shutting government down over this. The policy fights can happen when the 2012 budget comes out. The debate over cuts can happen now, with Democrats reacting to Republican proposals. ""The cuts we can agree to, ultimately, will be the cuts,"" said Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb. Asked what cuts he could support, he said: ""They will be subject to negotiation, but they will be substantial. My sense is that we have a lot of people running around here with a number or a percentage but not a plan. We need to develop a plan."" Failing that, they can kick the can another two weeks."	How Republicans are winning the debate over the federal budget.
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/libertarians_shrugged.html	"Atlas Shrugged: Part I, the new cinematic adaptation of Ayn Rand's multimillion-selling novel, ends with a long list of special thanks. The producers thank the Club for Growth, the organization that helps liberal Republicans spend more time with their families; FreedomWorks, the non-Koch-funded Tea Party group; the Atlas Society, a think tank that promotes Rand's ideas and legacy; and Ronnie James Dio. The late singer for Elf, Rainbow, and Black Sabbath, one of the founding banshees of heavy metal, was one of the people who kept the project alive. John Aglialoro, a board member of the Atlas Society and one of the film's two producers, bought the rights to adapt  Atlas Shrugged 18 years ago. In 2010, the rights were about to be ""lost forever"" after years of dithering by studios, funders, and eight screenwriters. Aglialoro hooked up with Harmon Kaslow, who had less experience in the libertarian universe but more experience making films, and in six weeks in the summer of 2010 they finished production of the movie. For months they have been previewing it to the sort of people who could help promote it--CPAC, the Cato Institute, libertarian businessmen. ""I put together clips for that Koch meeting that happened in Palm Springs last month,"" says Kaslow. ""I thought, 'Which of these scenes would be the ones that really wealthy people relate to?' "" Sadly, the preview never made it onto the schedule. I saw the movie, which is scheduled to be released nationwide April 15--a date not chosen at random--at a screening for journalists and libertarian activists on Wednesday. The consensus was that the movie is not as bad as libertarians had feared it would be, after all those delays and those iffy prerelease clips and that tiny budget. (Aglialoro says producers have spent ""something in the $20 million range"" on the project over the last 18 years.) It doesn't need to be good. Atlas Shrugged has sold somewhere between 7 million and 8 million copies in the United States. In 2009, the first year of the Tea Party, it sold around 500,000 copies. Themes from the novel, like the question ""Who is John Galt?"" and the concept of ""looters"" who subsist on the work of others, were sketched onto Tea Party signs. Members of Congress compared President Obama's policies to the policies of the novel's villains, a flabby crew of lobbyists and lazy businessmen. Of course, the novel is very long. Atlas Shrugged readers remember what age they were when they started the book; they don't always remember if they finished it. This movie, directed by One Tree Hill star Paul Johansson, compresses the novel's first 400 or so pages into 102 minutes of exposition, boardroom scenes, tasteful parties, and computerized high-speed rail montages. Anyone who's seen a SyFy Channel original movie in which a mutated insect battles a mutated amphibian will be comfortable with the production quality. Anyone who's seen a faithful Christian adaptation of a Bible story will be comfortable with the style of adaptation--as much original text on-screen as the screen can hold. The actors and scenes are there to present Rand's philosophy to the Twilight and Nicholas Sparks set. The plot begins on Sept. 2, 2016, as the disembodied voices of news anchors helpfully explain that oil prices are so high that rail has become the only affordable method of transportation. Times are bad. Sad people warm themselves by the heat of trash-can fires. Businessmen in suits write their resumes on sandwich boards and walk back and forth. It rains a lot. A businessman is followed out of a diner by a man covered by a black hat and opportune shadows. That man is John Galt--a genius who's building a hideaway of geniuses. ""Midas Mulligan!"" he yells. ""Who's asking?"" says the businessman. ""Someone who knows what it's like to work for himself and not let others feed off the profit of his energy!"" The businessman ponders this. ""That's funny. Exactly what I've been thinking."" Mulligan disappears, and we learn (if we didn't know this already from Tea Party signs) that he has joined a strike by productive intellectuals who've had it with oppressive, redistributive laws. We figure this out long before Dagny Taggart does. Played by Taylor Schilling with the legginess and steeliness that Rand intended, Taggart tries to save her family's rail company, Taggart International, from the mismanagement of her dithering brother James and his political friends, well played by overweight character actors who are rarely seen without a drink or a steak. So she hooks up with handsome industrialist Henry Rearden, whose company produces a revolutionary metal alloy that could be the salvation of Taggart International. Rearden is played by Grant Bowler, who looks and acts more like Daniel Craig's James Bond than Daniel Craig does. (""Rearden would never have a faux-hawk,"" said one libertarian at my screening, aghast at Rearden's stylish hair.) Dagny and Henry get into a lot of arguments with James--as when they defend Taggart's deal with an oil magnate named Ellis Wyatt. ""You keep pissing off the heart of this operation!"" says Dagny. ""Wyatt is going to provide the blood it takes to keep this company alive! Do you understand that?"" ""That metal is completely untested!"" says James, waving a sheaf of research. ""The consensus of the best metallurgical authorities is highly skeptical!"" Most of the dialogue clunks like that. ""There's not much you can do about the dialogue,"" sighed Fred Smith, president of the libertarian think tank CEI, after the screening. It's supposed to clunk. The book doesn't sell millions of copies because it's subtle. It sells because it offers a fully formed philosophy of reason and self-interest, much of it in a speech by Galt. (The speech will be in the third movie of this planned trilogy, if it gets finished.) So the movie doesn't work as drama; as allegory, it works about as well as the Randians could want it to. (If it was meant to be drama, somebody in the year 2016 would get tired of hearing mysterious people ask ""Who is John Galt?"" and Google it already.) According to Aglialoro, when the movie was shown to Rand's former lover and ""intellectual heir"" Nathaniel Branden, he wept. It also drives home just how unlike Atlas Shrugged the Obama years have actually been. Rand's dopey bureaucrats are able to talk about anti-ingenuity legislation one day and pass it the next. One bill makes it illegal for anyone to own more than one company; another puts a surtax on the state of Colorado, because it's doing too well. The Obama administration, during the crisis years of 2009 and 2010, had mixed luck with passing legislation, and it never actually raised taxes except on cigarette smokers. Sure, Atlas Shrugged the novel has worked as a thought experiment. The movie sort of works as a thought experiment. It's an incomplete thought. The federal government's massive bank and auto industry bailouts eroded trust in the government and in companies that took bailouts--this even after the companies staggered back to profit and started paying the money back. These developments don't resemble the novel's plot at all; they were stopgap measures by scared capitalists, who socialized risk to prevent real socialism from taking hold. Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP's fiscal brain, voted for TARP a few months before he phoned the Atlas Society to ask how this movie was coming along. If this movie breaks big, or even if it gets an afterlife on Netflix, will it make as many converts as the novel? Doubtful; Rand's gospel of selfishness works better on the page than on film. This installment of the movie ends with Dagny hiking up Wyatt's property to see the oil wells he set ablaze when he left to join Galt. He left a sign, daring the bureaucrats to take it over: ""I'm leaving it as I found it."" But he's not leaving it as he found it. He bought mineral rights, made a profit, and left the land with a lot less oil and a few more towering infernos. This may be a sign that Aglialoro and Kaslow made a successful allegory: It's open to an interpretation that they never intended."

In the time between their last votes and their votes today, congressional Republicans have nudged Congress closer to a budget showdown, and closer - temporarily - to a compromise they get the better half of. On Friday, Republicans proposed a two-week continuing resolution that would keep the government operating while cutting $4 billion. Democrats, blinking a bit, tentatively agreed to pass it. That kicks the can down the road on the budget showdown that Republicans are demanding, but it's a mighty short road. Not everyone is happy with the impasse. First off, there's that ""uncertainty"" that Republicans occasionally blame for economic angst. ""Regardless of party,"" conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin told CNN, ""it's just bad governance. A pox on both their houses."" Second, the showdown, if it comes, will come over $61 billion of cuts, or 61 percent of what Republicans promised in the 2010 campaign. But just think of how far the debate has come. As Jed Lewison pointed out on Monday, Tim Pawlenty faced a possible shutdown in 2005, in Minnesota. He accused Democrats of cynicism and declined the bait. Over the weekend, he told a reporter that he regretted not forcing a shutdown. Republicans aren't afraid of a shutdown anymore; when they talk about the 1995 shutdown with Bill Clinton, they all turn into Sylvester Stallone at the start of Rambo. (""Do we get to win this time?"") They're girded for the fight; the Meter rises accordingly, to 41.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/the_real_obama_doctrine.html	"Immediately after President Obama spoke Monday night about the American mission in Libya, NBC aired a tribute to George Herbert Walker Bush. It was fitting, since Obama's speech had been a kind of tribute, too. Though the sweeping claims for American action at times made Obama sound like the more recent Bush president, the central message was the one associated with his father: prudence. Obama started with a clear mission statement. He promised to explain ""what we have done, what we plan to do, and why this matters to us."" He was very strong on Items 1  and 3 but got fuzzy on Item No. 2. The president had a pile of reasons the United States had to get involved: Muammar Qaddafi was about to slaughter the residents of Benghazi; the international community was asking for U.S. assistance, as were the anti-Qaddafi forces within Libya; allowing Qaddafi to crack down would have weakened the pro-freedom movements in other Middle Eastern and North African countries; the authority of the United Nations was in question. Above all else, though, the president said that American values were at stake. ""There will be times ... when our safety is not directly threatened but our interests and values are,"" Obama said. He talked about ""our responsibilities to our fellow human beings,"" universal rights and the core principles Americans share with those fighting Qaddafi. He cited America's unique (and exceptional!) history--""born, as we are, out of a revolution by those who longed to be free."" You could almost see and hear the Marine band coming on stage. It was stirring stuff, the same mood music John F. Kennedy had sounded when he said: ""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty."" But while Obama was aiming for the skies with his rhetoric, he was anxious to show just how earthbound and limited the actual mission was. We won't go farther than the international coalition will allow. The military mission was limited and largely over. Our values don't compel the United States to intervene wherever humanity is threatened--in, say, the Ivory Coast, Darfur, Bahrain, Yemen, or Syria. The statement that had sounded like a bold doctrine--that what guides a U.S. decision to intervene is not just threats to our safety, but threats to ""our interests and values""--came with an asterisk that led to some fine print at the bottom of the speech: Offer valid only if it's a relatively easy military mission and we have a lot of allies and we only share a limited amount of the burden. Then we'll get in the fight for a bit and hope for the best. This isn't the Obama Doctrine. It's Obama's Libya Doctrine. The president has been accused of staying in the background during the Libya operation. That was a tactical decision during the early stages to downplay the American role and highlight the international coalition. He rhetorically came on stage tonight. Explaining the story so far, he made liberal use of the first-person singular. ""At my direction ... I refused to let that happen ... I ordered warships into the Mediterranean ... The pledge that I made ... I refused to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking action ... The task that I assigned our forces ... And tonight, I can report that we have stopped Qaddafi's deadly advance."" Most important, the president was able to declare the mission accomplished and promises kept. ""So for those who doubted our capacity to carry out this operation, I want to be clear: the United States of America has done what we said we would do. ... I said that America's role would be limited; that we would not put ground troops into Libya; that we would focus our unique capabilities on the front end of the operation, and that we would transfer responsibility to our allies and partners. Tonight, we are fulfilling that pledge."" Obama also made the case for a different kind of leadership. ""American leadership is not simply a matter of going it alone and bearing all of the burden ourselves,"" he said. ""Real leadership creates the conditions and coalitions for others to step up as well."" The speech was mostly backward-looking. Questions about the future--the questions members of Congress want answered--were left largely unaddressed. What does the mission look like in the future? When does the United States leave? What happens if Qaddafi holds on? The tension in the U.S. position rests between the president's constant assertions that the military mission is strictly limited to humanitarian assistance and the fact that the military mission is aiding those trying to remove Qaddafi from power. The U.N. resolution calls for protecting the citizens of Libya, but NATO isn't simply protecting civilians huddled in their homes. The attacks, including U.S. airpower, are aiding those civilians marching on Tripoli to change the regime. That's not something the president can admit, however. It wouldn't be prudent.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/compromising_positions.html	"Newt Gingrich learned the difference between being a pundit and a candidate this week. Before he announced he was thinking about announcing his candidacy for president, he could opine without fear of contradiction--which is to say, he could contradict himself all he wanted. No one would notice. Now people do. As it turns out, on Libya, he was for a no-fly zone before he was against it. The former House speaker once said that flip-flopping was a disqualification for office. If that were true, the man he was attacking would not be president. President Obama this week was participating in an even more high-profile reversal than Gingrich's.  As a candidate in 2007, then-Sen. Obama said a president could not unilaterally authorize military action * without Congress' consent. That's just what he's now doing in Libya. As we lumber toward a campaign year, the flip-flop will become a topic of much conversation. Which candidates have changed their positions, and what does it mean? Are political promises a mere starting point, suggesting how a candidate will behave? Or are they sacrosanct? All politicians change their positions. But there are different kinds of reversals. Sometimes they can be the product of evolution or circumstance. Other times, candidates do the shimmy because they have no core beliefs. That's more worrisome than simple political hackery, cases in which a candidate changes his position because doing so will make it easier to attack the other guy. The way we untangle Gingrich's and Obama's reversals might help us evaluate the president asking to be re-elected and as calibrate our expectations for the candidates making promises who want to replace him. Gingrich's change was politically motivated but unimportant. He holds no office and has a very long climb to the Republican nomination. When he changes his mind, no one is affected. He is a deeply political person and a professional pundit who sees it as his job to wing out ideas that damage the opposition. All that Gingrich has shown us in his reversal is that he is sloppy. In his explanation of his discordant opinions, he has proved only that he has to sharpen his communications skills. We don't want a president who speaks carelessly, and the transparent point-scoring divides the country and poisons the conversation. At the same time, we've forgiven candidates--including the one now in office--when they've behaved similarly. The president's change is important but not politically motivated. Obama outlined a principle in 2007 about the relationship between the executive and the conduct of war. ""The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation,"" he wrote. As a teacher of constitutional law, he was not offering an idle opinion. As a relatively inexperienced candidate, he was holding forth on one topic on which he could claim expertise. Now that he's in office, and at a moment his supporters imagined would bring out his firmest convictions, he's changed his mind. This isn't just afternoon cable chatter. As a result of his reversal, there are bombs in the air and people in danger. Obama's change could serve as an illustration of the temptations of the executive branch. No matter what a presidential candidate says in a campaign, the power of the office is difficult to resist. But there is another way to explain it: A president should be allowed, and in fact encouraged, to respond to changing circumstances. And sometimes those circumstances will require him to rethink his principles. Perhaps it is the rigidity of the campaign promise that is at fault. And maybe the media and the public need to ask a follow-up question: It's essential to know a candidate's principles, but we should also ask about conditions under which he would reconsider them. If a candidate doesn't offer anything but rigidity, then he is either trying to fool us (shocking), or he doesn't allow for the fact that the real world is inevitably more complicated than you think. Obama has shed his old belief because he is dealing with a fast-moving and changing situation in which thousands of lives are at stake. He has a pass to expand on his original views. George W. Bush was unfairly criticized for going back on his campaign pledge that he wouldn't engage in ""nation-building."" That was cheap: The world had changed. Nation-building was important in a country like Afghanistan. It's possible to believe that and still think the adventure in Iraq was a bad idea, poorly executed. Obama's aides argue that what he is well within his constitutional authority. But that's not the issue. What causes people to question the president is that they're unclear about the space between his promises and his actions. If you're going to change your mind, you've got to explain why. This is both a responsibility to voters and in your self-interest as a president, because if you say nothing, the worst possible interpretation will fill the vacuum. The president is scheduled to address the nation on Libya ""in the very near future"" (probably Monday). Perhaps he will use the occasion to explain why he changed his mind.

Seven members of the party voted against the bill, and at least one did so on constitutional grounds: ""The bill's treatment of NPR is arguably unconstitutional,"" wrote Michigan Rep. Justin Amash on his Facebook page. ""Art. I, Sec. 9, of the Constitution prohibits Congress from passing bills of attainder."" With his explanation, Amash was honoring a prominent promise from the 2010 campaign, a plank in the GOP's Pledge to America. ""We will require each bill moving through Congress to include a clause citing the specific constitutional authority upon which the bill is justified,"" wrote Republicans. This was music to the Tea Party, which defeated at least one Democrat because they'd asked him to point to the part of the Constitution that justified the Affordable Care Act, and he blew them off, saying he ""didn't worry"" about it. Now some Republicans aren't worrying too much about it. Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., who introduced the NPR bill, filed a ""Constitutional Authority Statement"" that consisted entirely of six words: ""Article I, Section 8, Clause 1."" For those of you scoring at home, that part of the Constitution allows Congress to ""lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises."" ""No lawyer takes this seriously,"" said an exasperated Sandy Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas's law school. ""As any lawyer would know, it is not hard to come up with a constitutional justification for anything you want to do."" The Constitutional Authority Statements filed so far in the 112th Congress tend to support that view. They're a fascinating exercise. More than 1,200 pieces of legislation have been introduced so far in this Congress, slightly more coming from Republicans than from Democrats, and all of them are accompanied by statements. The main lesson is the same that a lot of legal cynics predicted last year: Almost anything can be justified by citing the Commerce Clause, which allows Congress ""to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes"" or the Necessary and Proper Clause, which allows Congress to ""make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers."" ""Just the mere fact that they start these discussions, that's helpful,"" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who campaigned on a promise not to vote for anything that wasn't justified in the Constitution. ""The extent to which they turn out to be helpful will turn on how much actual analysis takes place, because there are ways of taking the Commerce Clause and making it apply to everything. That's not new. If that's all that happens, then this isn't going to do much."" The statements are read into the Congressional Record after legislative staff figure out what should be in them. For the most part, they are short recitations of the Commerce Clause. It's Democrats, largely, who stick to the Commerce Clause for (largely doomed) legislation that would restore funding that Republicans want to cut. And Democrats act most interested in the rule when Republicans seem to be breaking it. When Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., filed a statement calling the Affordable Care Act ""unconstitutional"" without citing a specific part of the Constitution, Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., tore into him and told him to ""follow the rules."" But Pitts' bill got a vote anyway. On March 15, the day Lamborn introduced his NPR defunding bill, there were 34 other pieces of legislation. All but six of them cited Article I, Section 8, most of them pointing to Clause 3, the Commerce Clause. Only occasionally does someone go the extra mile. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., did that after introducing a bill that would have expedited visas for two noncitizens. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, did it, sort of, after introducing his annual bill to create a U.S. Department of Peace:""Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant to the following: The preamble to the Constitution has the following injunction: '... to promote domestic tranquility.' This is the purpose of the bill."" Rarely, a legislator uses his statement to lecture the hall about the wisdom of the founders. Right before Congress recessed last week, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., a freshman who won with the backing of the Tea Party, introduced the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2011.  He submitted, for the Congressional Record, a statement citing the authority of Article I, Section 8, Clause 3, but continued with eight paragraphs of history and precedent, from the 19th century to the 21st, from United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association (1944) to the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. * Gosar is a dentist by training, but when he introduced his bill, he did it with the gravity of a judge in the final scenes of a Grisham airport novel. ""The interstate Commerce Clause does not, as some have suggested, contain federal powers that are unlimited,"" Gosar said. ""Indeed, the original application of this clause was quite narrow, as most aptly described in Federalist No. 42. In that tract, James Madison explains that the purpose undergirding the regulation of commerce among the States was to prevent each state from imposing taxes, duties or tariffs on goods from another state that would in effect limit trade among the states and create animus that 'would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquility.' We follow here today, however, an accepted and long standing interpretation of the Commerce Clause that is not broad in that it regulates actual commerce involved between or transacted across state lines."" The very next piece of legislation introduced that day was the Emergency Mortgage Relief and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs Cost Recoupment Act of 2011, from Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. He was more concise. ""Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant to the following: Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (the Commerce Clause)."" Over and out. Correction,  March 25, 2011: This article originally referred to the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1990. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Constitutional Authority Statements: Are Republicans honoring their campaign promise?
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/weak_tea.html	"Over the last couple of days, since the United States joined in establishing a United Nations no-fly zone over northern Libya, Mark Williams has been yelling at Fox News and agreeing with liberals. Why are we there? Why was the intervention kicked off by a U.N. vote and not a vote in Congress? ""Dennis Kucinich and I find ourselves in the rare position of being joined at the hip,"" says Williams. ""What the hell is the endgame in Libya? Is it to take Qaddafi out or not? There's a vast gulf of difference between aiding to help an ally recover from a catastrophe, like Japan, and jumping in here to subsidize European security and the security of despotic tribesmen."" These musings about war, peace, and presidential power are coming from a man whom liberals associate with the worst of the Tea Party. As the spokesman for the Tea Party Express in 2009 and 2010, he called President Obama an ""Indonesian Muslim turned welfare thug"" and a bunch of other things. He left the Express after a satirical email to the NAACP offended basically everyone. He's now a radio host and author who wonders what, exactly, is the point of a movement focused on the Constitution if it lets the president get away with launching military strikes without asking Congress for permission. ""We've got the Constitution of this country being absolutely ravaged,"" he says. ""There is no governing authority except for the people of the United States or, if it grows a set of testicles, the U.S. Congress. And it would take all the radiation coming out of Fukushima to make the members of Congress grow anything."" In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution. It was supposed to require presidents to explain themselves to Congress within 48 hours of launching military actions and ask for some official declaration of hostility within 58 days after that. And so, on Monday, Obama issued a presidential message to Congress explaining why he'd joined an ""international effort"" and ""began a series of strikes against air defense systems and military airfields for the purposes of preparing a no-fly zone."" This was the 119th message of its kind since the passage of the War Powers Resolution. It was the first since the rise of the Tea Party, the conservative movement that defines everything it does as a way to keep faith with the Constitution. So the relative lack of Tea Party angst over the no-fly zone has been surprising. There is no discussion of Libya happening at Ginni Thomas' Liberty Central, no statement from Tea Party Patriots or the Tea Party Express. Quite a few liberal Democrats have come out and criticized the president. There were more Democrats who criticized President George W. Bush during the run-up to Iraq, but there have been enough to generate real heat for the White House. It was Kucinich, rather than a Republican, who first floated the idea that the strikes on Libya might be grounds for impeachment; Newt Gingrich, who mused that Obama could be impeached for failing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, hasn't gone that far. Half a dozen Republicans who identify with the Tea Party have criticized the Obama administration's shoot-first-ask-Congress-later approach, but most Republicans haven't. ""This is a hot debate, the debate over war powers,"" says Sal Russo, the consultant behind the Tea Party Express. ""One of the big components of the Tea Party is the activists who want federal government to get back to a narrow reading of what government can do. That's in keeping with the overall idea that our founders created a limited government."" But the question isn't quite settled. Historians can point to the arguments that James Madison made about war powers, or the uses Thomas Jefferson made of those powers in the presidency, and come to at least two conclusions. One: The founders saw a proper role for unilateral executive military decisions in some limited cases, and presidents don't always need to get declarations of war. (There  hasn't been an official declaration of war in the United States since 1942. *) Two: The founders may have said that, but until the Cold War era, Congress did take a role in these interventions, and presidents deferred. For now the second argument is winning out with most Tea Party activists, largely because they've got their eyes trained elsewhere. ""We can't fight every battle at the same time,"" says Russo. ""We've chosen to focus on getting America's fiscal house in order."" There could be more Tea Party criticism of the Libya strategy if the conflict drags on. On Monday, Jenny Beth Martin of Tea Party Patriots told me that the group may poll members to determine whether they should take a stance. If CNN's poll on Libya is right, TPP might find itself taking the pro-Obama, anti-Ron Paul line on Libya. The poll, conducted from March 18 to March 20, found 70 percent of all voters favoring a no-fly zone. Among ""Tea Party supporters,"" it was 73 percent. Fifty-four percent of all voters favored attacks ""directly targeted at Gaddafi's troops who are fighting the opposition forces in Libya."" That number rose to 58 percent among Tea Partiers. There are individual Tea Party leaders, like Williams or Rand Paul, who wince at a military intervention undertaken like this. The Tea Party is libertarian in plenty of ways. But if it has one defining characteristic, it's that it's nationalist. If there's a way to remove Qaddafi decades after he aided the Lockerbie bombers, then that's more important than a debate over the deep thoughts of the founders. In a Saturday interview with Fox News, Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., one of the most popular politicians to win the support of the Tea Party, explained that his problem with the intervention was about grit, not the Constitution. ""Back two or three weeks ago,"" said West, ""we could have taken care of this situation if we had done the exact same thing that Ronald Reagan did back in the early '80s to Muammar Gaddafi, when he dropped the bomb in his back yard. Muammar Gaddafi didn't say a word for the next 30 years."" Qaddafi has actually remained influential and powerful since the bombing West referred to. But that's almost beside the point. The Republicans who are more worried about Libya than the Constitution's strictures on war powers are speaking for most of the Tea Party. On Monday, Rep. Jason Chaffetz was in Utah, doing multiple interviews about his stance: that the president should have come to Congress. One of the people he spoke to was David Kirkham, a founding Tea Party activist in Utah. He disagreed with Chaffetz. ""I think his concern was money, among other things,"" said Kirkham. ""There are some good things you have to spend money on. If we're the leaders of the free world, we cannot stand by when a tyrant kills his own civilians. Constitutionally speaking, Congress has the power to declare wars, but I don't think the founding fathers intended us to never intervene.""

Obama's Libya strategy: Why the Tea Party doesn't oppose it.
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/you_cant_be_serious.html	"It's hard to take anyone seriously in politics these days. It's not that the politicians have gotten sillier--though an outbreak is always possible; it's that they talk about being serious so much, the word has lost all meaning. Washington is obsessed with measuring seriousness. President Obama's televised discussion of his NCAA bracket proved he isn't a serious leader. House conservatives said GOP leaders weren't serious enough about cutting the deficit. Senate Republicans leveled that charge against their Democratic counterparts. This call for seriousness is often itself not a serious charge. What most of the criticisms actually mean is ""My opponent doesn't believe something I'd like him to."" The outbreak of such talk comes at just the moment that more precise language would be helpful. The debate over short- and long-term budget deficits is about priorities. You can't start that debate, or work through it effectively, if the words used to convey the relative importance of things are all gummed up. Since Washington is dominated by politics, which is frivolous, the call to ""get serious"" is practically a tradition. ""Getting Serious About [Insert Issue Here]"" is the implicit subtitle of every think-tank paper and symposium. Politicians regularly overinflate the seriousness of things. In Washington everyone is talking, so the only way you can get people to listen is if you frighten them. When things are really serious, no one has to talk about it. After 9/11, there were no calls to put away the party hats. The debate over the budget, by contrast, has been dominated by talk about the need for serious talk, as opposed to much serious talk itself. The president is accused of not being serious about the budget deficit from both the left and the right. Much of it is a critique of his public posture. His aides are working behind the scenes, but both Democrats and Republicans in Congress would prefer that Obama take a public role. Serious members of Congress have the power to proceed on their own but they would like Obama to share some of the political risk of presenting voters with the inevitable hard choices. Some 64 senators from both parties--enough to end a filibuster and almost enough to override a veto, both of which actions would qualify as serious--recently sent the president a letter asking him to support and offer leadership on the deficit and debt. The letter immediately won praise from think tanks. Now all it needs is an editorial endorsement and it will have achieved a trifecta of seriousness. Meanwhile, Tea Party conservatives in Congress claimed the seriousness mantle this week when 54 of them bucked their leadership by voting against a three-week measure to continue funding the government because it didn't cut enough. The size of spending cuts has become the ultimate sign of seriousness among some conservatives. But just as lack of public action tells you nothing about how serious a politician is, neither do flamboyant displays or claims of seriousness. As House leaders tried to explain to their rank-and-file, unrealistic demands about spending reductions will lead to a government shutdown, which will imperil future efforts to achieve any of the bigger reductions they want. All of this discussion about seriousness, of course, prompts the question of what being serious means in Washington. This I am not qualified to answer. But for the purposes of the debate about the budget, I suggest that the test of seriousness is whether you are fixated on the health care costs that are driving the long-term deficit. That's the test that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan uses. He worries that the focus of Tea Party activists and many House freshmen on immediate spending reductions obscures that test. ""They literally think you can just balance"" the budget by cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse, foreign, aid and NPR,"" he said in an interview last week with the Associated Press. ""And it doesn't work like that."" Ryan is about to take a huge gamble on seriousness. GOP leaders have claimed since the election that the American public put their party in power because people were serious about reducing the budget deficit. Ryan has said his coming budget will include an effort to reform entitlements. That has been considered dangerous in the past because while voters have said they want to reduce the deficit, they don't actually want to see reductions in entitlements. Nearly every poll taken in the last several months confirms this. Never mind, says Congressman Tom Graves of Georgia, a new Republican member. """"We have to be emotionless about the various cuts that are out there,"" he told me. ""We cannot be married to one program or another. Instead, we have to step back and know that this is for the great good of America."" That might sound a little chilly to all but the most serious voters. House Republicans aren't the only ones gambling that the public is serious. Seriousness is also a fixation on the campaign trail. In discussions with advisers or supporters of three prominent campaigns, each has invoked the seriousness of the American people in exactly the same way. Newt Gingrich will be able to overcome his corrugated marital history because voters are so somber. Republican voters will overlook the similarities between the health care plan Mitt Romney promoted as Massachusetts governor and the one Obama pushed because they are so serious about the economy, an issue on which Romney claims special expertise. Haley Barbour may be a former lobbyist with a thick Southern accent, but voters won't care because, as an influential Republican lawmaker explained to me recently, ""voters are in a serious mood."" They may well be. But when politicians invoke seriousness like this, they are using it as a diversion. When a candidate has no easy way to overcome an obstacle to his campaign, he will seek to diminish it by pointing to something else. This is a time-honored technique, though its most notable recent use has been by Democratic presidential candidates in 2000 and 2004. Both Al Gore's and John Kerry's campaigns argued that Americans would overlook their shortcomings because they wanted a ""serious"" candidate. This theory also requires that people see President Obama as unserious. Cool, detached, and cerebral, maybe. But one ill-timed televised discussion of his NCAA bracket isn't likely to make voters take seriously the idea that he's not, well, serious. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/the_recall_state.html	"If your taste in politics tends toward the partisan and the absurd, there may be no better place for you in America right now than Wisconsin. There is no state with more acrimony or more members of opposite parties staring daggers at each other. After Republicans passed Gov. Scott Walker's Budget Repair Bill without any Democrats present, Wisconsin Democrats turned their party into a 24/7 machine armed to recall as many Republican senators as they can. Wisconsin Republicans, meanwhile, are aiding ad hoc groups of Tea Party activists who are trying to pull the same thing on Democrats. There are 16 senators, of both parties, who are vulnerable to recalls, and 20 official committees distributing recall petitions. If any of the petitions are valid, there will be general elections in those districts, incumbents defending against new challengers. If any of the efforts succeed, there will probably be elections in June. All this recall and response can be traced to Feb. 18, when Ian Millhiser of ThinkProgess put up an explanatory blog post titled ""Eight GOP State Senators in Wisconsin Can Be Recalled Right Now; Gov. Walker Can Be Recalled in January."" Any legal voter who had lived in a senator's district for 10 days or more could declare his intent to pursue a recall of any legislator who had served for at least one year. News of this spread very quickly, in Wisconsin and elsewhere. The first people to take advantage of the recall law were Republicans, and they weren't technically from Wisconsin. The American Patriot Recall Coalition, also known as the American Recall Coalition, filed recall petitions on Feb. 23 and Feb. 24 against eight of the 14 Senate Democrats who had high-tailed it out of the state to prevent the state Senate from voting on the budget bill. This made national news, and not for good reasons. The Onion ran an ""American Voices"" item cracking wise on the idea of Utahans meddling with Wisconsin. (""Following their example, my fellow Pennsylvanians and I have filed paperwork to compel Moammar Qaddafi to step down in Libya."") That was irritating for Dan Baltes, the executive director of the group. ""I'm from La Crosse!"" he said on Tuesday, over the phone. ""I'm not as removed from the situation as people might want to believe. As long as we're talking about that, why don't we talk about the influence in Wisconsin right now from Organizing for America, from the AFL-CIO, and from the Communist Parties and Socialist Parties out of Chicago. This out-of-state thing is a red herring."" The American Patriot Recall Coalition was trying to give some focus to local activists who didn't know how to pull this off. (Baltes' most recent experience with the recall is his campaign to remove Tucson's Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, who criticized the tone of Republican politicians in the wake of a January shooting spree at an event hosted by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.) There are local Tea Party activists. According to Baltes, there are at least 12 of them in every targeted district and up to 50 of them in key districts. They have to get as few as 11,817 signatures and as many as 20,352 to force recalls. ""We're right at the 50 percent mark in all of the districts we're targeting,"" Bartes said. That's exactly what Democrats are saying about their own campaign. On Tuesday, spokesman Graeme Zielinski confirmed what he'd told the Washington Post this week--that Democratic volunteers have exceeded 45 percent of the signatures they need across all districts and exceeded 50 percent of the signatures they need to go after three districts in particular. Zielinski wouldn't confirm it, but it's suspected that these are the districts where polls give Democrats the lead in potential recalls--Randy Hopper, Dan Kapanke, and Luther Olsen. ""These big, bad Tea Party groups?"" says Zielinski. ""We're lapping them. We're absolutely lapping them."" The Democrats didn't rush to file recall petitions. They built a campaign tactically and centrally. They started about a week later than the Republicans did and bought a Web site, RecalltheRepublican8.com. They staged recall campaigns from Democratic offices. Call, say, the campaign to recall Hopper, and you are put in touch with the Democratic Party's statewide office. The Democrats claim to have more people on the job and say they surged with volunteers after the Senate pushed through the budget repair bill without the Democrats in the room. They report $1 million raised since the fight started. Democratic and union activists also provided this story with one of its more surreal moments: On Saturday, they swarmed outside the Fond du Lac home they believed was the residence of Hopper. A woman emerged from the house and told them two things. One: Hopper didn't live there. Two: She was his wife, Alysia; her husband, who filed for divorce last August, lived somewhere else with a mistress. After this incident--and responding to inquiries from an intrigued Wisconsin press corps--Alysia Hopper released more evidence that her estranged husband didn't live in his old house. So far, at least, Republicans have not engaged in any home visits. In fact, unlike the state Democratic Party, state Republicans aren't even raising money for the recall efforts. ""We're assisting them,"" said Mark Jefferson, executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party. ""They're largely Tea Party groups and conservative organizations, and we think they're at a little bit of a structural disadvantage compared to the unions."" The party is also ""logging incidents"" in which its members are ""meeting resistance from union types who are crashing their rallies and not letting people sign their petitions,"" he said. This can be busy work. On Tuesday the Recall Jim Holperin Committee, a group dedicated to ousting that Democratic senator, reported that protesters in the town of Merrill, Wis., had crashed their rally and ripped up petitions. ""The policemen who were there,"" said organizers, ""and who were standing in close proximity to these events as they unfolded, did nothing to assist those collecting the petitions as they were being destroyed."" Things are slightly calmer 160 miles to the south in Madison. It took till Wednesday, but Republicans agreed to forgive Democrats for their flight and not enforce a contempt order that barred them from voting. Democrats went back to work. But they also kept their eyes trained on the goal that one of them, Sen. Chris Larson, mused about in a tweet: ""Have you chipped in to help the recall of Republican senators yet?"" he asked."	Wisconsin politics: Is there any state with more partisanship or acrimony?
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/full_steam_ahead.html	"Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., represents Madison in the House. Her district leans to the left, and so does she. But on at least one issue she may be at odds with Madison's stereotypical constituency, which is to say aging bearded liberals who wear ""No Nukes"" T-shirts from the 1980s and until recently could be seen all over the State Capitol: She supports the building of new nuclear power plants. ""I think that climate change poses such a significant challenge to us that we have to have all the tools on the table, and this is a very significant source of energy that doesn't release greenhouse gases into the environment,"" said Baldwin. She laughed. ""It's a very cautious support, if you will."" In Japan, there is a race against time to stop meltdowns at reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. In Washington, no one wants to overreact. There is near unanimity on the idea that the United States needs to keep building those plants, as President Obama requested in his budget and as Republicans request every day. ""If we can learn any lessons from Japan's experience, sure,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor at a press briefing. (He was answering the only question, of about 20, about Japan.) ""But I believe nuclear power is part of this country's energy strategy and the president has said so."" This morning, when William Saletan sounded the alarm against ""nuclear overreactors"" who would use the Japanese crisis to stop new nuclear power, he was arguing with fewer people than it might have seemed. Greenpeace responded by ""calling for the phase out of existing reactors around the world."" The Sierra Club drew attention to American reactors that operated with the same design as Japan's. And ... well, presumably there were some others. But the politicians cited as opponents of new nuclear plants were proposing a whole lot less than that. Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., an environmentalist Democrat who was widely quoted calling for a ""time out"" on new reactors, explained what he meant in a Monday CNN interview. ""I think we can build nuclear power plants potentially but only if safety features are built in mitigating against the disasters,"" said Markey. The reason to move to greener technology, he says, was really that those technologies don't put as much at risk if a disaster breaks them down. Plus, it wasn't him suggesting that the reactors needed a second look. ""Wall Street is what did in the nuclear industry after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl,"" he said. ""It is Wall Street again today that is going to believe that nuclear power has become an increasingly risky financial investment."" On Monday, Baldwin explained that her old opposition to nuclear power was sparked by the May 1979 disaster at Three Mile Island, when a reactor partially failed and leaked radioactive gases into an area close to Harrisburg, Pa. ""I was opposed predominantly because of the United States' inability to figure out the spent fuel questions,"" said Baldwin on Monday, ""and the concern after Three Mile Island that the safety checks and balances were not adequate at that point in time."" But Americans were less panicked about Three Mile Island than most people remember. A few weeks after the disaster, the Washington Post conducted a national poll on new opinions of nuclear power and compared them to a 1976 Gallup Poll. In 1976, 34 percent of Americans had said it was ""very important"" to build more power plants, and 37 percent said it was ""somewhat important."" In the 1979 poll, conducted after weeks of news about the nuclear danger, 29 percent of people went with ""very important,"" and 36 went with ""somewhat."" Thirteen million curies of radioactive gas had driven the polling numbers down by only six points. There would be more polls conducted in 1979 and 1980. They would find that Americans worried more about living near nuclear power plants than about the plants' existence, and more worried about America succumbing to an energy crisis than America running on uranium. Those numbers have moved back and forth in 30-odd years, but support for new nuclear reactors has generally gotten higher. It's stayed high as the pro-nuke ranks were swelled by liberals, who, like Baldwin, are more worried about climate change than about the risk of freak accidents. On Monday, Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones noticed that Obama had praised Japan, specifically, for the ""safe and effective way"" it uses nuclear power. It's ironic, but it's not surprising--the battle over nuclear power, at this point, is really only about where waste is stored and how it's regulated. On Monday, the absolute lack of debate about this got played out by a classic Capitol Hill tradition: Rep. Henry Waxman calling for an investigation. At the House energy and commerce committee's mark-up hearing (it was forwarding bills on net neutrality and the EPA on to the House), Democratic staff passed out a letter Waxman had sent Republicans demanding hearings on nuclear safety. ""The nuclear industry has ... asserted that it is far better prepared to respond to a nuclear accident than the oil industry was in responding to the blowout of BP's Macondo well,"" Waxman wrote, irony dripping off the page. Rep. Fred Upton, the committee's new chairman--and a Republican who makes war daily with Democrats on energy issues--wrapped up the hearing quickly and started to walk out.

Both places are cliquey. Both are gossipy. Both have resume-polishing egotists, humorless grinds, appalling bullies, and slackers. And, of course, there's nothing like the occasional sex scandal to get everyone excited. In high school, finding a best friend was crucial. This was the person who would still like you even if you puked in the middle of Spanish class or kicked the soccer ball into the wrong goal during gym. The same thing is true in politics. A surprising number of politicians buddy up when they get to Washington. The latest couple in American politics are House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. There were rumors of conflict between the two top Republicans last summer, but now that they rule Congress, they're practically inseparable: Cantor is wingman at Boehner's press conferences and sidekick in his photo ops.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/national_private_radio.html	"""We can't afford it and they don't need it,""said Sen. Jim DeMint Wednesday, referring to the $422 million the Corporation for Public Broadcasting gets from the federal government. ""We're facing a $1.5 trillion deficit and spending hundreds of millions on public broadcasting makes no sense today when they are raising millions from private donors and Americans already have thousands of media choices."" This is the good argument for slashing the CPB's funding. The lousy argument is that cutting the funding would save NPR, at long last, from its wretched existence as a Republican punching bag. BREAKING, as they say in the news business: NPR is always going to be a Republican punching bag. The main claim is its liberal bias, not its funding source. NPR is eternally apologizing for its liberal image, and it does so because it gets government funding. But would that change if the source of NPR's funding changed? No matter how NPR survives (and it's going to, even if DeMint takes power in a coup tomorrow), it will owe some donor something. Its donors will be subject to public pressure. There will be critics who will attempt--and succeed--to discredit what it reports because of who funds it. How do I know this? I've worked for nonprofit media and for-profit media since 2004. From 2006 to 2008 I worked at Reason, operated by the non-profit Reason Foundation. From 2009 through early 2010 I worked at the now-defunct Washington Independent, operated by the nonprofit Center for Independent Media. They didn't take money from taxpayers. They just used the generous provisions of nonprofit status to get exemption from the corporate income tax, and they got donations that were brought up as shibboleths by anyone irritated by the content. CIM got a grant from George Soros's Open Society Institute, to fund immigration reporting--the organization and its member sites are constantly labeled ""Soros-funded."" The billionaire industrialist David Koch is on the board of trustees of Reason, so that was used by hardcore libertarians (through 2008 or so) and liberals (starting in 2010) to discredit everything it published. I'm harping on the nonprofit side of this because that's the model NPR and the CPB are likely to stick with even if they lose federal funds. If the argument for cutting federal funds is that nonlisteners and people who don't support their reporting shouldn't have to buy in, there's a problem: Even if they no longer get federal subsidies, they still benefit from some federal tax exemptions. Some of their reporting will come with strings attached by donors who want to endow certain projects. That's true with a lot of funding to nonprofits that do journalism. It's attackable. But all journalism is attackable for bias. For-profit journalism--where I've worked since 2010-- is not immune, either. The O'Reilly Factor frequently criticizes NBC Universal (disclosure: I'm a contributor to MSNBC), pointing out GE's ownership stake in the network and casting aspersions on how this affects programming and coverage. On Tuesday, O'Reilly riffed about all the advantages Barack Obama had during the 2008 campaign, when GE owned NBC Universal outright. (Comcast bought 51 percent of NBC Universal in January.) ""NBC News actively promoted his candidacy,"" O'Reilly said, ""and so did the parent company General Electric."" Why should a taxpayer care about a private company owning a media company? The O'Reilly argument is that GE can benefit from government action, so any journalism it pays for should be scrutinized for bias. When GE's Jeffrey Immelt was named chairman of the president's council on competitiveness in January, O'Reilly called it ""a straight flat out quid pro quo."" This is the kind of criticism NPR can look forward to if it loses federal funding and instead relies on private donors. Scrambling for donors could be a good thing. As Michael Barone pointed out, the National Trust for Historic Preservation faced a similar death threat in 1995 and negotiated for a three-year draw-down of federal funds. That gave the trust time to build a new fundraising operation among donors who knew the organization could die without them. There will never be a time, however, when NPR will escape criticism for what it covers and who funds it. Talking about the NPR scandal on CNN last night, Andrew Breitbart mused about the beauty of journalism in Great Britain, where people choose their news sources based on biases. ""I think we're ending this era of false objectivity in this country,"" he said. If so, then maybe NPR can finally catch a break."	NPR controversy: Even if NPR loses its federal funding, conservatives will still attack it for bias.
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/passionately_patriotic.html	"In a wide-ranging C-SPAN interview in September 2010, Newt Gingrich reflected on the crazy nature of running for president. Small moments or candid photographs can upend a campaign, he noted, mentioning Jimmy Carter's bout with a ""killer rabbit,"" which came to symbolize his floundering re-election efforts. As a candidate, you cannot ""control all of the events"" of your campaign, he said. ""Sooner or later"" you will ""get into some kind of roller coaster and you just have to figure out if you can survive."" Gingrich has opted to get into his roller coaster immediately. He announced he might be running for office less than a week ago, and already he's zooming down the tracks, cheeks flapping in the breeze. In an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, he suggested that his love of country contributed to his marital infidelity. ""There's no question at times of my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked far too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate,"" said Gingrich. ""And what I can tell you is that when I did things that were wrong, I wasn't trapped in situation ethics, I was doing things that were wrong, and yet, I was doing them."" Imagine for a moment that this was an electromagnetic pulse for comedians. The voltage surge of possible jokes was so strong that they were temporarily struck dumb. In that interregnum, don't focus on the copulation but the causation. Some might think that the former speaker is trying to excuse his actions. Maybe so, though he goes on to say his passion is no excuse at all. But if he is trying to explain his behavior, the explanation isn't that reassuring. Gingrich is saying that he couldn't handle the pressure. This is known as being human. It's also a weakness that presidential candidates never admit. Entire campaigns are built around the question of whether you are tough enough to handle that 3 a.m. phone call (when it's the NSC, not from your mistress). After John Edwards' son died, he was so distraught he could barely function. This is a natural reaction for which no one could fault him. Yet, when he ran for president in 2004, he and his wife were careful not to highlight this fact, for fear that it would make him look like he couldn't handle the pressure of the office. (Clearly Edwards also needed outlets for public pressure.) In his admission, Gingrich reveals yet another similarity with his former rival Bill Clinton. During a series of secret interviews with author Taylor Branch, Clinton said his affair with Monica Lewinsky began because he ""cracked"" from personal and political pressure. (Since Gingrich and Clinton were putting this pressure on each other, maybe a lot of the political drama of the mid-1990s could have been solved by group therapy.) As a political matter, it's probably better to just cop to pure lust. That can be extinguished or not. Linking it to the stress of the job--while applying for an even more stressful job--suggests the possibility of more roller-coaster rides. How will this play out politically? The conventional wisdom is that all talk of private moral failings hurts in Iowa, where 60 percent of Republican caucus attendees in 2008 declared themselves born again or evangelical. Gingrich's private behavior does come up in conversation with social conservative activists, though the theology of it should be more complicated. Gingrich, a Catholic convert, believes in a forgiving God. So do these voters. Moreover, they believe in the transformational power of Christ's love. Gingrich is a fellow believer and so, presumably, has been delivered from his previous inclinations by the power of that love. The toughest audience, though, will be the comedians. Democratic and ruthless by nature, they're not likely to go easy on a political figure who is often ruthless with his opponents. It's not that comedians are all-powerful, but quips get repeated and passed around. It keeps this liability in the chatter. It's tough to run a campaign as the constant butt of jokes, and Gingrich's comment is sure to spawn hundreds: If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen--and repair to the bedroom. Gingrich says the Democrats are destroying marriage. So I guess he's running in their primary. I regret that I have but one wife to give to my country. And I'm not even a professional comedian, in case you didn't notice. In that same C-SPAN interview, Gingrich looked back on his rise and fall in the House of Representatives and said one of his weaknesses had been his communications strategy. ""I didn't learn how to be careful with my words, didn't learn how to be cautious about what we were trying to get done in ways that were self-destructive."" That's a lesson he's still learning.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/still_no_shutdown.html	"The battle over the first continuing resolution to keep the government operating didn't end with as much drama as some reviewers would have liked. Like most sequels, CR2 is likely to be even less dramatic. This time, Congress and the White House are facing a March 18 deadline, but all signals point to an agreement before then that will keep things running for two or three more weeks. The big question is where the flag will come to rest in the tug of war between Democrats and Republicans over how much to cut in the remaining six months of fiscal year 2010. Republican House leaders have proposed $57 billion in additional cuts. The White House has proposed $6.5 billion. In the end, there will have to be a compromise. In mathematical terms, it will look like this: Democrats will accept  6.5 + X in cuts. Republicans will accept 57 - Y. Both sides have said they don't want a shutdown, and no one is saying it's all or nothing. Finding X and Y is taking some time. The Senate has yet to vote on the proposals favored by the House GOP and White House. (Those votes are now scheduled for Wednesday.) The body will vote down both proposals, because there aren't 60 Democrats and Republicans for either route, so then the deal-making for the Goldilocks route can continue. But there are only 10 more days until the government has to shut down. That's not enough time. So the White House would like to agree now to an extension after March 18. Coming to an agreement now, rather than pushing right against the deadline like last week,  gives negotiators more time to work on the underlying issues. Also, it means President Obama can take his trip to Brazil on March 18 without looking like he's skipping town while a shutdown looms. (Remember all those trips he had to cancel during ""turning points"" in the health care fights?) At a breakfast with reporters this morning sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy said Republicans were preparing a new funding mechanism that would keep operations open for two to three more weeks with cuts of about $2 billion per week. At three weeks, that nicely matches the $6.5 billion the White House has already suggested cutting (though John Boehner says this figure is inflated). A House leadership aide says they'd rather the money come out of earmark slush funds and some other cuts already proposed in the budget Obama proposed. Wherever the money comes from, the White House is not going to put up a big fight. The dance steps seem pretty clear--everyone just has to go through them. But when this dance is over, say administration sources, that's it. The next debate will be more contentious. The president recognizes that these mini-funding mechanisms simply allow Republicans to get what they want in installments. If they continue, nearly $60 billion will be cut, and a big stretch of time will have been wasted. So does this mean the president will come on stage to join the fight? He's already been on stage, say White House aides, it's just not the stage the pundits are watching. Obama traveled to Boston today to promote his plans for education to make America more competitive. That's what the White House wants the budget fight to be about: big economic priorities and the themes Obama outlined in his State of the Union address. ""A budget that sacrifices our commitment to education is a budget that sacrifices our country's future,"" said Obama. ""It is a budget that sacrifices our children's future, and I will not let it happen. I will not let it happen."" House Republicans would like the president to be more specific about the resolutions they're debating this instant. ""Where is the president's proposal?"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, recounting a conversation he had with the White House Chief of Staff William Daley. Right now the public budget fight is about smaller things: continuing resolutions, funding levels for Planned Parenthood and public broadcasting, and so on. Important, perhaps--but also not the kind of fights the president can afford to wage if he's to have any stature left for the big fights he wants to have. A full Hollywood version of the Budget Battle is coming. The stars are attached to the script. We're just going to have to wait a little while longer for it to go into production.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/not_so_candid_camera.html	"When I was in Wisconsin covering the protests of a budget bill that would slash union rights and powers, I stopped by a free ""Non-Violence Training Session"" that had been advertised on posters at the Capitol. The sessions had been going on for days, and were put on, for the most part, by activists from the Grassroots Leadership College in Madison. The lesson was brief. I was actually the only person to show up on time, at 8 p.m. So I got my own rundown of the tips hundreds had received before me and hundreds have since. They started with a couple of questions. ""Why would you protest nonviolently?"" asked my trainer. I speculated that you might care for your fellow man. Or you might figure that protesting violently would tar your comrades by associations. ""That's right,"" she said. On Friday, the three-week protest in Madison moved into a new phase, with activists peacefully leaving the Capitol, where they'd been sleeping, and planning more daily and weekend rallies. They got loud, and they shouted down legislators and Fox News, and they were photographed with signs comparing Scott Walker to Hitler. But they didn't get violent. There was a lot riding on that. The Wisconsin showdown has, mostly, avoided becoming another skirmish in a tedious culture war--the battle between liberals and conservatives, both armed with cameras, to prove that the other side is hopelessly crude, violent, vile, Nazi-obsessed, and responsible for America losing its way. Oh, it could have become that. On Thursday, Politico's Ken Vogel ticked off the many videos produced by Wisconsin Republicans and conservative activists who looked for video gold at the solidarity rallies held around the country. In Boston, Washington, and Atlanta, unidentified men shoved Tea Party activists who'd showed up to counterprotest union rallies. (The videographer in Atlanta responded to this with Hollywood timing: ""Hey! He assaulted him! Right there! I want to file charges on that man!"") In Wisconsin, videographers had to settle for video of impolite signs: ""Walker Sucks Koch,"" ""Don't Retreat, Reload,"" Walker with the telltale Hitler mustache. The MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank, got a scoop when it captured doctors handing out sick notes to protesters who weren't sick. But it didn't film any violence. Christian Hartsock, a conservative videographer who'd filmed liberals at a California anti-Koch brothers rally and egged them on to describe the violent acts they wanted to commit on Justice Clarence Thomas, showed up in Madison to document the first big pro-union rally. He didn't see violence, either. ""I was impressed with many of the folks I met in the crowd,"" Hartsock told me. ""While there were plenty of exceptions, as we've seen, many of the protesters I met were truly decent, kind-eyed, regular people. There was not the same pervasive, knee-jerk, pathological hatred that I encountered in Palm Springs."" This wasn't all due to training from professional nonviolent types. Something like 80,000 liberal protesters came to Madison for the rally Hartsock covered. They weren't foul, but they were skeptical. And this is the pattern of protests-meeting-video cameras. At the first Tea Party protests, activists were happy to see media--any media--showing up to cover them. By the end of 2010, it was tough to talk to some protesters, because they'd gotten angry at mainstream reporting on the movement, and they'd heard, truthfully, that the NAACP and groups like New Left Media were showing up at rallies looking to score footage of people behaving with maximum levels of jackassery. It took only weeks for liberal, pro-union protesters to reach this level of outrage at the media. There has been no violence in Madison, but there has been video of angry people chanting and prodding Mike Tobin, a reporter for Fox News. ""These people hate,"" Tobin groused in one broadcast. In another report, when a man covered up Tobin's camera with a glove, Tobin stopped him: ""He's trying to shut down the communication!"" Here was proof of union violence! Except it wasn't. It was proof of plugged-in liberals, very aware of how the news cycle works, very aware of what kind of videos make it on Fox News, treating cameras as an enemy of solidarity. The reporters who showed up in Madison without Fox News stickers on their cameras got treated differently. University of Wisconsin law professor Ann Althouse and her husband have written and recorded video, respectively, of the protests and have come away more bemused by the circus than terrified by violence. ""Things have been really peaceful, by and large,"" wrote Althouse last week, ""to an amazing degree, considering the difficulty of keeping a large, diverse crowd energized enough to look like a good demonstration without tipping any individual over the edge into something ugly, even as the days wear on and on."" There's a reason for that. A lot of the Tea Party's success came after its key leaders reverse-engineered the tactics of Saul Alinsky, the community organizer and author of Rules of Radicals. The left had been using this stuff for years, and political operatives on the right had copied some of it (compare Donald Segretti's work with Alinsky's). But it wasn't really until 2009 that conservatives appreciated advice like ""Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it,"" or ""Ridicule is man's most important weapon."" Even the protesters outside Wisconsin have figured this out. FreedomWorks' Tabitha Hale, who was shoved by an unidentified Communication Workers of America protester as she filmed him outside the organization's Washington offices, recounted the scene at RedState.com. She had a new, key detail: ""The concern from a bystander was that 'You'll get on the news, stop it!' Unfortunately for him, he did not know who he was dealing with. I will ensure that this happens."" The shove did make the news, and the video of it is lurching toward 300,000 views on YouTube. It confirmed, for conservatives, that union thugs were fighting back over Wisconsin. Every reasonably solid video of a shove or insult made it to Breitbart.tv. They just haven't broken into the narrative about the protests the way that 2009 videos of rebellion at congressional town halls did, or even Hartsock's Palm Springs video did. (This week, some congressional Republicans called for an investigation of Common Cause because the group had organized the event where those activists embarrassed themselves on camera.) There hasn't been any dip in support for unions; there has been a dip in support for Scott Walker. The videographers have not given up. FreedomWorks activists are on the ground in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah ""this weekend through the next two weeks,"" according to the group. They want to supplement the FlipCam videos they've already been getting. They want documentary evidence of union anger out there so powerful that the media can't avoid it. But who doesn't know that he's venturing into the view of tiny cameras every time he attends a rally? Who trusts the media? Who wants to wind up as the face of Violence Breaking Out and wrecking his cause? The new age of protests is bringing on more self-consciousness and more detente."

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/biohazard.html	"Of all the candidates to dish theories about President Obama's roots, you'd think Mike Huckabee would be the most careful. As a former Baptist minister, he has had to endure all kinds of weird questions about how his religion controls him and his hidden motives. Just before the Iowa caucuses in 2008, for example, he was questioned about subliminal cross imagery in one of his advertisements, on the theory that he was trying to send secret signals to evangelical voters. (As it was an ad about Christmas, the Christian signals were hardly secret.) In a recent session with reporters, Huckabee said such questions--which treated him like some kind of oddity in part to excite the passions of viewers--were one of the reasons he could skip early debates without harming his potential candidacy. The inquiries are a bother, and they're not important to voters. Yet this week and in his new book, Huckabee has been offering his theories on how Obama's roots explain his foreign policy.  He got the facts wrong at first, saying Obama was raised in Kenya. * In correcting himself, however, he did not modify two theories he does believe: That Obama's Kenyan father and grandfather influenced his views about the British, and that Obama is not your standard American because he spent four years in Indonesia as a child. ""Most of us grew up going to Boy Scout meetings and, you know, our communities were filled with Rotary Clubs, not madrassas,"" Huckabee said. This is a dog whistle, by which I mean it gets all of us in the political press yapping. That term is more commonly used to explain a phrase or quote that has special meaning to a specific group--in this case, conservatives who are obsessed with Obama's otherness. Ugh, you're saying. Are we really going to have this debate every week until the election? Maybe. That was the plan of Hillary Clinton's chief strategist in 2008, and Republicans will look to feed off this energy, too. In a just world, using threads from Obama's biography to define him as un-American would itself be considered un-American. He can be criticized plenty on the merits of his presidency. The last two years have provided a flowing basket of opportunities, and the next two will provide even more. But this isn't a just world, and the instinct to ignore this dog whistle risks the chance the idea will float out there, unaddressed. So: David Weigel is right; Huckabee is not a birther. He doesn't think Obama was born anywhere other than Hawaii. He also defended Obama when conservatives tried to define Obama by his association with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, saying that he'd hate to be condemned by every word that was uttered in his presence. Still, what Huckabee believes based on his book and recent interviews is more sweeping than birtherism: Obama is actively anti-American, because he is ""molded out of a very different experience."" Huckabee is reaching back 40 years into Obama's biography to draw conclusions. Imagine if voters used that same intellectual dot-connector to draw conclusions about the beliefs Huckabee holds today and affirms each day in prayer and each Sunday at church. If a voter is supposed to believe that Obama is captive to the imagined ideas of a father he knew for only a month of his life, then, presumably, the same voter should believe that Huckabee can be equally captive to some imagined tenets of Christianity. Huckabee has taken several recent trips to Israel. Does he want people drawing direct lines between his foreign policy and every passage of the Book of Revelation? This applies to all GOP candidates who would seek to define Obama wholly by his foreign connections. Should Mitt Romney be judged by every rule and law of the Mormon Church? Is Newt Gingrich irrevocably driven by the same impulses that ended his two marriages? We are all the product of our life experiences. But any presidential candidate who doesn't want to be defined by the most attenuated interpretation of the influences contained in his biography should probably keep his theories about his opponents a little more closely tied to the here-and-now. Correction,  March 4, 2011:The article originally and incorrectly said that Huckabee stated that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. That is not what Huckabee said. He said Obama was raised there. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Mike Huckabee on Obama's roots: What was he thinking?
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/nice_or_newt.html	"Do you have to be likable to be president? Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign will test this question more than any viable candidate since Richard Nixon. For months, the former House speaker has said he would announce his presidential decision in early March. Several news outlets are reporting that he'll form an exploratory committee this week. Anyone who saw him speak to the Conservative Political Action Conference three weeks ago would not be surprised: He was clearly mounting some kind of campaign. He entered not from the wings, where senators and House members had shuffled to the stage, but instead emerged from a side door on the second floor of the vast ballroom. As he descended the stairs, ""Eye of the Tiger"" blasted from the speakers. Avoiding the direct route to the stage, he waded through the crowd, which greeted him with cries of ""Caesar! Caesar!"" OK, that last part I made up. But given the theatrical entrance, anything seemed possible. The crowd of committed conservatives was happy to see him. At a time when Republican activists are looking for leaders who will stick to their policy principles under pressure, there is no conservative candidate--announced or in GOP fantasies--who can match Newt Gingrich's record. In his push to balance the budget he risked, and achieved, two government shutdowns. Before that, he fought a decades-long struggle to build a majority party based on core conservative principles. As Gingrich reminds us: ""I helped create the modern Republican Party."" Those battles took a toll on his popularity. As freshman GOP congressman Todd Rokita put it in the New York Times, Gingrich's approach was ""sticking fingers in people's eyes."" His disapproval rating approached 70 percent during the fights of the mid-'90s. When he announced in November 1998 that he was stepping down, 70 percent approved of his decision, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll. Approval ratings aren't everything, but to Gingrich they are important: He cited Obama's low approval rating of 51 percent as proof of just how flawed his presidency is. Still, unpopularity in a just cause will be a badge of honor for Gingrich in the GOP primaries. But how will he manage in a general election where independent and moderate voters will require courtship? Maybe he'll figure that out once he's wrapped up the nomination. Or maybe primary voters will want to know if he's viable in a general election, just as they wanted to know that about Hillary Clinton, who was also highly unpopular. The good news for Gingrich is that his image has improved since he left Congress. A Gallup poll in July of last year had his unfavorability rating at 38 percent, tied with his favorability rating. That's not great, but still better than Sarah Palin's unfavorability rating, which is 53 percent, and Hillary Clinton's, which was at 52 in the spring of 2007. Unlike Clinton or Palin, there is no clear path to softening the Gingrich image. Clinton's ""listening tour"" during her Senate campaign helped change her image. Palin's folksy approachability on display in her television show has not improved her standing in the polls, but at least it's a strategy that can be deployed. Gingrich is aggressive, caustic, but unlike GOP candidates Rudy Giuliani and Bob Dole who also shared those traits, he does not display their easy laugh and talent for self-deprecation. Even when speaking to sympathetic audiences, his remarks come across punctuated by a metaphorical finger to the chest. He'll face questions that make it hard to be sunny as a candidate. He will be asked about his House reprimand and $300,000 fine for ethical violations, as well as the infidelities that ended his first two marriages. ""No woman can understand what he did to his wives,"" says a top adviser to one of his challengers, who is also careful to remind me that suburban wives are a key swing voting bloc. Gingrich, who has argued that the Kenyan roots of President Obama's father are crucial to understanding his presidency, can't credibly claim that questions about his biography are unimportant. When asked last week by a Democratic campus activist about his marriages, Gingrich responded by saying he believed in a forgiving God and that he was making a bet that voters care more about the future than they do the foibles of his past. Gingrich could launch a sustained campaign to show his warmer side, as Hillary Clinton tried in 2008. That seems highly unlikely. In the end, the success of the Gingrich candidacy will depend on the idea that the importance of likability is exaggerated. If so, it may come as a surprise to many Republicans who cite amiability among Ronald Reagan's key characteristics or Democrats who cite FDR's ""temperament."" It is an argument that Democrats made when defending Al Gore and John Kerry. Who cares whether voters want to have a beer with a candidate, or live with their constant presence on cable television. With a deficit of $1.6 trillion, chaos in the Middle East, oil prices rising and job growth anemic, Americans are in a serious mood. Maybe they're ready for the file cabinets of ideas that Gingrich has in his head. If that's the case, then all he'll have to worry about is selling his ideas, not whether voters are even going to open the door."

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/creative_destruction.html	"Democrats have been arguing for weeks that the GOP's spending cuts will be bad for the economy, and in the last week they've celebrated two new analyses that bear none of their fingerprints but validate just about everything they've been saying. To which Republicans respond: And your point is ... what, exactly? In the debate over the impact of federal spending on the economy, Democrats think they have turned over a royal flush. But it turns out the game Republicans are playing is blackjack. Last week, ABC News obtained an analysis of the GOP's spending cuts, put together by Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips, that predicted a one-time 0.8 point hit to GDP if the cuts passed. On Monday, the Washington Post produced an analysis of the cuts from Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com that reached an equally gloomy conclusion: Slash spending at the level House Speaker John Boehner wants and watch the economy shed 700,000 jobs by the end of 2012. On Tuesday morning, Boehner had a simple way to dismiss Zandi: He was Nancy Pelosi's ""pet economist,"" not worth taking seriously. The day before, Majority Leader Eric Cantor came to his weekly briefing on Monday aware that he'd be asked about this--asked, at least, about Zandi--and he waved it off. ""I would note that Mr. Zandi was a chief proponent of the Obama/Reid/Pelosi stimulus bill that we know has failed to deliver on the promise of making sure unemployment did not rise above 8 percent,"" said Cantor. ""I also think it is important to ask the question ... 'What kind of jobs is he talking about?' Is he talking about government jobs, and, if so, why is the government hiring people it can't afford to pay? This is obviously an unsustainable situation and something that we are trying to address through our approach in the CR we passed two weeks ago."" Cantor got the obvious follow-up questions: Didn't Republicans realize spending cuts would kill some jobs? After all, they want to terminate some government jobs and send some public-sector employees to the ranks of the unemployed. Cantor parried by saying ""the real question"" was whether ""you want the government to continue to fund jobs that we can't afford."" Zandi, Phillips, and other economists who think the government has been creating or saving jobs with supply-side spending are not taken seriously on the right. They have economic models that rate how much ""bang for the buck"" (they prefer this cliche) is delivered from various types of spending--unemployment checks, food stamps, tax cuts. They have the CBO's numbers, which posit that 1.4 million to 3.5 million people have jobs that wouldn't have existed without the stimulus package that became law two years ago this month. Republicans just don't buy them. ""These analyses by the Keynesians are missing a key part of the story,"" Rep. John Campbell, R-Calif., explained Monday. ""One hundred percent of the money they're talking about is borrowed. Republicans, right now, are talking about cutting spending on the margins, and 100 percent of what we don't cut will be borrowed. The capital that they're putting to work is capital that's not improving something in the private sector, and all of these studies fail to take into account the interest we're paying on the deficit."" Campbell, an Ayn Rand disciple, has been saying this for a while. Republicans have started aping him only recently. Two years ago, as they opposed the stimulus bill, House Republicans reverse-engineered the White House's economic models--models bearing a kissing-cousin resemblance to Zandi's--and promised 6.2 million jobs for half the price of the Democrats' proposal. The number was based on calculating how many jobs would be killed by tax hikes and inverting it. This didn't make much sense, and Republicans didn't really believe it, but they were out of power. Their bill didn't pass, so no one noticed. The Democrats' stimulus did pass, and because unemployment went up, voters don't think it worked. This gives Republicans a free hand to say anything they like about doomsaying predictions of cuts in government spending leading to cuts in employment. (Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who helped develop the GOP's Potemkin stimulus, noted that the Democrats planned on spending $275,000 per job if their models worked; the current cost estimate per job is $228,055, as reported derisively by the conservative CNSNews.com.) They may be dismissive, but Republicans aren't Pollyannas about this stuff. Boehner's comment to a Pacifica Radio reporter--if the spending cuts killed government jobs, he said, ""so be it"" --was not the party's message. It's not actually how they've been approaching their cuts. A GOP aide with knowledge of the process that led to $61 billion in proposed cuts described it like this. The ideas for cuts came from plenty of places--a lot of them came from freshmen--but they were vetted by veteran staff on the Appropriations Committee. Those people tried to direct the cuts away from the salary side of the agencies they were attacking. They tried to target discretionary spending that was not part of salaries. For example, Republicans cut $1.3 billion of discretionary funding to community health centers; the Affordable Care Act, which is still there, stubbornly unrepealed, included mandatory funding for those health centers that the GOP didn't touch. The goal, even if GOP leaders won't sing about it, was to shrink spending but leave employment as unmolested as possible. The agencies have discretion over how they use their shrunken budgets; they don't have to cut back jobs. The Republicans who'll open up about possible job losses might have the more convincing case. Campbell talks about the losses as Joseph Schumpeter talked about creative destruction--temporary losses offset by sustainable gains. ""If we do not get the deficit down, if we don't change trajectory, will lose more jobs than we lose from cuts,"" Campbell said. ""When a debt crisis hits, if we've still got 47 percent of our debt held by foreigners, we'll have much greater job loss than that. Our first objective to is try and prevent a fiscal collapse, a la Greece. And it will take a longer time for the private sector to replace public-sector jobs that are cut, but when they do, they'll last longer."" Republicans have been talking like this for months, and they haven't been hurt by it. The choice between stimulus spending and creative destruction is a choice between something voters don't think worked and something voters don't think we've tried. As long as voters don't pay attention to how the U.K.'s austerity program is working, the GOP will be just fine."	GOP spending cuts: Will they kill hundreds of thousands of jobs?
