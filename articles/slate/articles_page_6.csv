It is the organizing principle of his campaign, his monument to victory. He speaks of it as if it were the God of the Old Testament, true and righteous altogether. It is to be an ""impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful Southern border wall,"" as Trump put it Wednesday night in his speech, the first plank of what at this moment he is calling his immigration plan. It is the lodestar of his campaign. Whatever softening he undergoes from now until Election Day, his base won't care so long as he doesn't waver on the wall. ""We're getting a wall,"" Ann Coulter said last week, when Trump appeared to be waffling. ""We're definitely getting a wall. That's the one thing we know about a Trump presidency."" If Trump becomes president, his top priority will be the wall. He has to get it. He will do anything. For the Democrats, the wall is what you might call an opportunity. The wall is not a good idea. Its potential effect on desert ecosystems is troubling. Much of the Southern border is a vital river. Billions of dollars in daily commerce is conducted along the border. How is all of this negotiated? The wall in some measure would need to be penetrable and porous. And then there's the complete inefficacy of the wall. It certainly wouldn't do anything about visa overstays. The requisite sensor technology to detect subterranean tunnels isn't there yet. Since Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, either directly or indirectly, the cost of construction and maintenance would be some tens of billions of dollars. But there are worse things to waste money on than mostly ineffectual federal construction projects that pay out sweet, sweet Davis-Bacon wages. If--if!--the environmental and commercial problems with the construction of a wall can be mitigated reasonably enough, Democrats would be holding an ace. Other central demands from a more conventional Republican candidate might include Democratic nonstarters like massive tax cuts for the wealthy, repeals of the Affordable Care Act or Dodd-Frank, or the Ryanization of Medicare and Social Security. Trump would just want a construction project, a physical bulwark, along the Southern border. Well ... sure? Publicly, at least, Democrats would need to be not sure. They would need to go on, as they've been doing, about how a wall is inconceivable. And then Sen. Chuck Schumer could just let the offers roll in as Trump tries to secure the cornerstone of his campaign against either Senate Democratic majority obstruction or Senate Democratic minority filibuster. The good(?) thing about Trump is that he has no ideological principles, would make offers to Democratic leaders straight over the head of House Speaker Paul Ryan, and then would whip in line Republicans who wouldn't want to embarrass their new president on his first major legislative effort. So what's the right vehicle? Trump is open to a mammoth infrastructure spending bill paid on borrowed money, which would make for sensible logrolling: Republicans get the wall in exchange for Democrats getting basically all of their infrastructure priorities. Or Democrats could go off-topic: the wall, in exchange for a public health insurance option or some other package of Affordable Care Act tweaks, an expansion of Social Security benefits, paid leave--you pick. The most obvious option, though, would be to trade the wall for other immigration-related provisions. Trump would say he wants a wall. Democrats would ask for a path to citizenship for noncriminal undocumented immigrants. Trump would then ask for triggers on the path to citizenship pending certification of border security, which would also have to include a doubling of Border Patrol agents. Democrats then ask whether the ""wall"" needs to be a wall and can't instead just be double-sided fencing. Trump agrees and asks for the funding to complete the already-authorized 700 miles of fencing, plus maybe a few hundred miles more, along with at least some ceremonial, symbolic portion of actual wall-wall on which could be emblazoned Trump's name. Democrats ask in return for an expedited citizenship process for DREAMers, and Trump pushes for full expansion of a nationwide E-Verify system. While they're doing this, they figure, they might as well throw in fixes to legal immigration and various broken visa programs, with input taken from both big business and labor groups. And then both Democratic leaders and the Trump administration would sell to their respective bases the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013--er, 2017--but this time with one mile of impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful wall, and the most terrific gold trimming you've ever seen.

1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/melissa_nelson_ousts_angela_corey_is_it_a_victory_for_criminal_justice.html	"The defeat of an infamously bloodthirsty prosecutor in Florida in an election Tuesday has been hailed as a victory for criminal justice reform, with academics, defense attorneys, and even the entertainer John Legend testifying to its significance in the fight for a more humane legal system. Indeed, voters in the state's 4th Judicial Circuit, which includes Jacksonville, were unequivocal in their rejection of State Attorney Angela Corey, who was blown out of the Republican primary race by her challenger, Melissa Nelson, by a whopping 38 percentage points. There are good reasons for people who believe in a less punitive, more equitable criminal justice system to cheer Corey's loss. As the Nation put it in its cover story on Corey last month, she might be ""the cruelest prosecutor in America""--a public servant best known for enthusiastically charging a 12-year-old boy as an adult for killing his half-brother and for pursuing a 60-year prison sentence for a woman who'd fired a gun at a wall during a fight with her abusive husband. Corey's other claims to fame: sending more people to death row than any other prosecutor in Florida and failing to secure a conviction for George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. So, yes: good riddance. But before this election gets conclusively marked down as a repudiation of the ""tough on crime"" mentality that gave rise to mass incarceration, it's worth taking a look at Nelson, the candidate who defeated Corey, and the kind of campaign she ran. Based on the coverage of Corey's loss, I had assumed that Nelson--a lawyer who had spent 12 years working in the state attorney's office--was a reformer who disapproved of her opponent on the grounds that she was too vengeful and needlessly harsh in her treatment of criminal defendants. So I was surprised at the first words I heard from Nelson's spokesman, Brian Hughes, when I asked him why his candidate had won: ""The thing nobody should read into it,"" he said, ""is that this was some success of the left."" I was similarly surprised to visit Nelson's campaign website and see the first words that flashed on the screen: ""tough prosecutor,"" ""tough on crime,"" and ""endorsed by the NRA."" These are not the proclamations of a crusading criminal justice reformer. While it's true that Nelson's brief campaign was centered on a call for change, and included the occasional comment about making the system more ""fair,"" the candidate's central message was not about, say, ending mass incarceration, or reducing the number of people doing prison time for drug crimes, or making the plea bargaining system more transparent and less coercive. The truth is Nelson ran a pretty conventional prosecutor's campaign, criticizing her opponent's integrity and judgment, while repeatedly emphasizing her own unforgiving stance on crime. As she put it in a debate earlier this month, she wanted voters to judge her on her record of prosecuting ""drug traffickers, robbers, rapists, and murderers."" ""Even though our opponent, Angela Corey, tried to make Melissa seem like the second coming of Bernie Sanders,"" Hughes told me, ""the reality is she is a conservative Republican."" Nelson was indeed attacked throughout the campaign as too soft and too liberal, largely on the basis that she waived the death penalty in a murder case in 2004, only to have the defendant kill again while serving his sentence in prison. So it's possible that Nelson really does have reformist impulses but that her campaign has made the calculation that appearing too sympathetic toward people who commit crime would hurt her standing with Florida voters. To that point, Hughes said something when I interviewed him that made me think maybe Nelson could be considered a member of the so-called right on crime movement--a conservative coalition that believes in reducing the prison population primarily for fiscal reasons. ""Criminal justice reform is becoming an area where conservative legal experts are really leading the way,"" Hughes said. ""One reason is fiscal responsibility, and the fact that the longer we stay on the path we're on, the more taxpayer money it's going to take to keep the criminal justice system going."" He indicated that Nelson has thought about this problem, as well as about what she as a prosecutor could do to help solve it: ""What Melissa would explain ... is that the law allows prosecutors a great deal of discretion. Angela Corey would not avail herself of many of those discretionary methods and that was bad for taxpayers."" The implication here is that Corey used her prosecutorial powers to send too many people to prison and that Nelson would not make the same mistake. It was a weird thing to hear from a spokesman for a Republican prosecutor: a dog whistle to the left? Maybe there is reason to be optimistic about Nelson's time in office. Nevertheless, any attempt to frame Corey's loss as proof that the American people have finally realized the folly of electing tough prosecutors should include a caveat: The Nelson campaign clearly believed that running openly and emphatically on a reform platform would not have been a winning strategy for her. Maybe times are changing. But you wouldn't know it from this particular race. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	"America's ""Cruelest Prosecutor"" Just Got Dumped. Is This Really a Victory for the Left?"

People aren't swayed by facts anymore; they're indifferent to reality and openly scornful of experts. All they want is to feel good, even if it's only for an instant, even if it's at the cost of an entire future. Vast crowds of the pleasure-hungry are being pulled along into increasingly destructive politics by cheap sound bites and tawdry emotion. We're teetering over the edge, and people hardly even notice--it's all become theater; society rips itself apart in real time before our eyes, but we approach it like an entertainment product. The question is no longer one of which politician actually has the best judgment and the best plans for the future, but which character is the most relatable, which post we want to hitch our self-identity against. This is madness, but it's also what's come to rule our world. You've probably heard the name for all this. We are in post-truth politics. It's not me saying this, though. This dire warning isn't about Donald Trump, or Brexit, or the news media covering either, or the tiny reality bubbles of the internet. This is the oldest complaint in the history of political theory, screaming at us from the discipline's frantic infancy. It's Plato, writing in the 400s B.C. And he was wrong. Plato was also, incidentally, the first notable person to complain that music used to be good back in his day but that kids now will listen to any old junk. He whined in The Laws that talentless modern musicians, ""being frenzied and unduly possessed by a spirit of pleasure, mix dirges with hymns and paeans with dithyrambs."" His complaints about the political culture of the time were in the same declensionist vein. Again in The Laws, Plato describes Athenian democracy as ""wretched theatrokratia,"" rule by the theater, a society on the precipice of tyranny. He famously wanted to expel the poets from his ideal Republic. Lyric poets, yes, but tragic dramatists especially. Today we're comfortable with a few demarcated fictions; for Plato, who identified the true with the good and the good with the true, all the lies and illusions of theater, the men in masks pretending to be people they're not, could only ever be dangerous. Stagecraft encourages mimesis. Audiences wince or laugh along with the hero's adventures, and as they do so reality is upended. In Plato the visible is only a reflection of immutable concepts, with images a tertiary phenomenon--as he puts it, ""naturally third from a king and the truth."" Reality rises from a dim underworld of representations to put both king and truth in danger. Plato's prescription was for a rationally ordered society, governed by the philosophers--people who cared, before anything else, about the truth. These days, we call them technocrats. The current panic over the collapse of truth in politics, something ripped apart by the outrageous lies of Brexit on one side of the Atlantic and the rise of Donald Trump on the other, isn't unjustified. These are dangerous ideologies, which have caused immense and terrifying damage in the past. But when you frame it as the disappearance of truth, you're in murky territory. Still, this is what's happening. In the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland cites a few of Trump's well-publicized distortions as proof that we've been ""left in a world without truth,"" while editor Katharine Viner warns that, as a result of traditional media's decline, ""increasingly, what counts as a fact is merely a view that someone feels to be true."" The Washington Post concludes a wonkish roundup of opinion polls on public trust in experts and institutions by declaring our era one of ""willful ignorance,"" in which ""the marshaling of undisputed facts and evidence doesn't have quite the effect on public debate that it used to."" But what's actually changed? At most, one form of lies is losing ground to another. In 2003, when we were told that half the world could be obliterated by Iraqi weapons within 45 minutes, were we still in pre-post-truth politics? At the start of this decade, when governments across Europe did everything to convince us that a global financial crisis had been caused by giving too much money to disabled people--was that also part of the lost golden age? When we entered the First World War to stop Belgian babies from being impaled on bayonets? When kings ruled by divine right? We have always been in post-truth politics. The first written texts of political theory are a lament that questions of government are no longer ruled by transcendent, objective fact. So many subsequent interventions tend to carry the same theme. John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville warned darkly of the ignorant masses on the horizons, now terrifyingly sovereign. Kant saw humanity living deeply irrational lives in a state of self-imposed nonage, capable of being rescued only by an enlightened but autocratic ruler. Most revealingly, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, Edmund Burke condemns radical and nonconformist preachers, who use their pulpits ""not for the diffusion of truth, but for the spreading of contradiction."" Whenever political processes start to involve large numbers of people, there's a worry that truth is being abandoned. This ought to say something. Science is a discourse in which the categories of truth or falsehood make sense; aesthetics is one in which they don't. Politics is something strange, however: It's far closer to literature than it is to science--disagreements over political principle can't be settled through a practical experiment--but for nearly two and a half thousand years it's faced the criticism that it should be something different from what it is. It might not be coincidental that this tends to happen when political reality has an opportunity to actually become something different. The liberal angst over Trump and Brexit is taken up again over socialists like Jeremy Corbyn or the movements that coalesced around Bernie Sanders: These people are fantasists and dreamers; their plans are flights of fancy, reckoned totally unworkable because they don't maintain a currently existing truth. But the power offered by politics is always the power to imagine something unreal. You can dream of (for instance) a National Health Service, or an end to all war, or the liberation of women. You can dream of things that don't yet exist and are by any binary definition untrue and then begin to bring them into being. Within politics you can say who you are and insist on it against those who'd rather you weren't. Emotive judgments are important: We should be able to say that in a world with enough food for everyone it's a moral outrage that people are still starving to death. Injustice demands anger--even if, by the cold calculus of pure facts, there's no end of perfectly reasonable explanations for why the poor must suffer. Politics is where people can gain the ability to actively reshape the world, rather than just describe it. It's as false as the Athenian theater, and this is no bad thing. Of course these aspects of politics can give rise to monsters like Donald Trump; dreams always raise the possibility of a nightmare. But when we're confronted with political evil, our response should be to fight it with something good, not to grumble that it's getting its statistics wrong. It's not that facts aren't good for anything, but a politics consisting of facts and nothing else isn't politics, but management. This is what our politics are actually turning into: rule by experts and fatalism. There are hyperbolic versions: Neil deGrasse Tyson's imagined country of ""Rationalia,"" for instance, where the primary constitutional principle is that all policy decisions are to be based on the collection of data and scientific standards of evidence, so that you'd have to run a trial on the arbitrary execution of dozens of innocent people before deciding that it's a bad idea (or, a horrifying possibility, discovering that according to some emotionless utilitarian calculus it's actually a good one). But stripped-back versions of Rationalia are all around us. In the United States, Hillary Clinton proudly boasts of her friendship with Henry Kissinger, who is indeed a very experienced statesman with a great many facts at his disposal, which all sounds wonderful as long as you don't remember what he used those facts for. Until very recently, all the mainstream parties seemed to agree on a politics informed by plenty of data but that was making life worse for millions. Is it any wonder that people are trying to find a way out? When truth is all that matters, there's no room for any vision of a better life. All you end up with is a system in which the rulers are the ones with the most information, who know the ins and outs of the machine, and are sporadically capable of keeping it running. And if it's a machine for grinding up human bodies into a profitable paste, then that's just the reality of things. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Biggest Political Lie of 2016
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/a_guide_to_tuesday_s_down_ballot_primaries.html	"Finally, some action. After a summer of mostly uneventful primaries, several of the country's most-watched intraparty races conclude Tuesday with down-ballot primaries in Arizona and Florida. On the ballots: Sens. John McCain and Marco Rubio, former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Florida Senate candidate Rep. Patrick Murphy, former Republican Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and all of our other friends! Each of the aforementioned names is expected to prevail against his or her challengers (or, in Crist's case, against no one) (though if anyone's going to somehow lose a race with no challenger, it's Charlie Crist). Primary polling has been sparse, though, so one must never rule out an Eric Cantor-like shockwave to the political system that terrifies all incumbents across the country for years to come. Here are the returns to watch tonight, at least during commercial breaks of Bachelor in Paradise. Arizona Senate The first hurdle in Sen. John McCain's relatively arduous path to a sixth term comes today as the incumbent faces off against Dr. Kelli Ward, a far-right, Trumpish Republican former state senator. I wrote (a breezy!) 7,000 words about this subject in July. Long story short: McCain was not so stupid as to author a comprehensive immigration reform bill with a path to citizenship and expect an easy glide toward renomination among border-state Republicans. He's been prepared for this for a long time, and that's part of why no more viable challenger, like Reps. Matt Salmon or Dave Schweikert, chose to challenge him. The McCain campaign, McCain's supporting super PAC, and allies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have dumped truckloads of money against Ward, painting her as a kooky conspiracy theorist; Ward, in her closing pitch, has been warning voters that the now-80-year-old McCain has lost his marbles and will probably keel over any minute. Running this primary successfully has come at a not-insignificant cost to McCain's pride, though, as he has had to debase himself by endorsing Donald Trump. If McCain prevails, there's been some speculation that he'd drop his support for Donald Trump in a hot second, because supporting Donald Trump is both embarrassing and his biggest liability in his would-be general election race against Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. McCain has said he's not going to do that. McCain is lowering expectations ahead of the race. How can I tell? ""The one thing you never want to do in politics,"" he tells Politico, ""is heighten expectations. You always want to lowball it."" A recent CNN poll gave him a 55 to 29 percent advantage over Ward; an intensely sketchy Breitbart/Gravis poll marked it at 37 to 33 percent in McCain's favor. Early mail-in voting has been going on for weeks. Kirkpatrick is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. Elsewhere in Arizona ... Eighty-four-year-old flamboyant crank Joe Arpaio, the longtime law-and-order sheriff of massive Maricopa County, is facing the usual legal troubles related to systemic racial profiling and contempt of court. For some of our elected public servants, this might represent trouble. For Arpaio, this represents a Tuesday afternoon. Some moderate Republicans are getting tired of the 23-year incumbent, however. Fortunately for him, he's working with $11.3 million (!) against a split field of three opponents who, between them, have raised less than $100,000. It shows in the polling. Should Arpaio make it to the general, he'll face a rematch with Democrat Paul Penzone, whom Arpaio narrowly beat in 2012. It will be close, and a wave of Hispanic voters turning out to vote against him (and Donald Trump) in Maricopa County in November could have serious repercussions for McCain's general election hopes. Three-term incumbent Rep. Paul Gosar also faces a difficult primary, as the Republican establishment hopes to do to him what it did to conservative Rep. Tim Huelskamp in Kansas a few weeks ago. A House Freedom Caucus member, Paul Gosar is sort of like a guy who might boycott a speech from Pope Francis, call him a ""leftist politician,"" and then raise money off of it. That's because he literally is the guy who did that. The D.C. establishment and local business interests hope to get rid of him because they find him irritating, and their vessel for doing so is some available city councilman puppet named Ray Strauss. Florida Senate The Republican Senate primary looks awfully different from how it did in early June, when it was still assumed that Sen. Marco Rubio would honor his word and retire, presumably into some corporate lobbying gig that came with owner's box season tickets to the Miami Dolphins. The main Republican challengers hoping to replace him, Reps. David Jolly and Ron DeSantis, along with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, struggled to gain traction, and the seat looked like a prime pickup opportunity for Democrats. Ultimately those three challengers withdrew from the race to make space for Rubio's change of heart, one he says was prompted by a visceral reaction to the Orlando shootings (and maybe a recognition that staying in the Senate was his best option for remaining relevant ahead of the 2020 Republican presidential primaries?). Rubio's only real remaining challenger is Carlos Beruff, a real estate developer with a predilection for mouthing off, a background and a trait that have resulted in exactly the sort of lazy analogies you'd expect the press to draw. Rubio is leading him by anywhere between 39 and 54 percentage points, depending on which recent poll you prefer. On the Democratic side, Rep. Patrick Murphy is expected to prevail against his fellow delegation member Rep. Alan Grayson. This is a pure establishment (Murphy) vs. anti-establishment (Grayson) race that was polling closely for a while. Democratic voters in Florida seem to have given Grayson a pass for various obnoxious, thorny comments he's made over the years. What's really killed him, though, are two things: a hedge fund he'd run on the side that came under a congressional ethics investigation and, worse, surfaced domestic violence allegations from his ex-wife. Murphy is not without his own problems; the two-term congressman was born into wealth and is painted as a spoiled brat who's reportedly inflated his own biography throughout his brief political career. He would face an uphill climb against Rubio, who significantly outperforms Trump among the state's sizable community of Hispanic Republicans. Florida's 23rd Congressional District Democratic Primary That's Debbie Wasserman Schultz's race! You remember Debbie, hmm, yes? Used to run the Democratic Party, resigned following the WikiLeaks trove, not particularly ...  liked ... by humans? Well, she's got a primary, and, fortunately for her, the people who do like her happen to live in her congressional district. Her opponent is Tim Canova, a professor and Bernie Sanders acolyte whom the Vermont senator has endorsed and fundraised for. Even with the mammoth fundraising support, recent scandal surrounding Wasserman Schultz's tenure at the DNC, and Wasserman Schultz's own unsavory record as a ""corporate Democrat,"" she appears likely to squeak by--the most recent survey showed her leading by 10 percentage points. There just aren't enough Bernie supporters there. Clinton won the district, which covers much of Broward County and extends south into Miami Beach, 68 to 31 percent in the Florida presidential primary. Elsewhere in Florida ... Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown, a Jacksonville-area member since 1993, is under a 22-count federal indictment for various corruption charges. She faces two challengers in the 5th congressional district. Meanwhile, former Republican Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is expected to win his second straight Democratic primary, this time running unopposed for the Democratic nomination in Florida's 13th congressional district. His last primary win was for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2014, after which he somehow managed to lose to awful and hated Florida Gov. Rick Scott in the general election. Florida's 13th district is one of the most competitive in the country, and he would go up against incumbent Rep. David Jolly, who decided to run again after abandoning his senatorial bid. The Cook Political Report lists the 13th as ""lean Democratic"" district now, but Charlie Crist has not won a general election since 2006 and is basically the walking definition of political opportunism. The 19th district Republican primary features the latest stand from Dan Bongino, who lost a Senate and a House race in Maryland in the last two cycles, before taking his talents (?) southward. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who built up his profile as a conservative radio host, faces two competitors in Chauncey Goss and Francis Rooney. We mention Bongino because last week, he launched the nastiest, most profanity-laden tirade against a reporter ever laid to tape. It's pretty funny. Bongino is expected to lose in Florida, much as he did on the regular in Maryland, although just yesterday he won the endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz--for whatever that's worth now.

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/the_patronizing_ahistorical_nonsense_of_trump_s_black_outreach.html	"To the extent that Donald Trump is reaching out to black Americans, his pitch relies on a bleak vision of black life in the United States and an attack on Democratic Party leadership in those same cities. ""Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on,"" tweeted Trump on Monday. ""Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary-type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!"" So far, there is no groundswell of black enthusiasm for Trump. He wins 8 percent of black voters in the latest poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal; he wins 5 percent in the latest survey from Morning Consult; and he wins just 3.6 percent in the latest poll from Reuters/Ipsos. In critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, he wins a statistically negligible share of the black vote, i.e. zero percent. In a sign of confidence, however, Trump plans to take his message to Detroit, where he'll hold his first event in a predominantly black community, speaking with Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of Great Faith Ministries. There's a strong chance he'll stick to his present pitch, even as it lands flat with the vast majority of black voters. That fact--black indifference or even antipathy to Trump and his rhetoric--deserves a little more attention. It's not that black voters are hostile to Trump; it's that they won't even entertain his basic message. There's nothing he could say or do in the realm of possibility that would budge his numbers away from historic lows, much less restore them to the double digits enjoyed by George W. Bush in the 2004 election. Given the real problems facing black voters--including higher rates of joblessness and criminal victimization--why aren't they receptive to Trump's message? The simple answer is that it's patronizing, ahistorical nonsense that's not at all unique to Trump. The problem goes beyond the mere optics of his ""outreach""--producing dystopian portraits of black life for predominantly white audiences. And it's not just the extent to which Trump is talking about black Americans rather than to them. The central issue is that Trump portrays black Americans not as able citizens who need to be convinced, but as mindless followers of a failed regime. ""The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty,"" Trump said in a recent speech in Milwaukee. He continued: ""The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin. They've ruined the schools. They've driven out the jobs. They've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable."" In this narrative, black Americans are mere objects--means to a partisan end. They do not choose or act as political agents. There are no black politicians or activists or leaders of any stripe. Instead, they are acted upon, tools of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. And worse, despite the horrors of Democratic governance, they don't understand that they've been used and ""betrayed."" They still vote for Democrats in overwhelming numbers. They are dupes. Trump's argument isn't new. It is de rigueur among conservative personalities to blame the Republican Party's poor performance with black voters on a ""plantation mentality,"" in which blacks are kept hopelessly dependent on government benefits and the Democratic Party that peddles them. The goal: to keep black Americans from grasping the truth that prosperity comes from ""liberty"" and free markets. You can hear this perspective throughout right-wing media, from Fox News and popular websites like Townhall, to films like Dinesh D'Souza's Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party and Pritchett Cotten's Runaway Slave, a documentary that claims to show how ""people can break free from a form of modern slavery caused by relying on welfare,"" and in which a black conservative--the Rev. C.L. Bryant--is the titular ""runaway slave"" who escapes the implied Democratic ""plantation."" Key to the ""plantation"" theory is the idea that modern Democrats are direct heirs to the white supremacist Democratic Party of the 19th and early 20th centuries. For proponents, it is a straight line from John C. Calhoun to Jefferson Davis to Theodore Bilbo to Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. You hear this in Trump's rhetoric as well. ""We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton,"" he has said, ""which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future."" Whereas Bilbo relied on terrorism to suppress blacks, modern Democrats use the welfare state to achieve the same ends. And the apex of this arrangement is in the inner cities governed for generations by ruinous Democratic policies. These narratives and arguments are bizarre to the point of incoherence, a fourth-rate imitation of history, devoid of any actual meaning. Shaped, influenced, and even driven by black Americans in the middle of the 20th century, the modern Democratic Party is not the literal descendant of the white supremacist party that bore the name for a century; in much of the modern-day South, black Americans are the Democratic Party. Black Americans have had an active role in Democratic Party politics for two generations, culminating in the election of Barack Obama, a black American. More broadly, blacks have not been led astray--they are not victims of false consciousness or some ""plantation mentality."" They are political actors making choices based on their interests as they see them. Likewise, the issues in urban America aren't the product of the Democratic Party or the black mayors and city councilors who took the reins of the cities in the 1970s and 1980s. The decline of Detroit or Cleveland or Baltimore didn't begin in 1967. Instead, they're the cumulative result of a century of policies, from redlining and housing discrimination to white flight, federal neglect, and ongoing hostility from surrounding municipalities. There's no question that these cities have been marred by bad governance, but to understand that in terms of party affiliation--neglecting the effects of deindustrialization, racism, and capital flight--is to show profound ignorance of urban politics and problems. Beyond incoherent, the ideas underlying Trump's narrative are racist, full stop. If ""plantation"" theory is true, then black voters are the mindless drones of American politics. Nefarious Democrats gave them a taste of government, and they never abandoned the hand that fed them. White voters, by contrast, are active citizens--noble republicans in the best tradition of the founders. It's ironic: For as much as they disdain Democrats as the real racists, it's the proponents of plantation theory who echo the arguments and propaganda of the pro-Southern, anti-emancipation Democrats of the Civil War era. ""The Freedman's Bureau!"" sang one poster from the 1866 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, advocating on behalf of Hiester Clymer and his white-supremacist platform. ""An agency to keep the Negro in idleness at the expense of the white man."" What's key is that black voters hear this sentiment in the rhetoric used by Trump and other conservatives. It's one reason that, despite having been peddled in its current incarnation by black conservatives and their allies for the better part of a decade, the argument has never gotten any traction. The other reason is Barack Obama. Tens of millions of black Americans hold the president and his family in high esteem as exemplars of the black community. For them, he deserves respect regardless of your politics. And if there's anything that defines the GOP in the present age for black voters, it's the outsized disrespect for Obama, from South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson's ""you lie"" to the birther crusade pursued so vigorously by Trump and others. Black Americans see this, and they remember. Somewhere in the multiverse is a world where black voters have warmed to Donald Trump. It's not this one. In this world, for blacks to reconsider Trump and the Republican Party, they would have to ignore his birtherism; they would have to ignore the push for voter ID and the attacks on civil rights legislation; they would have to downplay the patronizing ""outreach"" of conservative voices and Republican politicians. For blacks to reconsider Trump, they would have to act as if they were the dupes of his imagination. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	What Black People Hear When Donald Trump Asks for Their Vote
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/kelli_ward_wants_you_to_know_john_mccain_is_about_to_die.html	"We've only a few days to go until the Arizona Republican Senate primary, and death is on the mind of Dr. Kelli Ward. The former state senator is trailing, significantly, in her bid to oust Sen. John McCain. But it's not her campaign's impending death that consumes Ward. It's John McCain's. ""I'm a doctor. The life expectancy of the American male is not 86,"" she told Politico on Thursday, referring to the age McCain would be at the end of the sixth term he's seeking. ""It's less."" Ward's campaign has consistently teased around the issue of McCain's age. She frequently speaks of how it's time to ""retire"" McCain after his many, many, many years in Washington--so many years that, golly, he must be pretty old by now. (McCain turns 80 on Monday.) Now, in the closing-argument segment of the race, she appears to be dispensing with niceties entirely. Even if McCain doesn't die any second now, we're told, his advanced age is making him more senile. ""There are things that happen physiologically with the body and the mind. One of them is control over your anger, and he's already known as an angry man,"" she told Politico. ""It becomes more and more difficult to control those kinds of outbursts. And we have to have someone with a steady hand, someone with the ability to think on their feet."" This is not an example of a candidate straying off her talking points and later requiring cleanup by the communications office. These are the talking points, and she appeared on MSNBC Thursday afternoon to boost the signal. ""I see the physiological changes that happen in normal aging, in patients again and again and again over the last 20, 25 years,"" she told Chuck Todd. ""So I do know what happens to the body and the mind at the end of life."" The end of life. She's practically rolling him into the hospice wing. Let's think about intended audiences. There are the Arizona Republicans who already hate John McCain with the passion of a thousand suns and are willing to believe anything about him. Then there are the Arizona Republicans who think this is a strong political attack. The overlap between these two groups is somewhere around 100 percent, and it's looking as if their numbers do not constitute a majority of Arizona Republican primary voters. Arizonans already knew that McCain was gettin' up there and had a temper, and they'd baked that into their voting calculus. To everyone outside the far-right echo chamber, this just comes off as nasty and not a little bit kooky, and they're likely to assign those qualities to the originator of the attack. But at least Ward, 47, actually is younger than McCain. Donald Trump, on the other hand, is two years older than his opponent. This hasn't stopped him and his surrogates from suggesting that the aged Hillary Clinton is deeply ill and, like McCain, presumably going to die within the next 10 or 20 minutes. Trump-loyal conservative media, which includes the National Enquirer, is aflutter with such theories. The evidence behind all this is typically a photo of her walking up the stairs in February with some help. Another related sub-branch of the ""Hillary is dying"" theory holds that she sometimes sits in a chair or on a stool. Don't believe those who would tell you that maybe Clinton sits because sitting can be pleasant. Sitting, you see, is a classic tell from a politician who's trying to conceal her imminent death. Sean Hannity has devoted numerous segments to questions about what particular deathly disease Clinton is dying of, and surrogates like Rudy Giuliani and Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy have discharged their just-askin'-questions duties on cable news. Trump himself has taken to questioning Clinton's ""mental and physical stamina"" and her supposed proclivity for napping. ""She's got problems,"" Trump said earlier this month. ""Honestly, I don't think she's all there."" Again, let's think about intended audiences. There are the Republican voters who hate Clinton with the passion of a thousand suns and are willing to believe anything about her. Then there are the Republicans who think this is a strong political attack. Again, the overlap is about 100 percent. To everyone outside the bubble, which is a majority of voters, it's completely hilarious and baffling that they're running with these attacks. It's bizarre, back here on planet Earth, to hear the Republican presidential candidate, his loyal media, and some of his leading surrogates run wild with a theory about how Hillary Clinton is probably dying because she sits down. If there were any evidence that these attacks might be politically beneficial, we could at least respect their originators as political operatives. But all they do is please a narrow minority of conservatives and turn everyone else off with their comical bumbling. What the hell's going on here? A foundational belief among hardcore conservatives in the Obama era is that Republicans refuse to fight, and this more than anything else is to blame for the party's electoral and legislative failures. Per this school of thought, a central reason McCain lost the 2008 presidential election was that he didn't go hard enough after Barack Obama's relationships with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright or former Weather Underground member Bill Ayers. It couldn't possibly be that those issues had already been litigated earlier in the campaign and baked in, and the McCain campaign found that they didn't have much cachet outside conservatives. To continue harping on them might have come off as some combination of hilarious, tiresome, and bizarre to swing voters. It was the same deal with Romney and Benghazi in the late stages of the 2012 campaign. On the legislative side, it's held as an article of faith that the reason the Affordable Care Act was passed in the first place and hasn't since been repealed is that Republicans haven't fought hard enough on either occasion. Republicans, in truth, fought quite hard to block ""Obamacare"" and have since fought as hard as they could to tank it. They just haven't had the numbers in Congress or control of the White House. When I was following Ward earlier this summer to report a story on the Arizona Senate race, she seemed to be throwing haymakers for the sole purpose of showing Republican primary voters that she could throw haymakers. At a Tea Party meeting, she proudly read aloud a nasty press release from earlier that day calling McCain ""directly responsible for the rise of ISIS."" Her point was to show Tea Partiers that she was willing to say something like this, unlike the effete wusses back in D.C. Presumably, if she were to reach D.C. as a senator, she would just hurl a lot of strange insults and innuendo at a physical printout of the Affordable Care Act until it spontaneously combusted. Conservative media has been the lifeblood of Ward's campaign, and with Trump's hiring of Steve Bannon, it is in direct operational control of the Republican presidential nominee's campaign. And so crappy attacks, workshopped inside the conservative tabloid media bubble, get greenlit even if they confuse 70 percent of the electorate. Trump was able to say a lot of stupid things and get away with them in the Republican primary, but the lesson from that shouldn't have been that the idea was replicable: He was in a 17-person field, against a group of mostly undefined opponents, depriving them of oxygen. And he could at least be funny. John McCain and Hillary Clinton have total name recognition and well-known histories. It doesn't convert anyone new to suggest, sans evidence, that they're near death. It just hastens the death of the campaigns suggesting it. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Is the Trumpish Right So Inept at Hardball Politics?
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/hillary_clinton_offers_the_gop_a_lifeboat_off_of_trump_s_sinking_ship.html	"Thursday afternoon, Hillary Clinton unloaded on Donald Trump. Drawing on a wealth of evidence from his business history, his statements during this campaign, and the rhetoric of his supporters, she slammed him as a chronic, paranoid race-baiter. This wasn't an attempt to wound Trump's candidacy. As my colleague Michelle Goldberg explained, it's an attempt to kill it. But the speech was also Clinton's clearest signal yet as to how she plans to govern the country. She's not using Trump to try to take down the whole Republican Party. She's not going to tie him around the necks of House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the rest of the congressional GOP. She plans to work with these men. She's sinking Trump but sending lifeboats for Republicans. Twenty seconds into her attack, Clinton sent her first conciliatory signal. Trump's ""divisive rhetoric,"" she said, was ""like nothing we've heard before from a nominee for president of the United States from one of our two major parties."" Many liberals would disagree. They think Trump has made explicit the racism to which other Republicans have appealed indirectly through attacks on figures such as Jeremiah Wright or Willie Horton. Clinton, who began life as a Republican, chooses not to see it--or at least put it--that way. A few minutes later, speaking about Trump's criticism of a Mexican American judge, Clinton brought up Ryan. ""Even the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, described that, and I quote, as 'the textbook definition of a racist comment,' "" she noted. Clinton could have added that Ryan, after making that statement, continued to support Trump. She didn't. She let the speaker off the hook. Rather than tie Ryan to Trump, Clinton drove a wedge between them. She pointed out that the newly installed CEO of Trump's campaign, Breitbart executive Steve Bannon, recently ""railed against Speaker Paul Ryan for quote, 'rubbing his social-justice Catholicism in my nose every second.' "" In her next breath, she mocked Trump for being ""the only presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the pope."" This wasn't just a jab at Trump. It was an overture to Ryan. In negotiations on budgets and poverty, expect Clinton to play the Catholic social justice card. Clinton even tossed a bouquet to Ted Cruz, the right-wing senator who has done everything possible to vilify her and block President Obama's agenda. Reviewing Trump's ""conspiracy theories with racist undertones,"" Clinton chose this example: ""He suggested that Sen. Ted Cruz's father was involved in the Kennedy assassination."" In a tone of incredulity and disgust, she surmised, ""Perhaps in Trump's mind, because Mr. Cruz was a Cuban immigrant, he must have had something to do"" with the assassination. Her reference to Cruz's heritage, like her reference to Ryan's faith, was a reminder of the American melting pot--and a gesture of solidarity with both men against a bigot. At times in this campaign, the collaboration of Ryan, McConnell, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus, and other Republicans with Trump has so disgusted me that I've wanted to bury their whole party. Clinton made clear she doesn't intend to try that. Her designation of Trump's philosophy as ""alt-right"" presented, in effect, an invitation to Republicans to preserve their brand while rejecting Trump. ""This is not conservatism as we have known it,"" said Clinton. ""This not Republicanism as we have known it. These are racist ideas, race-baiting ideas, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women."" She described alt-right as an ideology that ""rejects mainstream conservatism"" in favor of ""white identity."" That's a dead ringer for Ryan's standard line that right-wing racism is ""identity politics."" Clinton also appealed to Republican instincts on foreign policy. She framed Trump as the American branch of a global network of xenophobic nationalists, all of them doing the bidding of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Clinton ridiculed Trump for staging a rally Wednesday with Nigel Farage, the leader of the British Brexit campaign who ""regularly appears on Russian propaganda programs."" This was arguably the most ambitious section of her speech, linking the racism of Trump and Farage--an indictment that stirs anger on the left--with their service to Putin, which alarms the right. ""American presidents from Truman to Reagan to Bush and [Bill] Clinton to Obama have rejected the kind of approach Trump is taking on Russia,"" she said. ""And we should, too."" Why is Clinton, at this late stage of the campaign, still offering Republicans an exit ramp? Why is she working so hard to distinguish Republicanism, conservatism, and the past three GOP administrations from Trump? Maybe she's just playing it safe, maximizing her potential election support instead of trying to kill off down-ballot Republicans. Maybe it's the mainstream instincts she shares with her husband (she repeated some of Bill's vintage lines in the speech). But a lot of it, I'd argue, is that she thinks like a policymaker. That's why, in attacking Trump's proposed ban on Muslims, she targeted its infeasibility: ""How would they do that?"" She's not focusing on how many Republicans she can take down in the election. She's focusing on how much help she can get from Ryan and McConnell after it's over. If Ryan, McConnell, or Priebus were braver, one of them (as my colleague Jamelle Bouie points out) would have given a speech like this one. He would have defined the GOP and the conservative movement in opposition to Trump. Instead, Clinton did the job for them.  ""This is a moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the party of Lincoln has become the party of Trump,"" she said:"	Hillary Clinton Just Offered the GOP a Lifeboat Off of Trump's Sinking Ship
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/hillary_clinton_s_alt_right_speech_was_shrewd_strategy.html	"On Thursday afternoon, speaking to an audience in Reno, Nevada, Hillary Clinton took a knife to Donald Trump's campaign. The subject of her speech was a movement called the ""alt-right."" To the vast majority of Americans, this means nothing. And that ""vast majority"" includes most of the audience for the 2016 presidential election. If you watch broadcast and cable news, if you read newspapers and magazines, if you listen to political radio and podcasts, there's a strong chance you haven't heard the term either. But if you experience politics through social media--and Twitter in particular--the alt-right is an all-too-familiar phenomenon. Broadly, the alt-right is a loose collection of bloggers, activists, intellectuals, and media figures. It's conservative but unconcerned with the usual right-wing platform of low spending, low taxes, and small government. Instead, the alt-right is preoccupied with the status of white America, which it sees as under siege from Hispanic immigration, diversity, and ""political correctness."" The alt-right has its origins in the white nationalists and ""white identity"" movements of the 1990s, but in the past year, it has found a home on Twitter and other social media, where adherents traffic in white supremacist and anti-Semitic memes; threaten and harass female, nonwhite, and Jewish users; and decry ""white genocide,"" defined as multiculturalism. These users see themselves as an intellectual and political vanguard defending European civilization from the brown hordes. In reality, they're white supremacists with a knack for branding. If these white supremacists are relevant, it's because of Donald Trump. In ways small and large, the Republican nominee for president has legitimized their presence in public life, from retweeting alt-right Twitter accounts and sharing anti-Semitic memes to his followers, to hiring the executive chairman of Breitbart (an online haven for the movement), to courting figures such as Nigel Farage, the Brexit tubthumper who stirs up similar sentiments of racism and xenophobia. Trump is their avatar, and he welcomes their attention. The upside, for Trump, is that it gives him a fervent base of supporters who evangelize on his behalf in every medium they can access. The downside is that it makes Trump toxic to vast groups of Americans. Fifty-nine percent of voters, according to a new poll from Quinnipiac University, say that ""the way Donald Trump talks appeals to bigotry."" Likewise, in polling by the Trump campaign, large numbers describe the real estate mogul as ""unqualified"" and ""racist."" These numbers are why Trump has lost white voters with degrees--the first Republican to do so since the advent of modern polling--and why he struggles with white women in particular. All of which is why, for the past week, Trump has tried to soften his approach, with an attempt at performing empathy for black voters and a newly muddled stance on immigration, meant to appeal to hardliners and moderates. If it works, if Trump can show those white voters that he's not as rigid and prejudiced as he might seem, then he could make gains. He could even have a shot at the White House. Clinton's address on Thursday had one goal: to tie Trump to the alt-right by reminding voters of his statements and associations, going back to the beginning of his campaign. And she did just that. ""We all remember when Trump said a distinguished federal judge born in Indiana couldn't be trusted to do his job because, quote, 'He's a Mexican,' "" said Clinton, reminding her audience of Trump's attacks on Gonzalo Curiel, the judge presiding over the lawsuit against Trump University. ""His campaign famously posted an anti-Semitic image--a Star of David imposed over a sea of dollar bills--that first appeared on a white supremacist website,"" she went on, pointing back to an example from earlier in the summer. She kept on, citing incident after incident in which Trump indulged in bigotry and hatred, from his claim that American Muslims cheered the 9/11 attacks to his long-standing birtherism. Her most important move in the speech was to contrast Trump's behavior with that of past Republican presidents and nominees. Clinton favorably cited Bob Dole's admonition against racists during the 1996 Republican National Convention, praised George W. Bush for his outreach to Muslim Americans after 9/11, and highlighted John McCain for his pushback against racist conspiracy theories during the 2008 presidential election. As analysis, Clinton's argument about Trump's distance from the rest of the GOP is wrong. At various points in their campaigns, those Republicans gave their winks and nods to the most toxic elements in their party. And broadly, the Republican Party has long appealed to the white racial resentment and hostility that now fuels the Trump campaign in explicit form. As strategy, however, Clinton's approach is shrewd. She could tie the entire GOP to Trump, but at the risk of embattling Republican voters and activating a tribal loyalty to the party. By distancing Trump from the Republican mainstream, she offers those voters another choice: You can vote for me, or if that's too much, you can just not vote at all. Either way, Trump's margin shrinks. And if those voters decide to abandon the polls in November, it could bolster Democrats even further as they try to take the House and Senate back from the Republican Party. In the meantime, by highlighting Trump's prejudiced rhetoric and his close ties to white supremacists, Clinton disrupts his attempted pivot, forcing him to litigate these questions and even provoking him and his allies into reinforcing her argument. Neither Clinton nor her campaign brought much fanfare to this address. The speech was short, the audience was small, and the proceedings were a bit more sedate than the usual political rally. But that's because this wasn't a usual speech, a fact underscored by Clinton's delivery, which was calm--almost conversational. In the years since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it has not been normal for a major party nominee, such as Donald Trump, to have open ties to white nationalists and conspiracy theorists. It has not been normal for that nominee to push religious discrimination as a matter of public policy. It has not been normal for him to attack federal officials on the basis of their heritage. That Clinton gave this speech at all is another stark reminder that this election is not normal and that the stakes--the potential elevation of outright white supremacists in government and society--are incredibly high. And if there's a question to take away from Thursday, it's this one: Why couldn't Republican leaders say this when they had the chance? Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Clinton's Alt-Right Address Was the Speech GOP Leaders Should've Given Months Ago
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/why_hillary_clinton_is_talking_about_donald_trump_and_the_alt_right.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. The white nationalist Richard Spencer was on vacation in Japan when he learned that Hillary Clinton was planning to give a speech about Donald Trump's ties to the so-called alt right, and he was thrilled. ""It's hugely significant,"" Spencer told me by Skype from Kyoto. ""When a presidential candidate--and indeed the presidential candidate who is leading in most polls--talks about your movement directly, I think you can safely say that you've made it."" Spencer, a clean-cut 38-year-old, loves publicity. He hung around last month's Republican National Convention in Cleveland with a sign saying, ""Wanna Talk to a 'Racist'?"" He is president and director of the National Policy Institute, described on its website as ""dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of people of European descent in the United States, and around the world."" He coined the term alternative right, founding the website alternativeright.com in 2010, which has since morphed into the highbrow racist RadixJournal.com. ""The alt right has really become the banner for European identity politics in the United States and around the world,"" he said. Spencer agrees with Clinton about very little, but he agrees with her about this: Understanding the alt right is important to understanding Trump's rise. Clinton's speech about the alt right is scheduled for Thursday in Reno, Nevada. ""Trump's newly installed brain trust of Steve Bannon, Roger Ailes and Roger Stone completes Donald Trump's disturbing takeover of the Republican Party,"" said a statement by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, citing Trump's new campaign CEO as well as his informal advisers. ""We intend to call out this 'alt-right' shift and the divisive and dystopian vision of America they put forth because it tells voters everything they need to know about Donald Trump himself."" For the alt right, a movement nurtured on internet message boards and websites full of obscure in-group jargon, such a high-profile denunciation is a big deal. The white nationalist website VDARE is already fundraising off the speech. Yet it is Trump, not Clinton, who has given the alt right unprecedented political relevance. It's not just that he's a hero to the movement. He has actively helped expand its reach. He retweets white supremacist accounts and echoes alt-right rhetoric about America's devolution into a violent mongrel hellscape, besieged by immigrants from without and crime and disorder from within. Trump shares the alt right's respect for Vladimir Putin, admired by many in the alt right as the leader of what Spencer calls ""a powerful white empire."" (By contrast, said Spencer, the countries of NATO are ""cucked nations""--cuck being a favorite alt-right insult, invoking white men who are cuckolded by black men.) Trump's comparisons of Clinton to Angela Merkel might have puzzled many Americans--Germany's chancellor isn't a household name here--but as ThinkProgress reported, white supremacists who revile Merkel for her policy on migrants have been making the same connection for months. Until recently, the overlap between Trump and the alt right seemed more a matter of what Spencer calls ""elective affinities"" than active coordination. But earlier this month, Trump hired Bannon, then chairman of Breitbart News, to be his campaign's CEO. Bannon has run Breitbart since the death in 2012 of its eponymous founder, Andrew Breitbart, turning the site in an explicitly ethno-nationalist direction. ""We're the platform for the alt-right,"" Bannon told the journalist Sarah Posner last month. Now the Clinton campaign has to try and explain to America what the alt right is. That might not be easy. Though Spencer came up with the term, it has come to define a broader congeries of reaction. The alt right encompasses longstanding racist organizations; taboo-scorning Twitter trolls; unapologetic misogynists; professional Islamophobes; and so-called neo-reactionaries, a movement of futuristic monarchists. What unites these figures is a fundamental rejection of egalitarianism, contempt for democracy, and irreverent glee in their ability to shock the bourgeoisie. Daryle Lamont Jenkins, who founded the One People's Project to track the far right, describes the alt right as ""hipster Nazis."" The alt right generally sees itself as being at war with establishment conservatism. ""The Alt Right is one name for the political tendency (actually tendencies) that exist outside of the racket of Conservatism Inc.--the GOP publicists, cheerleaders and assorted parasites who make up the Establishment Right,"" Peter Brimelow, the editor of VDARE, told me via email. ""It addresses new issues that have surfaced since the end of the Cold War, like immigration, Affirmative Action, the emerging science of race differences, even rethinking foreign policy etc., all of which are currently kept out of public debate by the curse of Political Correctness."" Ironically, for a movement obsessed with nationalism, the alt right has more affinity with the European right than traditional American conservatives do. United by ethnicity rather than religion, it is less moralistic than the Christian right; like the right in Europe, it is more likely to condemn Muslim homophobia than to condemn homosexuals. The big alt-right event at the Republican National Convention was the Gays for Trump party hosted by Milo Yiannopoulos, Breitbart's technology editor, which drew Spencer, Brimelow and Dutch right-wing politician Geert Wilders. The alt right sees allies in France's National Front and Britain's U.K. Independence Party, whose leader, Nigel Farage, rallied with Trump on Wednesday night in Mississippi. For alt-right apologists, the movement's decadent impudence serves as an alibi; they say its bigotry shouldn't be taken at face value. In March, Breitbart published ""An Establishment Conservative's Guide to the Alt-Right,"" by Yiannopoulos and Allum Bokhari. ""Just as the kids of the 60s shocked their parents with promiscuity, long hair and rock'n'roll, so too do the alt-right's young meme brigades shock older generations with outrageous caricatures, from the Jewish 'Shlomo Shekelburg' to 'Remove Kebab,' an internet in-joke about the Bosnian genocide,"" they wrote. ""Are they actually bigots? No more than death metal devotees in the 80s were actually Satanists."" When Britain voted to leave the European Union, Yiannopoulos tweeted, ""Sorry about it (((Soros))),"" accompanied by a photo of a little blond girl. He was referring to the liberal financier George Soros, and the triple parentheses are the alt-right symbol for Jew. This was apparently arch, ironic anti-Semitism, not the vulgar earnest kind. (Yiannopoulos has been permanently banned from Twitter, so the tweet is no longer available.) Spencer, however, is dead serious about his ideas, despite his taste for sarcasm and memes. ""European identity politics is really an inevitability,"" he said. ""It's going to happen in North America as whites become a minority in this country. And the only question really is how it is going to happen. I never would have predicted that it would happen through Donald Trump. If you had told me that two years ago, I would have said you were crazy. But it is happening."" He's right, it is. Now Clinton has to make it clear to America what that means.

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/_undercover_voters_won_t_save_donald_trump.html	The Republican presidential candidate is trailing in just about every national or battleground state poll. To certain minds, this can mean only one thing, and it's not that the Republican presidential candidate is losing the election. It's that the polls are skewed. Poll-skewing accusations come in different flavors. In 2012, the unusually widespread idea among conservatives was that the liberal media organizations sponsoring these polls were fiddling inappropriately with their samples and making them more Democratic. These accusations were poorly evidenced, the polls were mostly accurate, and President Obama won re-election. The sampling wars will be inflicted upon us anew if Donald Trump is able to significantly close polling gaps to within a few percentage points. But a larger deficit of, say, 5 to 10 percentage points in national polls, with corresponding marks in the state polls, requires a blunter argument from surrogates tasked with explaining how Donald Trump Is Actually Winning. It requires an argument like, say, this one from Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, herself a pollster:	"""Undercover"" Voters May Exist, but They Won't Save Donald Trump"

Dana Milbank, in the Washington Post, pointed out that Hannity--who'd told the Times' Jim Rutenberg in the piece that he was not a journalist--had previously called himself a ""journalist."" Rutenberg himself took Hannity to task for his lack of honesty, and called the entire network's behavior into question. (Roger Ailes, the former head of Fox News, is also reportedly advising his fellow feminist Trump.) Whether or not Hannity is a journalist, he should certainly be honest with viewers, which he has not been. But the mini-scandal seemed to be fueled by a wish for Hannity to comport himself according to the abstemious norms of Serious Journalism. Why? Hannity is self-actualizing before our very eyes. He's a hack in full now, and everyone knows it. Even if Hannity's relationship with Trump is unsurprising, there can be no denying that the host has placed himself into a special category of bootlicker this year. While it's true that conservative personalities from Rush Limbaugh to Fox's own Bill O'Reilly have tied themselves in knots trying to ""explain"" the giant pile of horseshit and arrant nonsense that is Donald Trump, Hannity has gone further than one would have thought possible. In his numerous interviews with the candidate, he has acted as a conduit for whatever message the Trump campaign is trying to get across to the base. He has also helped Trump avoid gaffes that his nonbase might not appreciate. Back in April, ThinkProgress found that Hannity had interviewed Trump 41 times since the start of his presidential run in June 2015; the candidate didn't make news once. Hannity has also begun circulating some of the Trump campaign's (more) insane theories, such as those about Hillary Clinton's health. (My favorite Hannity ""questions"" consist of his asking Trump why the rest of the media is asking Trump actual questions.) Still, advising the candidate is in some senses a different beast than this sort of behavior, and it has caused the mainstream media to take more notice. As Rutenberg reported:"	Sean Hannity Has Gone in the Tank for Donald Trump. Let's Leave Him There.

He's fired one campaign manager and hired another; he's gestured toward contrition for his behavior and muddied his language on immigration, pledging a ""fair"" process for mass deportation. And he's begun to court black voters using an unconventional message. ""What do you have to lose,"" said Trump, making his pitch to black Americans at a recent rally in Dimondale, Michigan, a city that's less than 1 percent black (and named, incidentally, for a failed New York City real estate mogul). ""You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?"" He continued: ""I will produce. I will produce the inner cities and I will produce for the African Americans. And the Democrats will not produce. All they've done is taken advantage of your vote. ... If you keep voting for the same people, you'll get exactly the same result."" In a re-election bid four years from now, Trump added, ""I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African-American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce."" It almost goes without saying that the facts here are wrong. Yes, blacks face major obstacles to upward mobility, among them structural poverty and unemployment driven by deep segregation and ongoing discrimination in job and housing markets. At the same time, most black adults are employed, most blacks aren't poor, most black children attend decent schools, and--barring an unimaginable shift in the political landscape--most black voters (upward of 95 percent) will oppose Donald Trump in the general election. But as with his rhetorical moves on immigration, the content of Trump's message is less important and less interesting than the audience he's trying to reach. Hint: He's not trying to win over black voters. If that were true, Trump would have made this pitch at a black church or any other space where black Americans are in wide attendance. And while Trump has an uncanny ability to convince himself of virtually anything, he must know that he stands little chance of winning even a sliver of the black vote, which has turned decisively against his candidacy. No, the point here--and the overall goal of this latest ""pivot""--is to salvage Trump's standing with college-educated whites, who have turned decisively against the alleged billionaire for his outright bigotry and general buffoonery. Trump does best among white men without a college degree, but the simple fact of this election is that there aren't enough of them to win a national election. If 99 percent of white, non-college-educated men turned out to vote in November, according to demographer William Frey, Trump would still lose the popular vote by more than 1 million ballots given his deep deficits with every other demographic group. Trump needs to do something, and nonwhite voters are already too far gone for the real estate mogul to make up lost ground. (Trump is on pace to lose black voters by the largest margin in modern American history, surpassing even Barry Goldwater's catastrophic performance in the 1964 presidential election.) Enter Kellyanne Conway, part of the latest round of political operatives to hitch their fate to Trump's aspirations. Last week, Conway--who backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries--supplanted Paul Manafort as manager for the Trump campaign. And in short order, she has worked to tame the worst of Trump's behavior. The goal is straightforward: If Trump seems more normal and less erratic, then he could begin to win those white college-educated voters who are critical to victory in states like Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. For Team Trump, it's a simple equation. If those voters are turned off by his racist rhetoric, then he could address their fears by loudly reaching out to black voters. It's an old strategy, meant to assure a critical set of Republican-leaning voters that they aren't backing a bigot. Conway herself gave away the game in a Sunday interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. ""I live in a white community. I'm white. I was very moved by his comment,"" said Conway, when asked about the all-white venue for Trump's comments and the extent to which they sustain the idea that most black Americans live in poverty. Likewise, on Monday, Republican National Committee spokesperson Sean Spicer pointed to Trump's belated adherence to anti-discrimination laws as evidence of black outreach, something that wouldn't win a single black voter to Trump's side, but might assuage some white ones. If Trump were an ounce more disciplined, this might work. Most Americans key into the election after Labor Day, and Trump stands a chance of convincing some that he's a broad-minded businessman with a steady hand. But Trump's reckless combativeness is part of his person--it's not a persona. He's incapable of sticking to a strategy, as evidenced by his gratuitous Monday-morning swipes at the hosts of MSNBC's Morning Joe, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. Worse for Conway (and perhaps those Republicans still hopeful he will change), Trump has a real affinity for the white nationalists and other provocateurs who surround his campaign. A Trump who hires the executive director of Breitbart (a virtual hub for online racists) and whose first ad for the general election is anti-immigrant demagoguery is not a Trump interested in being respectable. Yes, Trump is aiming some rhetoric at the center of American politics. Yes, he's doing ""outreach."" But don't mistake this for some kind of ""pivot."" There is no pivot. Trump has one move for this election, and he is going to keep playing it and playing it until he loses. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Trump's Outreach to Black Voters Isn't About Black Voters
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/donald_trump_doesn_t_have_foreign_policy_ideas_he_has_moods.html	"Donald Trump's predictably demagogic national security address in Ohio on Monday was filled with disgusting asides and mean-spirited policy proposals. It functioned as a bit of a greatest-hits package of ideas he has tried out in other speeches and on the campaign trail, such as banning certain immigrants (hint: they  practice one particular religion) and getting good information from suspected terrorists (no hint necessary: he is gleeful in his approval of torture). But as his campaign shows signs of collapsing, Trump has inadvertently done something interesting. He has inverted the traditional duty of a responsible political journalist. At this stage in the campaign, the specific details of any given Donald Trump speech are much less important than what can be gleaned about the frame of mind of the man who is uttering them. We are all, in a way, Mark Halperin now. The most surprising aspect of Donald Trump's address was that his campaign shied away from billing it as a ""relaunch"" of his flailing campaign. It seems like only a week ago--in fact it was only a week ago--that Trump had another campaign relaunch aborted, this one after his big economic speech got lost amid his calling President Obama the founder of ISIS, and his ""joking"" about ""Second Amendment people"" taking some sort of action against (take your pick) Hillary Clinton or America's judiciary. So, this time around, perhaps realizing there wasn't much point in overselling things, the campaign merely talked of a big, important speech. And, in typical Trump big-important-speech fashion, this one felt like something read off a teleprompter; it was relatively relaxed in manner of delivery, with fewer Trumpian flourishes than usual. When he began the speech by saying he wanted to ""begin a conversation,"" he momentarily sounded like a soothing television host rather than the unhinged pseudo-populist we have all come to know and love. Still, in very little time--but for a very long time--Trump was enumerating his bill of wrongs, gravely intoning all of the bad things that ISIS has done. It was reminiscent of some of the Republican convention speeches, in which sky-is-falling pessimism was leavened only by barely subdued anger. Of course, there was one break from Trump's dark picture. That was when he drew a portrait of life in the Middle East and North Africa before Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton entered the executive branch in 2009. Trump presented Libya, Egypt, and Syria as stable countries, and he mentioned that Iran at the time was being choked off by sanctions. He didn't say that it was the Obama administration that had put the real squeeze on Iran via sanctions, nor did he mention that he supported the war in Libya that wrecked the oh-so-peaceful status quo. Needless to say, he blamed Obama and Clinton for the chaotic state of affairs today. (His attack on Obama for ""apologizing for America,"" as he tiresomely put it, sits awkwardly alongside his general take on America, which is that we are a horrific and bad place that has no right to lecture other countries precisely because of our awfulness.) The main body of Trump's speech was organized around the theme of, as he put it, halting ""the spread of radical Islam."" ""All actions,"" he said, ""should be oriented around this goal."" Trump then called for restricting immigration from countries that he deemed threatening, and applying an ideological test that would forbid people from entering whom he considered bigoted or un-American . Given that Trump spent a good chunk of time talking about Islam's supposed hatred of women and gay people, one can only ask if Trump would deport people in his own party who share similarly retrograde views. As for the rest of the speech, it was a mixture of half-truths and outright lies. Trump, for example, did not oppose the Iraq war before it started. ""I was against it, believe me,"" Trump said, perhaps expressing a rare moment of doubt about his own truthfulness. The reason that it's not worth focusing too closely on the content of Trump's speech--its place in our intellectual debates on foreign policy, its variety of ""realism,"" the ways in which it represented a tweaking of earlier policy positions--isn't just that Trump is very, very unlikely to be president. It's also that no one has any clue what sort of policies this obviously unstable and vindictive and impatient man would actually pursue in office. Trump is sui generis in American politics, from his violation of various norms to his astonishing takeover of the Republican Party. But he has also changed the formula for proper journalistic coverage of a candidate. It was silly to focus on Al Gore's outfits or Hillary Clinton's tone of voice. But it isn't silly to focus on how stable Trump seems during a certain speech--he was stable on Monday, for the record, which means he'll have broken free of his moorings by Friday--or the precise way in which his campaign is trying to keep a lid on its candidate's volatile id. And in Trump's case, the reverse is true as well: While it is important and urgent to keep in mind that he is a racist and an authoritarian, it is silly to think too hard about the specifics of a foreign policy he put forth on Monday that could all easily change in an off-the-cuff moment on CNN on Tuesday. Trump's policies may loosely cohere into some sort of familiar ideology, but his campaign and his ideas all basically exist within his head. And if the past year proves anything, it's that his head is what needs examining. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Donald Trump Doesn't Have Foreign Policy Ideas. He Has Moods.
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/the_real_meaning_of_the_right_wing_conspiracy_theories_about_hillary_s_health.html	"If you spend much time on right-wing media, you might have heard that Hillary Clinton suffers from seizures, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and possibly even tongue cancer. As David Weigel writes in the Washington Post, Sean Hannity has spent all week dredging up debunked rumors about Clinton's health, giving special attention to a photo of her stumbling as she climbs a set of outdoor stairs while wearing heels in February. Donald Trump nodded to the rumors at a rally last weekend, saying, ""Honestly I don't think she's all there."" Photos of ""leaked"" medical records describing Clinton's ""subcortical vascular dementia"" and ""complex partial seizures"" are circulating online; as Snopes points out, they are printed on plain paper rather than letterhead, and they misstate the professional title of Clinton's physician, Lisa Bardack. (An actual letter from Bardack says Clinton is in ""excellent physical condition and fit to serve as President of the United States."") As Clinton conspiracies go, this stuff is picayune. After all, some of the same right-wing characters painting Clinton as a frail invalid are also accusing her of masterminding the murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, who is said, without evidence, to be involved in last month's leak of DNC documents. (This is only the latest of the dozens of murders some attribute to the Clintons.) Echoing the right-wing conspiracy site InfoWars, Trump has accused Clinton of co-founding ISIS, though very early Friday morning, he expressed incredulity on Twitter that the media took his claim seriously: ""THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?"" Clinton has been accused of maintaining a secret police force to harass her critics. Countless Republicans have said she deliberately covered up the motives for the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. Indeed, though right-wingers now cite her 2012 concussion as evidence of her failing health, Fox News previously accused her of faking the concussion to get out of testifying about Benghazi. It's hard to blame conspiracy theorists for this contradiction; with so many rumors swirling around, internal consistency is impossible. What's striking about the rumors of Clinton's imminent collapse aren't the stories themselves, but the purpose they serve. Most Clinton conspiracy theories are meant to delegitimize her, to explain away her baffling, irksome persistence in public life as a product of a scarcely comprehensible homicidal ruthlessness. The idea that she's secretly much weaker than she appears, by contrast, is pure wishful thinking. It's the demented cousin of the right-wing conviction, in the run up to the 2012 election, that polls showing Mitt Romney losing were skewed. ""Hillary Clinton's Health in Rapid Decline--Will She Even Make It to Election Day at This Rate?"" asks a headline on InfoWars. This is the speculation of desperate men hoping for a deus ex machina to save them from a Clinton presidency. That means that on some level, these men are starting to understand that this future is bearing down on them. If they're living out the Kubler-Ross stages of grief, this is denial. One can only imagine what the next phase is going to look like: anger. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/mark_foley_sat_behind_trump_seddique_mateen_sat_behind_hillary_who_cares.html	"America owes a debt of gratitude on this day to disgraced former Rep. Mark Foley, the diddler. By showing his face at Donald Trump's Florida rally Wednesday night and sitting in the same camera shot as the candidate, he canceled out the story about Seddique Mateen, father of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, who on Monday appeared just above Hillary Clinton's left shoulder during the broadcast of a rally. Now that both Trump and Clinton have had unsavories sitting behind them at recent rallies, they're both tainted by the same nonstory, and both might now be loath to weaponize the other's nontransgression. It would be a minor victory in this intensely stupid election if we were at least to rid ourselves of the ""controversial person is in the same camera shot as a candidate, shame on the candidate"" genre of nongaffe. There are stories to be had regarding Mateen at Clinton's rally or Foley at Trump's. After his son's shooting rampage, Seddique Mateen--who did not countenance his son's shooting, for the record!--earned a measure of notoriety with some controversial statements about gay people and the Taliban. Why does he support Hillary Clinton, one wonders. And Foley, of course, is the Republican who resigned in 2006, after it emerged he'd sent sexual emails and messages to teenage congressional pages. Why does he support Donald Trump, one wonders. As far as the campaigns go, it's worth asking them if they invited these people, intentionally placed them where they were knowing who they were, and if they disavow their support. (The Clinton campaign, for example, eventually disavowed Mateen's support.) Then there are the second-order stories. Should Mateen, with feelings still raw over what his son did and how people responded to some of his own controversial comments, show his face at such public events, this soon after the shooting? Is Foley trying to ride the Trump Train as some sort of comeback into politics? Those are interesting stories. But if the campaigns didn't invite the people, didn't purposely place them in their choice seats knowing who they were, and didn't have any meaningful relationship with them, then ... wha ... whatta we got here? Where's the scandal to which finite media resources are allocated? Consider just about every story regarding the Mateen cameo and the Foley photobomb. The words in these stories mattered little. The point was the photo or video footage. Look at the monster's father sitting there, menacingly, as Hillary Clinton discusses the expansion of some tax credit or another. Look at the pervert just over Trump's left shoulder. Enhance. Enhance! The most honest headline of this fracas was Twitchy's on Wednesday night, which noted that Foley sitting in the same camera shot as Trump was ""not a good look."" Because that's what the ""scandal,"" in either case, is: one of optics. Oh, God. ""Optics"" is the flimsiest basis for a media-driven scandal. It is a meta-justification in which media figures say, ""This is bad for the candidate because the media will declare it bad for the candidate,"" with no apparent self-awareness. It wasn't a physical-safety threat for Mateen or Foley to be seated so near the candidate, and they weren't wearing any clothes that might have been offensive to the general public watching on television--a Klan hood or something like that. These are figures who have done some bad things in their past but remain free citizens, and the campaigns had the audacity not to throw them out of camera shots and onto the curb. This is the equivalent of criticizing candidates for having a few hairs out of place or for wearing white after Labor Day. It's the sort of thing that campaigns get paranoid about only because they know the press might make an idiot fuss over them. That alone shouldn't give the media license to make an idiot fuss over them. It can be funny when campaigns, so diligent and anal-retentive about the stagecraft of their public events, err in some way or another, and in this instance it's certainly funny that Foley was discovered just as Trump was trashing Clinton for allowing Mateen in. It doesn't mean that this connotes scandal. If the father of a terrorist sits behind Clinton and gets his face on the teevee, it's still a stretch to deduce that Clinton supports terrorism. And Trump does not condone flirting with underage boys because Foley attended one of his rallies and landed a prime seat. It's not like we don't have plenty of other genuinely scandalous material to work with this year. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/donald_trump_left_his_bluster_on_this_side_of_the_border.html	"Donald Trump's brand is bluster. It's aggression. It's an outsized show of dominance. And his pitch to voters depends on that brand. Vote for me, he argues, and I'll bring my skills to the table for you. I'll take the rigged game of corrupt elites and make it work for you. I'll get deals, for you. But on Wednesday afternoon, that bluster--the outsize boasts that define Trump's public life--was gone. Flying to Mexico City, Trump joined Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for a news conference. It was an odd move for the Republican presidential nominee, whose campaign is centered on Mexican perfidy, either sub rosa or officially sanctioned. (""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best."") By standing onstage with the Mexican president, Trump opened the door to a disaster. If Pena Nieto had wanted to, he could've take action against a man despised by the vast majority of Mexicans. But the president demurred. The news conference, which followed a private meeting of the two men, was a quiet moment. Far from denouncing the Republican presidential nominee, Pena Nieto used his time to politely disagree with Trump's depiction of Mexico's border with the United States. Trump was on the same page. Reading from a prepared statement, the real estate mogul gave a sedate restatement of his campaign platform. He promised to renegotiate trade deals, reduce illegal immigration, and asserted the right to build a wall on the Mexican border should he win the White House. At no point was Trump forceful or defiant. When a journalist asked about payment for the wall, he sidestepped the issue. ""Who pays for the wall? We didn't discuss,"" Trump said. ""We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date."" Pena Nieto clarified the discussion on Twitter, telling his followers that the two had discussed the wall and that Mexico would not be paying for it. ""At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump,"" he said, ""I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall."" By the time Trump returned to Arizona, where he would give his ""major"" speech on immigration, pundits and talking heads had formed a consensus around Trump's visit. It was a success. Just standing onstage with Pena Nietro was enough to confer much-needed legitimacy on Trump, to make him look like a normal candidate with the experience and skill to perform at the highest levels of national politics. ""If you believe Trump needed to pivot, moderate and look more Presidential, that event was a home run,"" said Howard Wolfson on Twitter. But this was an extraordinarily low bar. Trump hadn't moderated. At most, he had lowered the volume, obscuring the extent to which he touted the aggressive anti-immigration and anti-immigrant policies that catapulted him to the Republican nomination. And with his speech in Phoenix, Trump emphasized the extent to which he hasn't changed. Campaign spin aside, there is no ""pivot"" and Trump hasn't softened. It's deportation now, deportation tomorrow, and deportation forever. ""There will be no amnesty,"" Trump said, shouting to a frenzied crowd of supporters. ""Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. ""We will build a great wall along the border,"" he continued. ""And Mexico will pay for the wall."" For the first time in the campaign, Trump was clear and forceful about his plans. ""According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people, criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement."" He emphasized this point with an aside: ""And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone."" Beyond those ""criminal aliens,"" Trump announced plans for immediate deportation (seemingly without due process) of any ""illegal immigrant"" who comes in contact with law enforcement, regardless of the degree of their offense or whether there's an actual offense to begin with. The severity of Trump's policies fit the tenor and tone of his speech. Trump did not read from the teleprompter so much as bark, punctuating his steamroller delivery with slashing hand gestures and red-faced anger. It wasn't just a contrast from his tranquilized performance in Mexico; it was a different Trump entirely, a more vicious Trump who seemed to have materialized for the sole purpose of repudiating his meek counterpart. The earlier Trump seemed cowed, unwilling to take his full message to the Mexican capital. This Trump didn't hesitate to tie the nation's crime and violence to illegal immigration, telling story after story of Americans killed by people who came into the country without papers. It was pure demagoguery, an attempt to build a link between violent crime and illegal immigration that doesn't exist. And it was racist. Trump's chief concern is the border with Mexico. In his rhetoric, ""illegal immigrant"" is virtually synonymous with ""Hispanic immigrant."" When he targets ""illegal immigrants"" for ""abusing our welfare system""--citing estimates from a nativist think tank--he is playing on the association. When he approvingly cites ""Operation Wetback""--a deportation program authorized under President Eisenhower--he's all but shouting it. When, at the beginning of his campaign, Trump slammed Mexico for sending ""rapists"" and ""criminals,"" he meant it. In his picture of America, illegal immigrants from Mexico--easily conflated with immigrants from Mexico, period--are a threat to American lives and national sovereignty. They murder and they steal and they abuse the system. They cannot assimilate. For Trump, there are no distinctions. Regardless of who they are, or what they do, all illegal immigrants carry the same threat. That is, if they're Hispanic. From Trump's own behavior, we know this view doesn't extend to European immigrants. For a time, his wife Melania Trump may have worked as an unauthorized immigrant. As a real estate developer, he used undocumented Eastern European workers. Likewise, his modeling agency violated immigration law by bringing European girls and women to the United States to work illegally. Once again, with his Phoenix speech, we see the extent to which Trump's is a vehicle for white nationalism. But more striking than his pandering to the worst elements of American society is the degree to which his style--angry and uncompromising--is all affect. Trump had a chance to show his mettle in the belly of the beast. And he dropped it, only to thunder anew against those same opponents once he was back on safe territory. Trump is anything but the strongman he sells onstage. Far from being America's savior, the real Donald Trump is its Nelson Muntz. Not that it matters for his supporters. Trump's followers don't care that he can't even deliver on his bluster. All that matters is that he sneers at the right people. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Back From Mexico, Trump Got on Message: Deportation Now, Deportation Tomorrow, Deportation Forever
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/donald_trump_s_support_for_immigration_restriction_is_terrible_for_the_immigration.html	"Since the start of Donald Trump's presidential campaign a little more than a year ago, I've argued to anyone who'll listen that his noxious anti-immigration rhetoric would ultimately hurt the cause of immigration restriction. Now that Trump has delivered his long-awaited address clarifying his stance on immigration, I'm even more convinced that his candidacy will be the downfall of the cause he claims to champion. To be totally clear, I have no idea if Trump's speech helped his presidential prospects or not. Over the past couple of weeks, he has made a series of contradictory, sloppily improvised statements backing away from immigration policies he's supported in the past. Now, based on the tone and content of Wednesday's speech in Phoenix, he appears to have doubled down on the hardline positions he took at the start of his campaign. Will that help him? At least one tracking poll, sponsored by USC Dornsife and the Los Angeles Times, has identified a bloc of non-college-educated voters who didn't vote in 2012 but who may well vote for Trump this time around. Refusing to budge on immigration could be the key to getting this slice of the electorate to the polls. Or maybe Trump is doomed and he's trying to build the audience for some cockamamie media venture. Who knows? Here's the thing: I don't really care about Trump's fate. I am not his butler or a child from his twelfth marriage to a model from one of Neptune's lesser-known moons. What I do care about is the future of U.S. immigration policy, and it's here where his shambolic campaign has been an utter own-goal disaster for the restrictionist coalition. No matter how many times Trump talks about how much he loves Hispanic immigrants who entered the country lawfully and how he wants to protect Latino workers, he's already poisoned the well. You either believe he's a heroic truth-teller taking on a corrupt establishment or you believe he's a racist demagogue who will, if elected, hasten the apocalypse. That's why, even on the off chance Trump wins in November, he will have made it harder for restrictionists to achieve their long-term goals. Undoing the damage Trump has done to restrictionism will take politicians as deft, measured, and thoughtful as Trump is, uh, not those things. This is despite the fact that Trump has, in roundabout fashion, embraced much of the core policy agenda backed by immigration restrictionists. I am myself sympathetic to at least some of the proposals Trump championed in his Phoenix speech, though I cringe at the thought that he might be discrediting a number of perfectly sensible ideas. For years, restrictionist wonks have acknowledged that mass deportations of the kind Trump began calling for early in his campaign are impracticable. Instead, they've mostly coalesced around a strategy called ""enforcement first"" or ""attrition through enforcement."" The basic idea here is that unauthorized immigrants come to the U.S. for access to job opportunities. Therefore, the best way to encourage them to return to their native countries is to enforce existing immigration laws that bar them from employment; to enforce labor laws, including minimum-wage laws and occupational health and safety standards, that employers of unauthorized immigrants often flout; and to encourage state and local authorities to work with, rather than against, immigration enforcement efforts. Instead of granting legal status to unauthorized immigrants before stepping up enforcement, as in the comprehensive immigration reform bills backed by President Bush and President Obama, restrictionists like Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies call for reversing that order of operations: strengthen enforcement and then, once certain benchmarks have been achieved, offer amnesty to unauthorized immigrants in exchange for future reductions in immigration. Trump danced around amnesty in his Phoenix speech. In one breath he said ""there was one route and only one route"" to legal status for unauthorized immigrants: Go back to your native country and apply like any other aspiring immigrant. But as Byron York of the Washington Examiner observed, Trump then said that once we successfully crack down on unauthorized immigration, ""we will be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain."" In other words, Trump says he's against amnesty when what he's really for is enforcement first. Is enforcement first a ""softer"" position than revving up the Donald Trump Deportation Force (uniform designs courtesy of the Ivanka Trump Collection) to round up 11 million people and boot them out of the country in two years? I mean, maybe. But the big difference here isn't between hard and soft. It's between ""a laughable notion conjured up by someone who doesn't understand basic facts about how immigration enforcement works"" and ""pretty harsh and sure to be unpopular with pro-immigration liberals but probably doable."" Trump has moved to an enforcement-first position in the worst possible way. After all this time, he's basically adopted the same line on unauthorized immigrants as Mitt Romney. The difference is that he's done it after months of graceless appeals to ethnic and racial resentment that have alienated at least half of the electorate. It's hardly surprising that at this point in 2012, Romney had a far better shot at being elected president than Trump, his support for ""self-deportation"" notwithstanding. That's one reason why I believe Trump has damaged the restrictionist cause. Had Republicans nominated a less erratic and incompetent candidate, they'd have a much better chance at achieving their legislative goals. Trump was the least likely of the major Republican presidential contenders to defeat Hillary Clinton, who has made it abundantly clear that she favors amnesty-first, immigration-increasing legislation. Not everyone agrees that Trump is bad for restrictionism. Many restrictionists--the vast majority of them, I imagine--believe Trump has both brought needed attention to their cause and established the GOP as the restrictionist party. Similarly, some immigration expansionists fear that by demonstrating that there is a large constituency for decreasing immigration levels, Trump will make Republican lawmakers more reluctant to sign on to comprehensive immigration legislation that does the opposite. Neither of these (closely related) arguments are crazy. Among advocates of immigration-increasing comprehensive reform, there is widespread recognition that Democrats can't pass such legislation without at least some political cover from the congressional GOP. That is one of the reasons why the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate that passed the fiscal stimulus, the Affordable Care Act, and Dodd-Frank during the first half of the Obama administration didn't also take the opportunity to pass sweeping immigration legislation. Had Speaker Boehner managed to persuade Democrats to go along with a comprehensive bill that fudged the question of whether unauthorized immigrants granted legal status would ever have a path to citizenship, chances are the bill would have passed and we'd be looking at a big increase in immigration levels, despite the fact that rank-and-file Republicans overwhelmingly oppose the idea. In the wake of Trump, it's hard to imagine a Speaker Ryan getting House Republicans to agree to do the same deal. (That's assuming Republicans hold the House, which is far from guaranteed.) While that sounds like a win for restrictionists, I'm still convinced Trump has hurt the cause more than he's helped. Why? To meaningfully reduce immigration levels, restrictionists need to pass enforcement-first immigration legislation. To pass enforcement-first immigration legislation, they need to win over a larger number of immigrants and second-generation Americans. To win over a larger number of immigrants and second-generation Americans, they need the face of their movement to be a human who is not Donald Trump. By contrast, all immigration expansionists need to achieve their ends is a president who supports their cause. If Clinton wins the presidency, she will of course try to revive the Gang of Eight bill. But even if a President Clinton can't pass comprehensive immigration reform, she will have broad authority to interpret existing immigration laws in new and creative ways that would drastically increase legal immigration levels. For example, she could follow President Obama in granting ""parole"" to immigrants who can't secure visas by other means. Or she could use her executive authority to change how the federal government doles out visas to the spouses and children of high-skilled workers. The list goes on. It's true that a restrictionist president could use executive authority to move in the opposite direction--for starters, a President Trump might reverse President Obama's executive orders shielding broad categories of unauthorized immigrants from deportation. But without enabling legislation, a restrictionist administration would have very limited scope to reduce immigration. And the only way to pass legislation in our system of government is to get over very high hurdles in both houses of Congress. Immigration expansionists have come close to clearing these hurdles again and again despite the fact that advocates of higher immigration levels have been outnumbered by advocates of lower levels for decades. That's because the immigration expansion coalition includes powerful, influential, and wealthy employers, and naturalized immigrants, who all have a big stake in the outcome of the immigration debate. The immigration restriction coalition has far fewer resources at its disposal. Though there are certainly many passionate restrictionists, they've been outnumbered and outgunned by immigrants and second-generation Americans who see attacks on open immigration policies as attacks on their kin--not always without reason. This would be true even if Trump managed to win the White House by the skin of his teeth, which is pretty much the only conceivable way he could best Clinton. Indeed, in the unlikely event Trump wins, you can bet there will be a huge wave of permanent residents who will become naturalized citizens just so they can metaphorically punch him in the face. One of the more consistent findings in survey research on immigration is that immigrants who've lived in the U.S. for a longer period of time have more restrictionist views than those who've been in the country for a shorter period. Similarly, native-born Americans tend to be more restrictionist on average than immigrants from the same ethnic group. Recently, Gallup found that while Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump 87 percent to 13 percent among foreign-born Hispanics, she leads Trump by a less-imposing 43 to 29 margin among U.S.-born Hispanics. The Pew Research Center has found that while Hispanics who primarily speak English are split 48-41 in favor of Clinton, those who are bilingual or who primarily speak Spanish favor Clinton by 80 percent to 11 percent. Given the rapid political rise of the native-born Hispanic population, restrictionists must do a better job of winning over Hispanic allies. In effect, restrictionists need to give people of recent immigrant origin ""permission"" to favor policies that emphasize the interests of natives and immigrants who already reside in the U.S. over those of people who want to enter the country. How exactly can restrictionists pull this off? It should go without saying that it won't be easy. But here's a tip: Don't argue that Mexico is sending the U.S. a ton of rapists and murderers. Roughly two-thirds of U.S. Hispanics have their roots in Mexico, and the Mexican-origin population has quadrupled since 1980. Furthermore, Mexico is aging rapidly and growing more affluent, and there is reason to believe Mexican immigrants will represent a declining share of immigrants to the U.S. overall, whether authorized or unauthorized. There is no question Mexico has not always been an ideal partner when it comes to controlling our southern border. In his 2007 book Ex Mex, Jorge Castaneda, the former Mexican foreign minister, suggests there is far more the Mexican government could do to curb unauthorized immigration to the U.S. if it chose to do so. But demonizing Mexico and Mexican immigrants is literally the dumbest thing you could possibly do if you want to build a successful restrictionist coalition. So of course Donald Trump has spent the better part of the last year doing just that. Not everyone will see the fact that Trump has set back restrictionism as a tragedy. Do you believe we ought to welcome more immigrants of all skill levels? Then as hurtful or rage-inducing as you might find Trump's immigrant-bashing, you can take some small comfort in the fact that his emergence as the face of the restrictionist movement will help your cause. Henceforth, whenever anyone suggests we ought to strengthen border enforcement or reduce less-skilled immigration, you can accuse them of warmed-over Trumpism and there's a decent chance the accusation will stick. The flip side is that if you believe that in an age of globalization, automation, and high levels of domestic inequality, the U.S. ought to adopt a more modest and selective immigration policy, well, I have bad news for you. Whether or not you agree with every harebrained utterance that issues forth from Donald Trump's mouth, you will have to answer for his toxic mix of ignorance, arrogance, and lazy bigotry for years to come.

His feuding with the Bush family and the pointed nonendorsements from Ted Cruz and Mitt Romney brought about a contentious convention that sent Trump into a general election campaign without the full support of his party. From this perspective, Trump's position resembles that of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George McGovern in 1972, two ideologically extreme candidates--Goldwater on the right and McGovern on the left--who were handicapped by strong opposition within their parties, limped through their campaigns, and got destroyed by over 20 percentage points in the general election. To add to the analogy, these candidates' opponents--Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon--were, like Hillary Clinton, viewed by many voters as cynical, calculating politicians rather than inspiring leaders. Those two years, 1964 and 1972, still stand as cautionary lessons about the fate of any fringe candidate who manages to grab the presidential nomination without having secured the backing of his party's establishment. But Donald Trump seems to be defying political gravity. Unlike Goldwater and McGovern, who left their conventions 20 or more points down in the polls and never recovered, Trump is within striking distance of Clinton, down about 7 points in the latest polls--and all this despite the tepid support and in some cases outright opposition of his party's leading figures. What is happening? There are several ways that the politics of 2016 are not like 1964 or 1972. The first is political polarization. The liberal and moderate Republicans who would not vote for a warmongering Goldwater in 1964 and the ""Nixon Democrats"" who could not support McGovern in 1972 are no longer numerous. As many scholars have found using analyses of data from surveys, elections, and congressional voting records, the parties have become more polarized over the past few decades, and cross-party voting has declined. A second way that this election is different is that Trump, though far from the Republican establishment in many ways, is not ideologically extreme. If extremism were based on ideological and issue positions, its standard-bearer this cycle would've been Ted Cruz, not Donald Trump. Trump's candidacy is similar to Goldwater's or McGovern's in being an insurgency, but unlike their campaigns, it is not ideologically distinct from those of other candidates in his party. But the biggest difference between 2016 and 1964/1972 has nothing to do with the candidates or the conventions or ideology or endorsements or the fracturing of political parties. It turns out that, according to many years of research from political scientists, the most important determinants of presidential elections in the past half-century or more have not been the character or political ideology of candidates, or even the strengths of their parties, but rather the state of the economy. To emphasize the key role of the economy in setting the stage for presidential elections is not to be an economic determinist. Regression models predicting the election outcome from the economy have large error terms. But the economics-based forecast is a good starting point. It's easy for journalists to focus on political jockeying because it changes from day to day; the economy is a big factor that is just sitting there, not making news every day but setting the baseline for the election. For example, Douglas Hibbs' ""Bread and Peace"" model predicts the popular vote in presidential elections given economic growth and military fatalities (with the latter accounting for the 1952 and 1968 elections, in which incumbent-party candidates lost despite running in strong economies). And here's what was special about 1964 and 1972: These were two of the three strongest years for the economy in the postwar era, with per-capita income growth in the 4 percent range, and the candidates running for re-election--Johnson and Nixon--won in landslides, as would be predicted. (The other strong election year in terms of economic growth was 1984, when Ronald Reagan reaped the electoral benefit.) But 2016 is not like 1964 or 1972. The economy is slowly recovering, no longer in recession, but it is certainly not booming as in those earlier years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, per-capita personal income has been growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent during the past year and 1.2 percent averaged over the past four years. These numbers are OK but not stunning and do not foretell an electoral landslide, in either direction. Going by economic indicators, we're looking at a close election, perhaps slightly favoring the incumbent party's candidate, depending on how strongly one weights the most recent economic performance. Trump, in affect and approach, may well be an outlier; the economy in 2016 is not. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Trump-Clinton Probably Won't Be a Landslide. The Economy Says So.

This of course far surpasses Louis Brandeis' wait for a Supreme Court Senate hearing in 1916, but because Judge Garland has spent his summer waiting patiently for a hearing--as opposed to, say, sexting women or urinating on public structures--you may not have seen his name in the news as much as you should have. The continuing Garland news blockade warrants a publicity stunt worthy of a hot August afternoon, and at Slate we think we've got it: Judge Garland deserves a hearing and vote, yes, but barring all that he also deserves a personalized Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor. So we are asking readers to come up with a Ben & Jerry's specialty ice cream suggestion that combines the nothingness of the Senate's conduct, the abstract incomprehensibility of the judicial confirmation process, and the utterly unworkable given name that is Merrick Garland. The idea here is that if we can make Garland a household name--or even a freezer-section name--we could maybe still get him a vote in September. And here's a scoop: This week Sen. Chuck Grassley, who has been promising for months that there will be no hearings for the vacant seat until the next president is seated, seems to be softening on that vow and willing to be persuaded on a lame-duck hearing. Meaning that now, more than ever, is the moment to gin up some public attention for the invisible nominee. I threw this open to my Facebook universe yesterday morning and received some pretty strong initial entries. More than one wag went with variations on the simple ""Rocky Road"" (including ""Blocky Road"" and ""Rocky Middle of the Road"") and left it at that. There were also a good many snarky suggestions that Ben & Jerry's could just go with ""Plain Vanilla"" on this one, or the slightly more descriptive ""Vanilla on Ice."" A shoutout to some of the highbrow suggestions that included: ""Nom-Nom-Nom-Nominee"" and ""Januberry Surprise.""

Other creditable efforts include ""Fili-custard"" and ""Pure Applesauce,"" a Scalia tribute. Strong work on ""Unfilled Chair-ey"" and ""Merrick-ocracy,"" as well as ""Barack's Quart-Packing Scheme"" and ""Blockberry Swirl."" I personally liked ""Zero Fudge to Give"" as well as ""No Justice, No Peach,"" which was not only a strong contender but also won the unqualified support of Ben & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen who sent in his vote via emailed haiku:"	It's Confirmed: Merrick Garland Needs His Own Ice Cream Flavor.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/donald_trump_useful_idiot.html	"Donald Trump says he'll protect America by keeping bad people out. In a TV ad, he paints a grim picture of a Hillary Clinton presidency: ""Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay. ... Our border open."" If Trump wins, the ad promises a better future: ""America is secure. Terrorists and dangerous criminals kept out. The border secured. Our families safe."" It's natural to think of safety this way, especially when you're a small child. You're safe in your home with Mom and Dad. The bad guys are outside. Lock the door. But as you grow up, you learn that bad things can happen within. You can accidentally start a fire. Your parents can get cancer. Someone in your family can get hooked on alcohol or drugs. The same thing happens in countries. Threats from abroad are usually obvious. Threats from within aren't. Trump has never absorbed this lesson. He ignores the fact that native-born Americans are, if anything, more likely to commit crimes than immigrants are. He fixates on the possibility of ISIS operatives in the refugee population, failing to grapple with the more serious problem of ISIS-inspired attacks by native-born Americans. He demands ""extreme vetting"" of Muslims to protect the Constitution, obscuring the greater threat that he, as president, would pose to civil liberties. The peril to our way of life isn't coming from Mexico or Syria. It's coming from Trump. Trump isn't wrong to worry about ISIS operatives posing as refugees. That has happened in Europe. Two months ago, CIA Director John Brennan warned Congress that ISIS ""is probably exploring a variety of means for infiltrating operatives into the West, including refugee flows."" But conservatives who quote that line ignore Brennan's next two sentences. ""As we have seen in Orlando, San Bernardino, and elsewhere, ISIL is attempting to inspire attacks by sympathizers,"" Brennan pointed out. He noted that in May, ""a senior ISIL figure publicly urged the group's followers to conduct attacks in their home countries."" This is the principal threat from ISIS: not that its operatives will sneak into the United States, but that through the internet, they'll radicalize and trigger attacks by Americans who are already here. That's one conclusion of an analysis published in December by George Washington University's Program on Extremism. Brennan was referring to a May 21 message to ISIS sympathizers from the group's spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani: ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them. If one of you wishes and strives to reach the lands of the Islamic State, then each of us wishes to be in your place to make examples of the crusaders."" Trump's only answer to this problem is to complain that the parents of native-born American Muslims such as the Orlando, Florida, and San Bernardino, California, shooters shouldn't have been allowed into this country. He offers no solution. He has no plan to deal with the channel through which ISIS arms its American sympathizers: easy access to guns.

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/how_hillary_clinton_s_alt_right_speech_isolated_and_destroyed_donald_trump.html	"Hillary Clinton used to have a reputation for being more ruthless than her husband. Bill Clinton was often described as fundamentally conflict-averse, more eager to persuade his opponents than attack them. Hillary, by contrast, was known for identifying villains and going after them. In his book, A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Carl Bernstein quotes former Clinton adviser Dick Morris saying that Hillary had ""a quality of aggressiveness and strength about her that he doesn't have. A killer instinct. Her genre of advocacy is always straight ahead--fight, battle, take the fight to the other side."" (Morris was speaking before he turned on the Clintons.) This Manichean quality was at work in some of the incidents from Hillary's history that most disgust progressives. As first lady of Arkansas, she succeeded in pushing school reform by demonizing teachers. Bernstein quotes Bill Clinton's former campaign chair: ""She made it very clear that there had to be a bad guy in this."" At the same time, her strong sense of who her enemies are is the reason she was able to clearly apprehend the ""vast right-wing conspiracy""--her coinage--that bedeviled her husband's administration. We hadn't seen this Hillary in a while. She stayed under wraps during the Democratic primary, never seriously going after Bernie Sanders. But the killer in Hillary came out on Thursday, delivering a devastating indictment of Donald Trump's associations with the far-right fringe, one meant to permanently delegitimize him among decent people. ""A man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the internet, should never run our government or command our military,"" she said, daring Republican officials to disagree. With Trump already trailing badly in most polls, Clinton could have tried to yoke him to the Republican Party so he would drag it down with him. Instead, she sought to isolate and personally destroy him. First came her campaign's Twitter video earlier today about Trump's white-supremacist admirers. Usually, a politician trying to link her opponent to the KKK would come dangerously close to the Godwin's Law line, but Clinton appears to have calculated that few Republicans would rally to their nominee's defense. Her speech, in Reno, further painted Trump as a creature from the fever swamps, one who has nothing to do with legitimate conservatism. It was able to briskly explain some of the crazier figures and theories Trump has associated with, without getting bogged down in obscure detail. Her list of Breitbart headlines, including ""Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy"" and ""Gabby Giffords: The Gun Control Movement's Human Shield,"" tells you much of what you need to know about Trump's new campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, the former head of the site. Clinton invoked Paul Ryan twice, but both times it was in order to distance him from Trump. She made it seem as if Republicans have a history of anti-racism: ""Twenty years ago, when Bob Dole accepted the Republican nomination, he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the party to get out,"" Clinton said. ""The week after 9/11, George W. Bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that Muslims 'love America just as much as I do.' ... We need that kind of leadership again."" This story is, at best, incomplete. It leaves out Richard Nixon's Southern strategy and Ronald Reagan's dog-whistle rhetoric about ""strapping young bucks"" buying T-bone steaks with food stamps. In some ways Trump is a freakish deviation from normal conservatism, but in others he represents the movement's blustery culmination. It makes sense, however, for Clinton to paint Trump as a bizarre aberration, since it puts more pressure on Republicans to reject him. After all, everything she said in her speech was true. It's simply that no one has put it all together before quite so skillfully. Trump's outrages come so relentlessly that they're hard to keep track of, and eventually, one becomes numb to them. To follow Trump closely is to live in a miasma of cynical incredulity. Clinton's speechwriters found a way to cut through it with just the right examples. They reminded us how bonkers it is that Trump praised arch-conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who, as Clinton said, claimed that ""the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there."" The speech brought us back to June, when Trump claimed the federal judge presiding over the Trump University lawsuit couldn't properly do his job because his parents came from Mexico. It recalled Trump's birtherism and his weird attempt to tie Ted Cruz's father to the assassination of JFK, and reminded us that none of this is normal for a presidential candidate, no matter how debased the Republican Party has become. It's hard to say how Republican officials will respond. Most of them hate the alt-right, which denigrates them as pathetic cuckservatives. But Clinton succeeded in tying Trump to the alt-right in a way that will make it hard to disavow one without the other. Trump, meanwhile, will be tempted to lash out, lest it look as if he'd been intimidated by a woman he derides as weak and frail. His response, so far, was to tweet: ""Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!"" In fact, the speech could have been twice as long; there's enough material. But it was long enough to define Trump and his most fervent followers as people beyond the pale of American politics.

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/donald_trump_just_helped_ted_cruz_bigly.html	"Donald Trump is about halfway through his new pivot from using mostly harsh-sounding adjectives about immigrants to using nicer-sounding adjectives about immigrants, and reactions on the right are mixed. Best-selling racist author Ann Coulter is disappointed but hasn't disembarked the Trump Train just yet, openly comparing her devotion to Trump to how ""the people of North Korea worship their Dear Leader."" Other immigration hard-liners are hoping that the so-called ""softening"" is just a hiccup, a brief concession to the consultant class, from which Trump will un-pivot soon enough. Meanwhile, there's a strong waft of I-told-you-so coming from the conservative movement's Never Trump wing. National Review's Jonah Goldberg is up with a post saying, ""Jeb Called It,"" quoting the felled Bush's post-campaign interview with NBC News' Nicolle Wallace during which he said that nothing Trump promised hard-liners is going to come to fruition. And Politico reports that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's former presidential campaign backers ""are quick to characterize Trump's emerging position as amnesty."" Rick Tyler, former communications director for Cruz, says that ""from what I have seen, [Trump] is now the pro-amnesty candidate."" He added that ""[if] Trump is insistent on reversing himself on amnesty, then he will have fooled his entire base."" Amanda Carpenter, the CNN commentator who previously worked in Cruz's Senate office, noted that ""everything Trump promises comes with an expiration date."" Again, tol-ja-so was a big theme here. ""We knew it during the primary, and now it is apparent he has duped his most loyal supporters on the issue they care about most, immigration,"" Carpenter said. ""Don't say we didn't warn them."" Cruz and his allies did previously argue that Trump's hard-line immigration rhetoric was something he'd abandon after the primaries. Not even after the primary, really. Cruz himself was saying during the primary that Trump was soft on immigration because he supported so-called ""touchback"" amnesty for undocumented immigrants--the idea that some of the ""good ones,"" as Trump likes to call them, would return to their home countries as a formality before being admitted back through the Trump Wall's""big, beautiful door."" Trump is a unique Republican presidential candidate in many ways, but his tonal moderation on immigration issues during the general election is not one of them. The I-told-you-so aspect of the campaign isn't even very new here. In 2012 Mitt Romney, who encouraged ""self-deportation"" and exploited gaps in the immigration policy records of Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich to crush them during the primary, tried to ""soften"" his posture as soon as the nomination was relatively secure. Sen. John McCain, in 2008, was compelled to dial back his support for immigration reform during the primary; by May of that year he was right back on it. Whoever won the 2016 GOP primary would be ""softening"" by now--two or three months ago, really--because it's obvious politics. Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, or any of the other alternative-reality GOP presidential nominees would probably personally be handing out green cards on the southern border at this point. But not Ted Cruz, we're led to believe. His people are spinning Trump's shift as a confirmation of their own, risible theory throughout the primary that Republicans are best served electorally by a nominee who stands by his base-pleasing primary rhetoric. ""It's a mistake by the Trump campaign; it seems to be this attitude that the way to win a presidential campaign is to follow the playbook the Republicans enacted over the last few cycles: move to the middle during the general election,"" Chris Wilson, the Cruz campaign's former director of research, analytics and digital strategy, told Politico. ""It's not the campaign Ted Cruz would have run. It's why we said from the very beginning, to win a general election, we need to nominate a conservative."" This is all part of Cruz's positioning for 2020 in the eventuality that Trump loses. If/when Trump loses, it will be, above all else, because he is visibly unqualified, at a level we've never seen, to be president of the United States. Lagging well behind that, but in a safe second, will be his hard-line immigration rhetoric, which alienated the nation's fastest-growing demographic more than anyone else in Republican politics ever had. It's doubtful that Trump's pivot to friendlier adjectives will make a difference one way or another: Those he's turned off will remain turned off, and his working-class white, male base will probably excuse him for this ostensible betrayal. But if he's going to try moving in a direction to improve his chances, this is the right direction. Team Cruz's response shows what a missed opportunity the 2016 election will be for the Republican Party to at least answer a useful question, and how familiarly tiresome the 2020 primaries will be as a result. When the race came down to Trump versus Cruz, the thinking among establishment Republicans was that even if they despised Cruz, his nomination would give conservatives' a chance to test their beloved theory: If only we nominated a real conservative instead of a mushy moderate, we would've won the general election. If it failed, which it probably would have, then that would be the end of that; if Cruz won, fine! Instead, with Trump, Republicans will be placing on the November ballot this weird referendum over celebrity-sponsored white nationalism that punts the conservative movement question to another election. Also, now Cruz and other hard-line conservatives get to say the party nominated another squishy moderate. The main effect of Trump's desperate, too-late nod toward treating certain undocumented immigrants like humans will be felt in four years, when Cruz, and whichever other candidates the conservative movement tosses up, use it to explain that Trump lost because he went all RINO in the general election. The real reason he will have lost is that he went total-jackass in the primary and the general, and was unqualified throughout. But now that's not what the Republican Party will be forced to contend with come the next presidential election. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Donald Trump Just Helped Ted Cruz Bigly
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/there_is_no_clinton_trump_horse_race.html	"To anyone not following the ins and outs of the election, the contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton has all the trappings of a close-fought, competitive election. Both candidates dominate the news media; both have held massive rallies and events; both are on the airwaves with ads on television and radio; and both are maneuvering on the ground in an effort to reach broad and diverse constituencies. Turn to CNN or MSNBC, and you'll see breathless coverage of each development in the race, reinforcing the sense that this a tight contest between two formidable campaigns--one horse hitting the quarter pole half a length ahead of the other. But of course it's nothing like that. Hillary Clinton isn't just leading--she's dominant. And her odds of winning get stronger each day she holds that dominant position. Take the polling averages, which aggregate public polls to provide a comprehensive view of the race, with various weights and adjustments for methodology. As of Wednesday, Clinton leads in the Talking Points Memo average by a margin of 3.3 percentage points; according to the Real Clear Politics method for averaging polls, she leads by a margin of 6 points. And in the Huffington Post's average of national public polls, she leads by 7 points. A 3-point margin is within the realm of a typical, close contest. But in modern presidential elections--where parties vie for votes in a hyperpolarized electorate--6 or 7 points is something close to a landslide, comparable to Barack Obama's win over John McCain in the 2008 race. More critical than the size of the lead is its place on the calendar. Polls are at their least predictive in the first half of an election year, before the national conventions. It's a volatile time, as candidates compete in primaries and parties struggle for a semblance of unity. The conventions act as a reset button, a way to restore that unity and present the parties and their nominees to the public at large. And it's after the conventions that polls become far more predictive, as the volatility of the primary season dies down and pollsters begin to screen for likely voters. ""Although the convention season is the time for multiple bounces in the polls, one party ends up with an advantage when the dust clears,"" write political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien in their book The Timeline of Presidential Elections. ""This gain is a net convention bump rather than a bounce."" The polls we see after the conventions, in other words, tend to reflect a genuine change in the state of the race. And that change is durable. In their analysis of presidential polling, going back to 1952, the candidate leading at this stage of the race always won the popular vote. The margin might differ, but the outcome was on target. It's why the various polling models from FiveThirtyEight, the New York Times, and the Princeton Election Consortium all give Clinton a high likelihood of winning in November, from 85 percent in the FiveThirtyEight polls-only forecast, to 89 percent in the Times calculator, to 96 percent in the Princeton measure of the race.* In other words, Clinton's odds of losing this election amount to the general chance of an unimaginable black-swan event that transforms the political landscape. If you think there's a 10 percent chance that the American economy collapses before November, then that is roughly the chance that Donald Trump wins this election. On top of all of this is the fact that one side is running a campaign, and the other side isn't. Hillary Clinton is raising and spending hundreds of millions of dollars on ads (saturating swing states in television spots aimed at disqualifying Trump), organizing, and ""get out the vote"" efforts. She has hundreds more employees than Trump and far more offices in far more states, including traditionally Republican territory like Georgia and Utah. Trump has none of this: no infrastructure to find and mobilize supporters, an anemic budget for advertising, and little staff to manage volunteers. He is so thinly staffed that for a moment it seemed plausible that Trump's main organizer in a key Colorado county was a 12-year-old boy. For Trump, a stronger organization would not be enough to overcome his deficit. But it would minimize the size of the loss. That he's so outmatched on the ground bodes poorly for how he'll perform when the voting starts. Unlike Clinton, he won't ""bank"" early votes and absentee votes from supporters who could cast them, freeing resources for more marginal voters. He won't have people to mobilize the least enthusiastic Republicans and bring them to the polls. And he won't have resources to counter Democratic efforts to demoralize Republican voters through advertising and targeted appeals. At the same time, he's wasting the resources he has by spending them in deep-red states like Mississippi and deep-blue ones like New York. If states like Arizona, Georgia, Missouri, and South Carolina are on the edge--thanks to overwhelming nonwhite support for Clinton, third-party candidates, and profound ambivalence for Trump among Republicans--then his weakness and her strength increase the chances those states flip away from the Republican Party. Of course, if we're at the point where South Carolina--one of the most conservative states in the union--is vulnerable to a Democratic campaign, then the election is already too far gone for the Republican Party. And there's little chance that Democrats will lose their lead to complacency. If there's a bandwagon effect in politics, it's for winners. In presidential elections, at least, voters seem to want to cast a ballot for the winner. It's the losing ""side"" that stays home. There is no horse race here. Clinton is far enough ahead, at a late enough stage in the election, that what we have is a horse running by itself, unperturbed but for the faint possibility of a comet hitting the track. Place your bets accordingly.

A Trump who wanted to reach black voters would speak to black churches, black colleges, and organizations like the NAACP or the Urban League. The actual Trump, instead, has made his pitch to lily-white audiences in towns and neighborhoods with few black residents. And for good reason. Trump is never going to win more than a token percentage of black voters. If he wants the White House, he'll need to persuade as many white voters as possible, and a visible commitment to diversity is one way to win over a certain class of right-leaning, suburban whites. Or at least, that's my theory. And it fits the history of modern Republican presidential campaigns, where visible overtures to black voters were part of the process, from Richard Nixon in 1968 to George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. But there's a problem. In the past 24 hours, Trump's message to blacks has gone from unusual--""you have nothing to lose""--to something on the border of racist. Listen to what the Republican nominee had to say to an almost all-white audience in Akron, Ohio, on Monday evening. ""Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing. No homes. No ownership. Crime at levels nobody has seen,"" said Trump, painting a dystopian picture of black life for rallygoers. ""You can go to war zones in countries that we're fighting and it's safer than living in some of our inner cities. They're run by the Democrats."" Trump continued. ""Look, it is a disaster the way African Americans are living,"" he said, erroneously suggesting that most black Americans live in inner cities. ""We'll get rid of the crime. You'll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Right now, you walk down the street, you get shot."" As big a problem as violent crime is in the nation's most segregated and impoverished communities, the world Trump describes doesn't exist for the vast majority of black Americans in 2016. For them, as for most Americans, crime is at historic lows, and cities are safer than they've ever been. Despite this, Trump seems to envision an America where all blacks live in cities that are one part the Detroit riots of 1967, one part the Los Angeles riots of 1992, and one part John Carpenter's Escape From New York.* Which is all to say that Trump has taken his earlier appeal to black voters--or rather, his appeal to whites vis-a-vis blacks--and pushed it in a lurid and fantastical direction. In Akron, Trump didn't describe life for black Americans as much as he described a white supremacist fantasy in which blacks live miserable, brutish, and nearly subhuman lives in cities dominated by feckless Democrats. And he punctuated that fantasy with a call to vigilance for his audience, asking them to watch out for ""fraud"" in those same neighborhoods. ""You've gotta get every one of your friends,"" Trump said. ""You've gotta get every one of your family. You've gotta get everybody to go out and watch and go out and vote. And when I say watch, you know what I'm talking about, right? You know what I'm talking about. I think you gotta go out and you gotta watch."" That Trump is referencing black communities is made evident by the fact that he first debuted this language after warning of voter fraud in the largely black precincts of inner-city Philadelphia. After the rally in Akron, in an interview with Bill O'Reilly, he elaborated on this rhetoric, with a promise to reduce crime by letting ""tough"" police take charge. ""I know police in Chicago,"" Trump said. ""If they were given the authority to do it, they would get it done."" Trump didn't specify ""it,"" but it's worth noting that last year, Chicago created a reparations fund for surviving victims of torture carried out by the city police. None of this counts as ""outreach"" to black voters. But it also goes beyond traditional coded appeals to conservative whites. It sounds less like rhetoric from a Republican presidential nominee--or at least, rhetoric used in public--and more like a headline at Breitbart or other white nationalist forums and websites, where racist fearmongering is the norm and where black Americans and their communities are often portrayed in sensational and offensive ways. We're a news cycle or two from Trump invoking the knockout game. There's no question that he wants to win over white suburban voters--he needs them to have any chance of winning the Oval Office. But Trump is ignorant and undisciplined, with aides and advisers who swim in the shallow waters of nativism and white nationalism. His attempt to reach a different tranche of white voters through performative empathy for black voters has become, it seems, an outright appeal to his most racist and reactionary supporters. Those are the voters you reach with sensationalist descriptions of poor black neighborhoods, tirades against voter ""fraud,"" and calls for ""tough"" policing of black communities. That Trump has moved closer to anti-black rhetoric--an addition to his still-regular tirades against Mexico and Muslims--only underscores the extent to which his campaign is a vehicle for a resurgent and newly confident movement of white nationalists, whose influence on the Trump campaign is visible and unmistakable. And given the degree to which Trump has integrated these figures into his campaign, it was only a matter of time before black Americans were the target of his racist characterizations. At this stage of the election, polls are predictive. Barring the unforeseen or the catastrophic, Hillary Clinton will walk away from Nov. 8 with the presidency. But that leaves us with weeks of activity, and between now and then, there's a strong chance--a guarantee, almost--that Trump will go further down this white nationalist rabbit hole, surfacing the worst of American life in the process.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/donald_trump_doesn_t_have_an_immigration_policy.html	"It is more than a little funny to watch the political world try to suss out Donald Trump's allegedly new immigration policy, as though there is, was, or ever will be such a thing. Trump is not familiar with immigration policy, because he's not familiar with any policy. Building ""the wall"" is not a policy. It is a project. The wall is a wall. There are people who have written white papers for him. If he has read them, then I'm the Brookings Institution. Writing in Slate about Trump's foreign policy speech last week, Isaac Chotiner argued that Trump doesn't have foreign policy ideas; he just has foreign policy moods. ""Trump's policies may loosely cohere into some sort of familiar ideology,"" Chotiner wrote, ""but his campaign and his ideas all basically exist within his head."" Few ideas exist in his head, either. He doesn't even have a whole lot of nouns at his disposal. His head is mostly descriptors, adverbs and adjectives, up to a second-grade level. Someone--an interviewer, a staffer--tees up a noun for him, he assigns descriptors to it, and then the poor pundits try to determine where his descriptions of nouns in the news land on the recognizable political spectrum. Some staffer gets to him and says, Hey, polls are bad. Time for a new adjective. The cycle repeats. Throughout all of this, 14 months and counting, the candidate has had absolutely no idea what he is talking about. This applies to foreign policy, immigration, tax cuts, nuclear weapons, Morning Joe, whatever. ""After spending a few days reflecting on his immigration stances and consulting with Hispanic supporters,"" goes the lede of the Washington Post's story on Tuesday, ""Donald Trump on Monday detailed how he would deal with the millions of immigrants illegally living in the United States: Enforce laws that are already on the books and continue to do what President Obama is doing, although 'perhaps with a lot more energy.' "" It's quite something that Trump still believes he's at war with the Post after an exceedingly generous framing like that. Maybe it was meant tongue-in-cheek. If so, bravo. Because the contrast here between buildup and payoff is hilarious. Trump spent ""a few days"" both ""reflecting"" and ""consulting with Hispanic supporters"" about supposed ""immigration stances,"" and after this scrupulous, comprehensive policy canvassing, finally ""detailed""--this is the best word!--""how he would deal with the millions of immigrants illegally living in the United States."" This ""detailed"" plan is just maintaining the status quo (as he views it), ""perhaps with a lot more energy."" His plan, as ""detailed,"" is an adverbial clause. Well, maybe that's not fair. He detailed his detailed plan with further details as his detailed discussion with Bill O'Reilly continued Monday night. Of the millions of undocumented immigrants who are here, Trump explained, there are two subgroups: the ""bad ones"" and ""everybody else."" He has used these subgroups before. About this time last year his attitude was that the ""bad ones"" and ""everybody else"" would all have to go, but maybe some of the ""good ones""--interchangeable for the most part with ""everybody else""--could come back in later. That seems to be roughly the same attitude he holds now, but with tweaks to the descriptors. The ""bad ones"" will be deported ""so fast your head will spin,"" a metaphor about velocity that only dupes would describe as a policy position. The ""good ones,"" meanwhile, will have the luxury of dealing with something resembling a legal process, though ""perhaps with a lot more energy."" If the intensive reflection, consultation, and analysis that took place before Trump's O'Reilly interview achieved anything, it was to stretch existing adjectives and adverbs into these multiword descriptors. On Sunday morning, Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, went on CNN's State of the Union to clarify what he might have said or not said the previous day during a closed-door meeting with Hispanic supporters. ""It's that we need a, quote, fair and humane way of dealing with what is estimated to be about 11 million illegal immigrants in this country,"" she said. Fair, humane. On Monday morning's Fox and Friends, Trump described his plan thusly: ""We want to come up with a really fair but firm answer. It has to be very firm. But we want to come up with something fair."" Really fair. Firm. Very firm. Also, too, fair. The remark from the O'Reilly interview that's getting the most attention is his invocation of Obama's immigration policies: ""What people don't know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country."" Tremendous. The number of undocumented immigrants that Obama ""got ... out of the country"" is far too large for immigration doves and far too modest for immigration hawks. Donald Trump does not know what those policies are. What happened, most likely, was that someone showed Trump a six- or seven-figure number and he thought, ""Firm,"" but he can't outright praise Obama's work on immigration, so he said ""perhaps with a lot more energy,"" but he also wants to exude a sense of sunniness, so he said ""fair."" Donald Trump doesn't know President Obama's immigration policy--the things he is doing, the legislation he sought to pass, or the executive orders either in place or mothballed in federal court. He doesn't know Obama's immigration policy because he doesn't know immigration policy, and he doesn't know immigration policy because he doesn't know policy. There are no ""shifts"" in policy, because there is no policy, and there are no details of something that doesn't exist. At some point later this month, Trump is expected to deliver another (already delayed) ""major immigration speech"" outlining his fair, firm, very firm, but fair policies for the good ones--fairer--and the bad ones--like now, but perhaps with more energy. The scrap of paper on which these policies are written will last about as long as it takes him to hear a fetching new adjective. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/08/how_the_democrats_are_failing_obamacare.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. On May 20, about a month after UnitedHealthcare, one of the country's major health insurers, announced that it would pull out of Arizona's exchanges, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick wrote a letter asking for help. It was addressed to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, and in her note Kirkpatrick, who had lost her seat in the Tea Party putsch of 2010 in no small part because of her vote in favor of health care reform, related her concern about the wobblier parts of Obamacare. ""I represent a sprawling, mostly rural district in Arizona,"" wrote Kirkpatrick, the Democratic challenger for Sen. John McCain's seat this November. ""In several counties, United Healthcare is one of only two health insurance carriers selling marketplace plans."" After noting that the Affordable Care Act has ""significantly dropped the uninsured rate in Arizona,"" she addressed the problems it's still facing. ""[W]hat can we do to incentivize insurers to continue participation in the marketplace?"" she asked. ""How can we ensure that the people in these rural counties have sufficient choices in health care plans?"" The news in Arizona has only worsened since then. Blue Cross Blue Shield, which had been the only carrier submitting 2017 insurance plans for all of Arizona's counties--at an average requested premium increase of 64.9 percent--pulled its options for Maricopa County, by far the state's most populous, and the more rural Pinal County to its south, citing $185 million in losses in the state over two years. And last Monday, Aetna, another of the country's largest carriers, withdrew from markets in 11 of 15 states, including Arizona. Aetna, suddenly bearish on the sustainability of the exchanges where it had recently been so bullish, made the announcement not long after the Justice Department had challenged its merger with the carrier Humana. The timing of the move is now under major scrutiny. Whatever hardball tactics Aetna may or may not have been employing don't change the fact that it was losing hundreds of millions of dollars on the exchanges (on a market cap of some $42 billion) and was seeking consolidation as a remedy. With Aetna and UnitedHealthcare out of the picture and Blue Cross paring back, the competition in much of Arizona, particularly its rural areas, will be sparse or nonexistent in 2017. And unless Blue Cross, sniffing out a monopolistic business opportunity, decides to re-enter, Pinal County will have no insurers offering plans on its exchanges. Is Obamacare working? The question assumes a single national program. ""There are, in some ways, 3,000 different ACAs playing out across the country, because it's playing out very differently county by county,"" said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Some carriers, especially in denser areas, are able to broaden their risk pools and participate in flourishing exchanges, and some, usually the less brand-name ones that offer narrow-network plans at cheap cost, are making profits. Some 12.7 million people signed up for coverage through health exchanges in the 2016 open enrollment period, with many millions more covered under the law's Medicaid expansion. But it's becoming clearer that the Affordable Care Act, for all its advances, is due for the sort of legislative maintenance that most major laws require after implementation. Two temporary federal programs, reinsurance and risk corridors, designed to cushion losses for insurers as they determined sustainable premium price points in new markets, expire in 2017 as the exchanges enter their fourth year of operation. Carriers serving sicker-than-expected pools or rural areas find that their options are either to sharply increase premiums or to leave the exchanges altogether. Average premium increase requests from insurers on the individual exchanges are well into the double digits across much of the country. And a Kaiser estimate in May projected the number of counties that could have a single exchange insurer in 2017 to be 664--70 percent of which are mostly rural--up from 225 in 2016. That number will increase following Aetna's withdrawal and could reach roughly a quarter of all counties in the country. Alabama, Alaska, South Carolina, and Wyoming are set to have just one insurer offering coverage on their exchanges in 2017. Most of North Carolina, except for the Raleigh metropolitan region, will be down to one insurer as well. One problem with legislative redress for Obamacare is that the legislators who are supposed to do the redressing seem less than eager to return to the front where not long ago they'd declared victory. The second problem is that, once again, the fight will almost certainly involve the public option. You remember the public option, don't you? It's exhausting just to recall the debate. Despite the virtues of a government-offered health care plan that, with lower administrative costs, no profit expectations, and the bargaining power of the federal government, would compete aggressively alongside private plans, the debate over it was the scene of much garment-rending and commie-punching last time around. The public option's ultimate exclusion from the ACA remains, at least in some flawed tellings, the biggest knife President Obama ever stuck in the back of the left. But now both Obama and Hillary Clinton have come out in support of a public option, and the Democratic caucus is not what it was in 2010. ""The book was really closed on health care reform issues since Obamacare passed,"" said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. The progressive pressure group, Green said, is considering a ""big campaign on [the public option] very soon"" and released a statement following Aetna's announcement stressing the need for a public option. Obama and Clinton's support for the issue, he said, reopened the book. ""To have the two biggest figures in the Democratic Party calling for it and a clear villain""--Aetna--""the stars are aligned for a big campaign now."" But are the Democrats ready? The ACA is undoubtedly a mixed bag, and mixed bags always make for terrible political discourse. Republicans wield each and every suboptimal data point about the Affordable Care Act's implementation as concrete proof that the law has failed and must be repealed in full if the republic is to survive, but they offer no replacement plan that comes anywhere close to meeting the ACA's coverage figures. In the meantime, they refuse to be party to any legislative improvements that might shore up the program and help their rural constituents. Many Democrats, meanwhile, are content to hide behind Republican incoherence and nefariousness instead of confronting the shortcomings of their signature legislative achievement. When I spoke with Kirkpatrick in late June and asked what specific policy changes she would propose to prop up the exchanges, she couldn't name any off the top of her head--though she did point to the letter to demonstrate that she was asking HHS for advisement. Instead she gave me the usual anecdotes about people she's met whose lives were saved by the coverage they received under the ACA, and how the Republicans want to reverse all of that. It's not that she--or any of the other Democratic Senate candidates I reached out to asking about specific policy remedies they favor, to little response--isn't aware of the problems or doesn't care. (In a statement following Aetna's departure, Kirkpatrick, for example, wrote that she would be ""increasing pressure on the administration, state agencies and insurance companies to work together to find a solution."") But they still largely see the public battle as a foundational one of protecting Obamacare's existence against a Republican Party that hasn't accepted its legitimacy. This is a reasonable position--as well as an excuse for ignoring both the law's problems and certain politically inconvenient solutions. To reopen the book, for many of them, is to reinvite the fury of 2010 that helped end Democratic control of the House of Representatives and left Democrats with a bare majority in the Senate. And the law's approval rating is still underwater. All eyes now are on the 2017 open enrollment period that begins Nov. 1. The key question is how consumers will navigate the large projected premium increases, coupled, in many areas, with fewer options. ""If open enrollment goes well and more people sign up, I expect a lot of these current concerns will fade,"" Levitt said. ""If enrollment for 2017 stagnates, it's likely to trigger a debate about how to fix the law. And it's not at all clear where that debate would go."" Republicans will be ready, as always, with their recommendation to toss the whole act. How will Democrats counter? There is one Democratic figure who might be in office in 2017 who has treated the law's shortcomings seriously and put together a bevy of health care proposals--and she happens to be the party's presidential nominee. In the beginning of the campaign, Hillary Clinton, too, suffered from the ""everything is fine!"" bug, going so far as to red-bait Sen. Bernie Sanders over his Medicare-for-all plan. Sanders' specific proposal suffered from some fuzzy math. But he understood that though the ACA was a vast improvement on an untenable status quo, its flaws really were flaws, and it made little sense to avoid confronting them just because doing so would be a pain. One staple of Sanders' events during the campaign was to ask members of his crowds to raise their hands if they were facing sharp premium increases, and then to say how large the increase was. There was never a shortage of volunteers. Eventually Clinton put together a series of health care proposals. It wasn't the overhaul Sanders wanted, but he gave his enthusiastic endorsement anyway. Clinton would add a Medicare ""buy-in"" option for those 55 and older, and she also committed to doubling the money for community health centers from the funding mark set in the original ACA, an important provision won by Sanders in 2009. She offered further inducement for states that haven't already accepted the Medicaid expansion to do so and would grant the HHS secretary additional ""authority to block or modify unreasonable health insurance premium rate increases,"" increase resources for enrollment outreach, and expand existing exchange subsidies. And yes, she's also pledged to ""pursue efforts to give Americans in every state in the country the choice of a public-option insurance plan."" It's unclear how high a public option, and the political fight that will come with it, ranks atop Clinton's list of priorities. But if 2017 open enrollment goes poorly and more insurers flee the exchanges, the public option--which has always polled well--would be an obvious go-to solution for restoring competition. The idea doesn't rely on hand-holding private insurers until they feel properly incentivized to perform their societal function. It is a direct delivery of health insurance plans to health insurances exchanges. ""Health care markets will inevitably differ from region to region,"" Jacob Hacker, the Yale professor and so-called ""father of the public option,"" wrote in Vox on Thursday, ""but there's no reason every one of the existing marketplaces couldn't offer a Medicare-like plan--a plan that's stable; a plan with predictable costs; a plan that gives patients a broad choice of providers just as Medicare does."" It would also save money--$158 billion over 10 years, according to a 2013 Congressional Budget Office estimate. Progressives never gave up on the idea of the public option, even after efforts to include it in the original ACA fell short due to a combination of insurance industry pressure and red-state Democratic senators who were all afraid of being called communists and losing their seats if they supported it. (They were all called communists and lost their seats anyway.) That's one version of the story, at least. The rise and fall of the public option is the subject of volumes and volumes of folklore, at least half of which seem to feature Rahm Emanuel (or Obama himself) in the role of the heavy, rapping his brass knuckles against the desk of any Democratic senator who entertained even a fleeting thought about government-sponsored health insurance. The truth, as best it's been reconciled, is that while President Obama wanted a public option, what he wanted more was to keep industry and his own party's senators at the table to push a law through. The public option was tradable. ""They wanted to keep those stakeholders in the room,"" former Sen. Tom Daschle, who played a behind-the-scenes role in the crafting and passage of the ACA, recalled in a 2010 interview, ""and this was the price some thought they had to pay."" Industry pressure manifested itself through a handful of conservative Democratic senators, all of whose votes were needed to break a filibuster. Sens. Ben Nelson, Blanche Lincoln, Mary Landrieu, Evan Bayh, and others all had their own beefs with the public option, along with other state-specific concerns that were addressed through a series of controversial carve-outs. If one senator in particular deserved ""credit"" for killing the public option, though, it was Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the home of Yale University, the Bush dynasty, the original hamburger, and the insurance giants Aetna and Cigna. ""The last bargain was with Joe Lieberman,"" journalist Steven Brill wrote in his 2015 history of the health care reform battle, America's Bitter Pill. ""The Connecticut senator finally got rid of the public option, including a version that allowed individual states to choose to implement it or not."" (Much is made of the public option in the bill that emerged from the House--perhaps too much. In truth it was a half-a-loaf plan that the Congressional Budget Office reckoned would have premiums ""somewhat higher"" than those of private insurers, not to mention an unhealthier pool of enrollees.) Lieberman was also responsible for the death of another provision that Hillary Clinton has reintroduced this year in her health care plan: the Medicare buy-in for those ages 55 and older. Joe Lieberman is no longer a senator. And with the big-ticket exits of UnitedHealthcare, Humana, and now Aetna from so many exchanges, along with the collapse of nonprofit health insurance co-ops across the country, the talk of a nonprofit, government-sponsored health insurance option has been rekindled. The most prominent endorsement of new efforts to pass a public option came in the academic Journal of the American Medical Association this summer from author ""Barack Obama, JD."" ""The public plan did not make it into the final legislation,"" Obama wrote. ""Now, based on experience with the ACA, I think Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited."" It was quite a pivot from the president who could turn snippy when pressed by progressives about the public option's omission. The main problem with Clinton's plans for a public option, or any other legislative patches to the ACA, or any other legislative patches to anything--the problem with passing legislation, is the point--would be congressional gridlock. But it won't even get to the point of gridlock and crushed dreams if there's not enough of an appetite within the Democratic caucus even to try. In a piece last week, Bloomberg's Jonathan Bernstein surveyed 11 candidates ""most likely to become new Democratic senators in 2017."" Only six of the 11 ""had a 'health care' section on their websites."" Only one, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, ""mentions support for a public option on the issues section of his campaign website."" ""This is the major option I'm pursuing,"" Van Hollen told Slate when asked for legislative remedies to the lack of competition. He supported the public option in the original Obamacare fight, and he supports it now. ""The whole purpose of having the public option in the first place was to, number one, create competition in the exchanges and, two, to ensure that there were insurance providers in every market."" Van Hollen, from deep-blue Maryland, is as close to a lock in his Senate race as any Democrat this year. He has some room to stretch out his arms. The enthusiasm for a public option among those in closer races in purple states, though, is far more muted. When I asked the campaign of Deborah Ross, the North Carolina Democratic Senate candidate seeking to unseat Sen. Richard Burr, whether she would support a public option in light of the limited insurance options in her state, she changed the subject. ""I am not for a single payer system, but I do want to improve the ACA by giving consumers more options,"" she said in a statement. I am not a communist. I believe it would be bad to move from a private health insurance market to a Medicare-like system. ""Moreover,"" she continued, ""the willingness of Aetna and other insurance companies to abandon folks who need health insurance coverage is just another reason it's a bad idea to give Medicare away to the insurance companies like Senator Burr has proposed."" But I also believe it would be bad to move Medicare to a private health insurance market. The Democratic Senate campaigns of Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania and Kirkpatrick in Arizona did not respond to inquiries about support for the public option. And the Florida Senate campaign of Rep. Patrick Murphy was unwilling to commit to a position on the public option now, even though he did support one during his first House race in 2012. A lot of politicians are just getting reacquainted with the issue and will have to properly ""digest"" it now as it's re-emerging, Adam Green said. ""Since 2010, whenever somebody tried to bring up the public option in D.C. Democratic circles,"" he said, ""the answer was, 'Yeah, we support that, but first we've got to defend Obamacare.' And now we've done that, and now we're ready to move on."" The best argument against pursuing a public option is that it would be a waste of legislative time and capital, since there's no way it would pass Speaker Paul Ryan's House of Representatives (assuming that Republicans are able to hold the chamber this fall). ""The public option was a good idea in 2009, and it's a still a good idea today. [But] I don't know that the politics have changed at all on it,"" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut--who replaced Lieberman in 2013--told the Hill last week. It's true that passage of a public plan, at least in the near future, would be almost impossible. It's hard enough to pass anything, and especially hard to pass something on which even the faintest traces of socialism can be detected. But even a strong push for a public option can be useful. If fixing the Affordable Care Act reaches the congressional docket with some urgency, it can serve as a central piece of Democrats' opening offer that eventually gives way to other compromise solutions. Republicans en masse won't abandon their desire to eliminate the act. But with a new Democratic president beginning a term, it might be possible to peel off some Republican members of Congress who recognize that the law isn't going anywhere, so why not improve on it in the meantime for their rural constituents? That may come in the form of increased exchange subsidies for families, doubled subsidies for community health centers, or a reauthorization of the reinsurance program. For Republicans, the health care wars never paused. Whether Democrats like it or not, and for all the good the Affordable Care Act has done for the sizable majority of its enrollees, Obamacare's holes are being exposed, and Republicans are more than ready to fill them with the narrative that the law is beyond repair. If Democrats don't rally around any ideas for a fix out of a craven wish not to summon the ghosts of 2010, the GOP will have succeeded in weaponizing its opponents' political fear against their greatest accomplishment."	How the Democrats Are Failing Obamacare
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/08/the_week_democracy_died_how_brexit_nice_turkey_and_trump_are_all_connected.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. There are years, decades even, in which history slows to a crawl. Then there are weeks that are so eventful that they seem to mark the dissolution of a world order that had once seemed solid and to foretell the rise of one as yet unknowable. The week of July 11, 2016, has every chance of being remembered as one of those rare flurries of jumbled, inchoate, concentrated significance. The centrifugal forces that are threatening to break political systems across the world may have started to register a decade ago; they may have picked up speed over the last 12 months; but never since the fall of the Berlin Wall have they wreaked havoc in so many places in so short a span of time--showcasing the failures of technocratic rule, the terrifying rise of populist strongmen, and the existential threat posed by Islamist terrorism, all in the span of seven short days. At first glance, a political crisis in London; a terrorist attack in Nice, France; a failed putsch in Ankara, Turkey; and a bloviating orator on his way to becoming the Republican nominee for the presidency of the United States look like the dramatic apex of very different, barely connected screenplays. To my eye, they are garish panes of glass that add up to one unified, striking mosaic. Looked at from the right distance, they tell the story of a political system, liberal democracy, that has long dominated the world--and is now in the midst of an epic struggle for its own survival. A Week Full of Omens The week started with all eyes on the United Kingdom. Brits had recently voted to leave the European Union in a referendum whose unexpected results sent shock waves across the continent. But when David Cameron resigned as prime minister, when the promises of leading members of the ""Leave"" campaign went up in smoke, when the pound tanked and the first companies announced layoffs and many voters reportedly began to regret their choice, it seemed as though the country's elites might engineer some subtle subterfuge. And the woman to engineer that subterfuge was Theresa May, a cautious supporter of the ""Remain"" campaign who had quickly emerged as one of two candidates to succeed Cameron as the country's next prime minister. Those hopes were dashed when May set out her political program in a hastily arranged campaign appearance in the city of Birmingham early on Monday morning. ""Brexit,"" she vowed in the most significant piece of political tautology of recent times, ""means Brexit."" If May became prime minister, she would lead the country out of the EU--throwing the defining political project of Europe's postwar era into an existential crisis. By the time Big Ben had struck noon, Andrea Leadsom, May's last remaining rival for the leadership of Britain's Conservative Party, and the country, had dropped out of the race. Within 48 hours, May kneeled before the Queen, and was named the second female Prime Minister in the country's history. The cabinet picks she announced on Wednesday evening confirmed that she meant business. With Euroskeptics like Boris Johnson and David Davis in key positions, the last shreds of doubt about her commitment vanished. Britain will leave the European Union. Europe's postwar order is one step closer to unraveling. * * * Thursday, July 14, was Bastille Day. After a brutal 18 months in which France was hit by two major terrorist attacks, the nation took the opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to liberty, equality, and fraternity. In his annual Bastille Day press conference at the Elysee Palace, President Francois Hollande announced that he would end the state of emergency that had held sway since the bloody attack on the Bataclan last November. On the beaches of Nice, just beyond the storied Promenade des Anglais, a second home to Europe's rich and famous for the better part of two centuries, tens of thousands gathered to watch a fireworks display resplendent in red, white, and blue. When the fireworks were over, when the city was teeming with humanity--young and old, rich and poor, French and foreign, Christian, Muslim, and Jew--a truck of death barreled down the Promenade, zigzagging, firing shots, killing indiscriminately, killing avariciously. By the time the truck had come to a standstill, 84 people were dead or dying. Eighteen months earlier, when terrorists had stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo and gone on to kill shoppers at a kosher supermarket in the east of Paris, solidarity among the French political class had held for about a week. This time, the jockeying for position started almost immediately. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right populist National Front, mocked Hollande for his ill-timed revocation of the state of emergency and accused the government of total failure in its fight again Islamist terrorism. Her broadside resonated. Every attack pushes frightened citizens ""a little closer to surrendering to the impulse to embrace an authoritarian response,"" warned Art Goldhammer, one of the most astute American observers of France. While it had once seemed unimaginable that Le Pen might become president of France in elections next spring, ""it is becoming thinkable"" that it will be she who holds the traditional Bastille Day press conference from the Elysee Palace on July 14, 2017. * * * Just as tensions began to rise among the French political class, the first explosions pierced a quiet Friday night in sleepy Ankara. Yet another terrorist attack, the good people of Twitter quickly concluded. But what played out in front of the world's eyes over the next hours was something else entirely: an old-fashioned coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, updated for the age of social media by his desperate FaceTime pleas for Turks to take to the street and come to his rescue. Plotters, even ones imminently doomed to be deemed incompetent by CNN's self-proclaimed coup experts, tend to have the benefit of surprise on their side. In those first hours, tanks secured Ataturk Airport and the offices of the state broadcasting station. Erdogan, infamously vain, was reduced to addressing his nation through the speakers of a TV presenter's iPhone; rumors already located him en route to political exile in Germany or perhaps the United Kingdom. The country's secular elite, it seemed, had retained more of its power than observers had thought possible. With the might of the army's F-16s on their side, they were mounting a last-ditch attempt to resist Erdogan's creeping Islamicization of the country. The coup looked likely to succeed. Then the tide began to turn. When Erdogan next spoke to the nation, he stood in front of real cameras, looking more self-assured. At his behest, Turks came out in tens of thousands to defend democracy, or to pay allegiance to their tribune, or to claim the right to impose their religion on others, or perhaps all three at once. Most of the army fought the plotters, opposition parties condemned the coup, and--once they could be reasonably confident that Erdogan would stay in power--so did Angela Merkel and Barack Obama. By daybreak, a military dictatorship had been averted. But liberal democracy seemed to be in no less trouble. Safely returned to Istanbul, Erdogan called the coup ""a gift from God"" and set about the task of purging the state of anybody whom he suspected of disloyalty. Among the scores of arrests he made, and the thousands of judges he fired, some might plausibly have had a hand in the plot; but for most, their crime was one of thought, not action. And so Turkey had witnessed two coups in 48 hours: first, the failed rebellion of factions of the military against Erdogan's proto-authoritarian rule, and second, Erdogan's successful purge of all who might one day challenge his position, whether through the barrel of a gun or the power of the ballot box. * * * Never one to allow harrowing events to upstage him or to let propriety stand in the way of his sales pitch, Donald J. Trump cheered every twist and turn in London, Nice, and Ankara from the sidelines. When Brits voted to Brexit, Trump congratulated them on taking ""their country back,"" promising ""to do the exact same thing on Election Day 2016 here in the United States."" When he heard of the terror attack in Nice, he saw, first and foremost, an opportunity to drive home his opposition to Muslim immigration. ""When will we learn?"" he tweeted that Thursday night. ""It's only getting worse."" Even the coup in Turkey became ""further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look,"" he said at a Saturday press conference announcing Mike Pence as his running mate, ""every single thing they've touched has turned to horrible, horrible death-defying problems."" Trump's case is straightforward: The challenges facing America are momentous. But they were brought about by incompetence, corruption, or false loyalties. And so they can easily be solved once a strong, incorruptible, patriotic leader--a leader just like Trump--takes power. He, and only he, is the solution to the ""death-defying problems"" that shaped this terrible week. It is this providential fusion of the people and their leader--the belief that collective deliverance from a dark world can only come from a pure, unadulterated conduit for the people's voice--that defines the core of his appeal. And it is his closely related inability to contemplate that he may at times be mistaken, or that there may be legitimate conflicts of interest in a democracy, or that the power of the presidency needs to be checked by other institutions, that makes him so dangerous. Never has the egotism at the heart of his appeal been more apparent than during the media blitz to introduce his running mate. During the Saturday press conference at which they first appeared in public together, Trump was barely able to say a few consecutive sentences about Pence. Instead, he passionately spoke about his own views, interlaced with a few perfunctory talking points about his would-be vice president read from a conspicuous cue card. Sunday brought yet another display of Trump's egotism. When Pence was asked what kind of vice president he hoped to be during a joint interview on 60 Minutes, Trump answered the question for him. When Pence lauded Trump for speaking from his heart, Trump interrupted again: ""Well, I speak from my heart and my brain. Just so we understand."" But the best line of the interview, and the most telling, came when the interviewer suggested that Trump is ""not known to be a humble man."" ""I think I am actually a humble man,"" Trump responded. ""I think I'm much more humble than you would understand."" Liberal Democracy Under Attack The truly scary thing about Donald Trump is not that he is unique. It is, rather, that he is far from exceptional. In a rich, raucous republic of 300 million, there will always be a glamorous bully with a taste for the gutter. What is new is not the existence of a populist willing to voice nasty sentiments; it's that a lot of voters have become so disgusted by the political class, and so disillusioned with the current state of the country's institutions, that they are willing to vote for someone quite so nasty. In the long run, Trump's particular views and quirks matter less than we would like to think. He is ultimately no more than an extra in an unfolding horror show--the most prominent beneficiary of an epochal shift whose roots predate Trump's entry into politics and whose effects will continue to shape our societies long after he has retired to one of his many estates. Across the affluent, established democracies of North America and Western Europe, the last years have witnessed a meteoric rise of figures who may not be quite so brash or garish as Trump and yet bear a striking resemblance to him: Marine Le Pen in France, Frauke Petry in Germany, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, and many of the leading Brexiteers in the United Kingdom. They too harness a new level of anger that is quite unlike anything liberal democracies have witnessed in a half-century. They too promise to stand up for ordinary people, to do away with a corrupt political elite, and to put the ethnic and religious minorities who are now (supposedly) being favored in their rightful (subordinate) place. They, too, are willing to do away with liberal political institutions like an independent judiciary or a free, robust press so long as those stand in the way of the people's will.  Together, they are building a new type of political regime that is slowly coming into its own: illiberal democracy. Critics often attack Trump, Le Pen, and their cohort for being undemocratic. But that is to misunderstand both their priorities and the reasons for their appeal. For the most part, their belief in the will of the people is real. Their primary objection to the status quo is, quite simply, that institutional roadblocks like independent courts or norms like a ""politically correct"" concern for the rights of minorities stop the system from channeling the people's righteous anger into public policy. What they promise, then, is not to move away from popular rule but rather to strip it of its artificial, liberal guise--all the while embodying the only true version of the people's will. Places like Hungary and Poland show what this might mean in practice. Once celebrated as examples of successful democratic transition, these countries are now at the forefront of the movement toward illiberal democracy. After Viktor Orban took power in Budapest six years ago, his Fidesz party undermined the country's constitutional court, stacked government institutions like the electoral commission with party loyalists, and turned the most important media outlets into uncritical propaganda machines. Over the course of the past year, Poland's Law and Justice party has accomplished much the same feat in a fraction of the time. In both places, key liberal rights are honored more in the breach than the observance. Political elites are understandably terrified by the speed with which illiberal democracy is coming into its own. But if the populists are pushing for a political system that does away with one half of liberal democracy, the truth is that a large number of establishment politicians are increasingly tempted to embrace a system that does away with the other half. Where Trump and Le Pen seek to establish an illiberal democracy, a lot of sensible centrists are quietly seeking their salvation in what I call ""undemocratic liberalism."" If the people want to violate the rights of unloved minorities, setting up the prospect of democracy without rights, the political establishment is increasingly insulating itself from the people's demands, opting for a form of rights without democracy. To be sure, undemocratic liberalism usually retains a democratic sheen. The standard rigmarole of political life in a supposed democracy is jealously observed: There are regular elections and hard-fought campaigns, grand speeches and parliamentary votes. The institutional apparatus that supposedly serves to translate the will of the people into public policy remains in place. And yet, the actual purpose of these institutions--to let the people rule--is increasingly forgotten. To anyone who cares to take a skeptical look, it is obvious how ineffectual representative institutions have become at delivering on the noble task they supposedly serve. Take the U.S. Congress. Legislators are supposed to represent the people, but the views of ordinary voters now have precious little influence on Capitol Hill. More wealthy, more white, and much more likely to have gone to elite schools than the average American, congressmen and senators don't resemble the people they are supposed to represent. But the main problem is not who they are but rather what incentives the systems gives them. To get elected, politicians need to prevail in a primary system that emphasizes the voice of a small number of radical ideologues. To bankroll their campaigns, they need to raise contributions at a constant clip, making them dependent on the good will of major funders. And to enjoy a plush retirement, they need to cultivate the corporations and lobbyists that are likely to throw easy money their way once they leave office. Given those conditions, it is hardly surprising that political scientists who study to what degree legislation reflects the preferences of average voters have concluded that there is a deep democratic disconnect, in the United States and in many other supposed democracies across the West as well. Legislation thus reflects the will of the people less and less. As important, many areas of public policy have been taken out of the legislative process altogether. Congress is not only constrained by traditional balances like the Supreme Court. Increasingly, it is also hamstrung by the expanding influence of experts, an increase in bureaucratic autonomy, and the rise of new international organizations. Economic policy is a case in point: Some of the most essential economic decisions are now made by independent bureaucratic agencies like the Federal Reserve or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, set in stone by far-reaching trade agreements like NAFTA, or adjudicated by international institutions like the World Trade Organization. Ordinary people are angry at the political system in part because they recognize to what extent they have been shut out of key decisions. But, by the same token, the process is becoming so unresponsive in part because the rise of illiberal populists has given the political establishment a good reason to insulate itself from the people's anger. A pendulum is swinging from illiberal democracy to undemocratic liberalism, then back again. And its swings are getting wider and wider. * * * Britain's vote to leave the European Union is a perfect illustration of the tension between illiberal democracy and undemocratic liberalism. Even the most passionate defenders of the EU find it difficult to deny that it suffers from a serious democratic deficit. Most of the power in the institution rests with the European Commission, which is run by career bureaucrats, and the European Council, which represents the governments of member states. While the European Parliament is meant to provide a democratic counterweight to this elite-driven process, it is toothless in practice: elected with a tiny turnout by voters who barely register what it does day to day, the body has few formal powers. For all of its many achievements, the EU is a key exhibit for the existence of undemocratic liberalism. Resistance to the European Union has long been especially strong among Brits, who have traditionally prided themselves in the unchecked sovereignty enjoyed by their parliament. Under increasing pressure from right-wingers in his own party, David Cameron thus agreed to a referendum on membership in the EU. Giving the people a one-time simulacrum of plebiscitary democracy, he hoped, would ""lance the boil"" of Euroskepticism once and for all. There was only one problem with this plan: When the British people were offered the little finger of plebiscitary democracy, they decided to grab hold of the whole hand. Expected to follow the lead of their betters, they took great pleasure in shocking them with their disobedience. And while there are some perfectly reasonable grounds on which to dislike the EU, opinion polls leave little doubt as to the real reasons why most Brits wound up favoring Brexit. While the hard-line Euroskeptics who forced the referendum may have been concerned with questions of sovereignty, most voters cherished an opportunity to express their illiberal resentments. For all intents and purposes, the referendum turned into a plebiscite against immigration. In the manner of a parent who tells Little Timmy he can have anything he wants for dinner, then tries to back out of the deal when Little Timmy announces he would like a dozen grasshoppers with a side of vanilla ice cream, a lot of political leaders were tempted to backtrack on Brexit once the results were in. Couldn't they negotiate a deal that would end formal membership in the European Union while keeping all the important things the way they are now? Or call a second referendum in the hope that it might produce a different result? Faced with a blatant expression of how illiberal the preferences of most people are, the temptation to subvert the democratic procedures that were meant to translate those views into actual public policy was--understandably--strong. Theresa May ultimately quashed the hope that Brexit might mean something less than Brexit. The people had been allowed the rare luxury of speaking their mind, and she recognized it would have been too embarrassing to renege on so prominent a promise. If Little Timmy insisted, he would be allowed to eat grasshoppers with vanilla ice cream this one time. But just as any prudent parent would learn from the experience and grow much more wary of letting an unruly child make untutored decisions in the future, so too the political class has mostly interpreted Brexit as a warning about the irrationality of popular referenda. By and large, it will serve as a reminder of the importance of holding the illiberal preferences of the average voter at bay. * * * Liberal democracy is decomposing into its constitutive parts: Over the next decades, much of the world will face a tragic choice between illiberal democracy, or democracy without rights, and undemocratic liberalism, or rights without democracy. But if that comes to pass, it is unlikely to be the end point. For when illiberal democrats fall out of favor, they tend not to give up power. What starts as a genuine attempt to channel the voice of the people all too often degenerates into a straightforward dictatorship. A strikingly similar development might well befall undemocratic liberalism: Forced to defend itself against an onslaught of illiberal populists, it may have to resort to increasingly illiberal means to subdue its opponents. In the long run, both illiberal democracy and undemocratic liberalism may thus be headed for a remarkably similar fate: a gradual descent into an unvarnished form of dictatorship. There could hardly be a more striking illustration of this prediction than recent developments in Turkey. For decades, Turkey was a relatively clear-cut case of undemocratic liberalism: In a deeply religious country, a small, secular elite protected ethnic and religious minorities, resisting any attempt to pass laws inspired by Islam. Whenever a popularly elected government made small steps toward putting religion at the center of public life, the army was waiting in the wings to depose it. Then Erdogan managed to lead a seemingly moderate Islamic movement to political victory and to break the power of the secular elite. For some years, outside observers hoped that he would turn Turkey into a true democracy, allowing pious Muslims fuller participation in social and political life without violating the rights of secularists or religious minorities. But that hope gradually faded. Before long, Erdogan pushed illiberal legislation, from new restrictions on the sale of alcohol to increasingly extreme measures against critical journalists and academics. The failed coup was no more than a final showdown between the two ugly sides of this coin. If the coup had succeeded, the victorious factions of the army would likely have reestablished some liberal freedoms, in part by reverting to a more secular vision of Turkey. At the same time, they would have done away with any pretense of democracy: The freedom to drink alcohol in the streets of Istanbul would have been purchased by an inability to speak one's mind about the new military government. When the coup failed, the outcome was not all that different. Long desperate to consolidate his rule, Erdogan seized the moment. In the first three days after the coup, he suspended close to 30,000 members of the civil service, revoked the licenses of 21,000 teachers, took over 6,000 soldiers into custody, and commanded all 1,577 deans of Turkish universities to submit their resignations. The purge is continuing apace: All in all, over 26,000 people have been arrested in the weeks since the coup. Elected as a people's tribune, Erdogan has now amassed so much power that he can well afford to ignore the views of his electorate. The form of illiberal democracy he has instituted for the past decade has finally taken off its mask and revealed the ugly face of dictatorship. The Roots of the Crisis By historical standards, liberal democracies have been extraordinarily stable. Poor countries have trouble sustaining democratic rule. Some rich countries, especially those with vast oil wealth, have always been controlled by autocrats. But once a wealthy country has successfully transitioned to democracy, its form of government is locked in. This is about as remarkable a fact as political science has on offer. Never in history has a wealthy, consolidated democracy collapsed. Not once. That remarkable fact has made it easy to ascribe the stability of the West's political institutions to its fundamental attributes: universal suffrage, rule of law, checks and balances, individual rights. Each country gives its own spin on the genealogy of its particular political settlement. Americans tend to thank the genius of their founders, the French the principled visionaries on the barricades, Brits the fortuitous rise of pluralistic institutions owed to the blood-soaked compromises struck between lord and liege. But for all of the specificities of national myth and memory, the triumphalist upshot is remarkably similar in every democratic country. The question of the best regime form, which had animated the writings of thinkers from Socrates to Rousseau, has supposedly been solved. The end of history has arrived. This happy story overlooks a number of facts that have been so formative of our political world that it is easy to forget just how extraordinary they, too, are by historical standards. All through the history of democratic stability, the incomes of ordinary citizens grew rapidly. All through the history of democratic stability, a democracy has been the most powerful country in the world. And all through the history of democratic stability, democracies have been highly homogeneous. Over the last decades, each of these factors stopped being the case. Living standards stagnated. The rise of China is threatening American hegemony. Democracies in North America and Western Europe are more diverse than they have ever been before. History cannot tell us how liberal democracies perform under those circumstances, so we are only just starting to gather the first shreds of evidence for what the effects of those transformations might be. What little we know suggests that the answer is not going to be pretty. * * * Since the founding of the American republic, the median citizen in every generation could pride himself on being much wealthier than his parents and had strong reason to believe that his children would be even better off. Indeed, ever since the ink dried on the Declaration of Independence, a clear majority of American citizens ended their lives with comforts they could barely have imagined when they were growing up. From 1935 to 1960, the standard of living of the median voter just about doubled. From 1960 to 1985, it just about doubled again. From 1985 to 2010, it flatlined. In the years since then, America's gross domestic product, the Dow Jones, and the incomes of the rich have all recovered from the depths of the Great Recession. But the incomes of most Americans have barely improved. Most citizens have not experienced real economic gains since George H.W. Bush was elected. If statistics lie, it's often because averages hide. The stagnation of living standards conceals the phenomenal increase in income and wealth for the richest Americans. It also conceals the remarkable decline in income and wealth for the poorest Americans. That is true for many Latino and black Americans, who are more likely than other demographic groups to be doing the kinds of blue-collar jobs that have seen wages decrease in real terms. But it is felt especially keenly among white Americans with high expectations, limited qualifications, and declining hourly wages--that is to say, among some of Donald Trump's most passionate supporters. The appeal of illiberal democracy cannot be understood in abstraction from this economic story. The fortunes of the populists do not necessarily rise and fall in step with the business cycle or even the unemployment rate. Nor need it always be the very poorest, or those who stand to suffer the most immediate losses because of globalization, who flock toward them in the greatest numbers. The story that matters is broader than that: The basic deal offered by political elites since the inception of democracy was to provide ordinary people with large increases in their standard of living from one generation to the next. So long as that deal held, the people were willing to defer to the political class. Now that the deal has been broken--broken spectacularly--they no longer feel bound by their side of the bargain. And so many of them are willing to entertain the hope that the illiberal demagogues who are courting them so assiduously will serve them better than the unfaithful lot that is now in power. * * * In most parts of Europe, democracy took firm root only after the killings and expulsions of World War II turned countries that had once been home to a large number of minorities deeply homogeneous. Democracy in those places is a creation of the nation state, and for outsiders, membership in those nations has always remained difficult and incomplete. A German or an Italian or a Swede was thought to look a particular way and to descend from a particular ethnic stock. Though not every German is blond, and not every Italian has olive skin, it went without saying that somebody who is black or Asian or Middle Eastern could be neither German nor Italian. The story was a little more complicated in the United States and in Canada, where membership in the nation had always been based on mutual aspirations for the future rather than descent from common ancestors. But even in the U.S., the lip service to diversity was secretly--and not so secretly--predicated on two important facts: The social and economic superiority of whites was not to be called into question. And particular ethnic or religious groups could not be associated with physical threats to the safety of American citizens. What happened in the brief intervals when these background conditions did not obtain speaks for itself. During World War I, some descendants of German immigrants were suspected of disloyalty; a flourishing German American associational life quickly disappeared. World War II was much worse: In the wake of Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans were classified as enemy aliens and promptly interned. The brittle foundations of ethnic inclusion explain why tensions over immigration and racial identity have been running especially high over the last two decades. In Europe, places like Germany and Italy had to admit to themselves during that period that they were indeed ""countries of immigration"" and that they would not be able to go on forever denying immigrants of Turkish or Middle Eastern descent full membership in the nation. Meanwhile, in North America, many members of ethnic and religious minorities ascended to unprecedented positions of power and prestige, threatening the majority's comfortable assumption of perennial dominance. On both sides of the Atlantic, these transformations--which are cultural as much as they are economic or political--made the ethnic majority deeply resentful. The fuse was now in place, and it was connected to a ton of TNT. The terrorists just had to light it. This is the most important political effect of the series of spectacular Islamist terror attacks on liberal democracies in the West that began on 9/11 and has continued to wreak havoc since: The constant terror threat gradually transformed a division of ""us"" versus ""them"" that had once been one of many important facts of politics into the primary line of political division and mobilization. In every country and epoch, political life is defined by the key questions that determine which side you are on. In some countries these questions are socio-economic: Are you for the industrialists or the landowners, for the proletariat or the bourgeoisie? In other countries, the key questions are religious or ethnic: Are you for the Protestants or the Catholics, for the Luo or the Kikuyu? These political ""cleavages"" can be a productive element of democratic life, a way of balancing the interests of different groups who mobilize to defend their own. But they always run the risk of turning so deep that people on both sides of the divide can no longer recognize each other as fellow citizens with legitimate interests. That is when victory at the polls starts to provide an excuse for subjugating a minority; when different groups might formally retain citizenship of the same country but the state becomes no more than a committee for advancing the interests of the ascendant faction. This is what the fallout from Islamist terrorism is now threatening to do across North America and Western Europe: A cleavage that was already fraught in most liberal democracies is becoming an instrument of tyranny. Despite their hatred for each other, the populists and the terrorists thus live in a strange kind of symbiosis. The more marginalized Muslims feel in Western societies, the easier ISIS finds it to recruit converts to its bloody cause. And the more homegrown terrorists kill innocents in the name of Islam, the easier it becomes for populists to incite voters against liberal democracy's protections for ethnic and religious minorities. Seen in this light, the terror attack in Nice is yet another weapon in the armory that might allow Marine Le Pen to subvert liberte, egalite, and fraternite: It is yet another cause of fear in the population; yet another excuse to see politics from the vantage point of an ethnic in-group; and yet another example Le Pen can point to in claiming that Muslim immigrants simply do not fit into France. The terrorists, the pious sentiment goes, will never have enough power to vanquish the principles of liberal democracy. That is true, so far as it goes. But it doesn't go very far. As the political fallout from the attack in Nice--and the attacks in Orlando and Brussels and Wurzburg, Germany--demonstrate, it's looking increasingly likely that we will let them win by doing their bidding for them. The most pressing political question of our age is how we can stop that from happening. What reforms are needed to re-establish the social end economic foundations of liberal democracy? And how can we express liberal democratic values convincingly enough to win the battle of ideas against the likes of Donald Trump? Regaining Our Conviction Habituation breeds indifference. A turn of phrase that expressed a point with the help of a striking image no longer packs the same punch because we have grown inured to its literal meaning; linguists call this a dead metaphor. Driving to work in the sweet ride we bought a few months ago no longer gives us the same pleasure; economists call this hedonic adaptation. The person who once sent our heart racing enters the room and we barely notice it; grown-ups call this being married. Something akin to this form of habituation has happened to our most fundamental political values. The ideals of liberal democracy are all around us. We know that the people are supposed to rule and that all citizens have a right to the same basic freedoms irrespective of their race, creed, or religion. But precisely because these ideas have surrounded us in a diffuse way for so long, we have begun to forget their meaning and their grandeur. ""The fatal tendency of mankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer doubtful,"" John Stuart Mill presciently warned in On Liberty, ""is the cause of half their errors."" So, while civics teachers dutifully recite the ideals of the Founding Fathers and while the political instincts of mainstream publications from Time to the Huffington Post are in some vague sense ""liberal,"" the intellectual energy is now on the side of liberalism's opponents. A few decades ago, right-wing critics of liberal democracy were mostly confined to the oddballs and nostalgics who stubbornly harkened back to some imagined golden age, whether it be the era of fascism in Europe or the era of Jim Crow in the United States. Their ideas were terrifying and their influence, at times, real. And yet it was clear to all that they were ultimately defunct, bound to become more and more ridiculous with every passing year. Since the turn of the millennium, this has changed fundamentally. The assumption that far-right alternatives to liberal democracy are invariably a remnant from the past is, itself, a relic of a bygone era. Illiberal democracy, the form of rule the far right now advocates in most places from the United States to the United Kingdom and from France to Turkey, is in many ways a new invention--and its ambition is nothing less than to claim the future for itself. Its broad appeal and rapid spread, encapsulated so painfully in the week of July 11, 2016, demonstrates that this aspiration is not to be dismissed lightly. To ensure that the future does not belong to illiberal democracy, its opponents will have to do the hard work of political resistance--and be willing to overcome their own deep divisions to cooperate against a common enemy. As in the 1920s, when liberal democracy first came under deadly fire across the world, this willingness to work together in the face of a grave far-right threat is far from assured. Nobody should be more scared of the rise of illiberal populists than the left. And yet, in both Europe and North America, much of the left increasingly thinks of ""liberal"" as a term of abuse. Indeed, a growing share of left-wing activists has gone from understandable anger at the many shortcomings of the status quo to an outright rejection of the foundational political values of our age. Assuming that ideals that are flagrantly contradicted in practice can't be worth very much in theory either, they too are giving up on the core tenets of liberal democracy. If Donald Trump rails against Muslims in his speeches then, they believe, it is time to accept that freedom of speech is an outmoded concept. And if the police kill innocent black Americans then, they believe, the ideal of state neutrality between different ethnic groups is no more than a tool for white domination. The society they envisage is not one in which liberal democratic ideals are more perfectly realized than they are now--but rather one in which these ideals are sacrificed in the name of social justice. The most foolhardy parts of the left even go so far as to see the rise of their enemies as a strategic opportunity. Believing that things will have to get worse before they can get better, their most urgent desire is to smash up the status quo. Unwilling to recognize any real difference between the policies favored by the likes of Trump and the policies favored by the likes of Clinton, they prefer the agent of chaos, however violent, to the defender of the current political order, however decent. And so it is centrist politicians who have now become the last explicit defenders of liberalism. But, squeezed between a blatantly authoritarian right and an increasingly illiberal left, they have begun to seek refuge in new forms of technocratic rule. In the short run, the undemocratic bulwarks they are building against illiberal sentiments are protecting the rights of minorities. But their lack of urgency and the dearth of their vision mean that they do not even attempt to tackle the root causes of the populist rise, like the stagnation in living standards. In the long run, this is very dangerous: The exclusion of the people from the political process--especially when coupled with an unwillingness (or an inability) to pass real economic reform--will only serve to inflame illiberal passions, turning even more citizens against liberal democracy. Among the many worrying signs of our time, perhaps the most concerning is that those who believe both in liberalism and in democracy, both in popular rule and in individual rights, have increasingly taken on a defensive crouch. They seek to rescue what they know to be valuable, and yet they have lost their ability to articulate what part of contemporary reality is worth fighting for and why. And so many of them wind up focusing their energies on shoring up the bad as well as the good parts of our crumbling political order: Rather than imagining what social and economic policies might help to diffuse popular anger and fulfill the promises of liberal democracy, they seek their salvation in immobility. To fight the terrorists and the populists, to prevail both against the plotters of undemocratic coups and the illiberal tribunes propelled into office by the intense anger of a volatile age, will require liberal democrats to stand tall for their values--and to develop the radical imagination that is desperately needed if we are to recreate the conditions that once allowed for the system's stability. New economic policies are needed to ensure that ordinary people capture much more of the world's economic gains than they have in the past decades. Meanwhile, democratic institutions designed for the 18th century need to restore the promise of popular rule by incorporating the technologies of the 21st century. By the cruel standards of human history, the last few decades have been uncommonly serene. It is looking less and less likely that we will one day be able to say the same thing of the next few decades. Radical change seems to lurk just around the corner. The question is no longer whether we can preserve our political order in its current form. (We probably can't.) It is what reforms are needed to ensure that the precious, fragile combination of liberalism and democracy does not entirely vanish from the face of the earth. If the center is to hold--if we are to rescue what is best about our imperfect political order--a lot will have to change."	The Week Democracy Died: Seven Days in July That Changed the World as We Know It

Each of the measures calls for making it legal for people older than 21 to possess small amounts of pot, taxing the drug and allowing regulated stores to sell it. Arkansas, Florida, and North Dakota will vote this fall on legalizing medical marijuana. And Oklahoma may yet join the fray. The activity is a sign of just how much momentum the movement has picked up in only a few years. In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to pass ballot measures making the sale and use of pot legal. Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia followed in 2014. Twenty-five states and D.C. have medical marijuana laws, and others have decriminalized small amounts of the drug. As the movement has grown, the politics behind marijuana are also undergoing a subtle shift. Though traditional pro-pot activists have given the bulk of the money supporting the five recreational pot ballot measure campaigns--roughly $7 million of the $11.6 million raised so far--more and more of the backers are coming from the new but growing marijuana industry. Two-thirds of the big donors--those giving at least $5,000 to the campaigns for this fall's measures--have direct financial stakes in the weed business, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of state records. Indeed, as legalized pot grows in state after state, so has the industrial complex around it. This year, though, marks the first time this new legal pot industry has significantly contributed to making itself bigger. Now the movement's campaigns are starting to resemble most other big-money ballot measure fights, with business-minded donors looking to protect or enhance their profits. ""It has gone from an activist influence and is in transition to an industry influence,"" said Joe Brezny, who is directing Nevada's legalization campaign and also co-founded the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association. ""The industry is required to step up more now."" In Nevada, for example, at least 39 out of 47 major donors--who gave at least $5,000 each to the campaign supporting legal weed--have financial interests in expanding the legal marijuana market. They contributed $625,000 of the more than $1 million that the pro-pot political committee has raised so far. Among them: more than a dozen existing medical marijuana dispensaries and five beer distributors, which would have the first shot at being the state's recreational pot dispensaries and distributors, respectively. Similarly, in Arizona, where a pending court case could complicate marijuana advocates' path to the ballot, at least 26 of the 35 top donors potentially stand to make a profit if recreational marijuana is legalized there. The campaign so far has raised $2.2 million. In Massachusetts, 11 out of 18 major donors came from the marijuana industry, though they accounted for only $80,000 of the nearly $500,000 supporters raised. In contrast, only two of the 17 major donors to the measure that legalized weed in Colorado in 2012 had ties to the marijuana industry. They raised just $42,000 of the $3.3 million total raised by supporters. Likewise in Washington that year, the list of donors who raised $6.2 million was dominated by activist groups and philanthropists, such as Phil Harvey, the multimillionaire who made his fortune on sex toys, and Rick Steves, of travel book fame. The George Soros-backed Drug Policy Alliance and billionaire Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance also gave to legalize marijuana there, as they did in Colorado and in other states. (Disclosure: The Center for Public Integrity receives funding from the Open Society Foundations, which Soros funds. A complete list of Center for Public Integrity funders is found here.) In other states voting this year, the funding is more of a mixed bag. In California, where campaign supporters have raised more than $7.1 million, Napster and Facebook investor Sean Parker has bankrolled the campaign to the tune of $1.5 million. But Weedmaps, a company that helps customers locate pot shops, contributed $1 million. The Werc Shop, a laboratory that tests marijuana for potency and pesticides, pitched in $5,000, as did several other weed-related businesses. Jeffrey Raber, a California chemist who founded the Werc Shop, acknowledged his company would benefit from the measure's passage, since it requires legal marijuana to be tested at facilities like his. But he and his clients mostly want the state to regulate their business so they can ""be recognized as responsible citizens who are legitimate actors,"" he said. In Maine, only one of the major pro-marijuana contributors is closely related to the pot industry. The initiative there is in part led by a group representing small marijuana farms, which has donated $10,000 of the $692,000 raised by the committees supporting the measure. Those interested in legalizing marijuana are trying to adjust to the new funding dynamics. ""Marijuana legalization in the past has depended on a few kind of eccentric old white guys who had money, and some of them are literally dying off,"" said Ellen Komp, deputy director of the California chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. ""We're starting to see the industry get to a level of maturity where they're getting involved in the political sphere, as they have the right to."" Twenty-six states allow residents to put measures on the ballot. The efforts are notoriously expensive, often requiring generous donors to pay workers to gather enough signatures to allow the measures to go before voters and then promote them with pricey ads. So major ballot measure fights are often dominated by corporations spending to support or block measures that would affect their bottom lines. The contributions are flowing in even though marijuana remains illegal under federal law, forcing pot companies to operate outside the banking system and run all-cash operations. The Marijuana Policy Project, a nonprofit known for its major influence in making marijuana legal in Colorado and Alaska, acknowledges that the industry is more involved in bankrolling the political movement now--and sees potential for even more funding. ""This is really the first major election cycle where there's actually a business community already up and running in the states that are considering these broader reforms,"" said Mason Tvert, MPP's spokesman. ""We'd still like the industry to step in and contribute a little more. ... The vast majority of marijuana businesses are not getting involved or contributing."" Others are dismayed at the legalization movement's new corporate friends. Dan Riffle quit his job as a lobbyist at the Marijuana Policy Project because he said he was uncomfortable with how closely tied the advocacy group had become to industry. ""Drug policy is all about reducing demand, and a company that has a profit motive is only going to increase demand,"" Riffle said. ""Having a big commercial marijuana industry runs counter to public health goals."" Some longtime marijuana activists breathed a sigh of relief when an investor-backed marijuana measure in Ohio failed last year. The measure would have given the right to farm pot for profit exclusively to the investors who paid for the campaign. Some, like the Drug Policy Alliance's executive director Ethan Nadelmann, worry that the same kind of entrepreneurial mindset will drive the future of legalization. ""We don't want to be creating mini-Ohios here,"" said Nadelmann. ""Our ability to shape the future of marijuana legalization is going to diminish over time simply because our ability to raise the funds for this work from people who are driven by social justice values ... is diminishing."" But some industry donors say they're not solely motivated by dollar signs. Steve White, whose company owns marijuana dispensaries in Arizona and other states, said he gave more than $54,000 to the Arizona measure because he believes it will help medical users of marijuana avoid unfair prosecution, among other reasons. ""Like any place you're going to have some people that are more concerned about what's in their cash register at the end of the day,"" he said. But ""in Arizona there are a lot of individuals in the industry who really, really care about the social justice issues.""

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/why_georgia_is_looking_peachy_for_hillary_clinton.html	"Since the end of the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton has been riding high in the polls nationally, in swing states, and in a few places that should give Republicans cause for real alarm. One of those places is Georgia, a state that hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992. After months of a slim Trump lead in the state, two recent polls show Clinton ahead. The latest, a JMC Enterprises poll of likely voters, shows Clinton up by a remarkable 7 percentage points. Although JMC has a ""C"" rating in FiveThirtyEight's pollster rankings, FiveThirtyEight's own polls-only forecasting model suggests that a Clinton lead in Georgia could very well be real; it currently gives her a 52.7 percent chance of winning the state. Clinton likely owes much of her current standing in the state's polls to a highly successful convention and a highly damaging couple of weeks for Donald Trump. But there's also reason to believe that deep changes in Georgia's demographics are boosting her support and could turn Georgia purple soon, if not this November. The changes that have taken place in Georgia mirror the kinds of changes that have put into play other formerly solid Republican states in the South, like Virginia and North Carolina. As with these states, Georgia' population has been growing and diversifying. In 2000, roughly 63 percent of Georgians were white. Today, an estimated 54 percent are, the result of a Latino population that has grown from roughly 5 percent to more than 9 percent, a black population that has grown from 29 percent to 31 percent, and an Asian population that has grown from roughly 2 percent to 4 percent. These numbers are driven, as is also the case in the new swing states, by a changing economy. Urban centers like Atlanta and the industries based in them like tech and health care are growing, which is driving migration to Georgia not just from abroad, but also from elsewhere in the country. According to the Census Bureau, Georgia was one of the top 10 destinations for Americans moving to another state between 2010 and 2015. These factors motivated a significant investment of resources by Democrats in Georgia's 2014 Senate race. Michelle Nunn, a nonprofit executive and daughter of former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, was thought to have a real shot at beating then-Republican candidate David Perdue. Her chances were contingent on Nunn turning out Latino and black voters, including some of the 700,000 black Georgians who were eligible to vote but unregistered at the time. This seemed like a real possibility. The trajectory of voter registrations since 2000 suggested as much--almost a million new nonwhite voters registered between 2000 and 2014 compared with just over 111,000 new white voters--and in 2014, Stacey Abrams, Georgia's house minority leader, launched the New Georgia Project, an ambitious effort to register minorities. But in the end, Nunn lost to Perdue roughly 53 percent to 45 percent. ""Nunn's main problem in 2014 was simple: turnout, particularly turnout among the Democratic base,"" says Tharon Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia. ""She did not do enough to motivate that base nor did she do enough to appeal to the hundreds of thousands of historically white Democratic voters who have not voted for a Democrat statewide since 2002."" Indeed, Nunn won 26 percent of the white vote, short of the 30 percent of white voters her campaign estimated she would need to have a real chance of winning. Her loss in 2014 and the returns from 2012, in which Obama lost Georgia by roughly the same margin and did worse with white Georgians than any Democratic candidate since 1972, show that whites still must constitute a sizable part of any Democratic coalition statewide, despite Georgia's changing electoral base. Given Trump's significant lead over Clinton with white voters nationally and given the economic malaise of the working-class white voters in industrial sections of Georgia outside the state's growth centers, one might expect Trump both to sweep the white voters Clinton would need and to register many new ones. As Nate Cohn wrote in 2014, it is often forgotten that there are actually far more unregistered but eligible white voters than there are unregistered but eligible nonwhites. But the latest polling from Georgia suggests that Clinton is already doing better with white Georgians than Obama did in either 2008 or 2012 and better than John Kerry did back in 2004. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll released on Friday shows she's losing Georgia whites by 37 percentage points. That would seem abysmal if it weren't for the fact that Obama lost white Georgians by 60 points in 2012 and by 54 points in 2008. Kerry also lost whites by 54 points in 2004.* It's still unclear why Clinton seems to be doing relatively well with white Georgians, but if these numbers hold and if minorities turn out in droves, Clinton could have a very real shot at winning the state. Those are still big ifs. The state's voting laws might well suppress minority turnout, and at the moment Clinton isn't even within striking distance of the Nunn campaign's 30 percent target for white voters. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll shows that Clinton currently has the support of 23 percent of Georgia's white voters in a straight head-to-head with Trump and 20 percent of them with third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein included. Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia who's monitored the state's politics for decades, thinks that difference is important. ""She's going to have to count on libertarians siphoning off a share of the white vote,"" he says. ""And that could happen. Although polls this far out show third-party candidates doing better than they actually do on election day."" Just this week, the Clinton campaign told Georgia Democrats it would be hiring more field organizers in the state, and the New Georgia Project announced it has registered 70,000 new minority voters this year. These are both signs that Democratic organizing efforts in Georgia will be serious, if small relative to efforts in states more important to the electoral picture. It's plausible that these moves, combined with the effect of the third-party candidates on the ticket and Democratic turnout spurred by Trump's anomalous candidacy, could be enough to put Clinton just over the top. But it's the deep changes in Georgia's makeup that have truly brought a Clinton victory into the realm of possibility. *Correction, Aug. 11, 2016: This story has been edited to remove an inaccurate characterization of a FiveThirtyEight article.
