The Fox News host had warmed up the audience with his usual mixture of throwing foam footballs into the crowd and doing an extended Bill Clinton impression that would have been tiresome in 1991. And now it was time to get to what truly was the ""elephant in the room"" on the first day of the Conservative Political Action Conference: the extraordinary race for the Republican presidential primary. The word Trump was uttered maybe two or three times throughout the opening day of the annual conservative conference, as though the ongoing presidential race was merely a fictional subplot on a TBS political drama. ""How many of you here support Ted Cruz?"" Hannity asked. Loud cheers erupted from the conservative crowd. ""How many of you here support Donald Trump?"" An extraordinary wave of boos arose. ""How many of you like Marco Rubio?"" Mostly cheers, some boos mixed in. ""How many of you in this room want John Kasich to win?"" A prevailing sense of indifference, tilting toward boos. ""I would say, in this order: Cruz, Trump, Rubio, Kasich, right?"" The wrongness of that brought itself some boos, but Hannity moved on. Sean Hannity is a Trump ... what's the word here ... shill. Near the end of Hannity's warmup spiel--after he said he wished Mitt Romney were ""as strong against Barack Hussein Obama as he was today"" against Trump--he asked the crowd to stand up and pledge to support the Republican nominee for president, even if it's Trump. Most of the crowd did. But they sure didn't like the guy at all once the debate began. Cruz got cheers for anything he said--and since he had a strong debate, that's sensible--and Rubio got cheers mostly when he was going after Donald Trump. Trump got cheers when he talked about the wall. Otherwise, except for the stray fan here or there in a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat, Trump was the enemy. ""There is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections. There is no doubt about that. The numbers are there,"" Rubio said early on. ""Here is what the numbers also say: Two-thirds of the people who cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you. They do not want you to be our nominee."" The crowd signaled its approval. CPAC-ers also appreciated Rubio's mentioning of how Trump's clothing line is produced in China and Mexico, and strongly disapproved when Trump went after Rubio as ""this little guy"" or when he would say that ""the real con artist is Sen. Marco Rubio."" Though CPAC attendees would certainly take Rubio, ""the establishment candidate,"" over Trump, it doesn't mean they're particularly excited about him. During the first commercial of the debate, former Sen. Rick Santorum, a failed candidate again this cycle turned Rubio supporter, came onstage to sing the praises of his endorsee. He did not receive much of a response. But CPAC is Cruz's crowd. These are movement conservatives, and Cruz has run a campaign--and a career--as the platonic ideal of a movement conservative candidate. After Rubio and Fox debate moderator Megyn Kelly teamed up on Trump over the scandal that is Trump University, Cruz jumped in for his piece: ""Megyn, let me ask the voters at home: Is this the debate you want playing out in the general election? The stakes in this election are too high. ... And if we nominate Donald, we're going to spend the spring, the fall, and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial."" The cheers rolled in. ""Oh, stop it,"" Trump responded. He continued trying to talk over Cruz. ""Donald, learn not to interrupt,"" Cruz said. ""It's not complicated. Count to 10, Donald. Count to 10."" That did the trick. Cruz dug in:"	Watching the Fox News Debate at CPAC With a Room Full of Die-Hard Movement Conservatives

I was ready for the rending of garments and the drawing of lines in the proverbial sand. Instead, even as the rise of Donald Trump has split Republican politicians and conservative movement leaders, among their putative followers, a strange, subdued sense of business as usual prevailed. The National Review was giving out T-shirts emblazoned with its ""Against Trump"" cover, but I didn't see anyone wearing them. If anything, CPAC demonstrated afresh how much distance there is between conservative intellectuals and the right's activist foot soldiers. Grace Germany, age 79, is traveling around the country volunteering for Ted Cruz, but she thought it was a mistake to be too harsh in criticizing Trump. ""He has broadened our party,"" she told me. ""Isn't that what people want? And then we're going to blast them? What are we going to do, narrow our party to a bunch of social crazies?"" (I was surprised to hear a Cruz supporter be so dismissive of the religious right, but Germany says she leans libertarian.) Should Trump be nominated, ""I would help him, definitely,"" said Germany. ""And I would have to look at the good side of him. And the good side is the man's been a very successful American."" CPAC itself doesn't seem eager to air the conflict in the conservative ranks. Even as a Thursday New York Times headline screamed, ""Open Warfare: G.O.P. Leaders vs. Trump,"" the GOP leaders at CPAC hardly mentioned him. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum didn't say his name once. Neither did Ben Sasse, the Nebraska Republican senator who has made headlines for his anti-Trump stance. Speaking in Utah on Thursday, Mitt Romney blasted Trump as ""phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University."" But onstage at CPAC, Romney's former running mate, Paul Ryan, had an anodyne dialogue about conservative approaches to poverty reduction. It's surreal, this silence about the biggest issue in conservatism at a huge conservative convention. It's also evidence that the movement, such as it is, is far from ready to unite against Trump. That's partly because many people in the conservative grassroots love him. Susan Najvar, a grandmother from southern Texas and a fan of Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, used to support Cruz, but says she was disappointed in 2014, when he joined Glenn Beck in bringing clothes and toys to migrant children at the Mexican border. ""We said, 'That's it,' "" she told me. Now she's a passionate Trump backer. ""Where we live, those people down there are so fed up, they don't know what do,"" she says. She describes her community being transformed by immigration: ""We go into Wal-Mart and they're speaking Spanish. And we turn around, my husband and I, and say, 'We're in China!' "" Meanwhile, some CPAC attendees who abhor Trump are nevertheless prepared to vote for him in the general election. William Temple, a Georgia pastor who parades around CPAC in Revolutionary War garb, plans to lead a walkout when Trump takes the stage of the convention on Saturday. He calls him a ""Mussolini-like figure,"" and holds out hope that Cruz could still prevail electorally. ""God still has a plan,"" Temple told me. ""And if he wants Ted Cruz, heaven and earth won't stop Ted Cruz."" Trump, he says, ""could have a heart attack tomorrow. Who knows?"" Yet absent an act of God, Temple doesn't want to see Trump lose the nomination at a brokered convention. ""That would result in a rebellion,"" he says. If Trump is ultimately the nominee, he can count on Temple's vote, even if he does seem like a fascist. ""If Trump is my only choice, I will hold my nose like I did when I voted for Romney and I voted for McCain,"" he says. It's as if Trump, for all his fascist tendencies, is really just another RINO, not all that different from Jeb Bush, who Temple protested at last year's CPAC. Others see Trump as a threat of a much higher order, and are determined not to vote for him no matter what; often, it's hard for them even to speak to Trump sympathizers. ""I've walked by a few people that, six months ago, we might have had a 20-minute conversation in the hallway, and now there's barely a nod,"" says the conservative radio host Steve Deace, who recently wrote a column titled ""Why I Will #NeverTrump."" ""That's what happens when you rally behind a personality instead of your principles."" Perhaps some people at CPAC aren't talking to each other about Trump because they're no longer talking to each other at all. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	No, Conservatives Are Not Ready to Unite Against Trump
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/mitt_romney_s_only_weapon_against_donald_trump.html	"Donald Trump is a moral monster. He wants to deport America's 11 million unauthorized immigrants and build a wall on the Mexican border. He wants to kill the children of suspected terrorists and bring torture back to American intelligence gathering. He wants to ban Muslims (including citizens) from entering the United States, and he openly courts white supremacists for support. And yet, he is leading the Republican race for president, with more votes and delegates than anyone else in the race. For Republican elites, this fact is intolerable, which is why Mitt Romney--former Massachusetts governor, two-time presidential candidate, and one-time nominee--stepped to the plate on Thursday to oppose Trump's march to the nomination with a speech at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. His case was simple: ""[I]f we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished."" To that point, Romney attacked Trump on all fronts. He blasted him on domestic policy. ""His proposed 35 percent tarifflike penalties would instigate a trade war that would raise prices for consumers, kill export jobs, and lead entrepreneurs and businesses to flee America,"" Romney said. ""His tax plan, in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt."" Romney then hit him on foreign policy. ""Trump's bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies. Insulting all Muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in the urgent fight against ISIS,"" he said. He made real and effective digs at Trump's business acumen--""His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them""--and questioned Trump's intelligence and honesty, aiming straight at Trump's appeal. ""Dishonesty is Trump's hallmark,"" said Romney. ""His imagination must not be married to real power."" Romney was strong and confident. He was detailed and specific. But he wasn't effective. For all of his vehemence and disgust, Romney fell short with his saturation attack on Trump, for all the reasons that most GOP attacks have missed the mark. To start, there's no self-awareness. Romney didn't say a word about his aggressive play for Trump's endorsement in the 2012 presidential election. You can watch the press conference, where an effusive Romney hailed Trump as a figure par excellence: ""There are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life. This is one of them. Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight. I am so honored and pleased to have his endorsement."" This wasn't a throwaway moment in Romney's campaign. By that point, Trump was known for his racist ""birtherism"" and careless demagoguery. Romney chose to ignore this to win modest support from the GOP base. And by chasing Trump, Romney helped legitimize him as a figure in the Republican Party. To have any credibility in his present crusade against Trump, Romney needed to apologize. He needed to own his mistake and make that awareness a departure point for his case against ""the Donald""--a warning, of sorts, from someone who was taken in by Trump and his charms. Romney didn't do this. Instead, well after his speech, he sent a tweet. ""If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement,"" said Romney, ignoring Trump's birtherism. But then, Romney doesn't seem to fully understand Trump's appeal to Republican voters. Racism is one part of it. The other is deep economic insecurity, fueled by years of declining wages and supercharged by the Great Recession. Which is why Romney's attack on economics--Trump refuses to ""reform entitlements""--is a misfire. Far from undermining Trump, it emphasizes his appeal: that he'll protect retirement programs and bring security to middle-class (white) Americans. Trump's voters don't want to fight for survival in the free market. They want protection. They want to be safe. By themselves, these mistakes weren't fatal. The fact that a former GOP presidential nominee is speaking against a prospective one is almost enough--this is the dynamic that presages a failed campaign in November--and Romney deserves credit for it. But he undermines this by making a moral case against Trump that's still subordinate to other concerns. Rather than ask Republicans to reject Trump because he's immoral, Romney (and other Republicans) harp on one particular point: Trump will lose the election. ""A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as Hillary Clinton must not become president,"" said Romney ""But a Trump nomination enables her victory."" This is the unshielded exhaust pipe of the elite Republican argument against Trump--the fatal flaw that undermines the entire structure. First, there's the fact that if the core objection is partisan--to stop Hillary Clinton--then Romney is a terrible messenger. As the GOP nominee in 2012, he didn't just lose to Barack Obama, he lost badly, in an election that the party sold as a cakewalk, where Americans would welcome Republicans as liberators from a failed administration. They were wrong. And now, Republican voters believe Trump is their best chance to beat Democrats in the fall. After all, he's a fighter. Just look at his response to Romney's speech, mocking Romney for seeking his support: ""I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees.' He would have dropped to his knees."" Instead of making the morality of the case subordinate to the electoral calculation, Romney and other anti-Trump Republicans need to make the election subordinate to morality. If Trump is more than a threat to the GOP--if he, as Romney says would lead this nation ""into the abyss""--then Republicans need to say they're willing to lose the election, and hand the Oval Office to Hillary Clinton, if it means stopping Trump. They don't have to endorse Clinton, but they need to say that, if Trump is the nominee, they will not support him. It's the only step that might shatter Trump's coalition, or--in the fall--keep party unity from giving Trump a fighting chance, ending his viability as a general election candidate. It is a terrible choice to have to make for the party men and women of the GOP. But if Romney is right--if Trump is a threat to American democracy itself--then it's the only weapon they have left.

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/cpac_2016_won_t_impact_the_presidential_election.html	"The last time the Conservative Political Action Conference was held amidst a Republican presidential primary, the pressure was on Mitt Romney to convince conservatives that he was their guy. It was 2012, and the soft front-runner had just lost nominating contests to former Sen. Rick Santorum in Minnesota, Missouri, and Colorado--the latest sign that the conservative movement had yet to fall in line behind that cycle's establishment candidate. Romney met privately at CPAC with about 30 influential members of the movement to reassure them that his connection to conservatism was not an act. Romney was so eager to prove that he was one of them that, in his Friday morning speech, he memorably described his gubernatorial record as ""severely conservative."" The question that dogged Romney throughout the 2012 primary, and prevented him from quickly wrapping up the nomination against a pathetically weak field, was whether he was an acceptable vessel for the conservative movement. CPAC, that movement's largest annual gathering, was the natural place to adjudicate this. It was a central moment in the primary. Is Donald Trump conservative enough? is not a question this year's front-runner seems preoccupied with--and he's dominating anyway. That means that CPAC 2016, which begins in earnest on Thursday, isn't nearly as important this time around. To look at the schedule for the three-day conference is to look at a movement in denial. There's no indication on paper that a television-performing nationalist is overthrowing conservatism as the engine of the Republican Party. One early Thursday panel, ""Three Approaches to Conservatism,"" featuring Sen. Ben Sasse, Rick Santorum, Sen. Ted Cruz's chief of staff, and libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, is probably not going to delve into the conservative literature behind Donald Trump's approach of calling his rivals mean names on television. Speaker Paul Ryan's session about conservative approaches to poverty will offer few ideas that migrate into Donald Trump's nonexistent policy platform. What use does a panel like ""Political Islam: How Patriotic American Muslims Defy the Radical Islamists"" have in a party whose voters, encouraged by Trump, don't believe that there is such a group as ""patriotic American Muslims""? The panel on ""How to Grow Conservatism"" will have its work cut out for it, now that Trump's candidacy has revealed how the real motivating force behind the Republican Party is nationalism and #winning instead of ideological conservatism. If the nomination was being fought over candidates' fidelity to movement conservatism, Trump would be dead. For the last month or so, Ted Cruz, a real movement guy, has been relentlessly prosecuting the case that Donald Trump is unreliably conservative. Trump defends Planned Parenthood; he's argued that he'd broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal from a position of neutrality; he has donated to dozens of Democrats and Democratic groups in the past; he believes eminent domain is just terrific; and he does not really speak at all about reducing the size of the federal government. Cruz has made this case ably, and it hasn't affected Trump's strength. It's helped Cruz win pluralities of self-described ""very conservative"" voters in primaries, but that's pennies compared to what Trump has built. Expect Trump to be greeted with some coldness at CPAC when he delivers his speech Saturday morning. He will throw out some sops to conservatives, mostly about his immigration proposals. But he doesn't need to. The conservative movement's opinion is of little value to Trump. That is going to make this CPAC at once a historic snapshot of a movement in existential crisis, and unusually irrelevant to the outcome of the Republican presidential race.

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/donald_trump_s_presidency_would_create_a_deep_recession.html	"Donald Trump has formidably strong support among working-class voters, who showed up for him in a big way on Super Tuesday. He's cultivated that following by making grandiose promises not just about isolationism but also about the economy. Trump's mantra about making America great again is, in large part, centered on economic growth, and specifically on jobs. Of the policy positions he spells out on his website, three of the five are tied to the economy. He wants drastic changes to our trade relations with China, which is part of his promise to restore all the manufacturing jobs lost to other countries. His tax plan will ""create jobs and incentives of all kinds while simultaneously growing the economy."" His theory of immigration reform ""puts the needs of working people first."" Beyond the appeals to racism and xenophobia, his message is all about restoring the economic prospects of Americans who have seen them decline. But if President Trump puts these plans into effect, there is no way they would make jobs great again. Instead, they would most likely throw us into a recession. How does Trump want to reform relations with China? One big plank is imposing huge tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S., possibly as large as 45 percent. He would also somehow crack down on China's lax labor regulations and declare the country a currency manipulator, thereby ensuring more fairness in a global playing field in which Americans have lost too many jobs overseas. ""Jobs and factories will stop moving offshore and instead stay here at home,"" he assures his followers. ""The economy will boom."" One study found that the country lost somewhere around 2 million jobs between 1999 and 2011 to trade competition with China--about 10 percent of all manufacturing job losses during that time. But many of those jobs are likely gone for good and have moved on from China to even lower-wage countries like Vietnam and Indonesia. What tariffs are certain to do is hurt Americans' wallets. When Trump says the U.S. loses $58 billion to Mexico in trade, he neglects to mention what we get in return for that money: cheap goods. Tariffs on those products would drive up their prices, forcing Americans who are not seeing much in the way of wage growth to spend more for the same things. There was a natural experiment with just this policy in 2009, when the U.S. levied a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires. That move saved a maximum of 1,200 jobs while it raised costs for Americans buying those tires by $1.1 billion in one year alone. Under Trump's plan, China would also likely retaliate, as it did against the tire tariff with its own on American chicken imports, costing our exporters about $1 billion. That would only hurt American companies, who would likely cut back on jobs. Next, Trump's tax plan. The candidate declared that his plan would offer the poor and middle class relief while it went after the ""hedge fund guys"" by changing the capital gains tax rate on investment income. But the details didn't bear out his big promises. According to the Tax Policy Center, under Trump's scheme, the poorest fifth of the country would get less than 1 percent of the benefits of his plan over a decade while the top fifth would get more than two-thirds. Yet it would cost $9.5 trillion in revenue--a far larger bite than under Reagan or even George W. Bush. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation found that Trump's claim that the plan will be revenue-neutral not to be true ""under any scenario."" There's little reason to think that big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy will lead to a supercharged economy. There's certainly no evidence that higher rates have a negative impact on economic growth, and in fact, growth has historically been faster under higher top marginal rates. What massive tax cuts for the wealthy do accomplish, on the other hand, is faster growth in income inequality, which hurts economic growth. Third and last, we turn to Trump's brand of immigration reform, which wouldn't help the economy either. Economists have found little negative effect on Americans' wages from immigration. On the other hand, mass deportation and a blockade against immigrants trying to come into the country could have serious negative consequences, knocking $1.6 trillion off of our gross domestic product. Immigrants are projected to provide nearly all growth in the labor force for the next 40 years, but deporting them would shrink it by 6.4 percent over 20 years. Of course, it would also cost a lot of money to deport so many people--about $400 billion to $600 billion. Overall, Trump's prescriptions are pretty pricy: Added altogether, the conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that his policies would add between $11.7 trillion and $15.1 trillion to the national debt, including interest payments. Deficits in and of themselves don't necessarily harm growth, and can in fact simulate it, particularly when the country is climbing out of a recession. The outcomes depend on how the money is spent; Trump's plans aren't likely to involve productive expenditures. And if Trump wants to deliver on his promise to make his plans revenue-neutral, he'll have to find huge cost savings elsewhere, cutting spending by trillions. Given that he's said he won't touch Medicare and Social Security, he would have to slash current spending by more than three-quarters. Those cuts would all but decimate most government programs, including those that spur the economy such as infrastructure projects, job training, and a safety net that boosts economic productivity and mobility, to name only a few. There's no telling what a President Trump could actually get passed if he were to enter the White House. But if he got even part of what he wanted, we'd all be in for a very rocky economic ride.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/trump_s_super_tuesday_voters_tell_us_about_the_race_to_come.html	"For just a moment, it looked like Marco Rubio had a big win. When polls closed in Virginia, he was tied with Donald Trump, a surprise after a week of polls showing Trump with a double-digit lead in the state. But it was a false alarm. Trump had swept Virginia, along with Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, and Vermont. The only thing Rubio had to show for days of anti-Trump bluster was a modest win in Minnesota, called at the end of the night. If the Republican establishment went into Super Tuesday ready to fight Trump to the nails, they left it cowed and defeated. He's not quite the presumptive nominee, but he's close. At the same time, it's important to say that Trump didn't win a majority of the Super Tuesday vote, or outperform previous leading candidates. The real estate mogul won 34 percent of all Republicans who voted on Tuesday, compared to 26.5 percent for Ted Cruz and 22.3 percent for Marco Rubio. This makes Trump less of a dominant candidate than Mitt Romney in 2012 (who won nearly 40 percent of the Super Tuesday popular vote against a wide field) and John McCain in 2008, who won 42 percent, against a smaller one of three opponents. But Trump's relative weakness doesn't mean he's vulnerable. While Trump isn't as strong as previous front-runners, his coalition has a similar shape. Take Virginia, a varied state where Trump won with 34.7 percent of the vote. The Washington, D.C., suburbs aside, Trump won every region of the state, from exurban Northern Virginia and the central region of the state, to the vote-rich, eastern Tidewater and the Richmond metropolitan area. More important than that, however, is the ideological and socio-economic shape of his coalition. Trump won ""very conservative"" and ""somewhat conservative"" voters in Virginia, and placed second with self-described Republican moderates. He won 39 percent of white evangelical Christians and 42 percent of people with military service. He won a whopping 47 percent of Virginia Republicans without a college degree, and most voters making less than $50,000 a year. This pattern plays out everywhere. Trump dominates in the middle and downscale sections of the electorate, among Republicans who are ""somewhat conservative,"" and even those who identify as highly ideological. And while he has a difficult time winning new voters--few who decided in the past week broke to Trump--he won support early and held it in the face of attacks and pushback. With a broad-based and durable coalition behind him, Trump can't be easily stopped, even as he underperforms previous Republican front-runners. Things could change if the GOP consolidated around a single candidate (like Cruz, who won Texas and Oklahoma on Super Tuesday), but that understates the extent to which Trump might pull former Rubio or Kasich supporters into his orbit. He is a juggernaut, and he's charging quickly to the nomination. With that said, we shouldn't mistake Trump's strength in the Republican primary for any national advantage. While Trump's moderate, conciliatory post-victory press conference sounds like an effective message in a general election, it's also happening in the favorable context of a win, in a contest where--the past week aside--he hasn't been bloodied. Trump is still the man who called for the deportation of 11 million people, still the man who wants to ban Muslims from the United States, still the man who refused to disavow the Ku Klux Klan, still the man who was sued for discriminating against blacks and who called for the execution of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. Put simply, he is a toxic figure with deep unfavorables among large swaths of the American electorate. And while he could appeal to disaffected white voters--blue-collar Democrats and alienated Republicans--there's no guarantee he could do this without sparking a backlash among blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, and a whole host of other groups offended and repulsed by Trump's sexism, racism, and vulgarity. Nor is there evidence he could overcome the likely deluge of attacks on his dealings and business record, especially if high-profile Republican politicians begin to disavow him in the face of his nomination. Anyone who wins a major party nomination can win the presidency. That doesn't mean it's likely. Trump is on the path to success in the GOP. But he's still a long way from success with the entire American people. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	What We Now Know About the Trump Coalition
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/rubio_cruz_and_kasich_will_all_stay_in_the_gop_race_why.html	"In case you hadn't picked up the latest goalpost shift from the losing Sen. Marco Rubio campaign, we have an update: Winning a majority of delegates doesn't seem to be something it expects to do, especially after another ho-hum night on Super Tuesday. The goal now is to deny Trump from reaching an outright majority of delegates and then oust him after the first ballot at the convention. This isn't just the backup plan anymore; it is the plan. This means that it might be better for all of the non-Donald Trump candidates to stay in the race and pick off potential wins from Trump here and there. Interesting theory. And definitely one born out of necessity, since Super Tuesday's results made clear that the field won't consolidate any time soon. But does it work? ""Rubio and his advisers have described an ugly, drawn-out path to the Republican nomination,"" Politico reported on Tuesday. ""Their strategy relies on picking off enough delegates to hold Trump below the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination on the first ballot at the convention."" Politico also reported that Terry Sullivan, a top Rubio adviser, told donors, lobbyists, and other members of the dying Republican establishment in a Tuesday morning meeting ""that it would be mathematically impossible for Donald Trump to get to 1,237 delegate votes by the end of April, according to multiple attendees."" (Sullivan must be aware that there are contests in May and June, including a small state called ""California,"" but maybe the dopey donors aren't.) If blocking Trump from winning a majority of bound delegates is the goal, then it could make sense in the short term to keep everyone in the race, since any delegates that Trump doesn't win count as a victory. Rubio would not have defeated Trump in Texas, so it was useful for Cruz to stay in and take a majority of those delegates for himself. Rubio won't be able to defeat Trump in Ohio, so Kasich can handle that task. A split field makes it impossible for one candidate to gain a majority over Trump. But it helps to stop Trump himself from getting a majority. The ""everyone stay!"" strategy appeared to have some adherents Tuesday night. As Time's Zeke Miller points out, if the goal is to stop Trump from hitting 1,237, a split field can be of use through March 15. But then there are the problems. Even if some contests allocate delegates proportionately starting March 15, most of them don't. They simply do not. So Trump would win most winner-take-all states with pluralities in a field split between Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich. Even if the field did winnow to a one-on-one, Trump would probably still win enough of those contests to secure a majority. This is what it means to be a dominating front-runner: You've closed off all paths for your challengers. Even if either the all-in or one-on-one strategies for denying Trump a majority of delegates somehow worked, few seem to have considered what happens next. Suppose Donald Trump gets close to a majority of delegates--and well beyond Rubio--but some sort of establishment convention coup goes down and magically installs Rubio as the nominee. Do the plotters believe that this will go over well with Trump supporters? Trump wouldn't be the one destroying the Republican Party in that case. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	The GOP's Deeply Flawed, Post-Super Tuesday Strategy Won't Work
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/twitter_commentary_about_the_super_tuesday.html	Happy Super Tuesday! After months of speculation and an inconclusive series of early primaries, today's marathon of nominating contests will clarify which candidate in each party has the clearest path to his or her party's nomination. Despite Bernie Sanders' surprising rise in the polls since the start of the year, Hillary Clinton is expected to take home most of the 865 delegates up for grabs across 13 Democratic contests (including American Samoa and the Democrats Abroad primary) and secure the position of the presumptive nominee. If the polls bear out on the Republican side as well, Donald Trump will likely take away the lion's share of the 595 delegates available across 11 contests. The question is: How will other Republican campaigns react if this happens? Who will drop out? Who will dig in and spin? Now you can watch the spin in real time as the results trickle in. Below, you'll see left-leaning commentators on the left and right-leaning commentators on the right. Let the spin begin! See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 presidential election.

That's what Republican politicians have told themselves and the public for eight years. It began before Obama took office, when Republicans blamed him for a recession that started on their watch. Now they're blaming Obama for the rise of their own presidential front-runner, Donald Trump. The delusion that Obama caused Trump has been building since last year. This week, it reached the last bastion of rationality on the right: New York Times columnist Ross Douthat. Douthat has a long track record of fairness and good sense. When the madness infects even him, it's time to clear the air. No, Obama didn't cause Trump. What caused Trump was the GOP's decision to negate Obama in every way, and thereby become the party of Trump. As president, Obama was never a radical leftist. He extended the drone program, the Iran sanctions, and the bailout-recovery policies of George W. Bush. He proposed to cut the national debt through a higher ratio of spending cuts to tax increases than even Bush's father had accepted and Republican voters preferred. Obama embraced the Heritage Foundation's idea of imposing personal responsibility for health care costs through an individual mandate to buy insurance. He decimated al-Qaida's leadership, built up troop strength in Afghanistan, and killed Osama bin Laden. Nevertheless, Republicans opposed Obama at every turn. Whatever he embraced, they rejected. They refused to compromise on health care or offer a realistic alternative. They staged dozens of votes to repeal the new health-insurance law in its entirety. They forced a federal shutdown to protest the law. They took the nation's credit rating hostage in a debt-ceiling showdown. They urged Iran to reject a nuclear nonproliferation agreement with the United States. In 2012, Republicans lost the Hispanic vote and the presidential election. An internal autopsy report on this defeat, commissioned by the Republican National Committee, concluded: ""We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform."" Instead, in 2013 and 2014, House Republicans killed immigration reform. Today, Sen. Ted Cruz hounds Sen. Marco Rubio for having consorted with Obama to support the bill, and Rubio dutifully renounces it. If Obama had been a leftist, the GOP's policy of negating him on every issue might have positioned Republicans in the mainstream. Instead, because Obama was a moderate, the GOP's negation strategy pushed it toward the fringe. Obama was for fiscal responsibility and compromise, so Republicans were for absolutism and drama, risking a federal shutdown and a credit default. Obama was for respecting the Supreme Court, so the GOP was for defying judicial orders. Obama was for using sanctions to pressure Iran into a nuclear deal, so Republicans were for scrapping the deal and daring Iran to provoke a war. Obama, like Bush, was for drawing a clear distinction between terrorists and Muslims. So Republicans were for blurring that distinction. In Trump, Republican voters have found their anti-Obama. Trump spurns not just political correctness, but correctness of any kind. He lies about Muslims and 9/11, insults women and people with disabilities, accuses a judge of bias for being Hispanic, and hurls profanities. Trump validates the maxim that in presidential primaries, the opposition party tends to choose a candidate who differs temperamentally from the incumbent. Obama is an adult. Therefore, Republicans are nominating a child. The GOP's predicament isn't just that Trump is leading the fight for the nomination. It's that his only viable opponents are men who claim he's not conservative enough. In rallies and interviews, Cruz and Rubio call Trump soft on immigration and gun control. They denounce him for praising Planned Parenthood's work against cervical cancer and breast cancer. They're outraged that Trump has said he supports government-funded health care to prevent sick people from dying in the streets--as though there were some way other than government-funded health care to guarantee that sick people don't die in the streets. How did the GOP end up in this madness? By twisting itself to thwart and vilify Obama. Cruz paints the president as a traitor ""who doesn't believe in the mission of our military and who undermines them at every step."" Rubio, incensed at Obama's inclusive language, repeatedly excoriates him for ""talking about discrimination against Muslims."" Both senators pledge to shred the Iran agreement on their first day in office--apparently out of spite, since renouncing the agreement would free Iran of its nonproliferation commitments without recovering the money that was relinquished in sanctions relief. What has Obama done to provoke this psychosis? Douthat says he abused executive authority. But that's circular: Obama resorted to executive action when Republicans blocked the normal channels of government. The GOP's sabotage began the moment Obama took office, and it exceeds anything done to previous presidents. I'm hard-pressed to come up with an innocent explanation. The immigration debate illustrates the madness. Four years ago, Republicans campaigned against illegal immigration but emphasized their support for legal immigration. Now that distinction is all but lost. Cruz, who has renounced his prior advocacy of visas for foreign workers, complained at a rally in Oklahoma on Sunday that ""the Democrats support immigration."" Even Douthat, in his column on Obama, writes nostalgically, ""It was possible to be a culturally conservative skeptic of mass immigration in the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton. Not so anymore."" Note the absence of the word illegal. So, yes, Obama led to Trump. But that's only because the Republican Party decided to be what Obama wasn't. And what Obama wasn't--insecure, bitter, vindictive, xenophobic, sectarian--is what the GOP, in the era of Trump, has become. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

The primary calendar will not help Trump's opponents stage a comeback; if anything, it helps Trump, who has the ability to land a knockout blow on his most viable competitor, Sen. Marco Rubio, in the March 15 Florida primary. Trump's support keeps growing as he continues winning states--imagine that!--to the extent that, at this point, it may not matter whether the anti-Trump field consolidates or not. CNN's latest national poll finds Trump's support at 49 percent to Rubio's 16 and Sen. Ted Cruz's 15, and Trump wallops each senator in a head-to-head. Unless Rubio, Cruz, and affiliated anti-Trump outside groups can persuade the masses that Trump is a fascistic con man by the winner-take-all-states on March 15, Trump is en route to an easy majority of delegates. This means that it will soon be time for Republican leaders, whose preferences primary voters cared very little about this cycle, to choose: Are they in or out? Will they sign on with the figure who hijacked their party and whose nomination threatens down-ballot races, or will they disavow him and begin looking toward 2020? There is no obvious answer, and if the early sorting process tells us anything, it's that everyone's for themselves. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, had plenty to gain by signing up early with Trump--perhaps vice presidential or Attorney General consideration. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, meanwhile, has a safe Senate seat and hopes that his party will remain the Senate majority in the next Congress, so he loses relatively little for speaking his conservative conscience and saying that he'll never support Trump. And Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions endorsed Trump because he genuinely shares a nativist passion with Trump on their mutual driving issue of immigration. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is encouraging candidates to denounce the Republican presidential nominee if that's what it takes to preserve his Senate majority. McConnell, as the New York Times reported this weekend, ""has laid out a plan that would have lawmakers break with Mr. Trump explicitly in a general election."" He has freed senators to ""run negative ads about Mr. Trump to create space between him and Republican senators seeking re-election"" and has ""raised the possibility of treating Mr. Trump's loss as a given and describing a Republican Senate to voters as a necessary check on a President Hillary Clinton."" This makes a lot of sense: After two terms of the Obama administration, Republicans are comfortable serving as the opposition party. They could block the Clinton administration from achieving much of anything, as they know from experience. Though they would (theoretically!) have to grant Clinton a Supreme Court seat, their control of the Senate would give them leverage to demand a more centrist candidate. And since Hillary Clinton is not a very popular political figure, and Democrats will have held the presidency for three consecutive terms, the fundamentals for 2020 would be in Republicans' favor. There is a problem, though. Votes have been cast, and Trump has been winning them. This indicates that Republican voters like Donald Trump. For elected Republican leaders to disavow Trump as an official leadership position at this point is not just to disavow the opinions of many of their voters, but to disavow the very idea of nominating presidential candidates by primary. If the voters send party leaders a nominee that they don't want, and leaders' response is to disavow the nominee, what respect does that show for the process? This is the stuff from which party breakups are made. It would be much harder for Republicans to oust Clinton in 2020 if there's no longer any unified Republican coalition to speak of. This is why, despite all the handwringing, Republican leaders' consensus posture toward Trump is most likely going to be an extension of RNC chair Reince Priebus' posture toward Trump throughout the primary: Smile, damnit. License those individual senators to disavow Trump if his nomination violates either their conscience or, more importantly, their own political prospects. Otherwise, nominate the dude. Give him party resources throughout the general election. Go on television and say that Hillary Clinton is the real disaster in the race as a dodge to pretty much any question asked about Donald Trump. Lose, then regroup in 2020 and try to stop the Democrats' presidential winning streak at three. And hope that Trump, having found that the Republican Party treated him fairly in 2016, does not have any excuse to run again in 2020 as an independent."	What Republican Leaders Are Going to Do About Trump
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/bernie_sanders_loses_south_carolina_but_not_the_war.html	"CHARLESTON, S.C.--The only question with South Carolina and Hillary Clinton was the final margin. Would Clinton win by 20 points, following her lead in the polls, or would Bernie Sanders make this a close race? Would turnout meet 2008, or would it fall short, like in previous contests? By mid-Saturday night, with 91 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton held an almost 48-point advantage over Sanders, 73.5 percent to 23.9 percent. She swept every county, winning blacks 86 percent to 14 percent (surpassing Barack Obama's 2008 margin), winning whites 54 percent to 46 percent, and even winning very liberal voters. As with Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, she lagged with younger voters, losing them 46 percent to Sanders' 54 percent. Turnout was down from 2008 (361,000 versus 532,000), as it has been, but it's important to remember that the race between Clinton and Obama was much more competitive than the present one between Sanders and Clinton. Compared to 2004, a typical year, turnout is substantially up. And, it should be said, more voters backed Clinton than came out for Trump in last week's Republican primary. For insight into Clinton's overwhelming victory, it's worth looking to Orangeburg, a small and struggling town in the state's rural center, where both camps made final stops before voting on Saturday. There, at the annual oyster roast, before a mostly black audience of older and female voters, Clinton and Sanders made their closing arguments. As usual, Clinton promised to break down ""all of the barriers"" facing American voters and defend ""all rights"" from Republican attacks. And Sanders, as usual, pledged to transform American politics, breaking the power of big banks and bringing new guarantees--for college, for health care--to ordinary Americans. But these weren't parallel appearances. Clinton didn't just launch into her stump speech. In this almost archetypal political venue--a public picnic at a local fairgrounds--Clinton went retail with her politics, speaking to the particulars of Orangeburg and South Carolina writ large. Sanders, by contrast, did not. It was a microcosm of the entire South Carolina campaign. Clinton held rallies in the state and organized in the major cities of Greenville, Columbia, and Charleston, but a large part of her team's time and effort went toward less traveled regions, the rural regions where Barack Obama built his victory in 2008. Clinton spoke to isolated towns of low-income and working-class black Americans. Sanders stuck to massive rallies, which are effective for showing enthusiasm--especially among young voters--but not as ideal for persuading the working- and middle-class black women that determine primaries in South Carolina. They are the backbone of the state's Democratic Party; a loyal group that votes and volunteers out of proportion to their numbers in the electorate. Clinton focused on them--with surrogates like the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, and Eric Garner--and they responded in kind. Black women were 37 percent of the electorate in South Carolina and backed Clinton 89 percent to Sanders' 11 percent. Clinton's small-scale contact paid huge dividends. It's important to note the role of time in all of this. In addition to her past in the state, Clinton has spent years cultivating connections and relationships among South Carolina Democrats. She's also earned goodwill for working in Obama's administration. The only way Sanders could have overcome this is with more time and an effort that fully canvassed the state. Unfortunately for Sanders, he had neither, and his able campaign crashed against Clinton's powerful effort and deep support among voters and state Democratic leaders. What comes next? The scale of Clinton's win--and the depth of her support with black voters--alters the Super Tuesday picture. Before, conventional wisdom was that Clinton would win in states like Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and Arkansas, where the Democratic Party is disproportionately black. But her almost 9-to-1 victory--along with her performance in Nevada among Latinos--suggests a cleaner sweep, with a win in Texas and a closer contest Massachusetts and Minnesota, where black voters are an important part of the state's Democratic electorate. And for the March 5, 8, and 16 primaries--when Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio vote--Clinton's performance with black voters, as well as white voters in South Carolina's Appalachia, suggests a series of sweeps. The simple fact is that there aren't enough states like Iowa and New Hampshire--where whites are a majority of voters and the large bulk of the Democratic Party--to give Sanders the kinds of wins he needs to capture the nomination, or even make the fight as competitive as it was at the beginning of February. Despite his fundraising prowess and enthusiastic supporters, his strength is running low. That doesn't mean Sanders has been unsuccessful or that he should leave the race. An able competitor, Sanders has forced Clinton to sharpen her message and work for the nomination. And he's pulled her somewhat to the left, prompting her to embrace a public option for the Affordable Care Act and move in line with the base on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Keystone XL pipeline. Which is to say that, if Sanders' goal is to make the Democratic Party more ideological, he should stay in the game, pressuring Clinton and forcing further commitments to his agenda. Indeed, Sanders' campaign can serve as a base for other left-wing efforts to shape the Democratic Party. Now is the time to endorse down-ballot candidates, pressure less liberal Democrats, build a policy agenda, and lay a foundation for future candidates. In short, now is the time for Bernie Sanders to construct a Sanders wing of the Democratic Party that will push and advocate for social democracy. Politics never ends, and this Democratic primary is just one battle. If Sanders loses, it doesn't mean he has to forfeit the war. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/christie_s_trump_endorsement_might_finish_marco_rubio_off.html	"Just as Marco Rubio was getting his legs mocking Donald Trump and engendering widespread media boosterism for his efforts, the front-runner for the Republican nomination responded by drawing out Rubio's kryptonite. We can consider all sorts of reasons for why Chris Christie endorsed Trump on Friday, one day after a Republican debate in which Rubio seemed to knock the billionaire back on his heels: promise of a job in the Trump administration, sidling up to the near-inevitable winner, stylistic similarities or a Tri-State penchant for brawling. Really anything could have motivated him, except for Christie's stated reason that he believes Donald Trump would make an excellent president. What seems most likely, on the guttural level that spurs an establishment governor to make a decision to support a figure like Donald Trump for president, is that he despises Marco Rubio and enjoys thrashing him. If he can't do it through his own campaign anymore, he'll do it through someone else's. The fate of the Republican primary now rests, appropriately, on which candidate can level the more effective high school insults through March 15. The window for taking down Trump by pointing to the thinness of his policy positions, such as they are, ended the day Trump entered the race building a groundswell of support based almost entirely on personality. Rubio is calling Trump a con man, a possible pants-wetter, a profuse sweater, a poor speller, a repetitive dunce, a wimp who begged for Secret Service protection, and a trust-fund baby. And this is just the first 24 hours since he started to finally attack. Trump, meanwhile, has fewer insults for Rubio--two, really--but they're two great ones: ""choker"" and ""lightweight."" (Alternately spelled ""chocker"" and ""leightweight."") These two slurs are arguably more powerful than anything the Florida senator could level at Trump, and now he'll have Rubio's official tormentor to amplify the delivery. The most effective oppositional branding effort of this cycle has been Trump's coinage of ""low-energy"" for Jeb Bush. This did not make much practical sense. It is Trump, after all, who only has the energy to hold one campaign rally a day, while Bush was doing three or four. And yet it was so ... apt. Bush was an introvert from a tired old political dynasty whose style of politics lacked a certain motivating drive for the moment. ""Lightweight"" is to Rubio what ""low-energy"" was to Bush. It's unlikely that you're a lightweight if you were speaker of the Florida state House in your 30s, beat an establishment governor to become a senator, and now a few years later are in second-place position for the Republican presidential nomination. And yet there's an untested quality about Rubio that makes you wonder if he can do much more beyond speak rapidly. He's risk-averse, stage-managed, and when there's a battle--like over the comprehensive immigration reform bill that he co-authored but has now disowned--he eventually backs down. What makes ""lightweight"" work best, though, in the animalistic show of dominance that is this awful and hilarious primary, is his boyish appearance. ""Choker"" is the more acute line now with Christie's endorsement. It refers to a specifically damning moment that Rubio thought was behind him now. ""I watched Chris [Christie] do a number on [Rubio],"" Trump said in the press conference announcing the endorsement. ""Never seen a meltdown like that in my life. It's interesting about people who choke."" Choking allows Trump to employ familiar football imagery, which is easy for many voters to understand and appreciate:"	Chris Christie Is Marco Rubio's Kryptonite 
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/chris_christie_endorses_donald_trump_will_others_follow.html	"When he was still in the race, just a few weeks ago, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blasted Donald Trump as a terrible risk for the Republican Party--a straight line to President Hillary Clinton in 2017. Now, he has a different tune. ""He's rewriting the playbook of American politics because he is providing strong leadership that is not dependent upon the status quo,"" said Christie in his Friday afternoon endorsement. ""And so the best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November on that stage last night is undoubtedly Donald Trump."" It is not clear what Christie gains from endorsing Trump. The real estate mogul and reality star is still an uncertain bet for the general election. He could win, but he could just as likely lose in a landslide, not only precluding Christie from work in a future Republican administration, but ending his career in Republican politics, as the party turns on Trump's most high profile backers. Likewise, if Trump doesn't win the nomination, there's no chance Christie has any pull or place in a Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, or John Kasich administration. But the horse race aside, Christie's endorsement is breathtakingly cynical. For months, he attacked Trump for his ignorance and his bigotry, mocking his plan to ban Muslims from the United States. ""We do not need to endorse that type of activity, nor should we,"" said Christie during a December appearance on conservative talk radio host Michael Medved's show. ""You do not need to be banning Muslims from the country. That's, in my view, that's a ridiculous position and one that won't even be productive."" It was part of Christie's appeal as a moderate, reasonable Republican. Someone you could trust to appeal to all Americans and ignore the temptation of a hyper-nationalist demagogue. Either Christie didn't mean it, or his integrity is worth less than a modest chance at career advancement. As for Trump, he doesn't just gain a valuable surrogate--one eager to take the fight to Rubio, again--he gains legitimacy. The great question of a Donald Trump nomination is whether the Republican Party would get behind his campaign, or would it disown Trump as antithetical to the party's values? And for as much as Republicans have enabled Trump in his rise, it's also true that the mogul represents an existential threat to traditional control of the Republican Party. Backing him means taking that risk in the hope that he leads them to the White House. An endorsement from Christie, former chairman of the Republican Governors Association and avatar of the party's Northeastern faction, is a sign that, for some in the GOP establishment, Trump is an acceptable risk. Already, reports Robert Costa of the Washington Post, Christie is telling New Jersey insiders that Trump is the ""presumptive nominee and that he expects other governors, and GOP leaders to reveal endorsements soon."" If nothing else, this endorsement gives Trump the news cycle ahead of Super Tuesday. Instead of attacks and ridicule from Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, voters will hear how Trump is the choice of Chris Christie, how he's marching toward the nomination, and how now is the time to get on board."	Christie's Endorsement Signifies the GOP Establishment Is Beginning to Accept Trump
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/marco_rubio_finally_learned_how_to_attack_donald_trump.html	"On Thursday night's pre-Super Tuesday CNN debate, Sen. Marco Rubio probably had a strong enough performance to earn his roughly 10,000th ""IT'S OVER, RUBIO IS NOW PRESIDENT!"" cycle of overenthusiasm from the Rubio-industrial hype complex that has built up his sweaty, faltering candidacy throughout this campaign. We should remember, though, that Trump is still the dominant front-runner in the Republican race and his supporters are famously unperturbed by his common moments of astounding ludicrousness and fraudulence. Rubio still has only a slim chance of taking the nomination away from the billionaire. But, if it's ever going to happen, it's going to be because of what Rubio finally started doing on Thursday night. He went after Donald Trump relentlessly, without melting, and--this is critical--by having fun doing it. Fun! For a long time it seemed as if all the candidates not named Donald Trump had forgotten about the existence of ""fun""--probably because they were losing to Donald Trump, who has been hoarding all the fun to himself. Trump has been radiating fun. When stiff old Jeb Bush would say, ""You can't insult your way to the presidency, Donald,"" Trump would dismiss him with wry smile and a shooing motion, a pithy nonverbal insult. He realized that you can insult your way to the presidency--or at least to the Republican nomination--and it's time for everyone else to learn that too. So many of the earlier attempts to go after Trump have been stilted and lacking in imagination. Trump once supported single-payer health care! Yeah, so what, shut up. Trump supports eminent domain! Go away, muppet. Trump once said he thought Hillary Clinton was a good secretary of state! Whatever, you're losing in the polls. All of these items treat Trump like a conventional politician susceptible to collapse on the basis of conventional opposition research. But Trump's enduring popularity is based on his dominating personality, his ability to tower over the other mortals and break the rules they live by. So why not just make fun of the guy? Rubio dumped a lot of opposition research on Trump--about the immigrants who built Trump Tower and the foreign workers he's brought in to avoid paying American laborers over the years. Rubio wisely punctuated each of these lines with Googling instructions for viewers at home. But the most effective Rubio moments were the small jabs, the side-digs and jokes he threw in. While they were arguing over the fine Trump paid decades ago for bringing in Polish workers, Trump tried blowing it off by saying, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah. 38 years ago."" Rather than letting it end there, Rubio added, ""Oh, he lied 38 years ago. I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies."" When Rubio brought up the large inheritance he received from his father, Rubio said, ""Here's the guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan."" And then there was the big one. Trump was going on about his health care plan. First of all, it's not a ""plan."" (Though he's hardly unique among Republican candidates in terms of lacking a coherent alternative to the Affordable Care Act that covers a roughly equal number of people.) What he has are two thoughts that he pitches as the most novel, innovative health care ideas in history, when really they're just two of the three things that all Republicans have been talking about since the dawn of time--expanding health savings accounts and allowing insurers to sell across state lines. (The third is tort reform, but that may be too constricting for the litigious Trump's taste.) The moderators, and eventually Rubio, kept asking Trump to expand on his health care plan. Trump just reiterated the same snippets--""the lines around the states,"" as he puts it--and saying that it would be fantastic. ""Now he's repeating himself,"" Rubio said, bringing down the house with the cheeky reference to his own infamous debate moment in New Hampshire. ""No, no, no,"" Trump said, still trying to get out of it. Neither Rubio nor the audience would let him. ""I saw you repeat yourself five times, four seconds ago,"" Rubio added to sustained applause. ""We're going to have many different plans,"" Trump tried to say, only to be met with a ""he's done it again!"" At one point Rubio started drawing circles with his fingers, to illustrate the ""lines."" In that moment, he made Trump look like a fool. And he'll need to keep making Trump look like a fool, over and over, if he wants to salvage his candidacy. We learned Thursday night that he's pretty good at it. It makes all these months that he spent ignoring Trump because they were in different lanes, or because he hoped Trump would take out Cruz first, look like such wasted time. He should have been thinking all along: Trump is winning. Go after Trump. Have fun. Rubio gets it now, and a moment of clarity like this can be rejuvenating."

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/mitt_romney_can_t_save_the_gop_from_trump.html	"Mitt Romney's name has been bandied about in some quarters as a possible Republican savior: the man who could either enter the race at the last moment or emerge victorious during a contested convention. Widely seen as competent and sturdy, not to mention opposed to racism and hate-mongering, Romney, the thinking goes, would allow the Republican establishment an ultimate victory over Donald Trump. Social media even exploded in excitement on Wednesday with the news that Romney would deliver a speech on the state of the presidential campaign on Thursday morning in Utah. Romney would likely be a better general election candidate than Trump, but he was a far-from-perfect nominee last time, and wouldn't stand much of a chance if he entered the race this time. Nor would he necessarily be particularly strong if he somehow emerged from the convention as the party's standard-bearer, overriding the substantial number of voters who supported Trump. But what's even worse, and less talked about amid his Twitter warring with Trump, is that his response to the front-runner has displayed all the same symptoms of the establishment's response: fits and starts, hypocrisy, and very little grand strategy. Romney is less a cure for the GOP's problems than a symptom of what ails the party. The Republican establishment has viewed Trump as everything from a nuisance who must be appeased, to a demagogue, to the man who could potentially destroy the party. Romney has mirrored this progression. In 2012, after Trump had flirted with running for the presidency before abandoning the idea, Romney felt the need to seek the businessman's endorsement, holding an event with him and receiving his blessing. This was well after Trump had used the so-called ""birther"" issue to drum up media coverage for himself, one of many examples of Trump's bigotry that Romney now decries in appropriately moralistic fashion. Like the entire Republican establishment and its ideological allies in the media who have found themselves ""shocked, shocked"" by the Trump campaign's dark turn, Romney was, for a long time, just another enabler. Now Romney is going after Trump with real passion, blasting him for his bigotry, and saying he represents a threat to the party. But Romney, who has long been mocked for his undying ambition to become president, seems to be just as calculating as everyone else in his anti-Trump response. Like a number of Republican bigwigs who stayed on the sidelines throughout the early primary contests, Romney never endorsed Bush or Rubio or anyone else. He met with many of the candidates, but never chose anyone, nor did he encourage his fundraisers to get behind a candidate. Romney remains popular in New Hampshire, where Trump was up big, but said almost nothing on the eve of the primary. And now, as Trump has gone from slight favorite to overwhelming favorite to win the nomination in the past several weeks, Romney still appears to be calculating. His team is saying that his speech on Thursday in Utah will include neither an endorsement, nor an announcement that he is at long last going to try to run--as a Republican or on a third-party ticket. It's unclear why Romney, who is obviously passionate about the election, refuses to endorse, but here is one theory: that convention scenario. Endorsing someone now would make it much harder for Romney to eventually emerge as a peacemaker. Fair enough, you might say: He wants to maintain his viability. But this is precisely the problem that all the candidates who are actually running have had. None of them wants to step aside for the greater good of stopping Trump; all of them are sticking around in the slim hope that they can be the eventual, lone anti-Trump alternative. In short, Romney isn't much different than Rubio or Kasich or anyone else. And none of them seem likely to vanquish Trump, either."	Mitt Romney Isn't the Solution to the GOP's Trump Crisis.

Marco Rubio has come up with a new pitch to stop him. Rubio says Trump is a racist. But the problem, according to Rubio, isn't that this racist, if nominated, would win the election. It's that he wouldn't. The controversy started on Sunday, when Trump, in a CNN interview, ducked an invitation to condemn white nationalist David Duke. ""I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists,"" said Trump. The interviewer, CNN's Jake Tapper, noted that Duke was connected to the Ku Klux Klan. Still, Trump insisted that he would have to research any group before denouncing it. After the show, Trump pointed out that he had previously disavowed Duke's endorsement. But Rubio, well aware of Trump's many bigoted comments, pounced. On Monday morning, Rubio raised the issue at a rally in Tennessee. He called Trump a ""con artist"" who had ripped off students and had hired foreigners and illegal immigrants. Then Rubio went after Trump for ducking the Klan question:"	Marco Rubio Is Confused About Why It's Bad for Trump to Be Racist

Some GOP pundits have already declared, with God as their witness, that they will never vote for Trump. (See, for instance, ""With God as My Witness, I Will Never Vote for Donald Trump."") Last week, the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza rounded up comments from prominent conservatives who are deeply disquieted by Trump and are grappling with a dilemma: If Trump's on the GOP ballot in November, what's the plan? Stay home on Election Day? Pray for a third-party candidate to appear? Write one in? Hold your nose and vote for Trump? Or--horrors--cast a vote for Hillary Clinton? I wanted to hear from some non-pundit-class folks. So I put out a request to friends and colleagues to spread the word: Send me Republicans who feel uncomfortable about the rise of Trump. This could not be a less scientific survey. It's a tiny sample, and my network skews toward Republicans more educated and affluent than the working-class voters who've been associated with Trump's ascent. (Though it's worth noting that Trump's appeal is more broad-based than some give him credit for--he's done well with all sorts of demographics.) I just wanted to listen to people describe how they're wrestling with a difficult question, while understanding that it's March, and plenty of minds can and will change between now and November. Below are condensed and edited interviews with Trump-averse Republicans, conducted over the past week by phone, email, and text chat. As you'll see, most are assuming Hillary will be the Democratic nominee. For the purposes for this piece, so are we. Who: civil litigation attorney, male, 45, California

 What he'll do if Trump is the nominee: probably vote for Trump ""Donald Trump is an amusing character but a con artist. He's an excellent marketer and a shrewd guy who has recognized a political moment and is going to ride it. I think he doesn't have the temperament to be president. I have friends I'm trying to talk out of supporting him. I would consider writing in a protest vote for a Libertarian. ""But honestly, Trump is smart enough that he'd pick someone for VP who's generally acceptable to people like me, and then I'll probably hold my nose and vote for him. I might consider a different Democratic candidate, but I just couldn't vote for Hillary. ""It does concern me a little that there could be a great disaster on his watch--an error of judgment that would be very serious, that Hillary probably wouldn't make. I don't think he would push the button or actually round up people and send them to Mexico. But when I say that it makes me nervous because all sorts of dictatorial leaders were not taken seriously before they came to power. I guess I can't imagine that that sort of thing would really happen here."" Who: retired attorney, male, 74, California
 Voting background: has voted GOP since Barry Goldwater, with one break for Ross Perot in 1992
 What he'll do if Trump is the nominee: vote for Trump ""I'm no Trump fan. But I would vote for Trump over Hillary. I recognize the arguments against Trump--I don't think they're frivolous, or mindless, or foolish--but I truly believe Hillary would be dangerous. I agree there are some aspects of Trump and his bombast that would make me and others uncertain about how he would behave. But he has been successful in business in part because he surrounds himself with good people, good advisers, good architects and engineers. He understands what he doesn't know. Trump would not be so foolish as to start a war with Russia or Syria or Iran. I can't guarantee it, but that's what my gut tells me. I trust the system to constrain Trump way more than I trust Hillary."" Who: federal HR employee, female, 40, Kentucky
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
 What she'll do if Trump is the nominee: vote for Hillary ""My biggest objection to Trump is that he is an ugly human being exploiting the ugly impulses of others. I don't even think he is a real Republican. I think that people are latching on to him because they are angry and afraid and feel like 'their' America is moving on without them. I'm a military spouse, so I am extra disposed to lean right. But that is something else Trump does to annoy me. He tries to use veterans as props. ""It is honestly not that much of a stretch for me to support Hillary (although my dearly departed father is no doubt spinning in his grave). I think she is the only person close to a moderate that is left. Also, it is time for a woman!"" Who: business owner and CEO, male, 44, Washington, D.C.
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in presidential elections, save for a libertarian vote in 2004
 What he'll do if Trump is the nominee: pray ""I have thought about this endlessly. For me it comes down to: pray for a viable third option, write in, or simply abstain. (Being a D.C. resident provides some measure of relief here.) ""Hillary makes this such a tough decision. I think many Republicans could cross the aisle, but not for her. What makes this so much more complicated than Democrats realize is that HRC is no ordinary Dem. Had it been Kerry or Obama or O'Malley, pulling the lever would have been a wee bit easier. But actually voting FOR Hillary is like succumbing to everything you know is profoundly wrong in this world. The closest comparison would be if somehow Kanye West hijacks the Democratic Party and says the most outlandish things, but locks down the nomination. Mainstream Dems would be like damn, I can't vote for that jackass. But what if the Republican nominee were Ted Cruz?"" Who: retired attorney, female, 52, California
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in presidential elections but abstained in 2008
 What she'll do if Trump is the nominee: probably not vote. Possibly vote for Hillary. ""Trump is a dangerous megalomaniac. Quite possibly the shallowest person in the public eye I can imagine, outside of a Justin Bieber-type celebrity. He has no humanity. He has no tolerance for different opinions. I am awestruck at how awful he is. I can't describe in mere words just how appalling he is. My friends feel the same way. I don't know anyone who isn't mortified, and that includes friends and family who aren't political, people who just read the paper occasionally. ""If the general election were held today, Trump against Hillary, I would not vote. I get a feeling from Hillary that she believes she's entitled to break the rules if she thinks it's a good idea, I find that arrogance objectionable. I don't see any bigger goal for her than just her own power. But I do think underneath it all, she at least has some sympathy for civil liberties and for separation of powers. There's some there there--while with Trump, he might wake up one morning and decide to invade Mexico. If Hillary starts showing something more than just a quest for power and authority than I'd vote for Hillary. There's no scenario under which I'd vote for Donald Trump."" Who: attorney, female, 39, Virginia
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in presidential elections, save for a libertarian vote in 2000
 What she'll do if Trump is the nominee: not vote ""Trump represents a complete coarsening of the political discussion. I don't see him standing for any principles. Certainly none of the principles that have caused me to vote Republican in virtually every election. I'm concerned about his cavalier attitude towards the Constitution. I don't believe he would see himself as being bound to uphold the First Amendment and other constitutional rights. Most of my friends are appalled. I'm surprised, though, that there is a significant minority who are cheering him on or are OK with him. I'd say it's 50-50 among my friends--half would hold their nose and vote Trump, half would not vote at all. ""I won't vote for Hillary first because I'm pro-life. But there are no Democrats I can think of that I would vote for. ""I've been volunteering for the local Republican Party for eight or nine years now, recruiting volunteers and organizing them. There's always been a small number who have had outrageous positions on things, and I've tried to avoid them. But most of them care about the country and good government and electing trustworthy people. If Trump is nominated, those volunteers will not lift a finger for him whether they vote for him or not. He's driving people who care most about politics and who we elect out of being active, and into despair about our political process."" Who: retired executive, male, 75, New Jersey

 What he'll do if Trump is the nominee: vote for Hillary ""Trump is a quirk of the times--no governing or legislative experience, gravitas, no redeeming social skills save celebrity, and no views on his fellow man that I can subscribe to--yet he persists. Assuming that Trump is the Republican candidate, not voting is not an option. I would swallow hard and vote for Hillary Clinton because she has the necessary experience, and because the standing of the U.S. in the world would not be compromised as I believe it would be if Trump were elected."" Who: stay-at-home parent, female, 38, Virginia
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every presidential election
 What she'll do if Trump is the nominee: write in a different candidate ""I think Trump is completely unpresidential. I think he's childish. I think he has no policy plan, and any inkling of a plan that he's articulated is not conservative. I think he's a misogynist, a racist, and a bigot. I have a problem with the way he deals with people he disagrees with. We need to be able to work together and present viable options for good government policy. His recent comments about free speech and limiting it--that's not a conservative value. Some of my friends have already said they won't vote for Trump if he's the nominee. ""I think Hillary is a criminal, I think she's going to be indicted, as she should be. She's someone else where I don't think you can trust anything she says. I'd have to see if a third-party candidate comes forward, or write in someone else."" Who: attorney, male, 33, Illinois

 What he'll do if Trump is the nominee: vote for Hillary ""My objections to Trump? 1) His ban on all Muslim immigration, and my worries that he could evolve to curtailing the rights of Muslim-Americans. 2) His promise to deport all illegal aliens, even those raised here. 3) His support of Putin. 4) His anti-free trade stances. 5) His incitement of violence at rallies and his other authoritarian tendencies. 6) His ""take the oil"" stance that appears like an endorsement of 19th-century style imperialism. ""I'm half-Japanese and half-white, and I guess the most alarming thing is that, as a rare minority Republican, I haven't felt excluded from the party or conservatism because the racist part of the coalition hasn't really had much power. Now they're about to win the nomination. ""I'm not a fan of Hillary at all. If it were constitutional, I'd rather even have a third Obama term. But if Hillary wins the nomination, I'd vote for her (and donate and possibly campaign too) over Trump. If Bernie wins the nomination, I'm voting third party."" Who: tech worker, male, 39, Ohio

 What he'll do if Trump is the nominee: not vote ""As a Republican, there is no way in hell I would vote for Donald Trump. He lacks the intellectual curiosity, integrity, humility, and temperament required of a good leader. He is a crony capitalist and would introduce government-enforced religious discrimination, both of which Republicans are supposed to abhor. Oh, and there is the fact that he is not a Republican, not by label but by policy. I am no ideological purist, but he isn't even close. So if he gets the GOP nomination, I will show up on voting day and leave a big, fat blank in the section for POTUS."" Who: stay-at-home parent, female, 31, Massachusetts
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
 What she'll do if Trump is the nominee: vote for Hillary ""Trump is too arrogant, hypocritical, and bigoted. His lack of experience doesn't help. He is unwilling to compromise or even hear people out with opposing views. He is childish in his responses, and I am terrified for how that would translate with foreign policy. ""If it's Trump versus Hillary, I would vote Hillary and probably cry and go to confession. It would be pretty horrific, and I would not advocate for her in any way whatsoever, but instead plead for others to just not vote Trump. I would also be looking into third party candidates a bit more."" Who: financial adviser, male, 30, Florida
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
 What she'll do if Trump is the nominee: vote for Hillary ""I was a strong McCain and Romney supporter. But Trump's policy proposals are absurd. He makes racist statements, thus confirming everything Dems suspect about Republicans. And he is a loose cannon--basically in the Sarah Palin wing of the party. A person who lacks the basic qualifications (sanity) to have nuclear weapons. ""I would vote for HRC, no doubt. I think she's smart. I think she won't blow up the economy like Sanders would. But she is basically a corrupt politician. On a human level she bothers me because I can see how full of shit she is, but she won't ruin the country. If Bloomberg ran, I would vote for him. If Sanders is the Democratic candidate, I'd vote a write-in. Trump and Sanders are absolutely unsupportable in my view. "" Who: CEO of a corporate consulting firm, male, 63, Florida
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in previous presidential elections
 What he'll do if Trump is the nominee: probably vote for Trump ... or wait, change that, Hillary I first talked to this man Thursday, and this is what he had to say: ""The crux of the problem for people like me is how can we vote for Hillary but how can we vote for Trump? I'm damn near close to not being able to vote. With Trump, there's no substance there. No accountability in terms of anything he says. He's reckless, he's dangerous, he's egocentric, he's childish, he's petulant. What he's capable of, that's the frightening thing. He's just such a loose cannon, he seems to do or say anything he wants. I hope some of that is positioning on his part and would come under control. I haven't researched Trump's positions enough yet because I'm so opposed to him. But in the end, if I don't discover anything new about him that I don't know now, and if I'm being honest about how I feel about Hillary versus perhaps a somewhat muted Trump, I would have to hold my nose and vote for him against Hillary. It's conceivable, if Hillary was indicted and Democrats came up with someone other than Bernie, someone more moderate--I might even give Joe Biden a second look over Trump."" A few days later, he changed his mind: ""When we talked on Thursday, I was right at the tipping point, but I was hoping that Trump might start acting differently, toning it down and creating a little more credibility, so that I could take a risk on him. But in fact what he did is go the other way. It gets worse day by day. Throwing the water bottle. The David Duke thing--a white supremacist, and then Trump thinks he can lie about it after. It's a farce. ""So I don't want to be that guy that says I'm not going to vote and not take that responsibility. Hillary is the tallest midget in the room. At least she's not an impractical ideologue, and I think she'd operate with some level of common sense. I think we have a responsibility to vote, and if push came to shove, I could not take the risk of putting Trump in that position."" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 presidential election."	Republican Voters Who Despise Trump on What They'll Do if He's the Nominee
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/marco_rubio_failed_here_s_why.html	"""We are so excited about what lies ahead for our campaign,"" Marco Rubio told an assembled crowd in Miami on Tuesday night. This was the sort of statement Rubio has become infamous for on primary nights: optimistic, forward-looking, and completely untethered from reality. Very little lies ahead for Rubio's campaign: After winning a grand total of one state--a near superfluous Tuesday--he merely gets the opportunity to sit around and wait for Donald Trump to humiliate him in his home state of Florida two weeks from now. Rubio's candidacy failed for a number of reasons. Above all, Donald Trump has emerged as a nearly unstoppable force. But there were other festering problems, from his canned answers and overprogrammed style, to the unfortunate fact that he is a youngish, Hispanic man who speaks about his hopes and dreams for America to a Republican electorate that is white, old, and hopelessly depressed about an increasingly Hispanic America.* This is the sort of thesis that is impossible to prove with data, at least for now, but it is inarguable that Rubio never captured the imagination of the people who could vote for him. Beyond demographics, part of Rubio's problem was that his substantive platform mirrored Bushism in too many ways. Foreign adventurism of the sort Rubio advocates (like much more aggressive stances against Assad and Putin) has rarely been less popular, and his other policies included (promised) giant tax cuts for the rich and (unmentioned) budget deficits for everyone else. In short, he was never able to connect with an electorate that is ready to move beyond compassionate conservatism. In his speech on Tuesday, when he had finished insulting Trump, he began speaking about issues like a strong defense of Israel, appearing once again more like a creation of Republican elites than a spokesman for average voters. Republicans have delivered a harsh verdict on traditional Republican priorities this winter, which is why Trump--who says (disingenuously) that he'd approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a neutral party--has been able to shunt aside GOP priorities while remaining popular with GOP voters. Rubio's political acumen, long overrated, has proven particularly lacking in this environment. And, of course, there was his original sin: his membership in the so-called Gang of Eight, a group of senators who worked to pass an immigration reform proposal that, it was thought, might give Republicans a chance with Hispanic voters. This would have supposedly closed the wound of the 2012 election, which Republican elites had convinced themselves was lost only because the party was too harsh in its rhetoric on the issue. Rubio's decision made no political sense even at the time; if a bill had passed, he would have had his name on Obama's biggest second-term achievement. Instead, Rubio was tarred with the details of a bill that failed, and which he abandoned, making himself look both feckless and unprincipled. (The ways in which Rubio's pro-immigration past mixed with his heritage in the minds of bigoted Republican voters is a subject for people more psychologically acute than myself.) In the past week, as Rubio's campaign became increasingly desperate to stop Trump, he began to develop a line of attack that could perhaps damage the real estate mogul, and one that Hillary Clinton will almost certainly use in the fall. ""Donald Trump is a con artist,"" he said Tuesday night, as he had all week, promising to ""unmask the true nature of the front-runner."" Earlier Tuesday, he called him ""Con-ald Trump."" But Rubio's attempt to recalibrate the Trumpian narrative as one of business failure and pyramid-like schemes was undermined and eventually overshadowed by his childish attacks. Rubio mocked Trump's hair and skin color, joked about the size of his hands, and kidded that perhaps Trump had peed in his pants during a recent debate. This wasn't just demeaning; it also showed that Rubio had perhaps forgotten one of the lessons of the campaign, which, ironically, Chris Christie's attack on him proved so clearly. When Christie went after Rubio's robotic answers during that fateful New Hampshire debate, it not only destroyed Rubio's chances in the state; it also did nothing for Christie, and may even have helped his opponents. Multicandidate races are not zero-sum games: You can bring down an opponent and still not get much benefit out of doing so. Again, it's too early to say whether Rubio's attacks on Trump backfired: Rubio outperformed his polls in Virginia, for instance. But Trump would no doubt prefer getting down-and-dirty with Rubio over hand-size than he would the details of his bankruptcies or his relationship to the laughable Trump University, two stories that might have gotten more media attention were it not for all the ink expended on Rubio's insults. Finally, there was that New Hampshire debate. After Rubio ""won"" second place in South Carolina, it seemed that perhaps his debate collapse had been overhyped: another gaffe that dominates headlines for several days without really changing much. But it's possible the initial conventional wisdom about his debate performance was correct. While there was no guarantee that he would have won New Hampshire, or would be winning states rather than losing them today, the debate performance did irreparably harm his campaign. He was polling second in New Hampshire and rising before that evening, but he finished fifth; his collapse kept John Kasich afloat, provided more oxygen for Ted Cruz, and, to conclude the mixed metaphor, gave Trump extra horsepower. It's wishful thinking among those who dislike Trump to say that Rubio would be the presumptive nominee today if he hadn't sputtered when responding to Christie. He probably still would have failed because he wasn't the man Republicans pulling levers in 2016 wanted. Rubio's inability to take off, and the ceding of his presumptive voters to Trump, was a sign that just about everyone, Rubio included, didn't see where Trump was going--largely because they didn't get where his voters were coming from. *Correction, March 2, 2016: This post originally misidentified Marco Rubio as nonwhite.

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/why_hillary_clinton_s_big_super_tuesday_wins_are_great_news_for_democrats.html	"When the first Super Tuesday polls closed in Virginia, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Texas, one thing was clear: Hillary Clinton would have a great night. Riding momentum from her South Carolina victory, Clinton scored big wins in each state. And as with last Saturday, her victories rested on strong support from black voters. In Virginia, exit polls showed her winning 84 percent of blacks; in Georgia, 83 percent; in Tennessee, 82 percent; in Arkansas, 88 percent. She also scored big with Hispanic voters, winning them by a 2-to-1 margin (65 percent to 34 percent) and securing a solid victory in Texas. As of mid-Tuesday night, Clinton holds a majority of wins across the map, excluding Vermont, Oklahoma, and Minnesota, where blacks--and minorities overall--are a smaller share of the Democratic Party and the electorate writ large. In Massachusetts, where minorities represent a modest share of the Democrats' voting pool, it's a tossup, as Sanders fights to overcome Clinton's advantage with older Democrats. The biggest story from Democrats' Super Tuesday isn't the horse race between Sanders and Clinton, however; it's the turnout drop from the previous open primary, in 2008. This fits the overall trend of this election, where Democrats are less likely to vote in the primaries than their Republican counterparts, who have turned out in huge numbers to vote for a grab bag of different candidates in a competitive and high-stakes nomination battle. It's important to remember that the 2008 Democratic primary was unusual. In addition to the historic campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton--vying to make history as the first black or first female president of the United States, there were the circumstances of the election: Democrats were eager to recapture the White House after seven years of George W. Bush. The result was a burst of enthusiasm, channeled by both candidates into incredible turnout. More than 36 million people voted in the Democratic primaries, or 19.4 percent of all eligble voters; Democrats set turnout records in 26 states, fueled by women, minorities, and young people. The party couldn't repeat this performance for 2016. In Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday states, turnout was down substantially from the heights of 2008. Democrats just aren't excited to choose a successor to President Obama, even with the prospect of the first female president and the presence of an authentic populist who has stirred younger voters and the party's left wing. For some observers, this is ominous. ""Democratic Party elites shouldn't be high-fiving each other,"" writes the Huffington Post, noting low turnout despite Clinton's substantial win in South Carolina. ""They should be very, very worried."" Shaun King of the New York Daily News sounds a similar alarm: ""Something is unraveling right now in the Democratic Party. Come November, it could cost them the White House."" On the surface, this alarm seems well-founded. If high turnout in the 2008 primary presaged high turnout in the general election, then low turnout should do the same. But when you compare past primary turnout to outcomes in the general election, you don't see a pattern. Before 2008, Democrats had their highest ever primary turnout in 1988, with nearly 23 million voters at the polls. The winner, Michael Dukakis, eventually lost to George H.W Bush in a landslide defeat. Likewise, high GOP primary turnout in the 2000 primary--more than 17 million Republicans voted versus 14 million Democrats--didn't guarantee an easy win: George W. Bush lost the popular vote. Primary season turnout isn't a reliable guide to general election results. But that doesn't mean we can't learn something from it. If there's a consistent result in the Democratic primaries thus far, it's this: Everywhere black voters have had a chance to vote in significant numbers--South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, etc.--they've either come close to or exceeded their 2008 vote share. In South Carolina, blacks were 61 percent of the electorate versus 55 percent in 2008; in Georgia, they were 49 percent of the electorate versus 51 percent in 2008; and in Virginia they were 25 percent of the electorate versus 30 percent in 2008. And just as they'd backed Obama in 2008, they backed Hillary Clinton by similar margins this year, delivering supermajorities--almost 90 percent in some places--to her campaign. It's not wise to extrapolate these results to a general election, either. We can't predict black turnout or vote share from these numbers in the primary. But we can say this: After years of speculation over black voters and their participation--will they turn out for Democrats who aren't Barack Obama?--the answer is yes, they will. The explanation is easy. Conventional wisdom aside, black voters didn't turn out in 2008 and 2012 because of Obama. Rather, Obama's campaign of dedicated outreach and contact newly activated a crucial number of black voters and brought them into the process. ""[D]oor-to-door, mail, phone, and Internet activities of the political parties may have been more of a factor in mobilizing Blacks than an amorphous, media-driven buzz surrounding Obama's charismatic and historic candidacy,"" write political scientists Tasha Philpot, Daron Shaw, Ernest McGowen in a paper titled ""Winning the Race: Black Voter Turnout in the 2008 Presidential Election."" What we can see from the 2016 results, thus far, is that two presidential cycles of this successful contact had an effect. Not only are black voters increasingly regular voters, but unlike many other Americans they also seem to believe in their efficacy as voters--that, if they organize and vote, they will change things for the better. If true, this is a powerful turn, and not just in the Democratic primary. If black voters believe that they matter, then they will turn out in the general election too. And if they turn out like they did for Obama, then the Democratic Party--and Hillary Clinton in particular--could have a clear path to the White House."	Hillary Clinton's Big Super Tuesday and What It Means for the General Election
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/super_tuesday_doesn_t_matter_like_florida_matters.html	"Donald Trump is set to win most of the contests on Super Tuesday, with a couple of potential surprises. He could pull off an upset in Texas against Ted Cruz, though Cruz appears to have retained his lead there even if Trump has slimmed the margin. It would behoove Marco Rubio, meanwhile, to win any state--perhaps Minnesota--just to show that he is capable of winning a nominating contest at some point. A surprise winner here or there would mostly serve PR purposes for campaigns. But proportional delegate allocation--which differs in specifics by state--ensures that no candidate will be able to deliver a structural shift in the campaign Tuesday night, even though Super Tuesday awards roughly a quarter of the party's total delegates. Trump should win a few hundred delegates, Cruz another hundred or two. Marco Rubio, the supposed savior, will likely be stuck in double-digits. Cruz will use his delegate advantage over Rubio as a justification for staying in the race, even if Cruz's prospects sharply diminish after the contests in Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Idaho on Saturday and next Tuesday. In other words, the day after Super Tuesday--""Wednesday,"" our sources tell us it's called--will feature the same race we saw before and during Super Tuesday. Trump will have a big but not insurmountable lead. Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich will each be spinning about how they should be the figure to go one-on-one against Trump. Rubio will continue knocking the hell out of Trump in the hope that he can win his home state of Florida. Kasich will be off doing his Kasich thing in Michigan and Ohio, praying that Trump knocks out Rubio in Florida. Cruz will putz around the South through March 8, and then pivot to praying that Trump knocks out Rubio in Florida. As you can see, Florida, which votes on March 15, is a fairly important contest. One can argue--as I am doing--that Florida is more important to the race than the sum total of Super Tuesday's contests. It's not just that Florida--along with other major states like Ohio and Illinois--comes on the first day of pure winner-take-all contests. It's the test for whether Rubio, the candidate rumored to have the broadest ability to take down Trump, can do it. Florida is Rubio's home state, though that's not quite the advantage that it may seem. It helps with campaign infrastructure and know-how, but Rubio is not measurably more popular than Trump there. Trump also has ties to Florida, owning several resort properties there, and his massive lead in the Super Tuesday state of Alabama bodes well for his ability to accrue votes in the Florida panhandle. Rubio's home-state advantage, in short, is canceled out by the competing fact that it's also a state that fits Trump quite well. Hence Trump's significant lead. Florida will serve as a microcosm for what needs to happen nationally to stop Trump from winning the nomination. It will effectively be a one-on-one contest. It will be expensive, with the Rubio campaign, its super PACs, and establishment-aligned conservative dark-money groups deploying possibly tens of millions of dollars against Trump from every angle of attack. Rubio's kitchen-sink strategy against Trump has only been underway for five days, so looking at Super Tuesday's results to gauge their effectiveness doesn't give them enough time to settle. By Florida, we'll know if they work or not. If they do, and Rubio wins Florida, we'll know Rubio can beat Trump if the campaign is waged properly. This would reverberate in the remaining big contests across the country. Even if the math might be difficult for Rubio to win an outright majority of pledged delegates by that point, he could deny Trump his own majority and take his case to a contested convention. If Rubio loses Florida, though, the race is over. His own campaign team has said you can ""take it to the bank"" that Rubio will win there. If Rubio can't pull it off, he will be humiliated. More importantly, he will be almost insurmountably behind Trump's delegate total, even after he's launched everything he had at the front-runner. He, along with Cruz and Kasich, could stay in the race for second-place bragging rights--or in the hope that, say, Trump realizes he's going to be the nominee and drops out because he never actually wanted to be president. Tonight, as the Super Tuesday results are rolling in, Trump will hold a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, the estate he owns in Florida. He may declare the race over after his Super Tuesday romp. It won't be. If he wins Florida on March 15, though, it's done. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	Super Tuesday Won't Change Anything. Florida Will.
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/donald_trump_s_white_supremacist_supporters.html	"Last week, voters across Vermont and Minnesota received robocalls from the white nationalist William Johnson, who has founded the American National Super PAC to support Donald Trump. ""The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called racist,"" Johnson said on the calls. ""This is our mindset ... It's OK to give away our country for immigration, but don't call me a racist. It's OK that few schools anymore have beautiful white children as a majority, but don't call me racist."" Others fear the taint of racism, Johnson said, but Trump does not. ""Don't vote for a Cuban, vote for Donald Trump,"" his message concluded. He gave a phone number that listeners could call for more information. Johnson is the chairman of the white supremacist American Freedom Party; according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, it was founded by a group of racist California skinheads in 2009. He has called for the deportation of Americans with any ""ascertainable trace of Negro blood"" or more than one-eighth ""Mongolian, Asian, Asia Minor, Middle Eastern, Semitic, Near Eastern, American Indian, Malay or other non-European or non-white blood."" When he is not working toward creating what he calls ""separate white ethno-states,"" Johnson farms and practices corporate law in Southern California. I reached him at his office on Monday to ask about how his movement seeks to help Trump, and about how Trump is helping his movement. Michelle Goldberg: Did you realize how much latent support there was out there for your ideas before the Trump phenomenon? Has this expanded your sense of political possibility? William Johnson: Yes, I am surprised by the level of support for our positions in the rank-and-file electorate. Where have you run robocalls so far? We ran robocalls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Minnesota. The last two were in preparation for Super Tuesday, which will be tomorrow. We are reaching every consumer landline in the states where we do it. Has this campaign resulted in an increase in membership for your organization? Yes, we have had an increase in membership. I personally answered the phones of everyone that responded, because I put my cellphone number on there. So everyone that responded based upon the robocalls they received, I was able to gauge the support. And the support in Iowa and Minnesota was markedly more favorable to Trump and our message than the New England states of Vermont and New Hampshire. Do you worry that your calls could end up damaging Trump in places where your message isn't popular? No, I don't think it will hurt the candidate. Donald Trump is really a Teflon candidate, like Reagan was. I need to point out to you that white nationalists are not conservatives. We are populists, along the lines of Huey Long. And the conservatives are really jumping on Donald Trump because he is a populist. So there is a large segment of the voting population that rejects the mean-spirited conservative views that have been the foundation of the Republican Party for a very long time. Populism is replacing conservatism among a large segment of the voting population. And along with that, racial consciousness is also prevalent now, so that's why we are growing. We are nationalists and we are populists, and that's exactly what Donald Trump is. What do you mean by conservatives' ""mean-spirited"" views? Obviously, your opponents consider white nationalists to be mean-spirited. White nationalists really have to be above-board and have to embrace principals that are just, moral, and proper because we are so disliked now. So we strive to do what is right and to be honest in all things. And much of the population is dishonest now, because they reject their heritage. They think that race does not matter, or at least they say that, but deep down inside, empirical evidence and their own personal feelings belie that fact. Race does matter. Millennials have rejected conservatism because it is mean-spirited. They see that the protection of the corporate interests that allows heads of corporations, captains of industry, to reap millions and even billions of dollars of profit while the working man struggles to make ends meet in a rented apartment, just is not fair. Trump is getting a lot of flack for not disavowing David Duke and the KKK on CNN on Sunday. (He later blamed his response on a bad earpiece.) What do you make of that? What message does that send to you? I believe that a leader needs to be circumspect and deliberate in making decisions. And Donald Trump said that he didn't want to blanketly reject all sorts of groups without knowing what it is they were talking about. I think that showed prudence. And that's what we want in a leader. Does it bother you that Trump eventually did disavow David Duke? It's good to look for the good qualities in all people, but there are positions that are so unpopular now that nobody needs that kind of baggage, and David Duke--he has a very negative image. So I think all prudent people would not want to be involved with that baggage. Have you had any feedback from people close to Trump? Presumably if they didn't like what you were doing they could tell you to knock it off. I didn't know they could, but they haven't and they won't. There's no communication whatsoever. Does it bother you or people in your movement that Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka is Jewish? It bothers a lot of people in the movement. It also bothers me, yes. But the fact that his kids went out and were engaged in big-game hunting, that bothers me. The fact that he swears, that bothers me. There's a lot of things that bother you about any person, but you have to overlook that. When did you first realize that Trump was your guy? If you'd asked me six months ago what I thought of Donald Trump, I would have said I don't like the scoundrel. It's happened since he's taken these unbending stands counter to political correctness that he's won us over. Is this the first time you've ever felt part of a mainstream political movement? You know, when Ron Paul ran for president in 2008, he had dinner at my house, and we just raised thousands of dollars for him. And he said, 'You know, Johnson, I realized I had a national campaign when I came to your place.' So I've been involved in a lot of different campaigns over the years. I was one of the first contributors to Rand Paul. Initially I was going to support Rand Paul, but he's just kind of a pale shadow of his father. He's not one that we can get behind. Donald Trump is.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/02/donald_trump_killed_the_gop_here_s_how_republicans_can_bring_it_back_to.html	"Donald J. Trump is laying waste to the conservative movement. His overwhelming lead in Super Tuesday polls stands as further evidence, if further evidence were even necessary, that his appeal among Republicans is deep and durable, even as his campaign makes a mockery of conservative ideals. While conservatives have traditionally emphasized the central importance of limited government, Trump has built his campaign around the promise of an unlimited government that will solve every problem that ails America, provided it is fully under his command. To many on the right, Trump's enormous popularity seems particularly galling in light of the failures this election cycle of one conservative true believer after another. No candidate was more ideologically orthodox than Bobby Jindal, the government-slashing, hard-right governor of Louisiana, yet Trump ridiculed his campaign out of existence. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker defeated powerful public-sector unions in a state that had long been a citadel of progressivism, and he too exited the race, as Trump stole his populist thunder. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were both backed by Tea Party activists in their respective Senate campaigns, and both have made their mark by singing from the Reaganite hymnal. Now both are being bested by a man who praises Planned Parenthood, has warm words for socialized medicine, and seems almost Bernie Sanders-esque in his delight at the prospect of waging class warfare. Though the rise of Trump has taken almost everyone by surprise, we really should have seen it coming. America has been long overdue for something like Trumpism. In the years since the financial crisis, populist insurgencies have devastated mainstream parties of the center right and center left in virtually every market democracy. Barack Obama's rhetorical gifts mask the many ways in which he is a deeply conventional political figure, a man who trusts the wisdom of technocrats rather than seeking to overturn the established order. One could argue that the Obama presidency rescued America's upper classes from a more ferocious post-crisis backlash, at least for a time. The twin insurgencies of Trump and Sanders demonstrate that the anger is still there--that it was just waiting for the right person to conjure it up. What separates the two politicians is that Sanders is in tune with the ideological orthodoxies of the left while Trump has no regard for those of the right. This iconoclasm is one of the sources of his power. More than anything else, Trump has demonstrated that white working-class voters have minds of their own. They will not simply line up behind the candidates selected for them by hedge-funders and industrialists during the ""invisible primary."" If we define working-class voters as those without a college degree, Ronald Brownstein of the Atlantic estimates that this bloc represents 53 percent of Republicans, split almost evenly between those who are conservative Christians and those who are not. The Pew Research Center reports that in 2012, 53 percent of Republicans were part of families that earned less than $75,000 a year. These groups, which tend to overlap, are Donald Trump's base. Ever since the Nixon era, Republicans have relied on the white working class to achieve political victories. Now, it has revolted against the GOP elite. Why wouldn't they be furious? The Republican failure to defend the interests of working-class voters, and to speak to their hopes and fears, has made Trump's authoritarianism dangerously alluring. Trump recognized that elite Republicans--a group rooted in affluent coastal metropolises and dominated by members of the credentialed upper middle class, which has shielded itself from the social and economic devastation that has wreaked such havoc in less-privileged corners of the country--often fall prey to wishful thinking about the rank-and-file voters who actually elect GOP candidates. They imagine that working- and middle-class conservatives are passionately devoted to the things they care about--tax cuts and entitlement reform--when these voters are far more passionate about other issues: economic nationalism, limits on less-skilled immigration, and minimum-wage hikes. Having recognized this chasm separating the Republican donor class from the grassroots, Trump has exploited it brilliantly. He has defended entitlement programs, and he has bashed bankers. He has defied the elite consensus on trade and immigration. He is channeling the Republican id, and in doing so he may have already dashed conservative hopes of winning the White House. Why can't his GOP opponents convince Republican voters that they would do a far better job than Trump of defending middle-class economic interests? The answer is that they are trapped by the delusions of the donor class, and they can't break free. In the coming weeks and months, old-school conservatives will do everything they can to defeat a man they consider a charlatan and provocateur. Alexander Burns, Maggie Haberman, and Jonathan Martin of the New York Times report that leading GOP donors and congressional bigwigs are mounting a desperate rearguard action to do just that. But whether or not they succeed, the GOP establishment must acknowledge that the Trump campaign has surfaced important and uncomfortable truths. Those truths can no longer be evaded. If the Republican Party is to have a future, it must learn from Trump's rise. By launching a frontal attack on movement conservatism, Trump has demonstrated its weakness and the failure of its stale policy agenda to resonate with voters. In doing so, he is giving conservatives a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change direction. There is only one way forward in the post-Trump era. The GOP can no longer survive as the party of tax cuts for the rich. It must reinvent itself as the champion of America's working- and middle-class families. In every campaign, Democrats and Republicans talk about getting the working class and the middle class back on their feet. Those are almost always empty words. The GOP must now become a genuinely populist party, putting the concerns of voters ahead of those of donors. The alternative will be a decade or more of marginalization and defeat, during which the left will have free rein. Following this path will be uncomfortable for a Republican elite that has grown accustomed to getting its way, and to selling an agenda that's best suited to the interests of the already well-to-do as an agenda for America. While tossing aside long-held orthodoxies will be difficult, it is absolutely necessary. By embracing populism, this new GOP will have the potential both to speak to Trump's voters and to grow the party's base, uniting voters across lines of race, class, and region. What might a more populist GOP agenda look like? Here is a brief sketch of how the party can change course. A Pay-Your-Own-Way Immigration Policy No issue better illustrates the divide between elite Republicans and the party's base. One recent survey found that a large majority (67 percent) of Republicans favor decreasing immigration levels while only 7 percent of them favor an increase. Nevertheless, leading Republicans, including Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, have backed proposals that would greatly increase immigration levels in defiance of the Republican grassroots. Trump, meanwhile, has used incendiary language to electrify Republicans who oppose immigration. What accounts for this divide between the policies prominent Republicans have backed and those favored by rank-and-file GOP voters? For high-income Republicans, skilled immigrants are their colleagues, neighbors, and friends, and less-skilled immigrants provide them with the low-cost child care, restaurant meals, and other services that allow them to lead comfortable lives. These affluent conservatives thus take a more relaxed approach to immigration, which is reflected in the immigration reform proposals they've advanced. Less-affluent conservatives, meanwhile, are far more likely to see immigrants as either competitors for scarce public resources or as a burden on hard-pressed taxpayers. To unite the right, the GOP ought to embrace a simple immigration reform principle: The U.S. will only welcome immigrants who can pay their own way. Immigrants who earn high wages are less likely to need public assistance than those who earn low wages. They are in a better position to provide for their families, and their children are more likely to flourish as adults. Republicans should not shrink from advocating immigration policies that protect the interests of American workers. That means welcoming immigrants who are economically self-sufficient and who can help finance social programs for poor Americans--whether native- or foreign-born, of every racial and ethnic group--rather than relying on those social programs themselves. Eat China's Lunch On more than one occasion, Donald Trump has said that ""China's just eating our lunch,"" and that we ought to retaliate. He's not wrong. It really is true that Chinese import competition has had a powerfully negative impact on America's Rust Belt, and that China shields its domestic market from competition while encouraging intellectual property theft on a grand scale. Yet it's also true that China is experiencing a wave of deindustrialization not unlike what already took place in the U.S., as many of its labor-intensive manufacturers embrace labor-saving technologies. Moreover, the Chinese economy is entering a rocky period, as growth slows and domestic unrest rises. Now might be the perfect time for the U.S. to rethink its relationship with China, and its approach to global economic integration more broadly. As automation accelerates, labor costs will be of decreasing importance for manufacturers. This could lead to more ""insourcing,"" or a return of manufacturing jobs to U.S. shores. But even if the U.S. attracts new manufacturing facilities in large numbers, the number of manufacturing jobs created will likely be modest, as these new facilities will make far greater use of machines than factories of the past. Nevertheless, insourcing of this kind would be an economic boon. Republicans ought to offer a comprehensive agenda for making the U.S. more attractive to manufacturers, through corporate tax reform but also through a renewed commitment to investing in infrastructure--in other words, an economic nationalism rooted in substance, not shopworn nostalgia. More broadly, Republicans ought to put forward specific policy proposals to improve the lives of workers who lose their jobs to outsourcing or automation. One promising idea is a wage insurance program that provides workers with a strong incentive for rapid re-employment. As Lael Brainard, Robert Litan, and Nicholas Warren proposed in 2005, workers who lose their jobs and then find lower-wage work would receive an insurance payout that would cover up to 50 percent of the earnings gap, up to $10,000 a year for no more than two years. This is exactly the kind of social program that elite Republicans tend to oppose. But a GOP more attuned to the interests of its working-class base must think differently, particularly if the alternative is subjecting American workers to long-term unemployment and all the suffering that comes with it. Defend the Safety Net One of the hallmarks of the Trump campaign has been his support for Social Security and Medicare, and his insistence that he would protect these programs from budget cuts. To many conservatives, Trump's defense of these old-age entitlements is his greatest heresy. What they fail to understand is that conservative voters are very fond of these programs, and their fondness can't be chalked up to simple hypocrisy. We saw this dynamic at play during the early days of the Tea Party, the last time elite Republicans faced a serious populist challenge. Many conservative intellectuals viewed the Tea Party movement as the realization of their fondest wishes: a grassroots rebellion demanding fiscal austerity. In fact, as Emily Ekins of the Cato Institute has observed, Tea Party members were chiefly motivated by a theory of economic fairness. They believed, in Ekins' words, that ""everyone should be rewarded in strict proportion to their achievements and failings and that government should not shield people from the consequences of their decisions."" This is why Tea Party conservatives are more favorably disposed toward programs like Social Security and Medicare--to which workers contribute over a lifetime in exchange for benefits when they need them--than they are to programs that lack this contributory element. Republicans ought to reform old-age entitlements to make them sustainable over the long haul. But in doing so, they must ensure that these programs perform their core functions better than they do today, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable seniors. To improve Social Security, Republicans might back a package of reforms that would encourage older Americans to work by slashing or eliminating their property taxes and that would ensure that all seniors receive a benefit that would keep them from falling into poverty, which is not currently the case. On Medicare, they could improve the quality of care for seniors while lowering costs by defaulting seniors into Medicare Advantage, a program that allows beneficiaries to access high-quality private insurance coverage. More controversially, Republicans should follow Trump's lead and accept that some of the core aspects of Obamacare are here to stay. Trump often seems confused when questioned about health policy, but he does intuitively understand that Americans hate the idea that people with pre-existing medical conditions might be denied care. The best way forward for the right would be to call an Obamacare truce: accept that the exchanges are here to stay, as they're a guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions will always have access to health insurance they can afford. The GOP should instead focus on reforming Obamacare so that people would have the option to buy lightly regulated plans with their own money. This wouldn't be as satisfying for Republicans as repealing Obamacare root and branch, but it's a far more realistic approach that might win over at least some Democrats and independents. And it would demonstrate that all Republicans, like Trump, ""won't let people die in the streets""--a commitment that doesn't always come across. Respect, Not Compassion Republican anti-poverty rhetoric often reeks of condescension. When George W. Bush spoke of compassion for the downtrodden, it was very clear that he meant well. It's equally clear, though, that for most poor Americans, a hand up is vastly preferable to a shoulder to cry on. Encouragingly, a number of conservative reformers have proposed using the tax code to help low-income families. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, among others, have called for increases in wage subsidies, and their proposals have much to recommend them. One serious challenge, however, is that sliding-scale wage subsidies help workers as they climb the bottom rungs of the job ladder, but they can also discourage them from earning more as they gain experience, because the subsidies taper off as workers earn more income. The Bipartisan Policy Center has proposed solving this problem by replacing the current earned income tax credit with a refundable earnings credit equal to 17.5 percent of the first $20,000 in earnings that would apply to each worker, with or without children. This would make life for low-wage workers much easier, not least by lowering the cost of tax preparation, a huge burden for poor families. Better still, it would remove the disincentive to earn more money. Republicans should go further and back a more generous refundable per child tax credit. Such a credit would help equalize the tax benefits received by low-income parents and their better-off counterparts, who benefit more from other provisions of the tax code. Conservatives might fear that a program that gives poor parents money with no strings attached will discourage them from working. This is a legitimate concern, but the experience of other market democracies suggests that it is overblown. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that a well-designed child credit can lead to increased work hours. Keep in mind that many low-income families with children already receive substantial assistance in the form of food stamps and other benefits. By replacing much of this in-kind assistance with cash, Republicans would give poor parents greater flexibility, and they'd also treat them with greater respect. No New Tax Cuts for the Rich If Republicans are to win the trust of working- and middle-class voters who've grown deeply skeptical of their economic nostrums, they will have to do something dramatic: It's time for the GOP to abandon its near-obsessive devotion to tax cuts that disproportionately benefit upper-income households. Virtually every GOP candidate, Trump included, has offered a tax reform proposal that would slash taxes on America's richest people. But according to a survey conducted last fall, almost one-third of Republicans (31 percent) would be more likely to support a candidate who favored raising taxes on wealthy Americans compared with one-third (34 percent) who'd be less likely to vote for such a candidate and another one-third (34 percent) who were indifferent. Given these numbers, you'd expect that one or two GOP presidential candidates might run on cutting taxes on the rich while one or two others might call for hiking them. Instead, we see elected Republicans march in lockstep on taxes, as though their voters did the same. The GOP elite has also yet to grasp that most voters simply don't care as much about taxes as they did in the Reagan era. Megan McArdle of Bloomberg View has observed that the tax burden on middle-income households has declined since the Reagan presidency. The predictable result is that support for cuts in federal taxes has fallen substantially, and the share of voters who consider their federal tax burden their top priority is a mere 1 percent. To break out of their tax trap, Republicans ought to embrace a very simple strategy. The GOP should continue to back tax cuts for the middle class, and in particular for middle-class parents. But until the country sees large and sustained budget surpluses, there should be no tax cuts for households earning $250,000 or more. While there are growth-friendly tax reforms that would preserve or even increase the progressivity of the current tax code, this proposal will still be difficult for supply-siders to bear. And that's to the good. For too long, Republican have been excessively beholden to voters at the top of the income spectrum, and swearing off tax cuts for the rich would be an excellent way to prove that they've turned over a new leaf. * * * I'm under no illusion that Republicans will embrace this agenda tout court, and there's no question that some of these ideas are more far-fetched than others. This proposal also isn't comprehensive: I haven't touched on same-sex marriage or abortion or foreign and defense policy. The point of this exercise is not to dictate exactly where GOP policymakers should go. Rather, it is to demonstrate that the GOP can speak to the interests of working- and middle-class Americans while maintaining conservative principles. Conservative reformers of earlier eras recognized that to protect and defend capitalism, they needed to ensure that everyone could share in the wealth it creates. This was true of Theodore Roosevelt in the progressive era, and it was true of Ronald Reagan, who broke with his free-trade convictions to protect vulnerable American industries and backed tax reforms that closed loopholes used only by the richest of the rich. Reagan was a conservative true believer, but he also recognized that rapid economic change could cause chaos and dislocation, and that government had a role to play in smoothing out its rough edges. What defenders of the Republican status quo fail to realize is that unless the party speaks to the interests of working-class voters, they won't just face slightly higher capital gains taxes or more wasteful spending under a Hillary Clinton administration. They will face a backlash from within that threatens to profoundly damage a party that, at its best, is a champion of the core social and economic institutions that made America great in the first place.

That's the consensus about Saturday's Democratic primary in South Carolina. It's the first contest in a state with a large black population, a constituency that heavily favors Clinton. If Sanders loses, he'll need a blowout on Super Tuesday to keep his candidacy alive. And that's looking increasingly unlikely. As of last week, Clinton had 502 pledged delegates to Sanders' 70. A candidate needs 2,383 to win the nomination. Whether you're cheering for Bernie or marching along with Hillary, you'll want to know what Twitter's smartest pundits and politicos are saying. Now you can watch the spin in real time as the results trickle in. Below, you'll see left-leaning commentators on the left and right-leaning commentators on the right. Let the spin begin! Correction, 6:25 p.m.: An earlier version of this piece misstated the Democratic primary delegate count as 474-3. Hillary Clinton has 502 pledged delegates, and Bernie Sanders has 70.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/donald_trump_is_exploiting_cruz_and_rubio_s_biggest_weakness.html	"On Thursday night, for more than two hours, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz pounded Donald Trump with facts and allegations. They said Trump had hired illegal immigrants, had shipped jobs to China and Mexico, and had defrauded people who paid tuition to his university. If you scored the debate on punches, it looked as though Trump lost. But he didn't lose. He won, because debates aren't decided by punches. They're won by the candidate who tells the best story, a story that frames his opponents' arguments as part of his own campaign message. Here's an example of how that's done: Three weeks ago, just before the New Hampshire primary, Rubio came into a Republican debate with a game plan. He was going to compete with Trump and Cruz for angry conservative voters by establishing himself as the candidate most hostile to President Obama. At every opportunity, Rubio denounced Obama as an evil genius who had set out to change America and who ""knows exactly what he's doing."" On the punch scorecard, Rubio did well. But he was destroyed by Gov. Chris Christie, who framed Rubio's message as part of a larger story: that Rubio was robotic, shallow, and unprepared for the general election or the presidency. ""There it is, the memorized 25-second speech,"" Christie told the audience as Rubio repeated his message. Rubio plunged in the polls and was humiliated in the subsequent primary. That's how you beat an opponent in a debate: You anticipate his message, and you make it part of your message. When viewers see your opponent talking, they don't hear what he's saying. They see him doing what you said he would do. It's like throwing a net over a guy who's trying to hit you. His punches don't land on you. He just tires himself out and looks foolish. The more he attacks, the more he loses. That's what Trump did to Rubio and Cruz on Thursday. The two senators came into the debate armed with information about Trump's employment practices, his flirtations with liberalism, and his sketchy college. But the real fight wasn't about that information. The real fight was about what it meant. As they spoke, the three candidates weren't just throwing punches. They were throwing nets. Rubio was casting Trump and Cruz as unelectable. Cruz was casting Trump and Rubio as unprincipled. Trump was casting Rubio and Cruz as politicians. The real fight was between these three stories, these ways of understanding the drama onstage. And Trump's story won. The framing began early, when Rubio went after Trump for hiring foreigners. ""You hired some workers from Poland,"" said Rubio. Trump shot back: ""No, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anybody."" With that, Trump reminded the audience that the complaints about his hiring practices were coming from politicians who produced no jobs. Later, Cruz and Rubio attacked Trump for defending Planned Parenthood. Trump replied: ""I'm pro-life. I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women--cervical cancer, breast cancer--are helped by Planned Parenthood."" When Cruz accused Trump of supporting ""socialized health care,"" Trump responded: ""I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country."" Rubio, aghast, asked, ""This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets ..."" But Trump stood firm: ""Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk."" In both of these exchanges, Trump came across as the only normal person, a man who responds from moral instinct, not from an ideology or a policy manual. Both senators hounded Trump for professing neutrality as a potential broker in Israeli-Palestinian talks. ""I am very pro-Israel,"" Trump insisted. ""But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors."" Rubio launched into a speech about the viciousness of Palestinians. Trump dismissed Rubio's rhetoric as unhelpful: ""You are not a negotiator. And with your thinking, you will never bring peace."" Cruz accused Trump of supporting politicians who undermined Israel. Trump pointed out that he had actually written checks to support Israel. ""You're politicians,"" he told the senators. ""All talk, no action."" Later, Cruz attacked Trump's statements about Libya. Trump answered him with an indictment of the whole political class for military adventurism in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. ""If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Qaddafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be--at least they killed terrorists,"" said Trump. ""We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war."" Toward the end of the debate, Cruz called Trump ""malleable."" He told the businessman, ""For 40 years, you've been funding liberal Democratic politicians."" Trump shot back, ""I funded you."" Rubio, off camera, boasted that Trump ""never funded me."" But Trump wasn't finished. He told the audience that Rubio had ""sent me his book with his autograph"" and a line that said, ""Mr. Trump, you're doing a great job."" The audience laughed throughout the exchange, recognizing that all the talk about principle and writing checks was just part of the political game. In their closing statements, the candidates repeated their main themes. Rubio said he was the only candidate who could end the ""silliness"" and expand the conservative movement. Cruz presented himself as the true believer battling two Washington ""dealmakers."" Trump said his opponents' promises were all theater. ""Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They're all talk, they're no action,"" said Trump. ""Whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core ... or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done."" As the debate ended, I wasn't sure who had won. The senators had raised serious questions about Trump's university, his taxes, and his hiring practices. But then I saw how the talking heads on TV were greeting those questions. They were struck not by the substance of the attacks, but by their timing. They wanted to know why the senators had waited this long, until the 10th Republican debate, to raise issues about Trump that had been public, though not widely shared, for years. Trump had an answer. In three interviews on CNN and Fox News, he said he had expected the attacks because his opponents were doing poorly in the primaries and in polls. He pointed out that he had pulled even with Cruz in Texas and that he was trouncing Rubio in Florida. Rubio hadn't won anything. Cruz had posted three straight third-place finishes. These were desperate men, Trump explained. They were under tremendous pressure. They had no choice but to throw everything at him in the debate, and so they had. Trump's interviewers played along, describing Rubio and Cruz as a ""tag team."" And with that, the net closed. The story of the night wasn't Trump's tax returns, his university, or his Polish workers. It was the politically timed attack by his two opponents. Two senators, down in the polls, were doing what politicians do. Exactly as Trump, the only real guy left in the race, the only one who gets things done, has said all along. In his endorsement of Trump on Friday, Chris Christie drove home Trump's message. Hillary and Bill Clinton ""know how to run the standard political playbook against junior senators and run them around the block,"" said Christie. ""They do not know the playbook with Donald Trump, because he is rewriting the playbook."" Politicians are out, and Trump is in. That's been the story of the campaign, facts be damned.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/cnn_debate_people_are_still_underestimating_donald_trump.html	"For the first time in the GOP presidential race, the Republicans who want the nomination are turning their aim to the outsider who's running away with it. From the jump at Thursday's pre-Super Tuesday CNN debate, Marco Rubio was in Donald Trump's face. ""You've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled,"" said the Florida senator, blasting Trump for using unauthorized labor. Rubio hit Trump on his bankruptcies, and hit him on the scandal that is Trump University. And it was effective. Trump looked rattled. He couldn't talk over Rubio and couldn't give a good response. But after muddling through a question on immigration, Rubio lost the thread of these attacks later in the debate. Ted Cruz attacked too, but he went to more familiar ground, hitting Trump for his ideological heterodoxy. ""Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court,"" said the Texas senator, questioning Trump's commitment to finding a suitable replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Rubio, himself a strongly ideological conservative, jumped in, attacking Trump for his commitment to a health care system--possibly under some form of government involvement--that wouldn't let Americans ""die on the streets."" ""This is a Republican debate, right?"" asked Rubio at the end of this exchange. On Twitter, pundits and observers were thrilled with this skirmish. Finally, Republicans were hitting Trump and taking his threat seriously. ""Best thing Rubio has done is to belittle Trump, undercutting him when he tries to apply his 'dealmaking' to everything,"" tweeted Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner. ""Exposing ignorance."" Likewise, said Ian Tuttle of National Review, ""Interruption is succeeding for Trump, but Rubio & Cruz have looked like adults and his equals--and on substance, obviously his superiors."" Both statements are true. But does that matter? Earlier this week in Nevada, I attended two events for Trump. One, at an arena in the south of Las Vegas, was a last hurrah before the caucus. The other, the next night, was to celebrate Trump's massive victory in that caucus. When I spoke to Trump supporters, at both events, I heard a single refrain: Trump says what we're all thinking, Trump doesn't talk down to us. These aren't idle comments. Trump has ideas and beliefs, but he's not winning because Republicans back his policies or hold his ideology. He's winning because, like the most effective demagogues, he's built an emotional bond with his audience. Somehow, pundits don't see this, and so they cheer for Rubio's attacks on Trump's knowledge and Cruz's attacks on Trump's ideology (or lack thereoef), blind to the fact that competence and belief are orthogonal to his appeal. They're not even key to actual Republican voters, who Trump's rise has shown are more tribal than ideological. They don't care that Trump doesn't have specifics, that he can't give details on the wall with Mexico, or his trade war with China. What they see is that Trump is like them. He talks like them. He jokes like them. He shares their anger and their prejudice. He shares their fear. He even talks about the government like they do. Majorities of Americans think their tax dollars go largely to foreign aid; they think we spend too much on other countries when there are problems in the United States that need solving. When Trump says, ""We're losing so much with Mexico and China,"" he's speaking directly to millions of Americans who think they're funding adversaries and enemies, at the cost of their own opportunity and success. On the same score, Trump speaks to a deep fear of loss, a product of the trauma of the Great Recession. It's the basis for his entire riff on health care. ""We are going to have private health care,"" he said, ""but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president."" All of this is why Cruz and Rubio will fall flat with their attacks. For the most part, they hit him from the right, as if Trump was just another politician, walking an ideological bridge too far. But that's wrong. Trump doesn't win his support from the most conservative Republicans; his base is among moderates and ""somewhat"" conservative voters. On the same score, it doesn't make sense to hit Trump for his lack of policy knowledge. He isn't winning because he's competent; he's winning because he connects with millions of Republicans who feel, strongly, that their leaders aren't interested in them or their lives. Trump, more than anyone else in the GOP field, feels their pain. The only way to stop Trump is to attack that and discredit the idea that Trump is anything but selfish. You need to show that he's a con man who doesn't care about them, who will exploit their trust and discard them as soon as he wins power. In short, you need to break those bonds of empathy and show Trump for the liar and opportunist that he is. Which is why, of all the attacks on Trump, the only one that landed--that has resonance with his supporters--is Rubio's Halloween Gambit to knock Trump off balance with his blows on Trump University, which goes after the core of Trump's appeal. Show that he exploited ordinary Americans, and you mar his facade of compassion and understanding. If Team Rubio is smart, it will focus all of their fire on this point, and force Trump to respond. No, it won't be enough to save Super Tuesday, where Trump holds a definitive lead. But it might be what it takes to block Trump before it's too late, and finally open Rubio's path to victory."

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/donald_trump_would_very_likely_lose_to_hillary_clinton.html	"With three victories behind him and even more on the horizon, Donald Trump has a clear path to the Republican presidential nomination. Which leads to a natural question: Could he win the White House? The case for yes is straightforward. We live in the age of narrow victories, where 51 percent of the popular vote is a solid win, and 53 percent is an outright mandate. Donald Trump is erratic, offensive to many, and broadly unpopular. But with the GOP nomination, he would have the instant support of tens of millions of Americans--enough to reach a high plurality in a national election. From there, a sudden recession--the collapse of the Chinese stock market, perhaps--or a terrorist attack could drive swing voters into Trump's waiting arms. On the morning of Nov. 9, given the right conditions, we could be looking at President-elect Donald Trump. Or, as my colleague Josh Voorhees writes in a piece on Trump's chances, ""Trump has been proving politicos, pundits, and political journalists wrong for the better part of a year now. I'm not willing to count him out come fall."" For all the above reasons, I wouldn't count him out either. But epistemological caution shouldn't blind us to the facts on the ground. For as much as he could win, the safe bet is that Trump would probably lose the general election, and then some. It's true that Trump is an opportunist who could easily contort himself for a general electorate, emphasizing his moderate positions on health care and foreign policy, and toning down his aggressive nationalism. But this also assumes a static political climate. For all their criticism of Trump in debates and on the stump, none of the Republican candidates have made a real effort against Trump. ""Multiple Republican campaign sources and operatives have confided that none of the remaining candidates for president have completed a major anti-Trump opposition research effort,"" reports Sam Stein for the Huffington Post. All of this would change in a general election. There, he would face the full fire of a Democratic Party that has spent eight months accumulating information for an anti-Trump deluge. With the full support of the Republican Party, Trump could survive that attack. And negative partisanship--the degree to which people vote against the other party more than they affirm their own--means he'll enter a general election with substantial Republican backing (assuming he wins the nomination outright). At the same time, judged by favorability ratings, Trump is far from the most popular Republican, and is the least popular candidate in the presidential race, period. When you combine his base unpopularity with Democratic attacks on everything from his bigotry to his business record, it's hard to believe he gets a substantial improvement in his favorability for the general election. Given her own general unpopularity, you might say the same for Hillary Clinton. The difference is twofold. First, unlike Trump and Republicans, Clinton is popular with the large majority of Democrats. And second, if she's the nominee, she'll also benefit from a rallying effect, boosting her numbers further. Come September, after the conventions, partisan Democrats will remember that Clinton is also a partisan Democrat, and move accordingly. The same would be true for Bernie Sanders, although he, like Trump, would also face a deluge of unfamiliar attacks. All of this gets to something important. Right now, Trump is driving up turnout in nominating contests without prompting a counter-reaction within the Republican Party. As BuzzFeed's Adam Serwer argued, this has a lot to do with the GOP's electorate. Put simply, the vast majority of Republican primary voters are white, and many of them hold views that aren't far from Trump's, even if they don't like him. Revulsion aside, he's not activating a real opposition among GOP backers. But he is activating opposition among voters writ large. Hispanic voters are fiercely anti-Trump (he has a negative 64 percent favorability rating among that group, according to a recent Univision poll), and Trump's presence may drive millions more Latino voters to the polls to cast a ballot for the Democratic nominee. Indeed, national polling on the question is sparse, but state polling suggests massive unpopularity for Trump among Democratic constituencies. A recent Rutgers University poll of New Jersey has Trump at a 74 percent unfavorable rating with minorities in that state, a 66 percent unfavorable rating with millennials, and a 65 percent unfavorable rating with women. A Quinnipiac poll of Ohio shows a similar result, with a 71 percent unfavorable rating among millennials, a 66 percent rating among women, and a 94 percent rating among black Americans. Other surveys show similar results, with deep antipathy for Trump among blacks. If these issues are borne out in a general election, then Trump will have an even larger problem than negative attacks. He'll have a negative electoral map. With abysmal ratings among blacks and Latinos, Trump is uniquely unsuited to this year's demographics, which--all things equal--has a modest tilt toward Democrats. With Marco Rubio or John Kasich, Republicans might have a chance with minority voters. With Trump, that's gone. To win, he would need to bring a massive influx of new white voters and create a further swing towards Republicans among existing white voters, all without alienating moderate whites or sparking counter-mobilization from nonwhites. The fundamentals of the election are also important. It's obscured by horse race reporting, but topline conditions for 2016 show a tight race, with odds slightly favoring the Democrats. What does that mean? First, that the economy is decent. We don't have the strong growth we need to resolve the output gap, but we've also left the doldrums of 2011 and 2012. Wages are up (slightly), more Americans are working, and fewer people are leaving the workforce. It's no surprise, then, that the other variable for forecasting the presidential election--Barack Obama's job approval--is also trending upward. Since January, Obama's job approval rating has grown 2.5 points in the HuffPost Pollster average, to 47.8 percent. If you isolate Gallup, Obama has been pushing 50 percent for the past month. A decent economy and a well-liked president are the necessary conditions for an incumbent party that wants to win a third term. For Trump--and any Republican--it would be an uphill struggle. Yes, anything is possible. Trump could ride a reactionary wave to the White House. But not everything is probable, and the obstacles to a Trump victory are yuge. Trump worsens the GOP's problem with minorities and single women, with no guarantee of a larger electorate to compensate for the loss. And Trump is so alien to parts of the Republican establishment that there's a chance he could drive down GOP turnout among its most reliable voters. We shouldn't underrate Donald Trump, but we shouldn't overrate him either. All things considered, he's a loser."	Why You Really Shouldn't Worry About Donald Trump Winning the White House
