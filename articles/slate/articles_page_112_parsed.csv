Unable to stand it, Allen interrupts and tells the man he's wrong. The pedant replies that he's a professor who teaches on the topic. Allen has the perfect retort. He steps out of the theater line and pulls from the wings McLuhan, who tells the man he's thoroughly incorrect and wonders aloud how he ever got a teaching position. Allen turns to the camera lamenting that life is never like this. In the debate over health care reform, West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd plays the role of Marshall McLuhan. Republicans have been appropriating him at every turn. They cite the Senate's longest-serving member to support their argument that President Obama and Senate Democrats are breaking the rules to pass health care legislation. Byrd is a good one to quote. He is the Senate's unofficial historian and protector of its prerogatives and procedures. He also wrote the rules that are at issue. So this week 41 Republicans wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that featured a quote from Byrd calling the use of reconciliation an ""outrage."" A day later, John McCain distributed a video of Byrd railing against using reconciliation to pass health care legislation. They are willfully misreading Byrd. (See update below.) In the speech Republicans cite, Byrd was talking about an entirely different situation: He was referring to the idea of passing Bill Clinton's entire health care bill through the reconciliation process, which is meant only for legislation having to do with revenue. His argument was that the scope of the bill (very large) and the time for debate (very limited) made use of reconciliation improper. But neither factor is at play this time. One, the health care bill has been debated (almost literally) to death in the Senate. Indeed, it has passed, with 60 votes. Second, the bill that will go through the reconciliation process is a far smaller bill than the one Byrd was talking about a year ago on the floor of the Senate and in the  Washington Post. Republicans don't need to guess at what the senator believes. A week before the Republicans launched this latest round of Byrd-quoting, he wrote a letter to the Charleston Daily Mail. In it, he essentially endorsed reconciliation as Democrats plan to use it."	The Republicans' mistreatment of Sen. Robert Byrd in their fight against health care reform.

They've been everywhere you look lately. This Sunday, he'll be on the cover of the New York Times magazine. Next Sunday, he will be a part of a 60 Minutes story, along with his brothers Zeke and Ari. It's not good for an administration when staffers are in the news this much. The Washington press corps covers the machinations and not the message. It also creates gossip and confusion in the White House, where staffers sometimes are the last to know what's going on in the office down the hall. Why now? Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., was elected. If Democrats hadn't lost their supermajority in the Senate, health care reform would probably have passed by now, and there would be fewer Obama-is-in-trouble stories and less concern with finding the root cause of the current stall. But in another sense, these stories were inevitable--what's surprising is that they didn't come sooner. Obama chose Emanuel for many of the qualities that are now causing attention. His administration has internal tension by design. Emanuel was always going to be at the center of the inevitable crackups that would occur between Obama's promises to usher in a new kind of politics and the messier necessities of governing. At times, Emanuel's job description could be: Head of Doing Things Obama Ran Against. The president came to town preaching the ideology of pragmatism. This required Emanuel's deal-cutting skill and his willingness to put aside ideology, as he had when he recruited anti-abortion, pro-gun candidates to help Democrats take back the House. Obama didn't give up on his pledge to hold health care negotiations in public because Emanuel tricked him into making backroom bargains. He knew he'd have to make those kinds of deals, and he picked someone who could work the inevitably complex relationship with Congress necessary to make progress. Emanuel's job requirements also include designing escape hatches for the president, like a Plan B if the current push for health care reform fails. This is nothing more than prudent planning, but it can look like you're working at cross purposes. Emanuel was picked not just for knowing how to make deals, but for knowing how to weather the abuse that comes from disappointed liberals. Liberals who are disappointed in Emanuel are, in part, using him as a scapegoat for their disappointment in Obama-- just as Obama imagined they might. The good-cop, bad-cop relationship is standard for a president and a chief of staff. It allows the president to stay above the fray. Yes, but don't all these stories of Emanuel's role in decision-making show a White House in dysfunction? Not really. The inside back-and-forth also seems thoroughly normal. It should not be unexpected that there are serious disagreements in a White House. A president's job is to make hard decisions. By definition, that means people close to you disagree. In its early days, the George W. Bush White House was often held up as a model of collegiality and efficiency. Yet as Ron Suskind first reported in 2002, then-Chief of Staff Andy Card lamented that every day he had to adjudicate a constant tussle between Karl Rove and Karen Hughes. It eventually wore Hughes down and she went back to Austin. The other striking aspect of this story is that, as Noam Scheiber points out, ""Emanuel manages to lose an awful lot of internal battles for someone with an ostensible vise grip on the presidency."" The usual downside of staff stories is that they make the president look disengaged. In the current crop of stories, Obama seems extremely engaged (which also makes it harder to believe that Emanuel is making any deal that Obama doesn't know about). These Emanuel stories also are pretty much without drama. There are stories about his dramatic behavior in the past but not from this current White House. Debates were had. Some he won. Some he lost. In the Clinton White House, the president was known for his purple-faced rages. Karl Rove was, at times, a screamer. Given Rahm Emanuel's reputation, you'd think that after he lost one of these debates, he'd have thrown a chair through the window (and then run out to the front lawn and thrown it back in again). Still, one of the job requirements of the chief of staff is that he only appear in the news on his own terms. It is unhelpful for Obama that one of the reasons Emanuel is in the news is that he's identified with his early advice that health care reform should have moved more slowly at the precise moment that Republicans are making this case. It makes Obama look like he screwed up the strategy, and you could imagine a GOP politician turning the president's chief of staff against him. ""The president should have listened to his chief of staff, Mr. Emanuel, when he said we should reform health care in incremental steps,"" a senator might lament. Despite the noise, Emanuel is still in the center of issues like closing Guantanamo Bay and passing health care reform. Late Tuesday, he went to Capitol Hill to meet with congressional leaders to speed the process. It's another skill Obama relied on when picking Emanuel--the ability to keep his head down in the middle of the Washington circus. He did, after all, work through the Monica Lewinsky scandal during the Clinton presidency. Sure, there's that Eric Massa story about Emanuel confronting him in the nude in the House gym. But things haven't gotten that weird in the Obama White House yet. Become a fan of John Dickerson on Facebook. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

Now, with November approaching, not only have Republicans reached dry land, they're poised to drown Democrats in their own ethical filth. What's changed? Very little--and that's the point. It's not that Republicans have become saints and Democrats have become devils. It's that Democrats are in power. The cycle of scandal is less about dramatic spikes in misbehavior than increased scrutiny trained on the party that's in power, combined with the outsize media response to the ethical lapses of a few. Remember Election Day 2006? The Republicans were grievously wounded by scandals. Rep. Tom DeLay's resignation in the wake of the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal fed the impression that Republicans were in the pocket of corporations. Rep. Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham's resignation and tearful confession to charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion threatened to taint the GOP as a bunch of crooks. Then, a month before Election Day, revelations that Rep. Mark Foley had exchanged inappropriate IMs with male pages completed the picture of the Republican Party as a political garden of earthly delights. Democrats may not have yet matched GOP's lows of 2006, but they're on their way. New York Rep. Charlie Rangel stepped down Wednesday from his post as chairman of the House ways and means committee after the ethics committee censured him for taking corporate-sponsored Caribbean junkets in 2007 and 2008. His House colleague Eric Massa also announced his retirement this week following reports that he may have sexually harassed a male staffer. (Massa cited ill health as his reason for retiring.) That's a week after New York Gov. David Paterson said he would not run for re-election, obviously dictated by New York Times stories about him allegedly intervening in a domestic violence case involving a top aide. Factor in reminders of Democratic scandals past--a new tell-all book about Eliot Spitzer by a former confidante has pushed the former governor back into the news, the John Edwards saga continues, and the trial of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is scheduled for early June--and the Democrats are approaching November nearly as tarnished as their opponents were four years ago. The most reliable predictor of which party will find itself enmeshed in scandal is which one is in power. ""I've always called elections the opportunity to throw the bums out and throw a new set of bums in,"" says Larry Sabato, political analyst and prognosticator extraordinaire of the University of Virginia. ""Partisans never believe that. They think their side is golden and the opposition is a bunch of second cousins to Beelzebub."" Politicians in power compromise themselves more frequently because they have more opportunities to compromise themselves. The only reason Blagojevich could put Obama's seat up for sale was because he was governor. And the longer a party is in power, the more time it has to get comfortable and screw up--hence the backlog of GOP misconduct in 2006, after 12 years dominating Congress. But more important is the increased scrutiny. Any member of Congress is a target for an ethics probe. But the higher his profile, the greater the scrutiny--and the farther they have to fall. Rangel had been going on corporate-sponsored junkets for a decade. (However, the rules he broke by doing so were only in place since 2007.) Meanwhile, his failure to pay federal taxes on rental income for a house he owns in the Dominican Republic, his use of a House of Representatives parking garage as storage space for his Mercedes-Benz, and his ownership of four rent-controlled apartments in Manhattan date back years. But only when Rangel took over the ways and means committee in 2007 did he become a plum target for reporters and congressional probes. It's not fair that the ethical misadventures of a few are extrapolated to define the entire party, but they are. ""In a field like politics that runs on ambition, a certain percentage of people will be corrupt, period,"" says Sabato. Promising to run ""the most honest, most open and most ethical congress in history,"" as Pelosi did, is not just futile; it raises expectation dangerously high. The party in power inevitably produces its own scandals, making the original pledge look absurd when its members lapse. Yet everyone makes the promise. Jimmy Carter promised to be the most honest and ethical president ever and never to lie. Bill Clinton entered the White House flinging similar rhetoric. Both presidents ate their words--Carter for Bert Lance, Clinton for the obvious. The lesson is simple, says Sabato: Don't set impossible standards. Here's what he suggests politicians say: ""I can guarantee there are people on my side who will stretch the limits and do things I don't approve of. I can't do everything to stop it, but I will endeavor to punish them."" That way, their words can't be used against them when they fall short of perfection. Of course, promising to run a ""pretty darn honest and ethical Congress, if you ask me"" doesn't have quite the same ring. But it's certainly more realistic. Become a fan of Slate on Facebook.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/gop_1_obama_1_democrats_0.html	"If the White House health care summit was political theater, here's a 30-second review: President Obama won. So did congressional Republicans. Democrats in Congress need another act. This is not because Obama is such a better speaker and advocate for the legislation than his allies, though he is. It's because Democrats didn't get much political benefit from the event. Obama ran for office promising to reach out to the other party. He said he would try to find areas of common agreement, and when his opponents had a legitimate philosophical disagreement, he would not question their motives. He did all of that in the session. Obama was not the crazy liberal caricature of GOP attacks during the seven-hour iron-bottom discussion. (Which may itself have been bad for the health of the people in the room.) Republicans came out ahead for the same reason: They did not look like hell-bent obstructionists. This isn't to say that they tried to meet the president halfway. They didn't even try to meet him a quarter of the way. Repeatedly they called on him to start over. The president tried to get the room to focus on areas of agreement, and though several Republicans--notably Sen. Tom Coburn and Rep. Dave Camp--worked in that spirit, several others (hello, Reps. John Boehner and Eric Cantor) did not. John McCain offered a prolonged critique. Obama had promised to hold negotiations in public, and he didn't. He promised not to negotiate behind closed doors, but he did. He is thinking about using reconciliation to pass the bill. ""John, the campaign is over,"" Obama said in response, showing mild irritation. But how did he repay McCain's political shots? Later, he agreed with McCain that there should be no special deals for various states in the bill. (McCain was so surprised, he almost couldn't take yes for an answer.) At another point, Obama praised McCain for sticking to his principles by not voting for Medicare Part D in 2007. This is why it wasn't a good day for congressional Democrats. According to strategists involved in 2010 races, fence-sitting Democrats needed to see Obama change the political dynamic. He needed to show how health care reform could be defended and how Republicans could be brought low. He did neither. White House aides and the president himself said he was going to press Republicans for how their plans would work, but he did that only twice--and mildly. There was no put-up-or-shut-up moment. Obama debated Republicans vigorously and with precision--but it looked like a debate among people with actual philosophical differences, which in part it was. After an in-the-weeds debate about how the Congressional Budget Office accounted for premium increases, it became clear that the debate was between Democrats who want to set minimum standards for coverage and Republicans who want the market and individual choice to rule. The Democratic plan is more expensive but covers more people. The Republican plan is cheaper and doesn't. As it played out, the event didn't look like one reasonable person aligned against a company of hooting morons. As Obama said during the lunch break: ""The argument Republicans are making really isn't that this is a government takeover of health care, but rather that we're insuring the--or we're regulating the insurance market too much. And that's a legitimate philosophical disagreement."" Obama continued to affirm this view by saying things like this: ""Neither of these proposals is radical. The question is which one works best."" The president may very well think Republicans are crazy. But he didn't say so, or even show it. For someone who may have been listening closely, the president's command of detail may have been convincing. And in some cases, like the dispute over how premiums would be affected by the new system, he was right (but you had to read CNN, the AP, the  Washington Post, or the  Wall Street Journal later to know it). For most others who watched--and for those who didn't--health care still seems like a pretty complicated issue that needs careful consideration. That's exactly what Republicans are calling for, which is why the event worked with their pre-existing conditions. The complexity demonstrated today helps Republicans because they're arguing that Congress should address the issue incrementally. There are policy arguments against this approach, which Sen. Ron Wyden says actually ""does less and costs more."" Yet that case wasn't convincingly made today. Obama and Democrats have been making the case for comprehensive coverage for months, and they haven't convinced anyone. In fact, people like the legislation less. Nothing today changed that dynamic. So what was Obama up to with all of this reasonableness? Maybe he never thought Republicans would actually meet him halfway. Now when he supports the Senate as it proceeds to try to pass the bulk of health care reform by majority vote, he can say he did everything he could and that Republicans just weren't willing to join in. The public is in a position to believe this. Polls have consistently showed that by an almost 2-to-1 margin, people give Obama credit over Republicans when asked who is trying harder to find bipartisan solutions. ""That's what elections are for,"" he said at the end when contemplating what might happen if Democrats proceed without Republican support. ""We have honest disagreements about a vision for the country, and we'll go ahead and test those out over the next several months till November."" Of course, for the president, there isn't an election for more than two years. That scary fact didn't come up today, but it may explain some of the differences between the president and congressional Democrats. Become a fan of  Slate and  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/whose_side_are_you_on.html	"Which are you more afraid of: the president or the insurance industry? This is the key question of Thursday's White House health care summit. There may be moments when it will seem like both sides are debating tax credits. But it's really this question they'll be debating. You can switch to the women's curling semifinal without fear; Washington's leaders will be fighting over the same territory when you switch back. In fact, whether health care reform passes or not, this debate will go on for the rest of this election year. If you are afraid of President Obama and congressional Democrats, then you will see this final push for health care reform as a scheme to bankrupt the country and ruin your current health care and as proof of a government-knows-best approach that will slowly erode personal freedoms. If you are afraid of the insurance industry, you'll see the Republican obstructionism in the face of rising premiums and inflation as an unconscionable abandonment of those who can't afford coverage now and those middle-class families who soon won't be able to. The half-day event is supposed to be a discussion. But the pregame posturing suggests it's more likely to resemble a genuine exchange of ideas about as closely as, say, a presidential debate. The president offered his case in his Sunday radio address. ""The other week, men and women across California opened up their mailboxes to find a letter from Anthem Blue Cross. The news inside was jaw-dropping. Anthem was alerting almost a million of its customers that it would be raising premiums by an average of 25 percent, with about a quarter of folks likely to see their rates go up by anywhere from 35 to 39 percent."" He argued that, unchecked, insurance companies would raise premiums that would cripple middle-class families and small businesses. Monday, Obama presented a plan that included measures intended to keep insurance companies from raising rates too high. Republicans responded by denouncing it almost immediately. Their main argument didn't come from the Heritage Foundation or Hoover Institution, but from public opinion polls. Minority Leader John Boehner said the president's plan was based on ""a partisan bill the American people have already rejected."" In the Senate, Mitch McConnell accused the administration of ""completely ignoring what Americans across the country have been saying."" John Cornyn said the plan was based on one that had already been ""overwhelmingly rejected by the American people."" Politicians claim to ignore the polls. Yet they know citing public opinion is powerful in these kinds of debates: It shows that the politician making the charge is in touch with the wisdom of the voters. And it further suggests that his opponent is not only out of touch, but is also actively ignoring the good people of his home district. A politician trying to refute this line of attack must do so carefully or risk looking like he thinks the noble voters are stupid. Sometimes public opinion is in line with policy arguments. Sometimes it is a substitute for them. Last week, during the one-year anniversary of the stimulus bill, Republicans cited as proof the program had failed to create jobs a CBS poll showing only 6 percent of the American people said it had worked. (This kind of thing must make them start drinking early at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) To refute these charges, Obama will offer his own kind of populist stance. He'll have to ignore the arguments about what the polls show--that kind of debate only leads to a numbing discussion of polling minutia that means nothing to regular people. Instead he'll focus on another set of figures--and that's where the insurance companies come in. The premium-increase figures may be a big enough number to shock viewers into wondering why Republicans claim to speak for the people but cite opinion polls rather than joining with the president to drive down premium costs. If Republicans point out that Obama's insurance horror stories apply to only 7 percent of the insurance market, the president and Democrats will use that to position their opponents as defenders of the insurance industry. It's a part of a longer-term strategy in which Obama and his allies will offer regulation to protect people from any corporate entity deemed dangerous. ""Anything that forces Republicans to defend insurance companies, Wall Street, drug companies, etc., is a win for us,"" said one strategist involved in the 2010 races. It's a twist on Obama's oft-stated goal of bringing about change. With this strategy, he is not an agent of positive change, but a guardian against unwanted change. Obama has two audiences Thursday. He needs to convince the public that reform is necessary and that Republicans don't have a plan. He also needs to convince House and Senate Democrats that they can win this argument in the public square. The central argument White House officials and their allies make to nervous Democrats is that the public has reacted negatively to the political process but not the underlying measures. Once a bill is passed, the public will react favorably to the substance of the new law. (By holding the summit, Obama hopes to replace Congress as the public face of reform. It's not the first time he's tried.) Rather than making the debate a referendum on the messy congressional process, which aides the party out of power, Democrats want to make the debate about whether Republicans choose to stand with middle-class voters or with insurance companies. In recent weeks, Democrats have benefited by debate over the stimulus bill, as much of the GOP opposition has appeared political rather than principled. They hope to make the same case with health care. In a time when analogies to the Clinton years seem to abound, some Democrats hope that on Thursday the president creates a tipping-point moment in which GOP obstructionism is so evident, it rivals the 1995 GOP government shutdown that wound up favoring Bill Clinton. (That's a stretch. No one is losing services in a way they can immediately recognize, as they did during the Gingrich shutdown. And there is no equivalent of Gingrich to get grumpy about being seated too far back on Air Force One.) This will be a tough balancing act for Obama. He will have to be political without seeming to be if he wants to create the kind of comparison that puts Republicans on the defensive. He'll have to retain a bipartisan posture to show that he is not the liberal zealot of the GOP caricature. Yet he'll also have to draw bright partisan lines by pressing Republicans on their plans. This is a president, remember, who called for politicians to work together in his State of the Union address just days after campaigning against future Sen. Scott Brown by arguing that Brown was a captive of the insurance companies and banks. Obama might seek the counsel of his White House ushers, who are highly skilled at managing White House functions. When they want to nudge guests toward the exit, doors start to shut and little velvet ropes start to appear. For guests who don't get the hint, the ushers smile pleasantly and nod. And then, if they must, they put a comforting hand on you to guide you to your destination. So the president must do Thursday: Be kind and hospitable to his guests while at the same time putting them into a corner. Become a fan of John Dickerson on Facebook."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/obamas_timid_tweets.html	"In the deep freeze of Washington politics, two small new stratagems were launched this week. The White House initiated yet another communications strategy change that included press secretary Robert Gibbs taking to Twitter. Conservatives, by contrast, went into the past, holding a ""signing ceremony"" for a set of principles that affirmed the power of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Both moves were novel yet thoroughly familiar. They were the latest tactics in a long partisan struggle. They were also the latest demonstration that at this moment of stalemate, Washington's tolerance for risk and appetite for failure has reached a new low. The new communications plan and move to Twitter wasn't the most important or interesting thing that happened at the White House this week, but it was the newest thing. Alas, the move only simply shrank an old battlefield. The White House can now respond even faster to the latest charge or debate. What was already a block-by-block war is now being fought room-by-room. (Look out--John Boehner grabbed a lamp!) The problem with the conservatives' Mount Vernon Statement is that while it reached for scope (you can't get much bigger than the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence), it was thoroughly anodyne. It was so unspecific even its signatories like Richard Viguerie said it was ""pabulum"" and ""embarrassing."" It was an attempt to take a stand while in full repose. ""This is something new."" In Washington politics, the phrase is not often heard. Business, art, and science require risk-taking. Our military strategy in two countries is based on risk-taking. In Washington, there is little of it. Sen. Evan Bayh announced his retirement this week, citing the town's partisanship, but then didn't take a stand and name the specific offenders. (Maybe that would have been too partisan of him.) The president announced a bipartisan commission to tackle the budget deficit, which is Washington's way of tricking itself into taking a risk that politicians won't take themselves. Members of Congress--including seven Republicans who had proposed the idea--were even too chicken to vote for a bipartisan commission. This is the political equivalent of being too timid to take a nap. By risk-taking, I don't mean loudly advocating some piece of ideology that will only glorify you with your political base. I mean taking a risk with your political standing. Sen. Judd Gregg did this a little when he momentarily signed up with the Obama administration. Obama did this recently when he suggested he could give up his pledge not to tax people who made less than $250,000 as a part of larger deficit reduction. (When John McCain picked Sarah Palin, that was more a gamble than a risk.) The reason politicians are even more risk-averse is that lots of them are reeling from the big chance the president took on passing health care legislation. This was a risk and an act of leadership, the kinds of things pundits are always calling for from presidents. Yet when a risk-taking move winds up being unpredictable, creates problems, and tempts failure--all of which risk-taking moves tend to do--the reaction from pundits and the political class is explosive. Risk requires tolerating uncertainty, but Washington doesn't allow it. Sure, some people observe that big risks are sometimes messy. But more likely there will be a hunting party convened to identify the fundamental flaws or incompetent officials behind the policy or initiative. Someone may even issue a call to fire the entire senior staff of the White House. Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, wrote recently in the Washington Post about the need for innovation and risk-taking in business. But the message applies to Washington, too: ""Encouraging risk-taking means tolerating failure--provided we learn from it. If we want to be a leader in new industries such as green energy, we have to accept that some of our investments won't pan out. Show me a program with a 100 percent success rate, and I'll show you one with 0 percent innovation."" Politically it would be foolish for Obama to panic with a staff firing unless he wants to complete  the Jimmy Carter analogies. (On July 17, 1979, Carter asked his entire Cabinet to resign.) Why fire the staff for mistakes he made or because the Senate filibuster has become perverted? A firing would also trade away his one central characteristic: his equanimity. If Obama gets rattled enough to throw over his staff, then we should all worry about his ability to make it through the next tough spot. (And if you're a remaining staff member, you should worry if you'll be next under the bus.) There are, of course, limits to risk-taking. We want governments to be risk-averse and not go dashing off to wars that are not in our strategic interest (or at least to think through what we do after we take the dictator's statue down). Right now we should be very happy that government is trying to take some of the risk out of the financial system, because banks and insurance companies thought they had come up with a way of getting around risk--and it crippled the economy. But an act of actual risk-taking by some politician might suggest a simple truth: that someone voted into office to represent the people did something that was not in his or her self interest. And unless someone in Congress or the White House takes a risk pretty soon, we're going to spend the rest of the year feeling about our politics the way we did in Washington after last week's blizzard--shut-in and cranky.

But the first bipartisan decision Obama and GOP need to make is what, exactly, bipartisanship means. Obama first floated the idea of a televised two-party summit during the Super Bowl pregame show, while millions of Americans were watching. ""Let's just go through these bills--their ideas, our ideas--let's walk through them in a methodical way so that the American people can see and compare what makes the most sense,"" Obama told Katie Couric. Republicans said they'd be willing to meet with Obama--so long as he promised to scrap the current Senate and House legislation and start over. Otherwise, Republicans would be ""reluctant to participate,"" according to a letter Minority Leader John Boehner and Minority Whip Eric Cantor wrote to Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed the need to ""go step-by-step on a truly bipartisan basis to try to reach an agreement."" Obama rejected the request for a do-over. Bipartisanship doesn't mean ""Democrats give up everything they believe in,"" he said. ""Bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both Democrats and Republicans to put aside matters of party for the good of the country."" Obama and the Republicans aren't just talking past one another. They're not even speaking the same language. They're using the same word--bipartisanship--but they mean two different things. And neither version is especially productive. The main difference between them is the amount of minority participation necessary to call a process ""bipartisan."" For Obama, bipartisanship means good-faith outreach to the other party, a genuine consideration of their ideas, and incorporation of those ideas that both parties agree on. But the starting point is what Democrats want. Republicans' definition of bipartisanship is starting at zero and building from there. In other words, the two parties begin on equal footing. In Republicans' defense, Obama has been gradually defining bipartisanship down. It no longer means getting Republican votes on legislation. Merely incorporating Republican ideas into a bill is enough--even if Republicans didn't support the bill overall. The Senate health, education, labor, and pensions committee's passage of a health care bill that included ""more than 160 amendments"" was thus touted as a bipartisan accomplishment and a fulfillment of Obama's pledge to change the tone in Washington. In his ""Question Time"" session with the GOP leadership in Baltimore, Obama seemed to define bipartisanship further down: His mere presence among them--listening and debating--has been cited as a kind of bipartisanship. On Tuesday Robert Gibbs suggested that the health care bill is already bipartisan, since it includes many Republican ideas. This won't amuse Republicans. If the White House already considers the bill bipartisan--whereas Republicans say they detest the bill--how many more concessions is the GOP likely to get? Reports that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plan to hammer out a compromise before the meeting even takes place provide the answer. But Republicans have refused to take the hands Obama has extended. The bipartisan Gang of Six failed to yield Republican votes on health care reform. Olympia Snowe voted for the Senate finance committee's bill, only to vote against the final, largely more moderate version. Not one Republican voted for the stimulus package, despite its nearly $300 billion in tax cuts. Add GOP refusal to cast a single vote for the budget and you've got a picture not of principled opposition but of knee-jerk opposition. As Rachel Maddow put it in this almost painful-to-watch segment, Republicans have repeatedly rejected ideas with which they agree simply because they're offered by Democrats. (Even if the two parties did meet face to face in an honest way, it's unclear that a ""compromise"" version of health care reform is even possible. And prospects for a bipartisan jobs bill don't look much better.) Meanwhile, the notion that bipartisanship means starting from scratch on equal footing has little precedent. ""Elections have consequences,"" members of Congress like to say--often in celebration, but just as often as a humble acknowledgement that they no longer have sway. The Republican definition of bipartisanship, at the moment, seems to suggest that elections do not have consequences--or, more charitably, that a special Senate election in Massachusetts is more consequential than 59 other Senate elections, 236 House elections, and a presidential election combined. No matter who is in power, both parties have equal ability to forge legislation. The result is deadlock. Both sides stonewall while hiding behind the supposed principle of bipartisanship. But in reality, they can't even agree on what they're talking about when they use the word. Of course, there's a reason for this: The word is meaningless. Bipartisanship is an ideal that politicians pursue when it's convenient for them, not when it's politically risky. As the parties become increasingly polarized, it's rarely politically convenient. As a result, bipartisanship has become, well, more partisan. Politicians are less likely to claim they're bipartisan, but more likely to accuse the other guy of not being bipartisan. If Democrats and Republicans want to achieve bipartisanship, perhaps a first step would be to agree on a meaning. Sounds like a job for a bipartisan commission."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/the_senators_dilemma.html	"The Senate likes to think of itself as the world's greatest deliberative body. But there's a less charitable way to think about it: It's the world's greatest collective-action problem. Passing health care reform has been the Democrats' worst nightmare, but it's a game theorist's dream. The dilemma is simple. The worst-case scenario for Democrats as a whole is to pass no health care bill at all. (Both chambers have already voted in favor of health care reform, so Democrats have spent political capital without anything to show for it.) And yet some individual Democrats oppose moving forward with the bill. And Republicans, of course, have many reasons to oppose it on both individual and collective grounds: They may disagree with its proposals, and, politically, they have no incentive to join the opposition. It turns out the dilemma facing Democrats reflects a classic model in game theory, explained Kevin Morrison, a professor who teaches game theory at Cornell University. Or, rather, two classic models, depending how you look at it. The first is the ""prisoner's dilemma,"" the other is a model called ""the battle of the sexes."" The prisoner's dilemma imagines two prisoners locked in separate cells. If both deny committing a crime, they both go free. If one cooperates and the other denies, the one who cooperates goes free and the other gets locked away. If they both confess, they're both screwed. In other words, it's in their collective interest to deny but in their individual interests to cooperate. The political equivalent is that when all other Democrats are voting for health care reform, it's in an individual Democrat's interest to oppose it. And not just for ideological reasons. By holding out, he or she can extract concessions in exchange for his or her support. If the whole thing collapses, that's bad for the Democrat in the end. But short-term calculus suggests he or she should oppose it. There are two ways to solve this kind of problem, Morrison explained: Change the payoff system or promise to return the favor later. Changing the payoffs basically means adding incentives to cooperate. Hence the ""cornhusker kickback"" Sen. Ben Nelson was able to extract for Nebraska and the ""Louisiana purchase"" Sen. Mary Landrieu got for her state. Future promises work in repetitive systems, where similar dilemmas come up again. The Senate is a perfect example. If Nelson supports health care reform, for example, Majority Leader Harry Reid will be sure to prioritize Nelson's pet legislation next time around. Adding Republicans to the mix complicates things a bit. Republicans don't benefit politically if the bill passes (in the sense that their party won't get credit for it). But the model remains essentially the same. Republicans just require even greater payoffs to make it worth their while. According to this model, Democrats would simply have to make Olympia Snowe or Susan Collins or Scott Brown an offer they can't refuse. These deal-sweeteners--some might call them bribes--could backfire as they did with Nelson. But they could still work. The ""battle of the sexes"" model is slightly different. The premise is that a couple wants to spend a night out. But they want to do different things. The man wants to go to a football game. The woman wants to go to the opera (or the reverse, if you prefer). But more than anything, they want to spend the evening together. It's therefore in their interest to cooperate, even though whatever they decide will be one person's second choice. It's also to each person's advantage to go first--to signal that they're determined to go to the football game, say, so the other person is forced to come along. Democrats mirror this model in that they all want health care reform--they just want different versions of it. They also can't agree on how to pass it. Does the House want to pass the Senate version? Do they want to use the reconciliation process to push through the budgetary aspects of the bill? Or do they want to start from scratch and work with Republicans? In this scenario, President Obama would theoretically signal that he wants to go one way, and Democrats, who want something, anything, passed, would be forced to follow. But he hasn't done that. Again, the model is oversimplified. The fact that the Republicans have veto power means that Democrats have to do more than just agree among themselves. And the assumption that all Democrats agree that any bill is better than no bill may be off, too. (Clearly, some would be happier with nothing at all.) But the central problem--the interests of individual Democrats trumping the collective interests--remains. This fact isn't true of the health care debate alone. Congress is designed to create collective action problems. It's a structurally ""indecisive"" body, says Alvin Roth, an economics professor at Harvard University who teaches game theory. And not just because of the filibuster. By requiring a majority (at least) in two separate chambers to pass legislation, the founders created a situation in which most members of Congress can favor a bill but it still gets blocked. ""They set us up for not passing laws,"" Roth says. That doesn't mean the Founders didn't want health care reform to pass. It just means they intended it to be a pain in the ass."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/how_a_bill_doesnt_become_a_law.html	"Calls for Senate reform peaked over the weekend after Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., put a ""blanket hold"" on more than 70 Obama nominees, not out of principled opposition, but because two projects in his home state of Alabama weren't getting enough attention. [Update, Feb. 9: Shelby lifted most of his holds late Monday.] This, for Senate-reform advocates, was the last straw. ""The genie is out of the bottle with this abuse of Senate rules,"" wrote FireDogLake's Jon Walker. ""I congratulate Shelby on fully exploring the logic of the modern United States Senate,"" remarked Matthew Yglesias. ""Why, after all, should a great nation of 300 million people have a functioning government if preventing the government from functioning can help a lone Senator advance parochial interests?"" ""America is not yet lost,"" Paul Krugman reassured. ""But the Senate is working on it."" Complaints about Senate procedure tend to focus on two tools: The filibuster, which many liberals hold responsible for the failure (so far) of health care reform, and the ""hold,"" which allows a single senator to stall a president's nominee. Both mechanisms are outdated, say critics. Filibusters used to be rare, with roughly 8 percent of major bills getting blocked in the 1960s. Now, the rate is 70 percent. And holds, while always common, are being used more frequently now than ever. What can be done? Well, quite a few things. What will be done? Probably not much. Here are a few of the possible reforms on the table--and why they won't pass anytime soon. Lower the threshold--but not yet. In 1975, the Senate lowered the number of votes needed for cloture from 67 to 60. Now, some reformers suggest they lower it even further--to 55, say, or all the way to 51. No minority is going to undermine itself by scrapping the filibuster immediately, so the change would kick in six or eight years from now, when either party could be in power. Why it won't work: Altering the filibuster requires changing the Senate rules, and changing the Senate rules requires a 67-vote supermajority. It's hard enough to get 60 votes on a contentious issue like health care reform. Getting 67 votes on scrapping the filibuster? Unlikely. ""Nobody's got 67,"" says Sarah Binder of the Brookings Institution. ""Unless there's some calamity where the two sides come together."" Lower the threshold slowly. One proposal that gets kicked around is to keep the initial threshold for cloture at 60 votes, but then lower it incrementally. After three days, it falls to 57. Three days later, to 54. Three days later, to 51--a simple majority. That way, the minority has time to express its opposition, but can't block legislation forever. Why it won't work: While the proposal sounds good in theory, it faces the same obstacle as abolishing the filibuster altogether: This, too, would require 67 votes. Use the fast track. Senate rules allow the chamber to ""fast track"" certain pieces of legislation, or pass them without extended debate. Budget reconciliation is just one example. Congress can also fast-track treaties or troop requests. The Senate could conceivably set up fast tracks for other types of legislation, too, like judicial nominees--if, say, a bipartisan commission signed off on a nominee beforehand--or for raising the debt limit. Why it won't work: Fast-tracking legislation is more plausible than scrapping the filibuster altogether, since it would take only 60 votes to accomplish instead of 67. But the political cost could still be high, as the minority party would accuse the majority of shoving the bill through using unconventional channels. (See the current bickering over reconciliation.) Limit the opportunities for filibusters.Filibuster, in the singular, is a misleading term. It should really be plural. Any piece of legislation needs to overcome several different procedural hurdles, including a motion to proceed with debate, a motion to end debate, a call for a conference, the naming of conferees, and a motion to proceed to conference. All of this takes time: The Senate must wait at least 24 hours for a cloture petition to ""ripen,"" plus another 30 hours for consideration after cloture is invoked. Congress could speed up the process by eliminating some of these votes. The filibuster would be intact, but its stalling potential would be lessened. Why it won't work: It might achieve a short-term goal of speeding the final vote. But it doesn't change the need for 60 votes to get anything done. In the end, the majority--which presumably has other items on its agenda--is more likely to blink. Roll out the cots! It's been years since we've seen a full-blown Jimmy Stewart-style filibuster. These days, the mere threat of a filibuster is tantamount to the real thing. Why don't the Democrats require the Republicans to actually stand there and talk (or not) for days on end? Why it won't work: It makes everyone look bad. The majority could accuse the minority of obstructing, sure, but the minority could just as easily accuse the majority of wasting the American people's time. The ""nuclear option."" This procedural gambit was made famous in 2005, when Republicans sought to scrap the filibuster in the face of Democratic opposition to George W. Bush's judicial nominees. The process itself is complex and opaque, but in short, the presiding officer (the vice president or the Senate president pro tempore) rules that the president's nominees require a mere majority vote, the opposition appeals, the majority votes to table the appeal, and from then on, a simple majority rules--effectively killing the filibuster. Why it won't work: Because, well, senators like the filibuster. The 2005 effort failed when the bipartisan ""Gang of 14""--seven Democrats and seven Republicans--interceded to block a majority vote from changing the senate rules. Senators may not like the filibuster when they're in the majority, but they cherish it as the minority. Make holds public. Most holds on Senate nominees are anonymous--that is, a senator can stall a nomination without having to reveal him or herself to anyone but the Senate leadership. Some suggest that requiring holds to be public would discourage them, since senators would be too embarrassed. Why it won't work: Shelby is a case in point that senators feel no shame about placing holds. If anything, they're proud of them. And even if the Senate imposed a rule that a hold would become public after, say, six days, Senators could simply remove their holds just before the deadline arrives, to be replaced by a hold from an anonymous colleague. Ignore holds altogether. There's nothing in the Senate rule book that covers holds. Rather, they've grown out of the Senate practice of ""unanimous consent,"" which allows the Senate to move forward on legislation without taking a vote on every last procedure. When a senator places a ""hold"" on a nominee, he or she is merely blocking the unanimous consent motion. The majority leader can still put the nomination to a vote and override the hold with a 60-vote supermajority. Why it won't work: Unanimous consent works because the Senate considers itself ""a collegial body"" in which members respect each other. Part of this tradition is majority leaders respecting the holds placed by individual senators. To ignore a hold would be seen as an affront at best, at worst a declaration of partisan war. Senators also like being able to place individual holds. If they revoke the opposition's ability to do so, they revoke their own. Proposals for Senate reform may pick up steam in the next few months, as Democratic frustration mounts and the 2010 elections approach. But the odds of streamlining the Senate anytime soon are low, thanks to a central paradox: Changing the rules surrounding the supermajority (60 votes) requires an even greater supermajority (67 votes). As of now, the political will simply isn't there. The inability to get anything done may eventually reach crisis level. Anger with the chamber may run so high that Senators are forced reform it or get voted out. But until then, they face a collective action problem: No one wants to give up the power to obstruct, even if it means that their own goals get obstructed. Plus, the Senate is still getting stuff done. It's mainly the big-ticket legislation like health care reform and the stimulus package that run into problems. ""Eventually, senators could realize the institution has become unworkable,"" says Gregory Wawro, a political science professor at Columbia University. ""At that point, you will get reform.""

A woman's voice speaks as words flash on-screen: ""Purity. Piety. ... Wholesome. Honorable. True Believers. Men like Tom Campbell, who would never lead us astray, his pedestal so high."" An animation shows one sheep elevated atop a tall column, high above the others. Suddenly clouds gather, lightning strikes, and the sheep falls. Ominous music as a new, evil-sounding male voice tells us about how Tom Campbell raised taxes as California's chief budget officer. ""Is that fiscally conservative, Tom?"" Intercut with quick images of pigs and sheep. Finally, cut back to sheep grazing. ""Tom Campbell: Is he what he tells us? Or is he what he's become over the years? A F-C-I-N-O? Fiscal Conservative in Name Only? A wolf in sheep's clothing?"" Cut to man in red-eyed sheep costume crawling through the meadow, scaring the other sheep away. ""Might there be a better choice?"" the voice asks. Cut to Carly Fiorina in a conference room. ""Someone who has not made a career of politics. A political outsider. Perhaps a proven fiscal conservative. ... Now that sounds like the right choice for California."" Political advertising is an inherently conservative form. And conservative politicians use it especially conservatively. Anything other than softly lit shots of a candidate and his or her family, with perhaps a cutaway or two to the flag or some hardworking Americans, is considered high-risk. Attack ads are even more likely to backfire and are thus to be used only in times of desperation. Which may explain the bewildered response to Carly Fiorina's new ad, ""FCINO."" Wonkette called the ruby-eyed sheep's first appearance ""the absolute most terrifying second of video on YouTube since the most recently uploaded clip of Roger Ailes."" Valleywag dubbed it ""inept."" One new media expert dismissed it as ""Jon Stewart material."" Meanwhile, #demonsheep is currently a trending topic on Twitter, and some quick thinker is tweeting away as @demonsheep. Both opponents of Fiorina, the former CEO of H-P who is running for the Republican nomination for Barbara Boxer's Senate seat, have piled on. The man to credit--or to blame--is Republican media consultant Fred Davis, the closest thing political advertising has to an auteur. Unlike just about any political media guru out there, Davis embraces weirdness. His oeuvre includes a giant rat storming through downtown Atlanta, a massive hairpiece atop the Illinois statehouse, and a full-length cowboy Western song about a sitting senator. You'd think most campaigns would either laugh him out of the room or run screaming. And yet, he gets hired. McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt called him ""the most creative person in the business--period."" When the Fiorina campaign brought him onboard, it knew what it was getting. ""He has a reputation for doing things outside the box, that grab attention,"" says Fiorina spokeswoman Julie Soderlund. His ads may not be instantly recognizable, but they do contain similar themes and motifs. Aerial shots of American landscape abound. Better yet, giant things casting shadows across aerial shots of American landscape. Time-lapse footage helps suggest that your candidate can navigate a chaotic world with a sense of calm and direction. If you can get your candidate to stand along a fence--George W. Bush, Sonny Perdue--by all means do. Animal metaphors? Go for it. Former Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia is depicted as ""King Roy,"" a Godzilla-sized rat storming through downtown Atlanta. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas is intercut with shots of horses running free and a Cornyn look-alike atop one. And, yes, Tom Campbell is a Satanic man-sheep furry from hell. Davis can do positive--see this family-friendly spot he produced for Elizabeth Dole in 2002--but he nails negative. He's the guy behind the ""Celeb"" ad in 2008 that turned the widespread adoration for Barack Obama on its head. His spot that shows men and women on the street sharing doubts about then-senatorial candidate Harold Ford predicted the RNC's more famous--and more ham-handed--""Playboy bunny"" attack ad. And his sendup of a carpetbagging House candidate in Georgia is one of the funniest political ads on the Web. Bad political spots simply state a candidate's positions. Good ones evoke emotions that the viewer then associates with the candidate. The best ones take full advantage of the medium. To suggest that California gubernatorial candidate Phil Angelides would take the state backward, Davis used backward video to show a diver rising up out of a lake and traffic moving in reverse. He depicted widespread corruption in Chicago by showing hoards of men and women in suits wearing Ron Blagojevich-like wigs. He wouldn't be a bad choice to direct the next Coldplay video. Then there's ""FCINO."" Where Davis's best ads are simple and clear, his ""demon sheep"" spot is confusing and sloppy. It took me two full views to figure out. Why is the voice-over praising Campbell at the beginning? Ah, sarcasm. But why is it good to be a sheep? Aren't they supposed to symbolize herd mentality or something? OK, I see, he loves taxes. Wait, now there are pigs and sheep? Also, how do you pronounce ""FCINO""? I know it's like ""RINO,"" but--OH GOD WHAT IS THAT THING? [Frantically shuts laptop.] Soderlund, the campaign spokeswoman, told me the spot took about a week to make. The shots of the sheep, including the demon sheep, were not filmed for this spot in particular, but came from footage Davis had shot for another project. (Perhaps this one?) Fiorina has been down in the polls ever since Campbell joined the Republican primary, and this Web video--Fiorina's first--was presumably an attempt to capture attention and change the narrative. Well, it certainly has. Before, Fiorina was a former CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Now she's the lady who made the ""demon sheep"" ad. Voters may learn Fiorina's name because of this ad. But will they vote for her because of it? To its credit, the campaign gets the joke. ""I think it's fine to make fun of it,"" says Soderlund. But self-awareness is easy to claim after the fact, and the campaign has proven itself to have a tin ear. Its first tagline: ""Carlyfornia dreamin!!!"" Its initial Web site was similarly bizarre. Soderlund promises more of the same. ""If you were shocked by this, you'll be really shocked moving forward."" The unfortunate part is that taking chances should be encouraged. The fact that Davis is an anomaly says more about the dearth of creativity in political media than it does about Davis. Political advertising is a form that needs more risk-takers. Grade: C+. ""Rule number one in advertising: If your message isn't seen, you are wasting your money,"" Davis told the Washington Post in January. ""Be big and bold. Be different."" Mission accomplished. But rule No. 2 is also pretty important: Get your candidate elected, not mocked. It's hard to see how this ad burnishes Fiorina's reputation--or her chances in the June primary."

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/omb_omg.html	"The primary purpose of a president's annual budget is to highlight his domestic and foreign-policy priorities. But this year's budget may have a secondary purpose: to scare Congress into doing something about the deficit. Annual budgets always contain bad news. But this year's numbers are especially bleak--if not for the cuts they announce, then for the predictions they make about what the economy will look like a few years down the road. Take the unemployment rate. The budget projects that it will go down, but not especially quickly. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that after reaching 10 percent in 2010, unemployment will decrease to 9.2 percent in 2011, 8.2 percent in 2012, 7.3 percent in 2013, and 6.5 percent in 2014. The housing market, too, will recover slowly. The most disturbing projection, though, is the deficit. If current trends continue, the annual deficit over the next 10 years won't dip below $700 billion and will surge back to more than $1 trillion in 2020, according to the administration's projections. That would add a total of $8.5 trillion to the national debt. The interest on that debt would balloon from less than $200 billion in 2010 to more than $900 billion in 2020. If you were hoping that reducing spending would help, William Galston of the Brookings Institution has bad news for you: ""These projections assume that total spending for discretionary domestic programs will decline from $553 billion next year to $529 billion a decade later--a trajectory without precedent in modern U.S. history."" Oh, also: This is all assuming health care reform does pass, reducing the deficit by an estimated $120 billion over 10 years. ""All our steps to rein in the deficit will be for naught if we do not reduce the rate of health care cost growth over time,"" Peter Orszag wrote in his accompanying essay. You know there's a problem if the government's blueprint for reducing the deficit--the budget itself--raises alarms about the impossibility of doing so. The path to fiscal sustainability involves three steps, says Orszag. First is pay-as-you-go legislation, so Congress can't dig the hole any deeper. Second is a combination of freezing spending, eliminating the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, slicing back tax breaks for oil companies, and taxing big banks, plus various spending cuts: Anyone who supports NASA moon expeditions, anthrax vaccine research, or C-17 transport aircraft is likely to be disappointed by this year's budget. Other cuts include tax breaks for coal companies, housing construction for the elderly and disabled, and grants to promote election reform. (See the whole list here.) According to Orszag, these spending cuts--along with the economic recovery--will bring deficits down from 10 percent of GDP in 2010 to 4 percent of GDP by 2015. As for the remaining spending gap, the administration assumes that the bipartisan deficit commission proposed by President Obama in his State of the Union address will take care of it. Which, judging from the last couple of weeks, is a bold assumption. Last Tuesday, the Senate rejected the formation of such a commission, with many senators who had initially supported it ultimately voting against it. (Some Republicans claimed they didn't want to raise taxes; some Democrats said they didn't want to cut Medicare.) When the president proposed creating a similar body in his annual speech, Republicans were cold to the idea. The new budget might change that. By highlighting the bleakness of the economic forecast if Congress doesn't intervene, the budget becomes a rallying point for Democrats as well as a weapon with which to bludgeon obstructionists. And by offering a raft of solutions that gets us halfway there--or even one-tenth of the way, or one-twentieth--it signals a commitment to deficit reduction without making the president too vulnerable. It may serve Republicans to not cooperate now, says Michael Ettlinger, vice president for economic policy at the Center for American Progress. But that will change. Interest rates will rise, as will the number of voters who sense that their representatives aren't addressing the deficit. Says Ettlinger: ""It's going to start being a problem."""

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/obama_20.html	"It was appropriate that the iPad was unveiled the same day President Obama gave his first State of the Union speech. Both were centered on Jobs, and both sought to give people something useful they could put their hands on. Obama answered complaints that he hasn't been focusing on the economy by calling for passage of a jobs bill and a series of other breaks for the middle class. None of the ideas was new or revolutionary (the House has already passed the jobs bill), but the speech was about emphasis. He'd planned to focus on the economy in the speech and in 2010, but he gave it a top priority he hadn't before. He called on Congress to pass the jobs bill before it did anything else. Health care reform is now clearly in second place--or lower. The speech had a feel of a relaunch. In tone and spirit, the president returned repeatedly to the themes he campaigned on--a call to end partisanship and special interest influence, and to create a government equal to the spirit of the American people. ""What the American people hope--what they deserve--is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics."" He aligned himself not only with those who were frustrated with Washington but with historic American struggles--from the Civil War to World War II. He called upon the common sense of determination and grit that has rescued Americans before. Quoting a woman who wrote him, he said: ""We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged."" Hope: There's that word again. Once he identified with voters, Obama went beyond the simple ""I get it"" message. He took their hope and made it his own. ""It's because of this spirit--this great decency and great strength--that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. Despite our hardships, our union is strong."" He is animated by the faith and hope of the voters. This is his best voice. (The hope and resilience message did get him elected, after all.) You could see it even in his delivery: He was on the balls of his feet, joking with Republicans and cracking corny jokes. He was connecting emotionally. He ended as he often did during the campaign--with tales of people struggling, using their stories to give poignancy and urgency to his call for everyone to behave like adults. It's a stirring message--and Congress could use it. On CBS just after the speech, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., immediately devolved into a bickering spat. If it had gone on one minute longer, one of them might have called the other a dummy-head. The question is whether, a year after Obama was elected on that message of hope, people still believe he can do anything about Washington gridlock and partisanship. At some point his inability to bring about results will make people less hopeful. If the president's message does remind voters of why they like him so much, it may not help his fellow Democrats in Congress. It may, in fact, hurt them. Though Obama admitted some mistakes, saying some of his political setbacks were deserved, he put himself on the side of the noble public, irritated that Congress wasn't moving. This helps him--but it validates the public's sense that Congress is the problem. And Democrats control Congress, so general upset at the institution hurts Democrats (who will also have a tough time adopting the Congress-is-bad message for their own races). The speech also had internal inconsistencies. When talking about why bipartisanship broke down so soon after 9/11, Obama said he didn't want to relitigate the past. But throughout the earlier part of the speech he did relitigate the past, explaining how Republican policies ruined the economy. (He was, however, more restrained than Reagan, who in his 1982 State of the Union address relitigated the past by blaming Jimmy Carter for America's woes.) Listeners might also find an inconsistency when the president said, ""No, I will not give up on changing the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern."" Pledges of excessive rectitude are always a little hard to take. (Obama himself made fun of John Edwards during the campaign for statements like this.) It's even harder to take when just a few weeks ago Obama was beating up on Scott Brown in Massachusetts. Though Obama said he didn't know much about his policies, he said the Republican candidate was in the pocket of the insurance companies and banks and that he was a phony trying to dupe voters. These inconsistencies were there during the campaign, of course, but people were willing to forgive or overlook them. Now that he's been president for a year, Obama can't count on voters to be so magnanimous. As expected, the president called for a spending freeze and said he would name a commission to tackle the deficit. He said he would work with Congress and the military to reverse the ban on gays serving in the armed forces. He asked Congress to reconsider health care reform, but his call for action was no more emphatic than before. The president said he wanted health care reform finished by the State of the Union, and so it may well be--just not in the sense that he hoped for. Nothing in the speech changed that dynamic. The State of the Union speech was intended, at least in part, to remind voters that the president is the same guy they elected 14 months ago. It's another similarity the speech shares with the iPad: They were seen as possibly reviving troubled enterprises (the publishing industry and the Obama brand). The president's speech was another of his good ones. But like the iPad and publishing, it's not clear how much the good packaging really will help the venture.

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/speech_therapy.html	"""Communications failure"" is the phrase being used by the White House and assorted commentators to explain the collapse of health care reform and other parts of President Obama's agenda. According to this reasoning, Obama hasn't pursued the wrong goals. He has simply failed to articulate them. And tonight's State of the Union could somehow change that. There are two problems with this theory. First, it's not as if the administration has failed to articulate its message. Second, even if it has, it's unlikely the State of the Union will make a difference. Obama himself seems to subscribe to the notion that no one is listening. ""What I haven't always been successful at doing is breaking through the noise and speaking directly to the American people in a way that during the campaign you could do,"" Obama told ABC's George Stephanopoulos after Republican Scott Brown's win in Massachusetts last week. Spokesman Robert Gibbs, meanwhile, argued on Tuesday that the administration was out-communicated by its opponents. Health care reform ""became a caricature of its component parts,"" Gibbs said. In one sense Gibbs is right: Ever since the inauguration, and especially since the health care debate began in earnest in the fall, the Obama administration has done nothing but communicate. Between the town halls, the weekly presidential addresses on YouTube, the prime-time speech on health care to a joint session of Congress, and the constant hawking of the administration's line on cable news--all of which drew charges that Obama was ""overexposed""--it's hard to say that the White House hasn't done enough talking. Yet certain memes--""death panels,"" anyone?--took hold despite the administration's efforts. So ""communications failure"" seems too pat an explanation for the collapse of the administration's plans for health care reform. It's an easy political fall-back. When something doesn't go your way, it's not because of a flaw in the policy. It's not because you failed to organize your supporters. It's because you failed to articulate your goals and why they're important. In the spectrum of political failings, it's the least blameworthy, since it leaves open the possibility that people just don't get it. There are more plausible--and just as easy!--explanations. One of the best is that the administration has simply been battered by a series of unfortunate events. If Ted Kennedy had not died when he did, there would be no talk right now of a ""communications failure."" Same if Martha Coakley had run a better campaign. Or if Senate Democrats had not spent so long trying to court Republican votes that never materialized. If these events hadn't played out the way they did, we'd be talking about Obama's patience, Rahm Emanuel's diplomacy, and the White House's shrewd communications strategy. What must be frustrating to the administration is that its talking points are hardly unique. Most independent experts, including the Congressional Budget Office, say that both the House and Senate versions of health care reform would reduce the deficit. The White House has repeated this numerous times. Yet 68 percent of Americans believe it would increase the deficit. The CBO says that reform would be fully paid for, be it through taxes on the wealthy or a tax on so-called ""Cadillac"" plans. Obama mentions this often. Yet more than 75 percent of Americans think it would lead to higher taxes for the middle class. Perhaps the most telling contradiction is that while many Americans believe that reform would improve care, costs, and access for the country as a whole, they think it would hurt them personally--a logical conundrum, if not an impossibility. The White House may be suffering from a communications failure, but it's not for lack of talking. An alternate theory, of course, is that Americans hear quite well what Obama is saying, thank you--they just don't believe him. If that's the case, then he may need more than a single speech to turn sentiment around. At any rate, Obama doesn't seem to be preparing a State of the Union speech in which he articulates the need for health care or stimulus more clearly than before. Quite the opposite: The walk-up has featured a raft of entirely different proposals: the bank tax, reforms of the financial industry, the freeze on some pieces of non-defense, non-entitlement spending. Meanwhile, Harry Reid has been furiously tamping down expectations for health care reform. In other words, the White House isn't trying to communicate better. It's changing the subject."

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/two_for_one.html	"President Obama has repeatedly called for an up-or-down vote on health care reform. But the only way House Democrats may be able to pass health care reform is by not holding an up-or-down vote. Follow me, Alice, and I'll try to explain. There are several interlocking dramas going on in the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to round up votes, settle on the final strategy (which elements will be in a bill voted on now and which might be voted on later), and figure out how to order the process so that Democrats limit their political exposure. It is this third matter that leads to the prospect of giving the president what he wants but not exactly the way he wants it. The problem is that House Democrats have to vote on two bills and they really don't like one of them. Let's call them Bill A and Bill B. Bill A, the Senate health care bill, has already passed with 60 votes. House Democrats don't like it. It has the ""cornhusker kickback,"" insufficient subsidies for middle-class families, and other flaws. So they plan to fix Bill A with Bill B, a reconciliation bill. Bill B is the one House Democrats like. The rub is that House Democrats don't want to vote on Bill A without assurances that Bill B will make it through the Senate and become law. If it doesn't, they get stuck having voted for the politically unpleasant Bill A without being able to say they tried to fix Bill A with Bill B. House and Senate Democratic leaders have been talking for weeks about how to solve this problem. The parliamentarians of both chambers--who aren't part of the negotiations but who are central to them because these parliamentarians decide which procedural matters are proper--have also been consulted. (These guys could sink the entire enterprise if they wanted to.) So Democratic leaders ask them questions about hypothetical approaches and, based on their answers, try to come up with a way forward. It gets further complicated when members of the House leadership try to make plans based on what the Senate parliamentarians will do. One method for accommodating the situation (first reported in CongressDaily) would allow the House to vote on the Bill B and, after doing so, simply consider the Senate health care bill (Bill A) as passed. There would be no actual up-or-down vote on the underlying bill. This would be the legislative equivalent of the economist's old trick of assuming a can opener. This approach would serve two purposes. First, Democrats who think the Senate bill doesn't sufficiently limit abortion rights would never have to be on record as having voted for it. (Because the Senate abortion language can't be fixed in Bill B for procedural reasons, some Democratic aides say there is talk about a later bill that would handle these issues.) Second, if the Senate didn't fulfill its end of the bargain by voting on Bill B--remember, it's already passed Bill A--then House Democrats would be able to say: I never voted for that crummy Bill A. In fact, I only voted for that nifty Bill B to fix it. The House has used a similar ""self-executing"" approach with budget votes. Under the ""Gephardt rule,"" a vote on the budget can also count as a vote to raise the debt limit. Republicans will try to say that the vote on Bill B is the equivalent of a vote on Bill A while arguing that this sleight of hand represents just another contortion in the Democrats' headlong effort to pass health care. (They'll also make a similar argument about a vote on the ""rule"" that allows all of this to take place, but if I spend too much time explaining that, you'll never come back here again.) Democrats will hope this maneuver will allow them to pass health care and move on to championing all the new benefits people can enjoy. As for the president: All this parliamentary maneuvering complicates his message. For the last few weeks, Obama and his allies have specifically called for an ""up-or-down"" vote on health care. It's an effort to blunt the Republican charge that what the White House is asking for--specifically, to use the reconciliation process in the Senate--is somehow undemocratic. By using the phrase ""up-or-down vote,"" Democrats steer the conversation back toward the more simple idea of a majority vote. As of late Wednesday, the president's team was still on-message. ""As the President has made clear, Americans deserve a final up-or-down vote on health reform,"" David Plouffe, president Obama's political strategist, e-mailed supporters. ""And the House is now expected to hold its final vote as soon as one week from today."" Well, maybe not quite an up-or-down vote as you or I would understand it.

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/slow_to_obsess.html	"One of the theories going around about Barack Obama's political problems is that he has talked too much on health care reform and not enough about the economy. It's not just pundits who say this. Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson made a similar claim, arguing that Obama should not have started on health care first but put more effort into resuscitating the economy. But for a president obsessed with health care, Obama didn't seem that obsessed at first. Tomorrow is the one-year anniversary of Barack Obama's first public event devoted to health care reform. It wasn't a memorable event. And it took him 43 days as president to get there. And after that one event, Obama didn't make health care the occasion for another in-person appearance for more than two months. (On May 12 he met with business leaders to talk about spiraling health care costs.) That means that during almost the first four months of his administration, Obama held one health care event. By contrast, the economy got all the president's attention He couldn't stop talking about it. He promoted his Recovery Act, stumped for credit card reform, and announced plans to create energy jobs. In those first four months, he held 59 economy-related gatherings, one-quarter of the total of his public events (counting meetings with foreign leaders and celebrations with sports teams and Easter egg rolls). The president's first week in office was particularly intense for its economic focus. In his first public remarks after his swearing-in, Obama said rebuilding the economy was his first task. He never mentioned health care. His next public remarks took place before a bipartisan meeting on the economy. A few days later, after meeting with the Republican caucus, the president said ""the main message I have is that the statistics every day underscore the urgency of the economic situation."" Two days later, he made a speech on the economy. Over the course of that first week, he mentioned health care only vaguely and in passing. How the president spends his public time is not the only way to determine an administration's focus. But it's a rough proxy, and it certainly influences the way people perceive the president's priorities. That's why now that Obama is in the final push for health care, we see him devoting his energy to it. He's spoken twice on the issue in less than a week. Next week he'll hit the road with at least two more health-care speeches.When did the president switch his emphasis to health care? Starting June 5, according to CBS's Mark Knoller, who keeps meticulous records of these things, Obama started his intense push. Between that date and Oct. 5, he held 32 health care speeches or events. The weight he gave the issue at the end of the year meant he spoke about it 52 times before the anniversary of his inauguration. Still, that doesn't mean he stopped talking about the economy. By the end of his first year, the president had talked about the economy twice as often. Arguing that Obama was obsessed with health care to the exclusion of the economy helps to explain the fall in his approval ratings. (If people didn't think he shared their primary concern then they were unhappy about it.) And it supports the charge that he was clueless about the biggest problem facing voters. It might seem that health care is all Obama has ever talked about, but in the months when he set the tone for his new administration the president wasn't talking about health care at all. He no doubt hopes that passage of the legislation will usher in another such blissful period. Become a fan of  John Dickerson and  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/health_care_rising.html	"If Barack Obama has his way, health care reform will be completed by Easter. That's fitting for a bill that was born on Christmas Eve, died, and that the president hopes will rise again. It's also a story that, like the resurrection of Jesus, calls on its adherents to take a leap of faith into the unseen. In Obama's case, he is selling the not-so-Biblical proposition that people will like health care reform that they don't appear to like right now. On Wednesday, the president is scheduled to make an afternoon statement about how to move forward with health care, but today he made his intention clear in a letter to Congressional leaders. He's moving ahead. He's not starting over as Republicans would like. The president did outline several Republican ideas he would like to consider. These include a search for alternatives to resolve medical malpractice disputes, plus efforts to cut down on waste and fraud in federal health programs, to set Medicaid fees so as to keep good doctors in the system, and to rejigger the insurance system in a way that might allow for health care savings accounts. Republican leaders weren't buying any of it. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called the president's offerings an effort to ""simply paper a few of these commonsense proposals over an unsalvageable bill."" With these expected dance steps out of the way, Obama's plan ends up back in the laps of Democrats in Congress. The first question that needs to be resolved is about timing and who goes first. The most likely scenario is that around mid-March, the House will vote on the Senate health care bill that passed by a supermajority in that chamber last Christmas. The president will sign that bill. Then, the House members will take up a second bill, full of fixes to the Senate bill they just passed. That bill will have to pass the Senate via reconciliation. (They'll schedule the bill for just before the Easter recess, so that Republicans will eat into their vacation time if they delay with excessive amendments. Though reconciliation limits the number of hours of debate, it does not remove all opportunities for procedural mischief-making.) The problem is that the House doesn't want to go first. Its members worry about voting for the existing Senate bill, with its flaws, from their point of view, based on promises of future fixes the Senate might make in a second, reconciliation bill. Nonetheless, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has been pressuring Speaker Pelosi to go forward. But she is looking for some kind of assurance from the Senate that it will keep its promise. There has been a rumor going around about a letter that 50 Senate Democrats would sign and that would promise to do just that. But this won't do the trick. The problem is not whether Democratic senators will act in good faith but whether they can. What if the Republicans propose so many amendments that the process gets out of hand and Senate Leader Harry Reid has to shut it down? Or, as another senior House aide put it, what if a Republican senator comes up with an amendment that acts as a poison pill? Such an amendment would have to be so universally appealing--probably related to funds for Medicare--that no senator could vote against it. And yet by passing the amendment, the Senate would put in motion a policy that would have a catastrophic affect on the whole reform package. Assuming the Democrats can solve their who-goes-first difficulty, the next question is whether they have the votes in the House of Representatives. The conversations I've had with people in the administration and on the Hill are all bullish. They talk about Pelosi's talent for hitting the right number the way people used to talk about Barack Obama's speaking prowess. At a more practical level, faith in Pelosi is based on an assumption that the number of House members who previously voted yes for health care reform last year but who will now vote no (because they think the legislation does not sufficiently limit abortion rights) will be small enough to overcome. Democratic leaders hope to find new yes votes among the retiring Democrats who previously voted no and in the crop of members who voted no last time but who would have flipped to yes if Pelosi really needed them at the last minute. Here are the main arguments the White House and Congressional leaders are making to win votes, in order from most high minded to most political: First, with this vote, you'll be insuring 30 million people and giving people health security because they'll know their coverage won't be dropped. Second, once people see the benefits--closing the donut hole and holding on to their medical care--they'll warm to the bill. Third, if you vote no, you'll dispirit our base, which wants us to do something. Fourth, you already voted for health care last year--you can't erase that political downside by voting no now. Fifth, you don't want to hand your Democratic president a defeat on his signature domestic policy proposal. Or hand a win to Republicans who have obstructed us every inch of the way. Of course, this endgame strategy all relies on the Senate using reconciliation, even though that's a word White House aides and Democrats would like never to hear again. It's a technical term, open to misinterpretation and hyperbole, and remote from the problems people face with health care every day. It's an even more potent possible distraction than last summer's debate over the public option. For all of these reasons, Republicans would like to shout the word to each voter every morning. Along with repeating words like jam and ram to characterize the measure. With the public opposed to the legislation, such framing makes the president's efforts to pass the bill not just wrong but sinister. Right now, Democrats are fighting back by explaining that reconciliation is being used in a limited way (not for the whole bill). They also point out that Republicans have used it more than Democrats, so those who now oppose its use are disingenuous. They are also trying to erase the word from the conversation. ""We're talking about a process where we use a simple majority to pass the legislation. So without any fancy names, a simple majority,"" said Nancy Pelosi. The best course may be to do what the president did at his health care summit last week: ignore the reconciliation debate and when asked about it quickly return to saying that Americans will have less health care coverage and higher premiums if no legislation is passed. ""When asked about reconciliation the response is Anthem,"" said one senior House leadership aide citing the president's favorite recent example of insurance company excess. Of course, the country hasn't bought those arguments over the last many months. White House officials and other Democratic strategists argue that popular support will follow once the legislation is passed and people see that the world didn't end. It's a lot to ask.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/all_politics_is_hypocritical.html	"All politicians are hypocrites, right? On this, a divided nation can agree. In the current version of this dispute, Democrats say Republicans are hypocrites for opposing the use of reconciliation to avoid a Senate filibuster even though Republicans used the same measure. Republicans, meanwhile, say President Obama is a hypocrite for supporting reconciliation--a simple majority vote--for health care reform when he said as a Senator that such majoritarian rule was ""not what the Founders intended."" Hypocrisy is the seesaw of American politics. One side is labeled hypocrites and the other side returns the same charge. Whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you. But not all hypocrisy is the same. It differs in degree and kind. In the interest of truth in labeling and keeping a tidy spice drawer, we should categorize the types. As a matter of politics, Democrats are hoping voters see the distinctions and agree that Republicans are the worse offenders. Their hopes of limiting 2010 election losses hinge on it. There are two kinds of hypocrisy in the news today: One concerns policy, the other procedure. Policy hypocrisy is worse both morally and politically. It affects real people--and those people tend to vote. Procedural hypocrisy is less toxic because it affects mostly the prerogatives of members of Congress. It is less politically potent because it relates to things like ""reconciliation"" and other matters that require special terminology and quotation marks so readers will know I am tossing around technical terms. That requires voters to pay an extra measure of attention before getting the hypocrisy. Democrats and the White House charge the Republicans are policy hypocrites on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Every Republican in the House and all but three in the Senate voted against it. In the year since its passage they have stayed on message, arguing the stimulus has not created jobs nor helped the economy, and has wasted money. But according to Bloomberg, 100 members of the House and Senate who voted against the measure sought funds from it--a fact that so excited White House press secretary Robert Gibbs that he used it for one of his maiden tweets. This is the classical definition of hypocrisy: saying one thing but doing another. I am against such terrible spending but please give me some of it. The stimulus will not create jobs but please give me stimulus money to create jobs. The tonnage makes the situation worse. A few hypocrites in the GOP may be explicable. But a 100 suggests a systemic problem. (A corollary related to political hypocrisy is that its potency is compounded when it becomes alliterative: the Hypocrisy Hundred.) Democrats are clinging to the policy hypocrisy charge--the DNC put out a video today--because politically it helps them use a tactic Republicans have been using successfully: making the 2010 election a referendum on political behavior. The message the White House hopes voters will take is that Republicans are fundamentally unserious. They also point to Republican outrage over the handling of the Christmas Day bomber. According to an administration source, internal Democratic Party polls have shown that when people learned that the Bush administration handled the cases in a similar fashion, their view of Republicans diminished. (Obama and his aides have discussed raising the hypocrisy issue tomorrow during the health care summit. It will be one of the things Dick Button and the judges will be looking at as they use the summit's complicated new scoring system.) But wait: Obama is a hypocrite, too. He promised to be a transparent president but negotiated the stimulus bill behind closed doors. He would have done the same with health care, too, if Scott Brown hadn't been elected senator in Massachusetts. He says he wants to extend the hand of bipartisanship--but beat up on that very same Scott Brown when he was elected. Democrats are hypocrites, too. These charges are all true. They should be pointed out and the president should have to answer for them. (And perhaps he should lose his privilege to quote the Founders in the public square). But they are of a lesser magnitude. They are related to the way in which policy is made and politics is practiced, rather than the actual policies that affect people's economic well-being. The same holds true of Republicans who supported a budget commission and then voted against it. Simply quoting the Founders in support of your position--which both sides have done on the question of the benefits or drawbacks of a simple majority vote--doesn't elevate your opponent's hypocrisy to a different category. In fact, in the case of arguing whether a majority vote should be sufficient to pass legislation, the fact that both sides have simply exchanged positions adds to the nullifying political benefit to the charge. Republicans would like to conflate the two kinds of hypocrisy. If all kinds are the same, their current infractions are less serious. They are helped in this by the fact that Obama ran for president in part by arguing that process was policy. By practicing government out in the open, he would make policy better. Some procedural hypocrisy isn't really hypocrisy at all. Republicans tried to filibuster the recent Senate jobs bill, and when they failed, some of those Republicans voted for the final jobs bill. This is familiar from any kind of negotiation. You threaten to walk, and when your bluff is called, you take the best deal you can get. If you ever have to explain this move out loud, however, it can be extremely politically damaging--as John Kerry learned in 2004. There is at least one other category of hypocrisy: sanctimonious hypocrisy. Here, too, there are gradations. Sen. John Ensign presented himself as a defender of the institution of marriage while carrying on an affair, a grade less severe than Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who prosecuted prostitution rings and was then caught soliciting a prostitute. Fortunately, at the moment this kind of hypocrisy isn't a part of the health care debate.

"" Sure, it was just a lowbrow reworking of William F. Buckley's famous phrase. But the crowd loved it, just as they had loved his mockery of President Obama's one-time cocaine use, his ridicule of feminists, his gay joke about Rep.

Still, Mattera's bombast would have melted into the bombast of the dozens of other speakers at CPAC had not the New York Times published a blog post about his talk: ""CPAC Speaker Bashes Obama, in Racial Tones."" For a young conservative firebrand, there can be no luckier break. So a few hours after his speech, Mattera was live on a HotAir.com Webcast criticizing the Times reporter. ""It's completely absurd,"" Mattera said. ""That's just par the course for the leftist New York Times."" In precise partisan formation, thousands of blog posts on the ""controversy"" were issued. All in all, not a bad day's work. In his real day job, Mattera is the spokesman for Young America's Foundation, a conservative-youth-outreach group that bought Ronald Reagan's California house and turned it into ""a living monument to President Reagan's character, leadership, and extraordinary accomplishments."" Mattera also moonlights as contributor to HotAir.com, founded by Michelle Malkin. In his videos for the site, he ambushes prominent liberal icons like John Kerry and Charlie Rangel. He gets up in their faces, calls them names, and smiles smugly when they book it in the opposite direction. He ends up looking like a low-budget version of Bill O'Reilly's young producer Jesse Waters, who's perfected the art of the ambush in prime time. But Mattera's no cheap imitation. He has a history of right-wing rabblerousing. As a college student at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, he founded a Whites Only Scholarship to protest affirmative action. He blew off an invitation to join the multicultural students union--he's Puerto Rican--because he thought it smelled of identity politics. Like many young conservatives at CPAC, Mattera takes issue with campus politics in this country. ""Students are subjected to a bombardment of liberal talking points throughout their collegiate careers,"" he said at CPAC. As he made his way out of the ballroom after his speech, Mattera bumped into some Roger Williams students. He told them he looks forward to catching up. Later, he told me how too many college students and young people are misinformed about their constitutional rights and liberties. ""I'm not calling them dumb,"" he clarified. No, he's calling them naive: ""Conservatives are always going to have an uphill battle in the sense that young people, just by the very nature of their age, are less mature and haven't experienced life as much as an older person. ... I think that's why they buy into a lot of the left's rhetoric."" Mattera says he hopes his forthcoming book,  Obama Zombies: How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed My Generation, can help change some minds.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/i_dont.html	"After months of flag-waving, sign-holding, and speechifying on the Capitol lawn, there's something revolutionary about a conservative tea party in the literal sense--a bunch of old conservatives standing around drinking tea. That was the scene Wednesday afternoon inside the Collingwood Library and Museum on Americanism in Alexandria, Va., where some of Washington's most influential conservatives gathered for the unveiling of a declaration of conservative principles dubbed the Mount Vernon Statement. After some introductory remarks and an official reading of the statement, attendees queued up to sign giant white boards featuring pasted-on faux parchment print-outs while a man dressed as George Washington looked on. (The online version currently has 7,500 signatures and counting.) The statement is, by its own admission, nothing new. It simply ""restates the ideas of the American founding as articulated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution,"" said former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, who served as master of ceremonies. The tone, however, is one of renewed urgency--especially when read in Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner Jr.'s best Founding Father baritone: ""The federal government today ignores the limits of the Constitution, which is increasingly dismissed as obsolete and irrelevant."" If those weren't fighting words already, the statement explicitly rejects President Obama's rhetoric of ""change."" ""Some insist that America must change, cast off the old and put on the new,"" it says. ""But where would this lead--forward or backward, up or down? ... The change we urgently need, a change consistent with the American ideal, is not movement away from but toward our founding principles."" Based on the audience, ""change"" wasn't much of a threat anyway. The attendees were, like their ideas, vintage. When conservative leaders gathered at the home of William F. Buckley in 1960 to sign the Sharon Statement--the predecessor to and inspiration for the Mount Vernon Statement--they called it ""the responsibility of the youth of America to affirm certain eternal truths."" ""Today, they are, let's say, mature conservatives,"" joked Meese. Indeed, of the 18 initial signatories--including Meese, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, American Spectator Publisher Alfred Regnery, and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist--the average age was probably in the low 60s. Aside from the ""change"" jab, however, the statement is remarkably uncontroversial: ""Constitutional conservatism ... applies the principle of limited government based on the rule of law to every proposal."" Liberals might not describe themselves as seeking ""limited government,"" but they're certainly not against the ""rule of law."" It ""honors the central place of individual liberty in American politics and life."" Who doesn't want individual liberty? (One could argue that universal health care expands liberty, rather than restricting it.) It asserts a ""firm defense of family, neighborhood, community, and faith."" America's anti-family, anti-neighborhood, anti-community, and anti-faith groups have yet to weigh in. If it weren't for the needling, Obama might even sign the darn thing. Which is kind of the point. The document is written overbroadly with inclusivity in mind. ""A lefty can't sign on, knowing what the words mean,"" says Norquist. ""But 70 percent of Americans go, Yeah."" Obama knows this as much as anyone. ""When he ran for office, that's what he said,"" says Norquist, pointing to the statement. ""When he governs, no. I'd've voted for him if I believed what he was saying."" The statement also implicitly rebuts the notion that the conservative movement is fracturing. Per the statement, all forms of conservatism are codependent: Constitutional conservatism ""reminds economic conservatives that morality is essential to limited government, social conservatives that unlimited government is a threat to moral self-government, and national security conservatives that energetic but responsible government is the key to America's safety and leadership role in the world."" Says Norquist: ""This points out that on the key issues, there's a lot more unity there than people on the outside might think."" What this all means policywise was left for another day. Like, say, Thursday. That's when a coalition of Tea Party activists will launch the ""Contract From America,"" a list of 22 policy ideas that will eventually be whittled down to 10. (The list includes both ""stop the tax hikes"" and ""demand a balanced budget."") Meanwhile, other conservative mission statements are also in the works. Newt Gingrich reportedly has a new contract in the works, as does House Minority Leader John Boehner. But at the rate of one influential conservative mission statement every five decades, there's no rush. ""This is something the conservative movement will be happy with 10 years from now, 50 years from now,"" Norquist says. Even if most of the original signers won't be around to enjoy it.

(Chuck Grassley, call your office.) For President Obama, the reverse is true: He lets his reason get the better of him.

He called the two bankers ""very savvy businessmen.""

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/try_me.html	"We recently noted with some chagrin that New York City was turning up its nose at $200 million in federal funds, and the opportunity to host the federal criminal trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other alleged 9/11 terrorists, because it might block traffic. So we invited Slate  readers to nominate their own hometowns as alternative sites for the trials. We are happy to report that most of you are indeed made of sterner stuff. After sorting through hundreds of thoughtful responses, we are delighted to announce that--assuming Attorney General Eric Holder agrees--the new host city for the 9/11 terror trials will be Detroit. Detroit garnered more votes than any other city, although Washington, D.C.; New York City; San Francisco; and Philadelphia were all close behind. Why Detroit? A combination of practicality, pride, and desperation best captured by reader Casey Lowe. ""First of all,"" he writes, ""large swaths of downtown Detroit are already abandoned, so there is plenty of available space. Traffic and business will be unaffected because the city has none of either."" Moreover, ""if the proceedings are attacked, there will be minimal collateral damage to the surrounding area. To the contrary, the terrorists would be performing a useful public service by demolishing deserted buildings."" As for the fairness of the trial, he notes that the metropolitan area ""boasts the largest Arab-American community in the country,"" so the jury pool would draw from people unlikely ""to reduce every Muslim we see to a jihadi stereotype."" Lowe concludes: ""We're the undisputed toughest city in the nation. Over the years, we've seen it all:  riots, murders, mass unemployment. Yawn. There's nothing the terrorists can do to us that hasn't already been done. In a country paralyzed by fear, I'm proud that Detroit is the only city with the guts to say: Bring it on, Al-Qaeda! Plus, we really need the money."" Honorable mention goes to the following proposed trial locations and the readers who submitted them: Bird-in-Hand, Pa. Alex Stamm explains that ""if Mohammed is to have a chance at receiving a fair trial, then he must be tried by jurors that aren't going to be blinded by a bloodlust to avenge the September 11 attacks. We will only find such men and women in a place so remote, so removed from civilization, that they have no knowledge of the attacks. ... Bird-in-Hand is home to just over 300 people, almost all of whom are Amish or Mennonite. Since these delightful folks shun (so to speak) television, they've never been exposed to incendiary commentary on the attacks or Mohammed. Ditto Internet."" Stamm adds: ""Think of how easy it will be to secure a town that has one road! Plus, can you imagine how many barns we could raise with $200 million?"" Salem, Mass. Peter Urkowitz calls the trial a ""win-win"" for this town north of Boston. ""We're already famous for the manifestly unjust Salem Witch Trials, so we would love the opportunity to clear our reputations by hosting a new, fair set of trials,"" he writes. ""Or if the new trials turned out to be disastrous, that would cement our reputation for unjust trials, which could only help our Witch Trial tourism industry, already our No. 1 economic driver!"" Wasilla, Alaska. Steve (he (?) didn't give a last name) suggests that if the KSM trial were to be held in Wasilla, ""The national press can cover this trial and the Bristol Palin child custody hearings at the same time."" Upson, Wisc. Writes Kevin Peltonen: ""Starting point of the illustrious Paavo Nurmi Marathon and home of Lipske's Bar/funeral parlour, Upson can provide all the seclusion and quaintness required in the trying of an infamous Middle Eastern terrorist. Upson's townhall/dance hall/event center/school/storage shed can be the site of the trial, and a jury selection from one of Upson's 30 citizens will ensure a speedy and fair trial. Those paranoid conservative commentators needn't worry about a liberal bias here."" Plus, Peltonen writes, ""if the verdict is death, I'm sure there would be plenty of people willing to volunteer their deer pole.""* Niagara Falls, N.Y. Notes Lee Neville: ""Escape by jumping over the falls and swimming to Canada is almost suicidal. Bonus: Even if KSM survived a jailbreak, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police would be waiting. Their unofficial motto: 'We always get our man.' "" Neville also points out that ""it would be counterproductive for terrorists to fly airplanes into the waterfalls because Osama bin Laden is an outspoken environmentalist"" and that local ""souvenir stands are not just shovel-ready but kitsch-ready. Sample: 'KSM got the death penalty but all I got was this mist-proof hoodie.' "" Rupert, Ga. As Dan Schooler Sr. explains: ""WE HAVE NO POLICE FORCE AND NO JAIL BUT WE CAN GET A NO-MISS FIRING SQUAD TOGETHER IN ONE HOUR AND WE WILL SHOOT AND BURY THE BASTARDS FOR FREE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DELIVER THEM. LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE."" (Capitalization in original.)"	The results of Slate's reader contest for where to hold the KSM trial.	[]	[]
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/unindicted_and_misunderstood.html	"The one promise Jack Murtha broke to me was to explain Abscam. The night the news broke that a group of congressmen had been caught boozing up, taking bribes--one tucked the money into his suit and asked, ""Does it show?""--Murtha seemed the most implausible of the bribed. ""Dennis, after this is all over, I'm going to tell you what happened,"" Murtha promised. I'd reached him at his house at about 11 at night. He was astonished at what had just happened. Two congressional pals had taken Murtha along for a visit to a group of guys who said they wanted to get their client, some sheik from the Middle East, into the United States. They told Murtha they were lawyers, seeking a special deal to make sure the sheik could stay in the United States. ""I thought, these lawyers couldn't be very good, because they didn't know how to get their client into the goddamned country,"" Murtha said. (Caveat: I'm going by memory here, but my memory is pretty clear. Murtha was not impressed by these guys.) Murtha played around with them for a while, and then they opened a briefcase--he later recalled it as a drawer. ""They pulled this drawer open, and I said 'I'm not interested. I'm interested in investment in my district.' And I've been doing that ever since I've been in Congress,"" he recollected in an interview after a subcommittee meeting last year. Matt Mazonkey, Murtha's press secretary, cringed when his boss said that into my tape recorder. Me? I laughed. This was absolutely how things were done in Washington, and would somebody kindly show me how such a thing violated any statute or law save that of good manners and polite fiction? Murphy and Thompson left with money in their pockets. Murtha, who'd been told there was ""walking-around money"" available, couldn't be bribed. The most he suffered was the temporary opprobrium of testifying against two fellow members of Congress. Instead of taking the moolah, Murtha teased his federal moles with talk of how he might be interested in doing business later on--but for now, he wanted to know what the sheik might invest in Johnstown, Pa. That was Murtha's hometown. To anyone raised there, that city is the blood of his heart. Three generations of Johnstowners have been driven out by floods. Death, recession, unemployment, and general struggle are the coda of the place. Murtha was ""not interested"" in a bribe that did not go directly to his hometown. The fictitious Abscam sheik's bribe meant nothing to Murtha unless it was an earmark for his district. That's why, try as they did for three decades, federal prosecutors never nabbed Murtha: He didn't want to be rich. He wanted to be powerful. So far, that's not illegal. Murtha's stature within Congress was predicated on his power: his ability to turn the spigot of federal dollars on or off depending upon his goals, strategy, even his mood. He served on the appropriations committee and, at life's end, chaired its outrageously well-endowed defense subcommittee. This penchant for directing federal dollars into his district, the perennially recession-wracked 12th of Pennsylvania, annoyed reformers. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington annually ranked him among the most corrupt in the House. Republicans howled at his penchant for redistributing federal monies. Advocates of abortion rights and gun control found his western Pennsylvania ethos odious. Nobody liked John Murtha but the voters. Since he first won office in a special election in 1974, Murtha always won at least 55 percent of the vote in the general election. For the most part, he could count on 60 percent. That was true even after Murtha astonished his constituents in November 2005 by announcing that the Iraq war was unwinnable and that the United States ought to get out. For a longtime defense hawk, a man whose counsel was sought by every president save the feckless George W. Bush, such a stand meant something. If Jack Murtha didn't want to fight another country, forget it. ""I feel like I've been preparing my whole life for this,"" he told me after making that announcement. He meant that he had the moral authority and personal history to speak against war because his doubts about war would mean more than Rush Limbaugh's certainties. Jack Murtha had seen combat. Most of the guys blathering about military authority had not. What explains this is a combination of things, and the first is not so much his delivery of federal pork as the fact that he was a perfect fit for the political sensibilities of western Pennsylvania. Democrats here would be perfectly happy if George Meany's bones were elected president so long as they were assured that his skeletal hands held a hunting rifle and a set of scapulars were wrapped around the bony neck. This is a socially conservative place, and those social conservatives recall their grandparents facing down armed guards in coal towns or trading blows with company goons outside of steel plants. Murtha's Democratic politics fit famously with this view. If someone were to accuse him of redistributing the wealth, he'd have smiled and said he certainly was: He was sending it back where it came from. If truth be told--and I'm not writing this from Washington, so let's do it--there were three Jack Murthas. The first was the young Pennsylvania legislator who was pushed before the electorate in a special election in February 1974, as a test case for Richard Nixon's future. A few months earlier, Nixon had fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. The vote to replace longtime Republican Rep. John Saylor, who died on an operating table around the same time Cox was fired, was posited as a test case for Nixon's popularity. This was stuff and nonsense: The people of the rural coal and steel towns of the old 12th District paid no more attention to Washington politics than they did to Argentine soccer. Nonetheless, it was fun to get the attention. Murtha won in a squeaker. Then he became Young John Murtha, the first Vietnam combat veteran to serve in Congress. That vanished in less than three years when he became the ""Congressman Who Saved Johnstown."" In July 1977, a flood clobbered the city. Murtha turned up everywhere: helicoptering in to relief centers; bringing the governor, then Cabinet members, into the city to promise relief; facing down closet racists in the suburbs when they objected to people from the city's poor areas being set up in trailers on high ground. The third John Murtha was the one who figured out that what the free market failed to do, he could do in other ways. In the 1990s, after Bethlehem Steel had fled the city, he began earmarking defense money to companies that set up shop in his district. Doing so, he employed, without apology, whatever lobbyists would do the paperwork. He put it to me this way last year, in the midst of a federal investigation in which he was the clear target: ""I have no idea why they're going after these lobbyists. Lobbyists play an important part. These forms that they have to fill out, the small companies, the small universities, the small corporations, the small hospitals, are complicated. When you come to Washington you don't just come and say 'I need something.' You don't come to a member and say 'Look, here's what I need.' You gotta fill out forms. You have to know exactly where the forms are."" In short, to his dying day, John Murtha saw lobbyists as clerks, Washington as the bank, and himself as little more than a conduit for the flow of those dollars back to his district. For all that clarity, nobody of virtue understood him. And nobody in his district could understand why anybody beyond the Alleghenies saw him as anything other than Robin Hood with a per diem. Murtha was not the last of his kind. He was just the last of his kind who knew how to be that kind."	Jack Murtha was a dying breed: an unapologetic partisan for his district.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/let_the_majority_rule.html	The unraveling of the congressional debate over health care reform is already renewing calls to abolish the Senate filibuster. As many have argued, the filibuster undermines the democratic principle of majority rule and compounds the unrepresentative character of the Senate's design. The health care debacle suggests that the filibuster may also be rendering our country ungovernable. So why not just do away with it? Because one of the most entrenched assumptions about the filibuster--that it thwarts majority rule--is only half-true. When you crunch the numbers, it turns out that the filibuster has often served to enforce majority rule in recent years, not to undermine it. Instead of abolishing the filibuster, we should try to curb its undemocratic excesses while preserving its role as a democratic check. Of course, the filibuster is by definition a tool for a Senate minority to obstruct a Senate majority. But since Rhode Island and California enjoy equal representation in the Senate, a majority of senators isn't the same as a majority of Americans. To gauge the relationship between the filibuster and national majority rule--the kind where everybody counts equally, and the representatives of the majority carry the day--it's necessary to look at the data.	Why the filibuster is OK for Democrats but not for Republicans.	[]	[]
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/dont_ask_dont_tell_dont_hold_your_breath.html	"In late 2006, John McCain told a live audience that he supported ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the policy that allows gays and lesbians to serve in the military as long as they keep their sexuality a secret. ""But the day that the leadership of the military comes to me and says, 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it, because those leaders in the military are the ones we give the responsibility to."" That day came on Tuesday, and McCain did not budge--just one reason a full repeal of the DADT policy may be further off than you think. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made history Tuesday afternoon when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that not only does the president support the repeal of the policy but that Mullen himself supports it as well. ""No matter how I look at this issue, I cannot help but be troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens,"" Mullen said. ""For me, personally, it comes down to integrity--theirs as individuals and ours as an institution."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates, testifying alongside Mullen, didn't get quite so personal, but agreed that the law should be repealed. McCain was not amused. ""I'm deeply disappointed in your statement,"" he told Mullen. Congress took up this issue in 1993, McCain said, and reached a compromise between ""the desires of a minority and the interests of a volunteer force."" (He also brandished a letter signed by more than 1,000 officers opposing repeal.) ""I'm eager to hear from our distinguished witnesses what has changed,"" he said. What's changed, Gates said, is attitudes. Most Americans support repealing the law. Members of the military have grown up around openly gay people. And there is now a president who is willing to take the leap and allow gays to serve openly--itself a testament to how politically acceptable the idea has become. Gates and Mullen's testimony is a huge step toward repeal, according to activists assembled in the hearing room. ""I was shocked--pleasantly surprised,"" said Jon Soltz of VoteVets.org, a veterans' group in favor of repeal. He rejected the suggestion by Mullen that repealing the law is going to cause some ""disruption"" among the troops. ""This is not a hard thing to do institutionally,"" he said. ""They could do this in four months if they wanted."" Instead, the military is taking its time. First, Gates is appointing a study group to figure out how best to implement the repeal if it's passed. That means examining potential changes in Pentagon policies on benefits (say, if two men are married), base housing (can they live together?), fraternization (can they, er, hang out?), and misconduct. The study will also examine questions of whether or not gays in the military hurt ""unit cohesion""--a phrase that became a rallying cry for DADT supporters when it was passed in 1993. That could take as long as a year. The military would then have another year actually to put the policy in place. And this is assuming Congress actually passes the law repealing the policy. Which may be the trickiest part. Neither chamber has taken up a bill that would lead to repeal. But there are two main options on the table. One is to attach the repeal to the annual defense appropriations bill, which comes up for a vote in the spring. That would give skittish members of Congress an excuse to support it--we were just voting to fund the military, we swear!--while putting its opponents into the awkward position of voting against money for troops. Another option is to pass a stand-alone bill. Sen. Joe Lieberman was considered an early candidate to lead that crusade in the Senate, but Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has lately taken up the torch. In the House, a bill sponsored by Rep. Patrick Murphy already has 183 cosponsors. This option might be faster, but it risks making members of Congress who vote for repeal more vulnerable. (Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin is on the record as being dubious.) That's not to mention potentially massive roadblocks if Congress doesn't like the results of Gates's study. The odds of the study concluding that gays in the military hurt unit cohesion are next to nil, because, well, no study ever has. Even the 1993 study the military commissioned from the RAND Corp. concluded that ""the presence of known homosexuals on the force is not likely to undermine military performance."" But that didn't prevent opponents of gays in the military from demagoguing the issue. If the new study reveals even a shred of doubt that gays serving openly could affect their ability to win in battle, Congress will flee. As Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., put it, the primary purpose of the military is ""not to promote civil rights or individual justice, but to prevail in combat."" This process might sound belabored. But it's probably the only way it can work. The reason: cover. Both the White House and Congress are cautious about doing anything that would be perceived as harmful to the military. Gates and Mullen, meanwhile, don't want to be seen as making policy. The study buys both sides not just time but deniability. Congress can say it's merely carrying out the wishes of the military leaders. Military leaders can say they're merely carrying out the orders of the president. Both can say they're being careful not to damage the military's effectiveness. Meanwhile, gays who want to serve will experience for themselves one of the military's unofficial mottos: Hurry up and wait."	"Why it could take years to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell."""

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/how_he_got_caught.html	"Among the revelations in Andrew Young's new book about John Edwards is that once the whole sordid truth about Edwards and Rielle Hunter emerged, Bill Clinton ""called the senator and said, in effect, 'How'd you get caught?' "" It's not a surprising question, given the source. But the better question may be how Edwards got away with it for so long. Between early 2006, when the senator's dalliance with his campaign videographer began, and August 2008, when he confessed to it, Edwards engaged in all sorts of subterfuges in an attempt to hide his liaison with Hunter from his wife, his staff, and the press. The Politician, written by Edwards' primary romantic facilitator, provides a blow-by-blow account how he did it--and why he failed. Consider this list a kind of public service to any elected official ever considering a secret romp. Get a cell phone and use it exclusively for your affair. Once the affair took off, Edwards bought a cell phone to take calls exclusively from Hunter, which he dubbed the ""Batphone."" Edwards failed, however, to keep the phone hidden from his wife. Elizabeth discovered it ringing one night in his bag, answered it, and heard Hunter launch into a ""romantic monologue."" That's when Edwards confessed to Elizabeth that he'd had a ""one-night stand."" (An understatement.) From then on, Edwards and Young arranged handoffs so Edwards wouldn't have the Batphone while Elizabeth was around. Use your calling plan's enhanced features. When Edwards didn't have the Batphone, Young set up three-way conference calls and had both Edwards and Hunter dial-in. That way there would be no record of the call when Elizabeth would check Edwards' call log, as she routinely did. Make fake hotel reservations. When Hunter traveled with Edwards, Young would reserve a room in his own name and tell the hotel staff that his ""wife"" would be checking in on that account. That way, there would be no evidence Hunter stayed in the hotel. Hunter would then join Edwards in his suite and leave before aides came to wake him up. Use separate doors. And don't forget to stagger your entrances. Heading back to the campaign office in South Carolina after a rally, Edwards had Young drop him off in the parking garage, and he took the elevator up. Hunter entered through the front, where she ran into Elizabeth. Elizabeth later ""confronted her husband about the glowing blond woman who had obviously arrived with him from the road."" Use cash. When Edwards gave Hunter his bank card, Elizabeth noticed money inexplicably withdrawn in New York. From then on, Edwards--through Young--gave her cash stipends and her own separate credit card. As one Edwards donor tells Young: ""Old Chinese proverb: Use cash, not credit cards."" Funnel money. When Edwards started paying Hunter's living expenses, the money came from the nonagenarian philanthropist Rachel Lambert ""Bunny"" Mellon, who didn't ask any questions about where the cash was going. Mellon would pay her interior decorator, who would pass the money along to Young. The cash would be concealed in boxes of chocolates. Destroy all evidence. Edwards was not as careful as he could have been. At one point, Edwards' nanny discovered a Marriott key card on the kitchen counter. Young noticed that when Edwards would receive notes from ""eager women"" on the campaign trail, he ""occasionally pocketed"" them instead of handing them off for disposal. And many nights, Edwards would take mysterious 2 a.m. ""jogs."" Seriously, destroy all evidence. Elizabeth spent days going through the footage Hunter shot for the never-aired ""Webisodes"" of the Edwards campaign, searching for evidence of cheating. However, she was never able to find the tapes shot at the Edwards house while she was away. Young and his wife later allegedly found a half-destroyed tape, allegedly shot by Hunter, of her and the senator allegedly having sex. Allegedly. (Hunter has now filed for a restraining order to keep Young from releasing it.) Don't canoodle in front of aides. While Elizabeth was on a book tour in 2006, Hunter came over to Edwards' house and the two spoke openly in front of Young about getting married in a rooftop ceremony with music played by the Dave Matthews Band. (The band didn't like her when they met her.) Hunter and Edwards would kiss in front of Young and cuddle in front of another aide, prompting him to ask Young, ""What the hell is going on?"" Choose a discreet lover. Hunter was a noticeable presence on the trail, according to Young. She dressed in bright colors, talked loudly, and flirted constantly. She spoke to ""close friends"" about their affair, but trusted them because of their ""spiritual connection."" She recounted their sexual exploits to Young and his wife. She even talked to Newsweek's Jonathan Darman about having an affair with a powerful man whom she wouldn't name. (Darman knew she worked with the Edwards campaign.) When rumors of the affair started circulating, she continued to risk getting spotted in hotel lobbies and grocery stores. ""I think she wanted to get caught,"" Young writes. Maintain plausible deniability. Even after Young learned about the affair, Edwards continued to use vague language while on the phone with Hunter--just in case he or Young, who overheard them, had to deny it. When Hunter said she loved him, Edwards ""would say only, 'Me too.' And if she asked him if he missed her, he would say, 'That's correct' ... but never, 'I miss you.' "" On calls with Young, top Edwards donor Fred Baron would refer to Edwards as ""the principal"" and to Hunter as ""her."" Don't sign any cards you send to the new mother of your child. When Hunter gave birth to their daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, Young asked Edwards if he wanted to send her flowers. ""Yeah, that's a good idea,"" Edwards said. ""But don't sign it from me. Someone might see it.Wear a condom. Edwards claims that Hunter told him she couldn't get pregnant. You know the rest."	The elaborate tricks John Edwards used to keep his affair secret.

No one held up handmade signs. No one waved copies of an alternative health care bill. And no one called the president a liar. Still, if President Obama sought to rekindle a spirit of bipartisanship with his speech, there was little evidence of it in the crowd. Reactions to the president's ideas, from the bank tax to the much-touted spending freeze to his call for Congress not to abandon health care reform, split visibly along partisan lines. While Democrats jumped to their feet after nearly every sentence, Republicans greeted many of the proposals with skepticism. The bank tax drew Democratic cheers. Republicans were unmoved. When Obama suggested that health care reform ""would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades,"" Republicans stayed quiet. During many of the bipartisan standing ovations--like those for Obama's declaration that combat troops would be out of Iraq by August or his exhortation for the Senate to pass a bill supporting community colleges--Republicans were slow to rise. Even those policies you'd think would be palatable to Republicans were met with silence. ""We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families,"" Obama bragged. ""We cut taxes for small businesses ... and we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person."" Democrats went wild. Republicans didn't move. ""I thought I'd get some applause at that one,"" Obama quipped, eyeing the GOP section to his left. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, raised his hands, palms up, as if to say, What do you want from me? There even seemed to be two standards for humor in the chamber. Democrats guffawed at the president's quip that the bank bailout was ""about as popular as a root canal."" Republicans did not. Some members of the GOP, meanwhile, cracked up when the president pointed out that his proposed spending freeze would not take effect ""until next year, when the economy is stronger."" Obama seemed to find the laughter puzzling. ""That's how budgeting works,"" he said. Republicans, careful not to say anything vocally, used facial expressions and gestures to signal their disapproval. Sen. Jon Kyl of  Arizona looked pained during Obama's drawn-out introduction. Rep. Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan seemed to vacillate between incredulousness and outrage. When Obama solicited ideas from ""anyone from either party"" for how to reform health care, Boehner pointedly raised his hand. While disapproval was par among Republican members, it also came from unexpected places. When Obama proposed legislation that would ban corporate campaign contributions--in refutation of the recent Supreme Court decision--Justice Samuel Alito shook his head and appeared to mouth the words  Not true. AP Video: Justice Alito at the State of the Union Outside the chamber after the speech, the battle continued. Democrats unanimously approved of Obama's address. Should Obama have been more specific about how to proceed with health care? ""In a speech like this, it's hard to get into much detail,"" said Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Was Obama right to suggest that bipartisanship on health care reform is still possible? ""Would you rather he didn't?"" asked Rep. John Dingell of Michigan. ""I always have reason to believe they will come around."" Sen. David Vitter, R-La., was less sanguine. While he applauds attempts to tackle spending and the deficit, he said, ""I didn't see any change"" in Obama's approach to health care. Sniping wasn't just between the two parties. Democrats from each chamber seemed to believe it was the other chamber's turn to act on health care. ""We're in a holding pattern at the moment,"" said Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. ""It's in the House's court now."" Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York had a different take: ""Did you hear the line he repeated the most? The Senate has to get to work."" (They weren't the only ones disagreeing on who's got the hot potato.) That's not to understate the moments of agreement. I counted no fewer than 17 bipartisan standing ovations. Everyone in the crowd could get behind sanctioning Iran, improving energy efficiency, and Obama's bold assertion that he would ""not accept second place for the United States of America."" President Obama, you do not lie."	Obama's call for bipartisanship fails to penetrate.	['Nelson', 'Dingell', 'Obama']	[]

Certainly it is a good idea to exclude, as he put it, ""spending related to national security."" I hope he realizes, however, that such spending is not synonymous with the Defense Department budget. Like the budgets of all bureaucracies, but much more so, the Pentagon is stuffed with entrenched interests, parochial barons, and internecine rivalries. In the budget-freeze section of his State of the Union address, Obama noted that because of the economy, many American families ""are tightening their belts and making tough decisions,"" so ""the federal government should do the same."" The administration will, he said, need to go through its budget ""line by line, page by page, eliminating programs we don't need or that don't work."" There is no good reason to exempt the Pentagon's budget from this discipline. Of course, there are plenty of good reasons to exempt parts of the defense budget from a strict spending freeze. For instance, there should be no arbitrary freeze on spending to support overseas conflicts, for instance in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the broader war on terrorism. There is no way to know now how things will be going in these fights, and how much our forces will need to carry out their missions, in 2011. Because of this, the Pentagon requests much of this money in emergency supplementals to the budget, and these requests should be evaluated on their own terms. Last year, to his credit, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates put a good chunk of this war-related spending into the baseline military budget. He noticed an unhealthy chasm between the nation's soldiers and the Pentagon's institutional bureaucracy. By putting some of the soldiers' traditionally unfunded needs into the Pentagon's budget, he hoped to give those needs some institutional grounding--and to give the bureaucrats a reason to fight for those needs. In the fiscal year 2010 budget, which was passed last year, that portion of the budget amounted to $170 billion. This included military pay. In the past 10 years, U.S. servicemen and servicewomen have received a cumulative 65 percent pay raise--and, with an all-volunteer military, in an age of multiple wars, they deserve it. So exempt this from a freeze. However, the total military budget for FY10--not including the emergency supplementals for fighting wars--amounted to $534 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates, in a recent analysis, that cost overruns and other unanticipated hikes will boost this sum to $552 billion. Deduct $170 billion--the hands-off portion--from the $552 billion amount, and that leaves $382 billion. This $382 billion has nothing directly to do with the wars we're fighting right now. That doesn't mean it's unnecessary or unjustified; maybe some of it is, maybe some of it isn't. But it's not the stuff of life and death, like the other parts of the budget--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--that Obama wants to exclude from the freeze. It should be subject to the same discipline--the same line-by-line, page-by-page analysis--as the rest of the budget. Most of this $382 billion consists of weapons systems--combatant ships, fighter jets, submarines, heavy armored vehicles--that the individual branches of the military have been cranking out for decades. If some Rip Van Winkle had fallen asleep in 1982, woken up in 2009, and looked at the U.S. military budget as an indicator of what was going on in the world, he would assume that the Cold War were still raging. Yes, the budget also includes the new, high-tech ""unmanned aerial vehicles""--the armed drones, as they're called--which are dominating so much of warfare today. These things didn't exist in the '80s. But they don't take up much of today's budget either. They're cheap. All told, according to the CBO, they and their infrastructure cost about $9 billion a year--barely 2 percent of the total Defense Department budget. Last year, Obama and Gates announced they would ""rebalance"" the military budget, cutting or killing certain weapons that were no longer needed because they had little use against the range of plausible threats that we faced now or in the future. The president and the secretary of defense also boosted the production of other weapons that were very much needed in the wars we were fighting now. This was why they stopped production of the Air Force's F-22 fighter, revamped the Army's Future Combat Systems, and cut back the Navy's DDG-1000 destroyer--and why they put more money in drones, new armored personnel carriers, and intelligence sensors. Next week, in addition to his new budget, Gates will present a new Quadrennial Defense Review--a congressionally mandated document that is supposed to lay out the priorities of U.S. defense policy and link them with defense budgets. A draft of the unclassified QDR (which is floating around and which someone sent me) states, ""Further rebalancing may be called for in [the] coming years."" It notes that the shifting shouldn't go too far; long-term needs are vital as well; the rebalance should still leave us with some kind of balance. However, the review adds, ""The Department will continue to look assiduously for savings in less pressing missions and program areas."" So there's the admission that Obama should remove the Defense Department's budget--or $382 billion of it, anyway--from the category of ""untouchable."" The fact that Gates cut or killed (and will continue to cut or kill) some major weapons programs means that someone in the Pentagon put the weapon in the budget in the first place. In other words, there is disagreement, even--especially--within the Defense Department, over whether some programs are needed. These programs reside in budgets that are, as Obama put it, ""related to national security."" But they are not all vital to national security. They should not be given a free ride when the rest of the bureaucracy has to make trade-offs."	Why Obama's spending freeze should apply to (most of) the military.	['Obama']	[]
29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/how_not_to_switch_parties.html	"Switching political parties is never easy: Former allies no longer trust you, while newfound allies may not yet. And there's a decent chance the switch will be for naught--about one-third of congressional party switchers don't get re-elected. But some switchers botch the job rather dramatically. Republicans initially celebrated the announcement in December that Rep. Parker Griffith, Democrat from Alabama, was switching parties. Democrats said good riddance, noting that Griffith had often voted against the caucus since his election in 2008. But since then, Griffith's transition hasn't been particularly smooth. Griffith appears to have broken some of the iron laws of party-switching. Make sure your new party wants you. Assorted national Republicans have welcomed Griffith to their side. And members of Alabama's Republican delegation have endorsed him. But the national party itself has yet to throw its weight behind Griffith, who now faces two primary challengers, one of whom met with the National Republican Congressional Committee early on. On the local level, skepticism abounds. Last week, the Madison County Republican Party approved a resolution opposing Griffith. The Limestone County Republican Executive Committee then voted to admonish him for supporting Democratic principles and to prevent him from spending money raised from Democrats. (Griffith says the money he received for the 2008 cycle is gone anyway.) ""He was aware there would be criticism,"" a spokeswoman for Griffith says. If not, make sure the activists support you. Tea Party activists in Alabama have been especially critical of Griffith. Sure, they say, he  voted against cap-and-trade, the stimulus package, and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. * But he also voted for spending and earmarks, for example, by declining to oppose reductions in the stimulus. Make sure the coast is clear. Party-switching often attracts opposition. (See Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania challenging Arlen Specter from the left.) But in Griffith's case, the opposition was already there. Even before he switched sides, two conservative Republicans--a county commissioner and a Tea Party activist--had announced their candidacies. Griffith may have better funding and name recognition, but his opponents seem determined to change that. Previously, they had been attacking Griffith as a tax-friendly, pork-obsessed Nancy Pelosi Democrat. Now they can add opportunist to the list. Speaking of which: Make sure your switch looks ideological, not opportunistic. It's one thing to argue that your party has drifted away from its ideals over many years, as Specter did when he joined the Democrats. It's another to claim it's done so over 12 months. Griffith was a Democrat in 2008. What changed between then and the end of 2009? (Out of control spending, he says.) It has also been revealed that Griffith commissioned a poll right before switching parties--suggesting motivations other than ideological frustration--and then tried to deny it. Griffith's spokeswoman describes the switch as ""a feeling of freedom. He no longer had to protect or defend a party that did not consider the needs or the best interest of the people in his district."" Reach out to important interest groups. Griffith's switch may have cheered national Republicans, but both the fiscally conservative Club for Growth and the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition have criticized him. Club for Growth called his voting record ""far from conservative,"" while the pro-life group's president said that ""people just don't like the guy."" Since then, he has signed onto the Club for Growth's pledge to try to repeal health care reform if it passes, and he spoke at the recent March for Life Rally in Washington, D.C. Pull down past attack ads. Everything survives on the Internet. But if you're switching parties, the least you can do is ask your new party to pull down any old spots attacking you. The National Republican Congressional Committee (which declined to comment for this piece) did just that for Griffith. But two spots survive. One portrays Griffith as soft on terrorism. Another ad accuses Griffith, a doctor, of ""warehousing"" cancer patients--keeping them sick in order to reap a profit. Perhaps Democrats can save some money and recycle those. Make sure you don't lose your committee seats. When he switched parties, Griffith predicted that Democrats wouldn't be ""small and punitive"" by taking away his committee assignments. He was wrong. Pelosi immediately stripped Griffith of his key posts on two House committees: science and technology, and transportation and infrastructure. Those seats have been essential in getting defense and aerospace contracts for Alabama's 5th District. (His district alone pulled in $6.8 billion in 2008.) Griffith's switch may not jeopardize those projects immediately, but it does mean the district won't have someone pushing for them down the road. (That is, unless he gets reassigned to the same committees. ""An announcement will be made soon,"" says a spokeswoman.) None of this is to suggest that party-switching should be simple. Even the smoothest transitions--like those of Sens. Jim Webb or Richard Shelby--leave scars. This year, the obstacles are especially daunting. Anti-incumbent sentiment means Griffith would likely have faced strong opposition whether he switched parties or not. And a growing Tea Party movement and a fracturing GOP mean that neither side is especially safe for moderates. Even if Griffith wins the primary, he could well see a Doug Hoffman-style third-party challenge. Still, there are some fundamental rules that party switchers should follow. Griffith seems to have lost the manual. Correction,  Jan. 26, 2010: This article originally misspelled Lilly Ledbetter's name. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Alabama Rep.
