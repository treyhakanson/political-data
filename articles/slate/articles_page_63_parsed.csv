Drive to the store. Park. Find a copy of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's opus, and flip to the index. You will find nine pages that cover Donald Trump generally and 10 more Trump-related topics--""Gingrich and,"" ""Huckabee and,"" ""Obama's college and passport records requested by,"" ""Rove and,"" so on and on. The Trump ""candidacy"" was a pointless and embarrassing PR stunt that revealed how shallow the news could get. Double Down starts with the stunt, with President Obama ""rummaging through the boxes"" that belonged to his late mother and coming back to Washington with a version of his long-form birth certificate. It sets a tone: This will be a chronicle of point-scoring, ego, and respectable people behaving like monstrous children, distracted--as the media is distracted--by the dumbest things. What else could it have been? Halperin and Heilemann's book about the 2008 race, Game Change, tackled the most exciting presidential election in generations: the rise and fall of John McCain; the election of the first black president; his upset of Hillary Clinton, the strongest front-runner who'd ever been felled. It was a Thanksgiving turkey dinner. Writing about 2012 is the same talented chefs trying to cook the same dinner with a couple of pigeons and a quail. It happens to the best reporters. Jules Witcover and Jack Germond penned tell-alls about every presidential race from 1980 to 1992, which meant that they had to cover the suspense-free Reagan-Mondale race. (Their title: Wake Us When It's Over.) Double Down is actually 37 pages longer than its predecessor, but this might have been inevitable--the success of Part 1 has made its authors as famous as anyone in politics, part of the election's story. Halperin and Heilemann are now fixtures on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the daily 180-minute conventional wisdom party that, we learn, informs how Michelle Obama thinks about politics. ""She watched the show religiously while working out, then fired off agitated e-mails to Jarrett about what this or that talking head had said,"" write the authors--one of whom was temporarily barred from the show (and network) for saying the president came off like ""a dick"" at a press conference on the 2011 debt limit negotiations. One of the book's best stories concerns a Sept. 30, 2011 meeting between the president and his political team, ""the Obamans."" Obama takes 30 minutes to read through ""nine or ten"" yellow legal pad pages upon which he's written a self-analysis. ""Turns out I'm really good at killing people,"" the president says, having just come from a fist-pumping interview about the drone killing of Anwar al-Awlaki. ""Didn't know that was going to be a strong suit of mine."" Fascinating on its own, but the hook comes in November, when Obama's strategists David Plouffe and Jim Messina inform him that ""two authors writing a book on the 2012 campaign knew all about the extraordinary session six weeks earlier; they had the whole roster of Obama's regrets in copious detail."" An outraged Obama lectures his team then leaves their daily meeting in a huff. Did it silence the leakers? That's a silly question--you've got the leak right in front of you, in the pages of Double Down. This is a fitfully depressing read, deep reporting about dishonest people. The best scoops aren't about 2012, but about donors, and about the players who might run in 2016. For all the media in New York and Philadelphia, for all the reporters who cover Chris Christie, only Halperin and Heilemann obtained ""Chris Christie memo 71912 FINAL,"" the vetting document that warned of the New Jersey governor's potential abuse-of-power scandals. We learn here that Jamie Dimon and Jeffrey Immelt, both public supporters of the president, urged Jon Huntsman to run in 2012. Huntsman ended up running third in New Hampshire, but not before unleashing his opposition team and wealthy father on the rest of the field. It was John Huntsman, Sr. who told Majority Leader Harry Reid that Mitt Romney hadn't paid net taxes in years. It was Huntsman's campaign that dug up Herman Cain's sexual harassment allegations, then wondered ""when the 'high heel' was going to drop"" when Politico reported out their tip. The stories keep flowing through the general election; the ""Obamans"" are less tight-lipped, and the authors better-sourced than when Game Change was reported out. One of the buzziest excerpts from the book walks through the excruciating debate prep that--eventually--helped the president discover a way to out-talk Mitt Romney. ""I am wired in a different way than this event requires,"" says the president. ""I just don't know if I can do this."" Another part of that chapter, one that's buzzed quite a bit less, reveals that Obama's strategists didn't really panic. They had a problem, yes, but they also had tracking polls showing them winning the election. (Sadly, we don't learn what the Obamans thought of the Gallup polls that showed them imploding in the stretch.) This sort of book reveals just how shallow and petty the political class is, but it's not some sort of I-Ching of election trends. For that, you'd be well served by The Gamble. Political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck wrote the book while 1) blogging the election and 2) conducting weekly, exclusive polling with YouGov. Presidential elections, they write, are ""tugs-of-war in which it is rare for one candidate to pull much harder than the other and shift the polls in his direction."" And so it was with Obama-Romney. A December 2011 poll gave the president a 5-point lead in ""candidate preference."" He won by 4 points. The Gamble's not going to sell as many copies as Double Down, which makes sense, because one book is a chronicle of heads exploding and the other takes place in a frozen world. Halperin and Heilemann have campaign staffers reacting to the most forgettable gaffes, as when Jim Messina bellows that he's ""off the Cory Booker train forever"" because he went on a Sunday show and derided the campaign attacks on Bain Capital. Sides and Vavreck prove pretty thoroughly that gaffes don't matter. The president's mangled argument that businessmen who counted on the American system ""didn't build that"" did shift persuadable voters toward Romney, incrementally, but it did not shift vote intentions. ""The impact of the 'War on Women' in the presidential election appears to have been muted at best,"" they argue--it, too, calcified what was already there in the vote intentions. It's fun to read these books in tandem; they are peaks, the rest of campaign coverage a barren valley between them. Double Down reveals how calculated and paranoid and bitter campaigns are, all in ways that they won't admit to the media covering them in real time. The Gamble reveals how few ""breaking"" developments in presidential campaigns (the rules are different for your local freeholder race, with its scant media coverage) can actually move the numbers. Pry out the secrets, read the data, and you can ignore the rest of the clattering B.S. machine that is the modern presidential election."

At a Saturday night rally in Toms River, N.J., one of the coastal towns brutalized by Hurricane Sandy, Christie begins the story with a warning--kids should cover their ears. They're covered? Okay: The story starts at a ""senior wellness day"" in West Orange, as the governor was milling around and talking to likely voters. Christie got a tap on his shoulder. ""This woman said, 'Hi, governor. My name is Gladys,' "" Christie recounts, standing on a high school football field, flanked by his family, flags, and four security officers. ""I said, 'Hi, Gladys.' She said, 'I'm from Newark, New Jersey. Lived there my whole life.' I said, 'Me too.' She said, 'I'm 82 years old. I didn't vote for you last time.' I said, 'don't worry about it Gladys, a lot of people didn't.' She said, 'I'm voting for you this time.' "" It sounds, at first, like the story of yet another African-American voter warming to the governor's charms. The polls that put Christie anywhere from 18 to 32 points ahead of his Democratic opponent, State Sen. Barbara Buono, show him pulling more than a quarter of the black vote. But Christie's crowd is chuckling. There's a punch line at the end of this. ""She said, 'Ever since Hurricane Sandy, every night I've prayed for you,' Christie continues. ""I said, 'Thank you Gladys, that is really wonderful. Kind. I appreciate it.' She said, 'A few weeks ago I saw you standing in front of that fire, that awful fire in Seaside Park. I saw you standing behind that bank of microphones, and I have to tell you, for the first time in four years, I was worried about you. You looked so tired.' I said, 'That wasn't my best day. She said, 'That night I said a special prayer for you.' I said, 'Thank you.' She said, 'You want to hear it?' I said, 'Okay.' She said, 'That night before I went to bed, I prayed Lord, please give our governor strength, because I'm not sure how much shit this boy can take.' "" The crowd, hundreds of people spread out across the football bleachers, explodes with laughter. ""True story!"" says Christie. ""People ask me, what's it like to run for governor of New Jersey? That's what it's like. You go to a senior wellness event, you go up to this 82-year-old, dignified, African-American woman, she tells you she's going to vote for you, and she doesn't hesitate for a moment to use the word Lord and the word shit within two sentences of each other. These are my people! I know this, because I was born here. I was raised here. I've spent my whole life here."" When he was running for president, Barack Obama had a story like this. He was tired, drained, done, hitting the trail in South Carolina even though he was desperately behind in the polls. An elderly African-American woman filled him back up with her chant of ""fired up, ready to go!"" The chant turned into a mantra that's still heard at Democratic events. Christie's story isn't so easily copied. It's about him--his unique appeal, the affect he has on people, the sense of humor he has about his state. At another Saturday rally, inside a VFW hall in Somers Point, Christie adds to the ""I was born here"" riff by explaining why he's so true to New Jersey. ""No one needed to teach me how to talk in New Jersey,"" he says. ""No one needed to teach me how to act in New Jersey. No one needed to teach me how to lead in New Jersey. I know you. I'm one of you. That's why I have so much fun in this job. That's why you notice how much fun I'm having in this job."" If it's a jab at Buono, it reveals just how in control of this race the governor thinks he is. Christie was born in Newark; so was she. The Democrat tells audiences about the early death of her father, her struggles as a single mother, how she survived on food stamps before going to law school and building her career. But Christie's had an easy time defining her as a throwback to Gov. Jon Corzine, the man he defeated in 2009, and as a negative campaigner with no agenda beyond what the unions command her to do. The last poll taken on the governor's race before Hurricane Sandy put Buono down by 16 points to Christie. The first poll taken after the storm put her down by 38 points. Since then, she has never trailed by less than 18 points. This deficit understates how well Christie has outplayed Buono, and the impossible time she's had looking for a consistent message against him. She's tried to convince the state's reliable Democrats to bail on Christie over his opposition to gay marriage, over his thwarting of a gun control bill, over the fact that he will probably run for president. In one of her final TV ads, Buono talks straight to camera about how she's ""the only one running for governor."" That's a strange line of attack, given how open Christie is about running for president, and how unbothered New Jerseyians are by the prospect. At campaign stops, he warns voters against getting dazzled by the polls by telling them an anecdote about a woman he met in a diner. ""I walked up to her, and she was all excited, big smile on her face,"" he says. ""She said, 'Governor, I'm so excited to meet you!' I said, 'Well, thank you.' She said, 'I can't wait to vote for you for president in 2016!' I said, 'Huh, that's really nice, but I have an election on Tuesday. I'd like you to vote for me there first.' She said, 'Ah, you got it wrapped up.' That's the thing that keeps guys like me up at night."" Democrats don't really think Buono could have won--not after Sandy--but the missed opportunities were glaring. The most devastating final poll, a Rutgers-Eagleton survey that put Christie up by 36 points, went on to ask whether voters would back Tuesday's ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage by a dollar. They would--by 38 points. Could Buono have tightened things up, even a little, by sticking to one populist issue the way other losers made it closer by focusing on car insurance (Jim McGreevey, 1997) or property taxes (Doug Forrester, 2005)? ""She keeps saying he's going to run for president,"" says voter Jim Logan at Christie's Somers Point rally. ""Who cares? Some people think that's a good idea. She shoulda fired whoever was working for her and she should have focused on property taxes."" Too late to speculate. The governor has steadily won over local Democratic power brokers, even ones who (pre-Sandy) said they'd never back him. Their big idea: Spare the Democrats in the state legislature from the fallout of a Buono rout. It's working, according to Democratic state Sen. Loretta Weinberg. ""We're up in our tracking polls,"" she tells me at a Democratic campaign office. Even that Rutgers-Eagleton poll, which Democrats don't trust (it was 10 points off in the October race for U.S. Senate) has them up by 6 points in the race for the legislature. Christie's ""cult of personality,"" as Weinberg calls it, hasn't been transferred to Republicans. He's outspent Buono; Democrat-aligned independent expenditures have buried the Republican candidates down the ballot. But can it be? On Saturday, Christie's campaign bus (emblazoned with the words ""Strong Leadership Now"") parked outside an Atlantic City bakery. The governor bounded outside, in his Rutgers jersey, suit pants, and brown loafers, to become the first candidate in generations to win the endorsement of the city's Chamber of Commerce. After a short, emotional speech about the development he'd seen in the city, Christie started denouncing the local state senator, Jim Whalen. ""You would think, from watching his commercials, that Jim Whalen and I went to the prom together. I mean, you'd think Jim Whalen's calling me every morning and asking, 'Gee, governor, what can I do for you today?' Let me tell ya, not once in four years has Jim Whalen picked up that phone and asked me that. It's been me coming to him and saying, 'Here's what we're going to do for Atlantic City.' He's just come along for the ride. He's trying to make it sound like we're partners."" ""He's a scumbag!"" yelled a supporter from the crowd. ""Well, I can't say that,"" deadpanned Christie. ""Sen. Whalen, I want to make sure you're listening. Don't mislead the people of the second legislative district that you've been a supporter of mine, when you haven't. Don't force me to come down here and tell the truth to people."" Christie's candidate, Atlantic County Sheriff Frank Balles, smiles and waves as the governor praised him. Not far away, in the highly diverse crowd, state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. grinned at the prospect of taking the majority. All voters needed to do, said Christie, was vote straight down the ballot--""you're not gonna vote for Buono anyway."" But neither in Atlantic City nor in Somers Point, both rallies attended by Balles, did Christie mention any particular policy he was stymied from doing because he didn't have a Republican Senate. In Virginia, the struggling campaign of gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli insists that it's gaining as the candidate makes the election a ""referendum on Obamacare."" Christie never mentions Obamacare, or Obama, or any national political issue more specific than Washington's status as a sick joke. Buono does talk policy, for all the good it does her. On Sunday morning, she makes the rounds at Democratic Party pre-election breakfasts in Belleville, a stronghold in Essex County, where Christie won 27 percent of the vote in his first race. In the Chandelier restaurant, she walks past tables piled high with pastries and stars-and-stripes trinkets, hugging and chatting with Italian-American women who tell her how good she looks in red. She's introduced as ""our next governor,"" and gives a short speech, to people already committed to getting out her vote, about Christie's record of ""New Jersey 42nd in job creation, $2.1 billion in tax credits to corporations, sometimes just to move them a couple blocks, high property taxes, college costs spiraling out of control."" She sings the song of every candidate written off by the national party: It will come down to turnout. ""Last election, for Cory Booker, that Senate election, did you know that three out of four people did not vote?"" asks Buono. ""It was the lowest voter turnout in our history for a general election. Cory Booker has twice as many people following him on Twitter! This governor wants to disenfranchise people. He wants you to think it's over. Why else did he veto a bill we sent him that would have allowed in-person early voting?"" That Senate race might be left out of Wednesday morning analysis. Christie, empowered to set an election to replace the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, could have bundled it with the Nov. 5 race. He opted to set the Senate race for Oct. 16, a Wednesday--""People were showing up on Tuesday thinking they could vote!"" says Buono--which unbuckled the fate of Buono or Jim Whelan from the fate of Cory Booker. That was annoying for Democrats, almost as annoying as the skin-saving Christie endorsements from members of their party. After Buono addresses a room of Nutley Democrats, state Sen. Ron Rice grips the microphone and paces, laying into the Essex County Executive who endorsed Christie this summer. ""A lot of these Democrats say even though we endorsed Gov. Christie he's been a catastrophe for New Jersey, that the bonding rating has stopped, that he's not for working people, that he's not for the minimum wage. All the things Democrats are supposed to be for, he's not about it. People don't want to call people out. Well, I'm calling Joe DiVicenzo out for what he is and what he represents! I'm calling out black clergy and politicians who are selling our party out."" Ralph Caputo, an assemblyman from the district, nods along with Rice. Sure, he says, it would be ideal if Democrats bucked the tide and held the legislature. ""But when Tom Kean won,"" he says, referring to the old Republican governor's 40-point landslide in 1985, ""we got wiped out. We held two seats in Essex County."" Until the polls close, even though Democrats hold that legislative race lead, Christie is telling crowds that they really should consider voting for more Republicans, if only to send a message. ""If you reward bad behavior, just like what happens with kids, you'll get more bad behavior,"" he says in Somers Point. ""If you reward good behavior, you'll get more good behavior. You know, Tuesday night, America's watching. America's watching and they want a new signal of hope for the country's future, after all the dysfunction in Washington, D.C. They're gonna look to New Jersey for that hope, and we're gonna provide it to them on Tuesday."" I look around the room and see more than one grown man daubing away tears at what Christie's just said about their state. Voter Jim Logan pulls me aside. ""Only Ronald Reagan could have given a speech like that,"" he says. ""That last sentence? Yeah, he's running."""

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/obamacare_worries_grow_will_private_insurance_end_before_the_government.html	"Obamacare is nerve-wracking for the very people it was intended to help. During the healthcare.gov saga, I've been in regular touch with Alice, a Pennsylvania woman trying to sign up for health insurance through the federal exchanges. She is a member of that 5 percent of the population who buys insurance in the individual market. When the Affordable Care Act took effect on Oct. 1, she was anxious to register for new health care coverage, because it is almost certain to be a better deal than her current plan. Instead, like millions of Americans, she has been confused and thwarted over the last month as the government's website failed her. Her stress and confusion level recently quadrupled when her old insurance company, Independence Blue Cross, sent her a letter reminding her that Obamacare meant her old policy was expiring and that ""to ensure continuous coverage, you'll need to select a new plan by December 15, 2013."" If everything had gone as promised, by now she would have had a chance to sign up for insurance through the window-shopping wonders of healthcare.gov. Or, at least, she'd have some idea what her options were. How big would her subsidy be? What would her co-pays and deductibles be? But she has no idea, and the Obamacare snafus don't give her any confidence that she'll have a clearer answer by Dec. 15. Her biggest worry is going without coverage. So while Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius says people have months to sign up for health care, that's not true for Alice--she has seven weeks. No matter that Sebelius and her IT team assures everyone that the website will be fixed by Dec. 1. Alice has a reasonable belief that she's going to get the wrong end of things. While healthcare.gov goes through its convalescence, Alice has tried to sort out things on her own. She is buffeted between government incompetence and insurance company greed. She can't get answers from healthcare.gov, and she's not sure she trusts the answers she hears from the insurance companies because she knows that they don't have her interests at heart. When they calculate her subsidy, is it the actual figure? Is it in their interest to steer her toward the best deal or the best deal for them? ""I have to make this decision by Dec. 15, but I don't know if there will be real information by then,"" she says. President Obama suggested that frustrated customers call the 800 number, so Alice did. The woman from healthcare.gov said she could mail her some information, which would arrive in three weeks. ""Can't you email it to me?"" Alice asked. We're not set up for that, the Obamacare operator replied. Once the application arrives, Alice is to fill out the forms, mail them back, and hope for speedy processing. It had better be fast because at that point there will only be about a month before her coverage lapses. While Alice waits for the mail to arrive, she has tried healthcare.gov several more times to get any kind of additional information. According to the site, she has only two carriers to choose from in Pennsylvania and she can only learn the name of the plans and the estimated premium and nothing more--not the co-pays, deductibles, or anything else. She's on the comparison-shopping site but can't actually compare plans. ""Not only are they quoting you a bogus number, but you can't see what that bogus number represents,"" she says. ""You are in total bullshit land."" Her insurer gives her a number for her new monthly premium, but it's several hundred dollars a month higher than the estimate she got on healthcare.gov. Had Obamacare not existed, Alice would have renewed her expensive but passable plan and lived under the fear that her rates would increase. Now she has spent a month not sure what she's going to have and experiencing the dread that she's going to get squashed in the pincer movement of the government and the private health insurance market. Whether you're in the private market or the employer system, the health care insurance dance is an unpleasant one. You study the forms, listen to the webinars, and try to read the fine print, but in the end you can never shake the feeling that you're losing out in some way you'll never understand until it's too late. In the end, Obamacare may be wonderful for Alice, but so far its rollout has only made her sick."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/keith_alexander_testifies_before_congress_nsa_chief_explains_why_america.html	"Not long from now, Keith Alexander will wrap up his career running the National Security Agency. He will be remembered as the man holding the bag when Edward Snowden decided to leak thousands of documents about the NSA's practices. There's nothing Alexander can do about that. What he can do, and what he did at Tuesday's hearing of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, is defend America's snoops as honest patriots being pilloried by those who don't know better. Alexander began his testimony by tossing aside his prepared remarks, high drama usually reserved for best-man speeches or student-council debates. ""I'm gonna talk, from the heart, so that you know what we're talking about here, from an NSA perspective, is what the nation needs to know and hear,"" he said. ""How did we end up here? 9/11. Two-thousand nine-hundred and ninety-six people were killed on 9/11. We all distinctly remember that. What I remember most is those firemen running up the stairs to save people, and then lose their lives."" This set the tone for the intelligence community's pushback against attacks on every front--House, Senate, White House, media, public. Alexander had been talking like this for a while. Last week, he gave an interview to an official Department of Defense news site, pleading for ""a way of stopping"" journalists from obtaining Snowden's documents, and suggesting the 9/11 commission wanted ""tools that help us connect the dots"" like the bulk data collection programs now being leaked and condemned. That wasn't actually the 9/11 Commission's advice, but it sounded suitably terrifying. The NSA's challenge, which looked impossible on Tuesday, is to convince policymakers to remain as spooked now as they were 12 years ago. The timing is awkward. Tuesday also marked the release of the USA Freedom Act, a joint product of Patriot Act critic Sen. Pat Leahy and Patriot Act co-author Rep. James Sensenbrenner. If passed, it would prohibit bulk collection of data under Section 215 of the 2001 law and require FISA court decisions to be disclosed if they ""significantly"" reinterpret the current code. And while Alexander and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were talking to the House committee, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was marking up its own unreleased NSA reform--this after Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the committee, had condemned reported monitoring of the phones of foreign leaders. All of this was happening on a week that had been expected to bring Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to Washington for a state visit. She canceled, citing the snooping revelations that fueled a feud between Brazilian regulators and American tech firms. The Patriot Act's longtime critics are less keen on whatever Feinstein does than on Sensenbrenner-Leahy--""the amendment that I've been unsuccessful with for the last few years,"" as Sen. Dick Durbin called it Tuesday. The House Intelligence committee isn't exactly a den of Patriot critics, though, and on Tuesday its interrogators fit into three categories. Some wanted only to thank the intelligence community and send it back to work. Some wanted largely cosmetic change. Some wanted actual change--and this was the group easiest to hush up. The chairman and ranking member, Rep. Mike Rogers and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, fit snugly into the first two roles. They started by agreeing with Clapper and Alexander that the reports of bulk U.S. spying on the population of Spain, a revelation spooled out by journalist Glenn Greenwald this weekend, was phony, a result of bad reporting. ""The person looking at it didn't know what he was looking at,"" said Alexander. That was good enough for Rogers, who stopped short of Feinstein and didn't chide the intelligence leaders for failing to share information. ""We could go through mounds of product that would allow a member to be as informed as a member could be,"" he said. ""I shudder to think what connections could be missed if the program were eliminated,"" offered Ruppersberger. Rep. Adam Schiff, a supporter of this year's failed amendment to defund the NSA, found that specious. ""I wonder if we're seeing what you sometimes see in litigation, where you're given a warehouse full of documents ..."" Rogers cut him off, explaining that, yes, a member of the committee really could dig deeper if he so wished. He or she had access to more secrets than the rest of Congress. ""This feeds into this flame of bad reporting about lack of oversight,"" he said. Also feeding that flame: The uncurious questioning of most of the committee's Republicans. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, a Georgian who became briefly famous when Stephen Colbert stumped him with questions about the Ten Commandments, urged Alexander and Clapper to discuss how Americans were already giving up their data. ""A lot of private companies have a lot more information on private citizens than the NSA does,"" he said, ""and use that information in ways we might not want that information to be shared."" Rep. Michele Bachmann, who's retiring at the end of next year, used her time to ask Alexander short, leading questions about the nefariousness of Edward Snowden. ""Were Mr. Snowden's actions unconstitutional?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" said Alexander. ""Did Mr. Snowden's illegal, unconstitutional actions enable the terrorists who want to kill Americans?"" asked Bachmann. ""They have and they will,"" said Alexander. Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo chastised his peers--not named, but implied--for reacting to each revelation by asking for new oversight. Why, he asked, did the NSA require some ombudsman or public advocate (the latter is one of Schiff's ideas), when Congress could simply work harder to provide some secret oversight. ""When everybody was slamming something, saying I didn't know about this, you stood forward and said, I did,"" said Alexander. ""That's huge. That's what the nation expects."" ""You're most welcome,"" said Pompeo. That exchange suggested that the intelligence community's long-running outreach strategy to Congress was, occasionally, working as designed. The White House's denial that the president ever approved the latest revealed snooping has emboldened Congress to criticize the president. The NSA's insistence that it wants to be transparent, only when talking to the right people, is also a sop to Congress. If the momentum for reform can be redirected just a little, Congress can quibble with itself about whether it's already doing enough to watch the spies who want to prevent another 9/11. ""What has the intelligence committee been doing the last four years?"" asked Sen. John McCain on Tuesday. ""Aren't they supposed to be oversighting these programs? We need a select committee, because the standing committees haven't done their job."""

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/healthcare_gov_witch_hunt_why_we_need_to_know_who_is_responsible_for_the.html	"Washington think tanks, your moment has arrived! Healthcare.gov is a mess and someone must chronicle exactly what went wrong. The press is trying, of course, but we also must cover the aftermath--the parade of predictable behavior that obscures more than it illuminates. Did you see the hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday? Despite the best efforts of Chairman Fred Upton, between the grandstanding, confused questions, and the witness fog machine, it's a wonder anyone got out alive. Meanwhile, Republicans are pointing fingers, placing blame, and otherwise showing disgust that a program that they have tried to kill is being run so badly. (Perhaps they're jealous that the administration is better at undermining Obamacare than they are.) Administration officials, on the other hand, are caught between covering their backsides, spouting plumes of happy talk, and hiring more people to collect the springs and sprockets from the launch pad where the whole thing went kaput. On Friday, officials in charge of the #techsurge said that healthcare.gov would be running smoothly by late November, two months after the launch. Here's why a controlled witch hunt is needed: This episode is about much more than a website. That's true with respect to health care, as Ezra Klein points out, and it's also true because there are big national issues at stake that have nothing to do with the specific issues of sickness and health. Can government do big things? Sen. Lamar Alexander famously said during the health care debates, ""We don't do comprehensive well""--meaning that any law that is big and complicated will fail. Is that right? Alternatively, have partisanship and gridlock created a situation where small flaws in a law can't be fixed through tweaking legislation because such legislation can never pass? Is there something about complex technology that confuses the bureaucracy? Is the procurement system nuts? Does the political nature of all administration activity mean that no one is capable of reporting that the launch of a key element of the president's signature legislation is going to throw a rod? Some of the states seem to be doing just fine. Is that because they are smaller enterprises or because the people working on state health exchanges have more flexibility? These are sloppy questions; experts can come up with better ones. But whatever questions are asked should be broad and sloppy, because right now everyone is scheduled to leave this drama with the answer they want. The experience will confirm their pre-existing views. That's no good as a matter of logic, but it's also a waste of rich material. This crack-up is a genuine disaster--it is expensive, it is worrying people who need and want insurance, and it is a huge waste of time. But it also provides rich material for a case study about the effectiveness of government. Precision in this hunt is the key. Usually in investigations you need subpoena power. That doesn't seem to be an issue. (Though I'd still put a hand on the shredders at Health and Human Services and the White House just to see if they're warm.) In this case, what's needed is some expertise, patience, and methodical reasoning. These attributes have long since been banned from congressional hearings. There are nevertheless people in Washington think tanks who will be excited to think through these matters. A precise example of the kind of thinking that's required is in David Auerbach's wonderful deconstruction of yesterday's hearing. Talking about the watery responses from the witnesses, Auerbach writes, ""They don't seem to understand the difference between acceptable and unacceptable bugs, and worse, they don't seem to know that there is a difference."" The point is that there's a distinction between garden-variety problems and catastrophic problems that you could either have seen coming or for which you should have been on guard because they're so damaging. So, using that same fine screen: What problems here are the normal ones you'd have in any big enterprise, what are the problems that are the result of unique one-time-only stupidity, and what are the problems that result from this being a government rather than private enterprise? This project should be one everyone loves. Only the most devout libertarian doesn't want the government to do anything. Those who want a smaller government should still want it to operate efficiently. Liberals, and people like the president, who believe in smart government, should be pushing hard for answers. If they're not interested in a thorough deconstruction of what went wrong for policy reasons, they should care for political ones. Healthcare.gov is now a very good excuse for anyone who wants to oppose an activist federal government. All a lawmaker has to say is that they don't want the same government that ran healthcare.gov in charge of X, where X is anything you want to see stopped in its tracks. Right now, no one in this drama is trying to learn from the mistake. That's understandable, but it also guarantees that the mistake will be repeated."

Ted Cruz may be the conservative movement's first populist egghead--a grassroots leader who is attacked for being too smart to have common sense. In political theater, you're usually allowed to wear only one of these costumes. The populist claims to possess the horse sense of the electorate and has no need for fancy schools, with their eating clubs, trays of sherry, and debating societies. That was Sarah Palin's posture. It was also true of the men to whom Cruz has recently been unfavorably compared--Huey Long, Joe McCarthy, and George Wallace--and those conservative luminaries he aspires to join--Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. Cruz came to Washington as an anti-establishment bolt from the blue, having defeated the GOP's preferred nominee in his first Senate race. In the recent Obamacare fight, he sharpened his populist credentials against the elites. After his bid to defund the Affordable Care Act failed, Cruz took to the microphones and aligned himself with the ""millions of Americans"" harmed by the president's pet project--people who he claimed the GOP establishment had forsaken. The establishment usually scorns the populist as a dummy, full of overheated rhetoric for the masses but not much more. When the smarty-pants set attacked Cruz for his Obamacare grandstanding, it looked like a familiar script. The elites thought it was dumb, but ""real Americans,"" thought Cruz was a hero, said former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Mike Gallagher, the conservative talk radio host, said in an interview with Cruz, ""You're not getting the credit you deserve from the intelligentsia, but you sure are from the American people."" But Cruz wasn't being mocked for low wattage the way Palin and Reagan had been. Cruz was being singled out for a lack of common sense born of his rarefied resume. He graduated cum laude from Princeton and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. He clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, practiced law, and worked in government, avoiding the practical world of business. Even his wife--a Goldman Sachs investment banker and vegetarian--seems at odds with Cruz's image as the tribune of the silent majority. When Republican Sen. Bob Corker sought to discredit Cruz's strategy to defund Obamacare by pushing a budget showdown, he tweaked him about his education. ""I didn't go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count--the defunding box canyon is a tactic that will fail and weaken our position,"" said Corker. After the gambit failed, Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid sounded the same theme: ""[Sen. Cruz] might be able to work a calculus problem better than I can. But he can't legislate better than I can."" The junior Texas senator's strategy, wrote conservative columnist John Podhoretz, gave ""flesh to George Orwell's warning that some ideas are so stupid, only an intellectual could believe in them."" It is usually the self-styled populist who levels the egghead charge. George Wallace complained about ""pointy-head college professors, who can't even park a bicycle straight."" Historian Richard Hofstadter traced the tradition of anti-intellectualism through the American experience, but in the modern age the attack was first effectively used by Dwight Eisenhower and his running mate Richard Nixon in the 1952 presidential race against Adlai Stevenson. Ike accused the former Illinois governor of using ""aristocratic explanations in Harvard words,"" which he associated with Stevenson's ""faintness at heart."" (After his defeat, Stevenson famously joked: ""Eggheads of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your yolks."") When Nixon became president, one of his special tirades was directed at Ivy League presidents who had not seen things his way on Vietnam: ""The Ivy League presidents? Why I'll never let those sons of bitches in the White House again. Never, never, never. They're finished. The Ivy League schools are finished."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who may face Cruz in a Republican primary, took up the anti-intellectual cudgel easily in a speech to Republican Party officials in August. ""We are not a debating society,"" said Christie. ""We are a political operation that needs to win. We have some folks that believe that our job is to be college professors. You know, college professors basically spout out ideas that nobody ever does anything about."" (Nobody does anything about them except the law students who use the training to become governor and senator). Though there have been few conservative politicians who lived at the nexus of elitism and populism, there have been several conservative luminaries who have championed the cause of the grassroots while having rarefied intellectual backgrounds. Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, who went to Harvard for undergraduate and graduate school, was a robust supporter of Sarah Palin. As Vice President Dan Quayle's chief of staff, Kristol championed the views of a man who conservatives thought spoke plain truths but who elites mocked as dim-witted. The most famous public conservative in this category was National Review editor William F. Buckley. Yale-educated and with an accent so erect it suggested high tea could break out at any moment, Buckley nevertheless fit within the post-New Deal conservative populist movement that gave rise to Ronald Reagan. ""I would rather be ruled by the first 2,000 people in the Boston phone book than 2,000 members of the Harvard faculty,"" he famously said. But the friction between erudition and populism is always ready to flare up. Kevin Phillips, author and former Nixon aide, called Buckley ""Squire Willie,"" and in his book The Emerging Republican Majority, heralded a ""New Right"" that connected with real people. ""Nor can we expect Alabama truck drivers or Ohio steelworkers to sign on with a politics captivated by Ivy League five-syllable word polishers,"" wrote Phillips, who attended Harvard. ""Any politics or coalition has to surge up from Middle America ... not dribble down from Bill Buckley's wine rack and favorite philosophers shelf."" For now, Cruz appeals to both the truck drivers and the Federalist Society. He heads to Iowa on Friday, where he will no doubt be greeted with a roar by activists who will travel hours just to see the populist egghead, a rare bird in the Republican menagerie."

""It was one of the best parties I've been to, hands down,"" one teen told the Baltimore Sun, though he admits he doesn't ""remember much."" This spectacular beer bash--so intense as to be called the ""eviction party"" by those present--would have gone tragically unreported if not for the momentary presence of Maryland Attorney General Douglas Gansler, whose photo was taken as he navigated through the crowd of shirtless, sweaty high schoolers. Now Gansler, who is running for governor, is taking predictable heat for his appearance at the party, which the National Journal suggests will hurt his chances in the election. It's an easy narrative to understand: sweaty teens drinking beer! Gansler the party crasher! A hypocritical politician--the leading lawman in his state--who won't even step in to stop an illegal gathering of sinful teens! But that's a shame. If his explanation is accurate, the plain fact is that Gansler and the other parents who helped organize their kids' trip to the Eastern Shore were being entirely sensible.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/barack_obama_spins_healthcare_gov_problems_the_president_s_message_may_make.html	"An IT problem has never escalated faster than the president's Rose Garden speech Monday addressing the problems with healthcare.gov. He could no longer outsource responding to user complaints. At first, the White House had said the headaches signing people up for health care coverage were just technical glitches, but now the sheer number of those glitches defies that explanation. Reporting about deeper systemic problems suggest that fixes will not come quickly. As my colleague Matthew Yglesias explains, adding more bodies to the problem adds more complexity, which may exacerbate the problem. It's hard to untangle Christmas lights by committee. Barack Obama doesn't like to play the action-hero president where the application of his overwhelming will is supposed to directly correlate with a snappy solution. There are too many constraints on the presidency--Congress, a fickle public, world leaders, a $17 trillion economy, and the vagaries of time and space. But with the botched Obamacare rollout, the president was applying all the rhetorical torque he could muster. ""Nobody's madder than me about the fact that the website isn't working as well as it should,"" Obama said on Monday, ""which means it's going to get fixed."" Rhetoric and will isn't going to solve this problem. That helped the president triumph over the government shutdown and debt limit crisis, when through determination and superior political positioning he out maneuvered his Republican opponents. Now he has a different kind of challenge--an operational challenge--where his talent for politics and persuasion are less useful and may even make matters worse. Putting a good spin on things only sets expectations that can then be dashed by reality. It's a challenge of the president's own making. Unlike his battle with Republicans over the serial budget crises or the economic mess or smoldering wars he inherited from the Bush administration, the president is not reacting to uncontrollable events. He can't blame BP or Halliburton. The Affordable Care Act is his baby. Republicans made the rollout harder, but more than any other domestic challenge, his administration should have been able to anticipate the problems they're now scrambling to fix. In the Rose Garden on Monday morning, the president had a tough balancing act. On the one hand, he wanted to show that he was personally peeved, but he also had to simultaneously argue that the problems that made him so angry weren't threatening the underlying health of the product. That's a proposition that has yet to be tested. There are substantive ways in which the rollout can damage the fundamental enterprise. If the problems are as systemic as some reporting suggests, then they will not be fixed easily or anytime soon. The premise of the website was that its rollout would initiate a wave of social media success stories that would reach those younger applicants who are so vital to Obamacare's success. Younger, healthy people must sign up to keep the insurance pools from being dominated by older sicker Americans, an outcome that would make prices soar. But those great sign up stories are not filtering through social media to this hard-to-reach group. Instead, they're hearing that the program is a mess. If enough young people don't sign up, then the death-spiral scenario kicks in. The president's speech was just the latest attempt to put the problems with healthcare.gov into perspective--a job that is not going well. Before the site was launched, the president said it would make signing up for health care as easy as making a plane reservation. When, after a few rocky days that turned out to be too rosy, the administration dropped the airline analogy. Now the experience more closely approximates the saga of having your flight delayed. First, the airline tells you it will be a half hour, then it stretches it to an hour, then two, then you're offered a voucher for a drink. After four hours, it dawns on you that the plane is never taking off. They continue to assure you it will--just before they cancel your flight. The stories keep shifting. Administration officials said the site had been tested as thoroughly as the IRS computer systems that handle electronic tax returns. Now Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admits the system wasn't tested enough. In the first several days, administration officials spoke of ""glitches,"" and Secretary Sebelius asked that people give the government the same amount of slack Apple gets when it launches a new product. But the administration dropped that analogy because, unlike Apple's quick admission that Apple Maps was a mess, the government can't just let users install Google Maps (and there have been no quick firings for the mess, as there were at Apple). The president and his team then said the website snafus were the result of huge traffic, but that explanation doesn't explain the considerable technical problems now being reported. Reports of the extraordinary number of people who have accessed the site are themselves full of fuzzy claims that seek to oversell the success. There's a dangerous spiral that can take hold in these situations, as spin intended to distract from the current mess becomes its own problem. That is especially true when the facts demonstrate that the story the administration was selling is too optimistic: Either the White House knew how bad things were and wasn't playing it straight or it didn't know how bad things were and is just inept. Which one the public chooses--or whether they forgive the launch pad mishaps when everything is repaired--depends on the administration's operational, rather than its political, skill. The customer support ticket has reached the highest level; now the country must wait."	Why the President's Spin on Healthcare.gov May Only Make Things Worse	['Obama']	['healthcare']

The smears rained down on them on every day of the shutdown. Unlike in 2011, when a Democrats' off-the-record comparison of their tactics to the dynamite-vest-brigade sparked a day of outrage, the conservatives couldn't get anybody else to care. Too many people, not just Democrats, were reaching for Roget's Book of Violent Analogies. ""I don't know of anybody in the business community who takes the side of the Taliban minority,"" said Dirk Van Dongen, chief lobbyist for the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, to the Washington Post. ""So many in the House are hard-right reactionary Tea Party,"" said Al Hoffman, a reliable GOP donor, in an interview with Politico. ""Those Republicans, it appears, are ready to self-immolate."" Both Politico and the Post have discovered a business community that wants to tame the Tea Party. USA Today reports that the business community is going to rescue Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, a reliable Boehner ally whose mostly rural district is being targeted by the Club for Growth. The 1 percent is back, baby, and this time it's on the right side. The counterrevolution is overrated. There are only three or four ""Tea Party conservatives"" on the target list so far. Michigan Rep. Kerry Bentivolio and Tennessee Rep. Scott DesJarlais, repeatedly cited as the first backlash targets, had already guaranteed primary challenges by, respectively, winning an election after the incumbent had failed to make the ballot and covering up his mistress's abortion. Anyway, they're outnumbered on the other side: Republican senators or Senate candidates in Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, South Carolina, and South Dakota are all fending off Tea Partiers. Just this week, Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran, who got to Washington in 1979 and has often been on the ""aye"" side of a deal, drew a challenger from his state's senate. Months ago, Karl Rove's founding of the Conservative Victory Project was teased on A1 of the New York Times as a force that could prevent ""future Todd Akins."" It's raised no money apart from a transfer from another Rove-linked PAC. Could the ratio change if ""the establishment"" wanted it to? Of course--but that's assuming that big financial interests are naturally set against the Tea Party. They are not. They helped create the Tea Party. In the aggregate, if you leave aside the contractors who might benefit from earmarks (RIP), they're better off when Tea Partiers run the House. The Tea Party, after all, is not wholly set against the GOP's business class. It's just the latest populist movement funded and fueled by the Big Business. The ""anti-tax clubs"" of the 1920s, which moved the Republican Congress to drop income tax rates, were literally organized by the allies of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon. The (mostly incompetent) opponents of the New Deal, like the Liberty League and the National Organization of Manufacturers, coalesced when conservative donors realized they, the captains of industry, weren't compelling advocates. ""The capitalist system can be destroyed more effectively by having men of means defend it then by importing a million Reds from Moscow to attack it,"" said one Texas businessman who backed the Liberty League, according to Invisible Hands author Kim Phillips-Fein. None of this means that the Tea Party is ""astro-turf."" Every successful political movement needs wealthy backers. And when you put aside the shutdown, the Tea Party members who now run the House are producing much more for the financial industry, for small business organizations, than Democrats would if they took back the House. No one's looking to primary the average Class of 2010 Republican because he's trying to repeal Dodd-Frank or challenge EPA rules or prevent any changes in tax law that would anger the donors. That's clear even from the donors-hate-the-Tea Party genre of interviews. One of Politico's donor-rebels is Paul Singer, who has no stated problem with the policies endorsed by Heritage Action or the Club for Growth or Ted Cruz or the Tea Party. He's angry at ""the GOP at large losing race after race."" Five years ago, the Tea Party was a fresh, unexpected brand switch for a Republican Party that blamed its 2006 and 2008 election losses on George W. Bush. Polling since 2011 has revealed a steady decline for the Tea Party. Some of that has to do with a liberal pushback that linked the Tea Party to the largest donors to Americans for Prosperity or FreedomWorks, et al. The Democrats of the 1930s called the Liberty Leaguers the ""cellophane league,"" because they were ""a DuPont product and you could see right through them."" Swap in ""Koch"" for ""DuPont"" and you've got the attack that, eventually--in the media, at least--fouled up the Tea Party brand. But what's the donors' plan, anyway? What's the business-friendly label that's going to be more potent than the Tea Party? Every successful movement of economic conservatives has been led in public by the non-rich, from the anti-tax farms of the 1920s to the property-tax-hating suburbanites in the 1970s to the ""family farmers"" who are, we're told, the real victims of the estate tax. How do you make Rove-ism or Goldman Sachs-ism as popular as the Tea Party is, even now? ""The media used to love to say that politicians were worthless because they were controlled by Wall Street,"" said Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador at a Heritage Foundation-sponsored forum this week. ""They were controlled by business. They were controlled by special interests. The only group that has stood up to Wall Street, to the special interests, to the big businesses, has been the Tea Party. For the last two weeks, I've read about that in your papers, but it has been in a derisive manner. We are uncontrollable--because Wall Street can't control us. We are uncontrollable because business can't control us. Instead of praising that, that which the American people have been waiting for for the last 200 years, politicians listening to the people instead of the ruling class, you guys have been writing about that in a derisive manner. I think that's really sad."""	Why Big Business Won't Abandon the Tea Party	['Paul', 'Cruz', 'Labrador']	['abortion']
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/cory_booker_elected_new_jersey_s_next_senator_lessons_from_the_hyped_politician.html	"The legend of Cory Booker began when he got his ass kicked. Eleven years ago, when he was a 33-year-old social justice attorney turned city councilman, Booker ran for mayor of Newark, N.J. He was a media sensation--a Rhodes scholar who hunger-striked to protest drug dealers and tractor-beamed money out of donors across the river in New York. A documentary about the campaign, eventually titled Street Fight, captured real-time video of Mayor Sharpe James alleging that Booker was a carpetbagger, a Republican, ""not black enough"" to run the city, and ""collaborating with the Jews."" Street Fight was nominated for an Oscar, and Booker never lost another race. Wednesday night, he beat Republican candidate Steve Lonegan to become only the ninth African-American in the U.S. Senate. Along the way, he faced the first challenge to his ""narrative"" in more than a decade, as reporters challenged his stories of ghetto heroism and hyped polls that showed his 25-point lead shrinking to the high teens. ""The bloom is off the rose,"" said one Democratic state senator in the Philadelphia Inquirer's version of the ""Booker in disarray"" story. ""No one could be as good as Cory was perceived to be."" Marshall Curry, the director of Street Fight, wasn't surprised by this. ""He's never been a bloodthirsty politician,"" said Curry of Booker. ""He's never been somebody who loves getting in a fight. When you're up against someone who does spoil for a fight, like Sharpe James, like Steve Lonegan, they can do some damage to you."" Not enough damage, obviously--Booker is now a Meet the Press-friendly senator-in-waiting, unencumbered by the politics of Newark. He has survived the saga of ""T-Bone,"" the drug dealer who may or may not have been a composite character, and of the sexless direct message he sent to a Twitter follower who happened to be a stripper. What did we learn in this special election? Pay attention to the boring polls, not just the game-changers. New Jersey's special election started, unofficially, with the June 3 death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg. One week later, a Quinnipiac poll gave Booker a 27-point lead in a theoretical race against Lonegan, the long-term New Jersey leader of David Koch's Americans for Prosperity. After Booker won the Democratic primary, two other polls had him up by 35 and 28 points. Then, in late September, disaster--Quinnipiac and Monmouth polls showed Booker up by only 12 and 13 points. Thus began the ""Booker in disarray"" storyline. ""Booker is underperforming Republican Gov. Chris Christie in a blue state,"" noted Maggie Haberman in Politico. ""Booker's missteps have prompted concern among allies who thought the race was a sure thing,"" wrote Holly Bailey in Yahoo News. ""If Lonegan loses by fewer than 10 points,"" wrote Pennsylvania columnist J.D. Mullane, ""it will be spun as a big win, given that Booker should have trounced him by two or three times the margin."" Anyone who watched any TV news coverage of the final days learned that the race was closing fast. It wasn't. Booker's average lead over Lonegan remained largely stable for the last three weeks of the race. He took body hits from stories about his investment in the poorly conceived tech company Waywire and about a late-summer surge of murders in Newark, while he was off raising funds. But there's no evidence that anything like the Twitter-stripper story hurt Booker (only 1 in 5 voters called it ""a legitimate issue""), and his favorable numbers remained stable in the high 50s, as much as 20 points higher than Lonegan's. ""New Jersey Senate elections tend to be in a zone where the Democrat gets between 53 and 59 percent,"" said Rep. Rob Andrews, who ran unsuccessfully in a 2008 primary for this seat. ""I think it's kind of an unfair criticism that he's underperforming if he's in that range."" That's spin, but it's not wrong--the last race for Senate in New Jersey where a candidate cracked 60 percent was 1984, when Bill Bradley ran for re-election. The last race for an open seat, in 2000, ended with a slim 3-point win for the now-despised Jon Corzine. You can swing too hard at a glass jaw. Booker deserved to sweat this race out--he hadn't been seriously challenged, or investigated, since becoming a star. He was so overrated that in 2005, before he'd even won his comeback race for mayor, he was on the short list for a U.S. Senate appointment. When Booker pre-emptively declared against Lautenberg, the senator suggested he needed a ""spanking,"" and his family has worked hard to present Booker as a show horse. The GOP's vessel to take advantage of this was one of the most entertaining jerks in American politics. Steve Lonegan had run for governor in 2005 and 2009, losing primaries while deriding his opponents as toothless moderates. He endorsed Gov. Chris Christie in 2013 because he fretted he'd ""be a total asshole"" if he didn't return the favor of Christie's endorsement. He was much tougher on liberals. Anytown U.S.A., a 2005 documentary about Lonegan's final run for mayor of Bogota, N.J., began with a town hall meeting where innocent-looking parents asked Lonegan to keep the high school open, no matter the cost. Lonegan responded by sarcastically applauding. When an unemployed blind man entered the race, Lonegan, who's also legally blind, chastised him for not finding a job. (Yes, both candidates for this seat were the stars of documentaries released in 2005.) Lonegan took this approach to the Senate race, deriding Booker for presiding over a ""black hole"" of a city where ""the only birds are vultures,"" reminding voters that his opponent had tweeted at a ""pole dancer."" He made no attempt whatsoever to moderate his positions. After Booker finally started attacking him as a ""right-wing extremist""--the GOP candidate had sarcastically called himself that on camera--Lonegan closed out the race with a Tea Party Express rally starring Sarah Palin and radio host/author/coiner of Hillary Clinton insults Mark Levin and with a press conference featuring three Newark residents who claimed, contra the evidence of witnesses and rent checks, that Booker did not live in the city. Did Booker err in not attacking Lonegan earlier? ""Cory truly thought if he went door-to-door in Newark, he could win people over by talking with them about issues and showing them his soul,"" suggested Curry. ""He doesn't want to be a negative campaigner. So he might have missed opportunities that his opponent gave him to define himself as a radical Tea Party person. He personally doesn't like negative campaigning, and he doesn't think it's good for his brand."" National reporters thought the same of Barack Obama. In 2012, when he opened his campaign with a barrage of anti-Romney ads in swing states, the president had to endure many think pieces about how he'd damaged his brand. But he really didn't. A Romney strategist suggested to me that Obama was protected by the media's inherent theory that for the first black president to lose would have said something awful about America. Booker might have tested a version of this theory, too. Lonegan, who landed some blows, was too unappealing to take real advantage of Booker's softness. ""If the Booker campaign had chosen to spend a huge amount of money in two of the most expensive media markets in the country to drive Lonegan down from 42 to 37 percent, he could have,"" said Andrews. ""But why? Unless you're betting the spread in Vegas, what's the point? I doubt he'll have a serious challenger next year."" Chris Christie remains invincible. Why is there a Senate election happening on a Wednesday in mid-October? Because Christie scheduled it then, costing the state an estimated $12 million by separating this race from the statewide gubernatorial and legislative elections in three weeks. He has experienced no blowback whatsoever for this maneuver or from his endorsement of Lonegan, holding to a lead in the high 20s over the Democrats' sacrificial candidate Barbara Buono. He's simultaneously watched Lonegan prove that his brand of politics can't even win statewide in a low-turnout special election and watched Booker take his first-ever dings in the national press. In the winter of 2012-2013, some Democrats were bitter at Booker for denying them a real race against Christie. Now they're glad he didn't. ""I think that the press likes to have a new story,"" said Curry. ""If the first story was Cory the underdog, well, that lasted a while. Next, the press needed to focus on whatever they could dig up. Nobody wants to keep telling the same story over and over."""	Meet Cory Booker, America's Most-Hyped Senator	['Clinton', 'Levin', 'Romney', 'Christie', 'Booker', 'Obama']	[]
10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/barack_obama_defeats_the_republican_party_the_president_s_aggressive_strategy.html	"Listen to John Dickerson and David Plotz dissect Day 16 of the government shutdown: President Obama said he wouldn't negotiate with Republicans over raising the debt limit and funding the government, and he never really needed to pick up the phone. The deal that passed both houses of Congress Wednesday achieves both goals, with minuscule concessions from the president's side. In the crude analogy of two cars playing chicken, the president's opponents pulled over. After 16 days of a government shutdown, the Republican Party has achieved its lowest approval ratings in recorded history, the president's health care plan is unscathed, and the GOP's civil war still roars. Proof was on the cable television split-screens. As Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was announcing the bipartisan deal that ended the standoff, Sen. Ted Cruz was holding his own press conference denouncing the Senate establishment that had caved. It was possible to see the seeds of this outcome just before Obama's second term started. The president, no longer facing re-election, had written off negotiating with GOP leaders. He and his aides resolved that future budget negotiations would be founded on a hard line. If he was going to burnish his legacy, it was most likely to happen through confrontation, not conciliation. Following that vector, the president has prevailed in this round and defended his signature legislative achievement. Obama won office preaching a message of a new kind of bipartisanship, but his domestic legacy will be defined by his partisan victories: passage of the 2009 stimulus bill, the Affordable Care Act, and victory in the shutdown fight of 2013. Two things could have upended Obama's second-term macho posture. He could have lost his nerve, as Democrats claimed he did during the debt limit negotiations of 2011. In this fall's dispute, he could have acceded to some Republican demands in order to lift the debt ceiling or fund the government because presidents are the ones who are blamed for a bad economy in the end. Presidents also always face a lot of public pressure to negotiate, even if the public doesn't blame him for starting the crisis. As Dan Balz reports in his book Collision 2012, Obama's campaign team learned in focus groups and polling that while voters might blame the GOP for the economic mess, they still wanted Obama to step in with a solution. It was this pressure that caused the president to move a few degrees off of his no-negotiations position--just enough to open the tiny crack that led to negotiations in Congress. The other challenge to Obama's aggressive posture was the behavior of his Republican rivals. The president's no-negotiation position on raising the debt-limit was deeply unpopular. According to the CBS/New York Times poll taken a few weeks ago, less than 20 percent of the country supported the president's view. Had Republicans fought on that ground, Obama would have had a tougher time. Instead, Republicans bailed him out by choosing to fight on turf that was equally unpopular. Polls before the shutdown showed large majorities of the country opposed to tying the funding of government to the defunding of Obamacare. After the shutdown, the polls got even worse for Republicans. In the most recent Wall Street Journal poll, public support for Obamacare actually improved. Of all the budget showdowns--the debt limit fight of 2011, the near shutdown of 2011, and fiscal cliff of early 2013--this one is likely to be remembered above all. But will the president's negotiating posture serve him well going forward? That's harder to predict. The president and his fellow Democrats benefited in this round largely because they were united. Republicans were not, and they will not be going into the next round of negotiations either. However, those future talks--which revolve around issues of entitlements and taxes--offer at least a policy opportunity for Republicans to move in lockstep. The argument involves core Republicans tenets and everyone knows what they want. Despite the current infighting within their ranks, there is a strong desire for unity among Republicans. The question will be what posture the president takes when the next round of negotiations breaks down in December, as it inevitably will. If Obama opts for a hard-line stance again, will it be as successful the second time? His average approval rating is only 43 percent, and 51 percent of the country disapproves of his performance. Won't the public be less likely to support the president if the Republicans are unified and offering a more popular position over tax-and-spend issues? Of course, it is not a given that Republicans will be unified. Sen. Cruz and his supporters in the House are not leaving this fight feeling vanquished. Cruz was pointing fingers the minute the deal was announced. ""Unfortunately the Senate chose not to follow the House, and in particular we saw real divisions among Senate Republicans that was unfortunate. I would point out that had Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans the outcome of this I believe would have been very, very different"" In defeat, Cruz sounds insane to his detractors--and his claim that the country was rallying to his position are refuted by all reputable metrics. But Cruz can still take comfort from the president's victory. Like Cruz, Obama stood firm to a principle in defending his health care plan despite public disapproval. Of course, Cruz's gambit was far more unpopular--among both his colleagues and the general public--but that is unlikely to sway the junior Texas senator because triumphant leadership can often appear to be on the verge of certain doom moments before it succeeds. The best proof of this also comes from Obama's leadership playbook: See Syria gambit. Before Cruz defined what it meant to blunder ahead without a plan, President Obama's was refining that approach with his Syria policy. In that case, the president's highly unpopular threat of military strikes, headed for a big defeat in Congress, was averted at the 11th hour by a surprise Russian intervention that led the Syrians to promise disarmament. The president didn't see that coming, but he kept pressing nonetheless. Following that lucky logic, it's possible to envision a scenario where Cruz's long-shot effort to delay Obamacare could have been given a boost when the rollout of healthcare.gov was so bad it seemed to ratify every Republican doubt over Obamacare not being ready for prime time. It didn't matter that Cruz's campaign was so clearly doomed you could tell from outer space. For men of ambition and deeply held views, there is little to distinguish between success and total failure when you are in the thick of the fight, guided only by the righteousness of your cause. ""You know, I don't think anytime you are in the middle of a fight your approval rating is going to be that high,"" said Rep. Raul Labrador, a leader of the Tea Party fight in the House. ""So for anybody to make a decision based on what your approval rating is at your lowest point, means that your decision--you don't really understand the political dynamics in the United States."" Cruz and his allies are likely to be just as animated for the next engagement and the president, fresh off of this success, will have little reason to change course. The next round isn't going to be pretty either. Read more of Slate's coverage of the debt ceiling fight."	Forget Hope And Change. Obama's Partisan Victories Will Define His Legacy.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/harry_reid_and_government_shutdown_negotiations_democrats_want_a_deal_that.html	"Majority Leader Harry Reid moved the goal posts. On Saturday, when Republican Senate negotiators came to work, they thought they were close to a deal with Democrats based on the proposal offered by Republican Sen. Susan Collins. The government would be reopened for six months in exchange for a delay of the medical device tax that helps fund Obamacare, flexibility in managing sequestration cuts, and new requirements to verify income for those entering the federal exchanges as a part of the Affordable Care Act. But the Senate Democratic leader didn't like the six-month date, so he called it off. Why did Reid back out? The agreement would have made it harder for Democrats to negotiate changes to the next round of sequestration cuts, something they have sought as part of a larger budget deal. If Reid was moving the goal posts, it's because he--or some of the Democrats negotiating with Collins--temporarily forgot where he'd put them. It has always been a Democratic goal to wipe out the new round of sequestration cuts that kick in next January. It was something they were hoping to negotiate once the government shutdown ended and all the lights were turned back on. It was on the Democratic wish-list, just as entitlement and tax reform are on the GOP list. What elevated the issue into the center of the debate this weekend was the six-month timeline in Collins' proposal. Under that agreement, which Collins worked on with Democratic senators, the government would be kept open until March. That seems reasonable, given how long it will take negotiators to wrangle with each other in the post-shutdown negotiations. But that also means that new sequestration cuts scheduled to start in January would kick in while the negotiations were ongoing. Democrats worry that if they allow them to take effect they won't be able to negotiate for their removal. Democrats say they aren't dictating how the future sequestration cuts will be replaced, just that they want to have a chance to negotiate how to replace them. ""Republicans want to do it with entitlement cuts,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer on Face the Nation. ""Democrats want to do it with a mix of mandatory cuts, some entitlements and revenues. And so how do you overcome that dilemma? We're not going to overcome it in the next day or two. But if we were to open up the government for a period of time that concluded before the sequester took place, which is Jan. 15, we could have a whole bunch of discussions."" This disagreement about dates is what caused the six Democrats working with Collins to say that they did not support her final offer. Some Republicans have claimed that the Democrats are trying to change the Budget Control Act, which is the law of the land. They are, but not as a condition of ending the partial shutdown or lifting the debt ceiling. That's an important distinction because actually asking to change the budget law now would be identical to the GOP requesting to lock in specific entitlement changes as a condition of lifting the debt ceiling or funding the government. The administration and Democrats have said that linking those issues to the current crisis is out of bounds. As a negotiating posture however, Democrats have no problem letting Republicans charge that Reid spent the weekend attempting to undo the Budget Control Act. When the final agreement includes no such thing, Republicans will be able to claim that they thwarted Reid's plan. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says Reid should just take yes for an answer, but Reid thinks he has enough leverage to hold steady and not deal away future discussions on the sequestration cuts. Democrats say, ""Why should we diminish our right to negotiate in the future over something they don't like, just because Ted Cruz and some House Republicans created a crisis?"" This is the White House's position, too. When asked if they were overplaying their hand, an administration official pointed to this weekend's rallies with Cruz and Sarah Palin. The demonstrations on the mall were keeping the Tea Party brand in the news, which Democrats believe hamper those lawmakers who are trying to ameliorate the Tea Party inspired budget detour over Obamacare. So now Reid and McConnell will have a debate about dates. It's not an impossible divide. Reid would like the government to stay open for a shorter period of time and the debt ceiling lifted for a longer period. McConnell would like something closer to the opposite. Those are not differences big enough to cause a breach of the debt limit and suggest that, despite the weekend hiccup, the Senate will get its act together. After this brief Senate interlude, we'll be focused on the House again. House Speaker John Boehner will have to decide what bill he brings to the floor and how many Democrats he'll need to pass it. Will he be able to get a majority of Republicans, as he did during the debt limit votes of 2011 and early 2013? The clock is ticking."

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/vincent_gray_s_fight_against_the_federal_government_the_d_c_s_mayor_government.html	"It was a pure accident, but Senate Democrats did Vincent Gray a solid. On Wednesday, Majority Leader Harry Reid's colleagues joined him on the Capitol steps for a press conference about the government shutdown. Gray, the mayor of the District of Columbia since 2011, walked right behind the senators. When they moved locations, Gray followed them. As Republican staffers giddily tweeted the botched photo op, Reid told the mayor to lay off. ""I'm on your side,"" he said. ""Don't screw it up. OK?"" The showdown brought some national media attention to Washington, D.C.'s plight, as a federal city with rights inevitably stifled or traded away in budget deals. But any reporter or pundit knowledgeable in shutdown-fu knew what Reid meant. He had to put the screws to D.C., and he had to shut down Republicans' ""piecemeal"" continuing resolutions that exempted the city from the shutdown. To do less would relieve the pressure on the opposition and slow down a deal. Drenched in conventional wisdom, I raced to Twitter and called Gray a ""moron."" He disagreed. I apologized. This ended with Gray inviting me to talk it all over. And so, on Friday afternoon, I was ushered inside a boardroom on the sixth floor of the Wilson Building. Gray was working from a long conference table covered in papers, decorated with a couple of half-empty water bottles from meetings. The city hasn't closed down any visible public services since the start of the shutdown. Gray never intended to shutter the city's operations. The shutdown plan that the city had been required to submit at the start of the year informed the feds that all of the city's 32,000 employees were ""essential,"" and nothing would close if the Congress, predictably, screwed up. ""Working with Congress from this seat is a real formula for cynicism,"" said Gray, sitting behind the paper mound. ""It's incredible to me that people either can't see or don't want to see the distinction between the District of Columbia and these federal agencies being closed. The money we're talking about is money generated by people who live in the District of Columbia. We send probably $3.5 billion to the federal government every year. We generate $6 billion in other taxes. It's hard to know at times whether folks don't fully get the distinction or whether they simply don't want to understand the distinction because it doesn't help their political purposes."" The $3.5 billion number was pretty well known--any visitor to the council building sees it blinking on an LED marked ""D.C. Residents Federal Tax Dollars Paid."" (Actually, as of today, the number's closer to $3.8 billion.) Anyone registering a car in D.C. can opt for a license plate labeled ""Taxation Without Representation."" The political impotence of this city, written into the Constitution, is a cause for every mayor or councilman who wants to win re-election. It only changes after a major Democratic Party win or a political crisis. Gray doesn't want this crisis to go to waste. ""If [the shutdown] is solved in a way that includes a recognition that we are separate and distinct from the federal government for these purposes, I think we'll have passed the ball down the field,"" said Gray. ""If it's simply resolved in the same way it is for the rest of the federal government, I don't think we will have made much progress at all, and the fight is going to have to continue. The fight will continue anyway, because nobody's going to give us full budget autonomy as a result of this effort. But the closer we get to a recognition that we are different, then I think we can feel that there's actually been some progress emanating from this. Otherwise, it will just be, we got dragged along in the course of this, and when the story is written it will be that the government is open again, and you might get a paragraph or two somewhere that the district government was included in the funding."" Before that happens, Gray and the council are alternating between doom and brio. Since the shutdown began, the city's tapped a reserve fund of $140 million to keep paying employees. There have been no mounds of uncollected trash or stranded buses, no B-roll of a city in turmoil. (There have been cutoffs for people on Medicaid, but that's hardly B-roll material.) Come Oct. 15, the city needs to make payroll. If the shutdown continues, there's a $1.5 billion reserve fund that, as far as the feds know, the city cannot tap. But nobody's ever tried it. ""We're trying to determine what authority would be required to use those funds for contingency purposes,"" said Gray. ""What happens if we get to the point where we've exhausted everything? There are potentially fines, potentially jail time, but then you're rolling the dice. Will you really be prosecuted?"" This isn't what concerns Democrats. They didn't just vote down the ""piecemeal"" CR to fund D.C.--they voted down all of the piecemeal CRs. They view the Republicans' plans more cynically than Gray does. At the start of 2013, the House Oversight Committee collapsed the subcommittee that used to manage D.C., and Chairman Darrell Issa took ownership of the task. Issa's talked about giving D.C. more autonomy. Gray believes him. ""He represents a district in California,"" Gray explained. ""Somebody tell me what he gets out of this, in tangible terms? Probably, this city does suffer from being too 'Democratic.' Republicans assume they're not going to get much out of it because there's so little Republican representation here. And then the Democrats just take it for granted because they figure no matter what they do, people will vote Democratic in this city."" This is Gray's problem with the theory that hurting D.C. will, somehow, make Republicans panic and cut a deal. ""How does allowing garbage pickup in a city that's 80 percent Democrat hurt the Republicans?"" Maybe it doesn't. In 2011, though, when the Congress narrowly averted a shutdown, it was partially at the expense of D.C. Republicans, who then had wanted to pack the CR with policy riders. One of the Democratic compromises put the riders in effect for D.C., and just D.C. ""I'll give you D.C. abortion,"" President Obama told House Speaker John Boehner. There is no evidence that this lost Obama any votes in the city. ""But I actually don't think they will do that again,"" said Gray. When that deal was made, he got himself arrested in a mass protest in front of the Senate offices. ""The way we reacted to it, that actually got international press. And it didn't make anybody, especially the president, look very good. So I don't think that there will be a statement made like that. A statement either verbally or in how they resolve this. Also, when you look at our budget now, most of those riders have disappeared. The abortion rights issue has been a rider consistently, but the guns stuff, the needle exchange, all those things have disappeared, and that's progress."" That's how the mayor of the Capitol City ekes out gains: by getting arrested, arguing with people, and hoping the media pays attention. ""I've talked to Harry Reid after that press conference,"" said Gray. ""I've talked to Valerie Jarrett. The day before last, I had a discussion with the White House, for 45 minutes. We went back and forth, back and forth, until the person I was talking to said: You have a point of view and I'm not going to change it.""

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/slate_surveymonkey_government_shutdown_poll_how_badly_do_americans_blame.html	"While House Speaker John Boehner and his fellow Republicans are working with the White House to hash out a short-term debt limit increase, the federal government remains largely shuttered. In such political standoffs, the central question always becomes, ""Who do voters blame?"" Like many other polls, the Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll found that most respondents place the blame for the government shutdown squarely on the Republican Party. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.)  Of those surveyed, 50 percent blamed Republicans, 37 percent hold both parties responsible, and 11 percent point solely at Democrats. But just because people think Republicans are doing a bad job doesn't mean they want to give a Democratic president authority to raise the debt ceiling. Even though we've been told that breaching the debt limit could lead to a global financial meltdown, most people think Congress should still be responsible for authorizing the country's debt ceiling. While many people argue that the president already has the ability to authorize the debt under the 14th Amendment (as discussed on Slate's Political Gabfest), the White House isn't likely to test out that theory.  Apart from the politicking, the government shutdown has had tangible effects on those who depend on federal services ranging from HeadStart and housing vouchers, to national parks and museums. Sixty percent of respondents said they had been affected at least somewhat by the government shutdown, and a majority of respondents said they care ""a lot"" about it. Only 4 percent said they didn't care about the shutdown at all.  Boehner has the less than enviable job of taming his more recalcitrant members into passing a ""clean"" continuing resolution--a bill that would reopen the government with no strings attached. As David Weigel reported Wednesday, not doing so could backfire on Republicans who are running in next year's elections. Democrats need to flip 17 seats to retake control of the House, and so far, the National Republican Congressional Committee is having a hard time making charges of hypocrisy stick to Democrats running for re-election in 2014. So far, no matter how the GOP tries to spin the issue--it's about Obamacare! It's about the debt! It's about entitlements!--they still come up looking like the bad guys."

It's hard to say anymore. Take House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan op-ed's in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. Ryan's article never mentioned Obamacare in his effort to press the president to negotiate. His argument's presentation seemed to codify the recent strategic shift of the GOP from a fight it was losing on Obamacare to one over government spending, where it has better odds to get some kind of a result. This looked like a capitulation. Sen. Ted Cruz's senior aide was quick to point out the omission. Not long after, Ryan was on the radio saying that he didn't mean to suggest he'd given up on the Obamacare fight. When he referred to entitlements in his Journal op-ed, of course he meant Obamacare, too. In little more than a week, the president's health care plan has gone from the single reason for the budget showdown to an implied one. Confusion was also on the menu across town where Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham spoke to reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast. He said that Obamacare should not be tied to the debt limit fight. Rather, this leader of a powerful Tea Party interest group said the president's health care law should be limited to the fight over a continuing resolution to end the government shutdown. What made this position confusing is that Heritage Action has been a key force in focusing the GOP budget strategy on the dismantlement of Obamacare. Their success has come from a clear message to grassroots activists: If your representative is serious about defunding Obamacare, he or she will go all the way. ""Our core message about defunding Obamacare was if your elected official has told you he will do everything he can to stop Obamacare--and if he is pointing to the 40 votes that he took, none of which were attached to must-pass legislation--it is a valid question to ask why?"" said Needham. If you're going to go all the way, why stop short of using the thing that gives you the most leverage? Nothing gives Republicans more sway with the president than the threat of breaching the debt limit. Polls indicate only about 20 percent of the public supports Obama's demand that a debt limit be increased with no strings attached. Furthermore, the president's repeated attempts to show that he was willing to negotiate in his Tuesday press conference were proof that his position of refusing to negotiate is weak. Republican Sen. Tom Coburn has recognized the debt limit as the ultimate leverage to force government to make hard choices. Why would those trying to beat back Obamacare stop short of using the stick that packs the biggest wallop? One reason supporters of defunding Obamacare want it removed from the debt limit vote is that they don't trust the GOP's leadership. Erick Erickson argued in RedState that the focus on the debt limit would lead to a ""grand bargain,"" where taxes and entitlement provisions would be the big issues. With so much on the table, Obamacare would only be nibbled at, if touched at all. Another reason to keep the Obamacare fight delinked from the debt limit fight is that it's not strong enough to take into that bigger battle. If economic chaos results from crossing the Oct. 17 debt limit deadline, the 72 percent of Americans who thought it was a bad idea to tie defunding Obamacare to our budget battles will grow higher. According to the Gallup poll, the GOP's favorable rating is now 28 percent, down 10 points from before the shutdown and the lowest Gallup has measured for either party since 1992. GOP leaders never liked this strategy and it's not working politically, so those who support it are right to assume it would be the first casualty in any negotiation as high-stakes as the one over the debt limit. By tying Obamacare to continued government funding, the debate can continue into its twilight stage. But if the Obamacare fight weren't strong enough to survive the rocks of the debt limit fight, it could easily get traded away later when the government shutdown is resolved. Imagine, for example, that the debt limit is raised temporarily in order to allow for fiscal talks. The president backed this idea in his Tuesday press conference--in partial fulfillment of the once fantastical exit strategy I wrote about a few days ago. That means the president would be engaged in negotiations, robbing Republicans of the useful stick that Obama was just sitting on the sidelines. (That critique--of a president refusing to even talk about his differences with those who disagree with him--was the most powerful talking point Republicans had going for them.) The president has also said he would talk about changes to Obamacare, which he might do as part of those entitlement talks Ryan was suggesting. Even if Obama isn't serious, his offers will remove another GOP argument for repeal--namely, that Obama is inflexible. Though the conservative Obamacare effort was weighed down by a lack of a clear end game, at least the mantra was clear--go big or go home. Going back on that forceful proposition seems like a tactical retreat unlikely to breed a new path to success.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/healthcare_gov_doomed_by_partisanship_and_spin_obamacare_s_failed_launch.html	"For four years we've watched the public political spat over President Obama's Affordable Care Act, but the Washington Post has given us a view into what it looks like when a political fight gets into the twitch muscles of an administration. In an in-depth investigation into the implementation of the president's health care law, the paper's reporters describe the creation of a jalopy built by a deeply flawed system. The problems piled up over years, flowing from both Republican obstructionism and the hyper political sensitivity of the Obama administration. This mix led to decisions based on politics instead of efficiency, which created the complexity and delay that contributed to the problems the president is scrambling to fix today. Healthcare.gov's collapse touches on the big issues of the Obama administration because the website represents a multiyear effort to implement the president's greatest vision. As the Washington Post outlines, three years before the site became an embarrassment, the seeds of its destruction were evident. The ingredients are familiar: partisan hurdles thrown up by the GOP, the jumpy political instincts of administration aides, administration insularity, spin that borders on deception, bureaucratic clots, and the bold and sprawling scope of the project. The question at the heart of this story--and, in a sense, of the entire Obama administration--is, what percentage of each element contributed to the ultimate outcome? The hero of the Post narrative is David Cutler of Harvard, an Obama adviser who wrote a four-page memo in 2010 outlining a number of structural flaws he saw in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Many of those structural flaws led to the public mess we're now witnessing. ""I am concerned that the personnel and processes you have in place are not up to the task, and that health reform will be unsuccessful as a result,"" he wrote to the president's top economic adviser, Larry Summers. The memo would seem to refute those who suggest that the failure of healthcare.gov is simply the kind of rocky rollout that attends any product launch. The problems were deep and predictable. Cutler suggests one big flaw was that there was no central person leading the charge who had experience implementing anything of that size and complexity in the nongovernmental world. This critique gets to the heart of the question about the difference between campaigning and governing. The modern political campaign is seen as a proxy for governing. For most of American history, it was seen as the opposite, because the talents of one often have little to do with the other. Can the team that runs a successful campaign--whether it's for office or selling a piece of legislation--also run a successful product launch? If the team members can't, do they know enough to bring in a person who can? When healthcare.gov imploded, the president knew to call in the experts and put a seasoned troubleshooter at the head of the cleanup effort. Why wasn't that done before? Apple and Google would never have allowed the problems that Cutler outlines in his memo to fester. But then again, Apple and Google would not have had to deal with an environment where their rivals were plotting to remove all the equipment from their product laboratories every night. The implementation of Obamacare didn't happen in a corporate environment. It happened in a toxic political arena where Republicans were working to undermine the law at every turn. That created hurdles real and imagined. A number of Republican governors did not open their own exchanges, adding to the federal burden. Republicans in Congress tried to defund the law any possible way they could, which meant administration officials had to house health care operations in parts of the government that would be protected from the defunding effort. The topsy-turvy organization decentralized responsibility for the law's implementation throughout the bureaucracy. Of course, that doesn't mean having a team of proper eggheads leading the effort would have made everything work. They might have gotten the implementation to look pretty on the whiteboard while failing to see the partisan traps. That would have made the law more efficient but also more politically vulnerable. On the other hand, administration officials may have been jumping at shadows, contorting decisions at every turn to avoid imagined political perils. The Obama administration needed someone to balance political considerations and operational ones. That position appears to have never existed. But the political problems facing the Affordable Care Act weren't just about avoiding specific attacks on the legislation to keep it alive. Obama aides wanted to keep the president's second-term prospects alive. That added complexity to the process as crucial regulations were delayed so that their publication didn't cause public relations headaches. The president needed to get re-elected to make sure his signature program was implemented, but how much did getting him re-elected warp the ability to implement the signature legislation? President Obama and his team won the political fight to pass health care reform, but they are failing at the implementation. Figuring out what variables matter most could do more than just tell us why the rollout was botched; it could tell us how to improve the state of things in Washington, where even basic legislation can't pass and when it does it isn't executed well. That's information we should take into the next election and pose to lawmakers making big promises about what they will get done.

The central Colorado congressman, who looks like an eager Batman sidekick grown up and made good, waved ""the letter that my family got canceling our insurance."" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius looked on, framed by TV and still cameras capturing every flutter of the paper. ""We chose to have our own private policy back in Colorado so we could be in the same boat as our constituents,"" said the congressman. ""And yet my insurance policy has been canceled. The White House website says, if you like the plan you have, you can keep it. Did I hear it wrong?"" Sebelius, who had sweated through three hours of questions (almost half of them, to be fair, from friendly Democrats), talked to Gardner as if trying to troubleshoot for him. ""I don't know how long you've had your plan,"" she said. ""Why aren't you losing your health insurance?"" asked Garner. From there, the discussion turned into a familiar shaming exercise about why administration officials or liberal congressmen won't sign onto the health care exchanges. Democrats find that easy to dismiss; Rep. Henry Waxman, the snappy ranking member of the committee, asked Sebelius if she could follow Gardner's advice and secure a health plan that ""would be able to protect you from cheap shots?"" But after the hearing, Gardner kept on fulminating about the broken ""you can keep it"" promise. In a TV statement, and in a short conversation with reporters, Gardner repeated the president's phrase like a mantra. An insurer had informed Gardner and his family that their old plan was unavailable, replaced by something with a ""significantly higher"" cost. They were among the 15 million people who bought insurance on the individual market, and now among the 7 to 12 million whose plans would be ended by Affordable Care Act regulations. ""We're like millions of Americans who lost our plan after the president said if we liked it we could keep it,"" he said. ""We called them up, and I said, 'Is this due to Obamacare?' They said, 'Yeah.' "" To Republicans, this is the latest in an ongoing series of Obamacare ""smoking guns,"" proof that the law never should have passed. And it's more than that. It's a shift away from the fruitless, theoretical, absolutist attacks of the past few months. Let Sen. Ted Cruz go on about liberty and tyranny and the evils of the living Constitution. Now that Obamacare is being implemented, the rest of the party is going to feel the pain of the middle class. That pain is most acutely felt, right now, by the 5 percent of Americans who shop on the individual insurance market. For more than three years, health care reporters had been warning that these plans would be altered or scrapped as they comported with new regulations, and for at least the last month conservatives had been circulating the letters from companies warning of the change. Gardner actually released his one month ago, the sort of dramatic gesture that might have gotten more attention had congressional conservatives not been betting all their chips on a government shutdown. Since the shutdown ended, some of the conservatives most identified with Manichean calls to shrink the government are calling for something new. Arthur Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute, won a new national following with a book (The Battle) about how each new government program put a brick on the ""road to serfdom."" Yet in an Oct. 18 speech, he warned conservatives against ""insane"" attacks on ""the government social safety net for the truly indigent."" ""We somehow want to zero out food stamps or something,"" said Brooks. ""It's nuts to want to be doing something like that. We have to declare peace on the safety net."" This week, in a speech at D.C.'s other conservative mega-think tank, Utah Sen. Mike Lee did a similar reshuffle of conservative talking points. It was worth building a federal system that rewarded good behavior and lifted up the poor, even if that meant--clutch your handkerchief--some redistribution of wealth. ""Many middle-class parents may pay no income taxes--but they do pay taxes,"" said Lee. ""Working parents are not free riders."" What Brooks, Lee, and Gardner all realized was that conservative Republicans needed to acknowledge what government looked like in 2013. The ""if you like it, you can keep it"" story, which they should have glommed on to earlier, inverts the health care narrative that had always made Democrats sound like Samaritans and Republicans sound like misers. Before, the ""exemplar"" story of health care was of the sick person (preferably young, preferably cherubic) being denied coverage because of villainous HMOs. Now, the networks were full of exemplars whose insurers had been held down and smothered by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' invisible army of regulators. This has Democrats spooked, for the moment. On Wednesday, as Republicans got ready to roll out a bill literally named ""The If You Like Your Health Care Plan You Can Keep It Act of 2013,"" Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu promised her own version. ""The promise was made and it should be kept,"" said the Democrat, who's up for re-election in 13 months. ""It was our understanding when we voted for that, that people when they have insurance could keep what they had."" So the sad insurance company letters will roll in, and Republicans will keep making them famous. As the New Republic's Jonathan Cohn puts it, this tactic gets Republicans out of a jam on their own health spending plans. Almost every member of the party is on record for Medicaid reforms that would end the program for millions of people, hypothetically more than are getting the bad news about private insurance plans now. Democrats, for now, are set to be the party of pain and suffering. That's surely why Republicans at the hearing didn't actually call for Sebelius to quit her job, or for the president to fire her. ""If this were the private sector, heads would roll,"" said an eager reporter to committee chairman Rep. Fred Upton, after the hearings. ""I had the opportunity to work at the White House myself, as a political appointee,"" said Upton. ""I served, every day, at the pleasure of the president. I knew that if I didn't do my job, I probably wasn't going to be there. Because she is there, she is serving with his pleasure, and, uh ..."" He trailed off, but the point was clear. Republicans have a better target than Sebelius."	Why Republicans Are No Longer Going After Kathleen Sebelius	['Cruz', 'Gardner', 'Upton']	[]
17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/obamacare_and_republican_criticism_the_health_care_law_s_early_missteps.html	"During the public debate over health care in 2009 and 2010, no matter how tightly you may have shut your door, there was one piece of information it was impossible to avoid: the president's promise that if you liked your doctor and your health care plan you would be able to keep it. So it was a surprise to many people to get a letter like the one Independence Blue Cross sent its customers weeks ago. It said that as a result of the Affordable Care Act, ""your current plan will be discontinued effective January 1, 2014, and you will need to select a new plan by the end of December to avoid any interruption in coverage."" That wasn't what the president promised. But wait, the president can explain. It's not what we think. People won't have the same insurance--they will have better insurance, administration officials assure. That's not the way some of the people receiving these letters see it. The president's original promise was so ironclad and repeated so often that any explanation now sounds like dissembling. When healthcare.gov launched with the fanfare and success of a North Korean missile, the president insisted that Obamacare was more than a website. The website might be a mess, but the underlying product was sound. Now, it's Republicans who are using this exact phrase. Like the president, GOP leaders want people to focus on the larger law. You can fix a website, they say, but you can't improve the law. What started as a website debacle is growing into a relitigation of the underlying operation. The Affordable Care Act passed with cracks and inconsistencies that are now re-emerging in the context of the website's bad launch. In some cases that simply gives Republicans new lines of attack. In others, like this argument over keeping your old health care, the failure of the site is weakening the administration's ability to engage in those old debates. The matter at issue here only affects the 5 percent of the population that buys health care in the individual market, compared to the 80 percent who get health care through their companies. The president's press secretary, Jay Carney, pointed this out several times in his daily briefing Tuesday to put the controversy in perspective. ""You would think in some of the coverage over the last several days we were talking about 75 percent,"" he said. Fair enough, but the president's claim about keeping coverage was always about more than a sliver of people signing up for Obamacare which is why it has the ability to resonate beyond the audience directly affected by it. Let's go back in time. During the debate over the law, the president had a difficult balancing act. He had to argue that the status quo in health care was a disaster while at the same time not threatening the status quo for those people who were happy with their health care or who feared it would get worse under his changes. A CBS poll at the time showed that people were quite afraid that whatever the president did, it would hurt their plans. Sixty-nine percent worried that the ACA would affect the quality of their care. Almost three-quarters thought it would limit their access. There was a lot of pressure on the president to send the message that nothing would change. In the summer of 2009, the president began to tailor his message to assuage the fears of these very people. If you liked what you had, it wasn't going to change. That was a broad and simplified claim and the press called him on it. The president could never make that promise. He didn't have the power to keep insurance companies from changing their policies in response to the law. Nevertheless, the president continued to make the claim in the desperate attempt to sell his unpopular plan. This was a time bomb embedded in the legislation. It might have been mitigated if the website had worked. If it had been humming as administration officials so fervently hoped, there would be no broader context for debates about whether the president is living up to his promises. And in this specific instance, the flourishing of the site might have offered loads of examples of people in that individual market whose plans had only changed for the better. Of course, that's not what happened. The president's message about his signature law has always been: It gets better, I promise. That was always an uphill battle. The benefits of the law were strung out over time, making it harder for people to recognize a payoff. ""Trust me"" claims clash with people's mistrust of politicians and government programs. When the website doesn't work and the promises of 2009 and 2010 are revised, questions of credibility infect everything the administration says. This can lead to a death spiral as administration officials make bold assertions to distract from the current challenges. White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett tweeted Monday night: ""FACT: Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans. No change is required unless insurance companies change existing plans."" Of course the insurance companies wouldn't have had to change plans if it hadn't been for Obamacare. This is spinning--which is to be expected from a president's defender--but its legalistic dissembling seems particularly weak in light of the president's initial promises. (It isn't the only time the administration has claimed a FACT recently about health care that isn't one). For congressional Republicans, these credibility challenges help obscure their recent flirtation with utter collapse. It's not just that Republicans benefit when the president's signature legislation falters. This debate over his initial claim lends credibility to their longstanding opposition to the law. House Speaker John Boehner's office quickly provided reporters with a quotation from the GOP weekly radio address from September 2009, delivered by Rep. Tom Price: ""On the stump, the president regularly tells Americans that 'if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.' But if you read the bill, that just isn't so. For starters, within five years, every health care plan will have to meet a new federal definition for coverage--one that your current plan might not match, even if you like it."" A key critique of the Republican Party's recent attempt to defund Obamacare was that it was a strategy born of limited vision. They couldn't see that it was doomed to fail spectacularly. Four years ago, with the Affordable Care Act, they saw this moment coming."	Why Obamacare Is Making Republicans Look Wise Beyond Their Years	[]	['healthcare']

""We need people to know that Nov. 5 in Virginia is a referendum on Obamacare!"" The place: A conference center nestled in the unending concrete yawn of Fairfax County, Va. The audience: At least 300 cheering Republican voters, there to sign up for the final stretch of Cuccinelli's gubernatorial campaign and to see special guest Sen. Rand Paul. The message: The last way that national Republicans want this race to be perceived. If these are the final days of Ken Cuccinelli's political career, as the polls suggest them to be, the wider Republican Party wants to say a safe, spinnable distance away from the smoldering wreckage. What was supposed to be a competitive race for governor between two unpopular candidates is in danger of turning into a rout. Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, has overcome a series of financial scandals and a governing record that consists of Meet the Press appearances to build a 10-point lead over Cuccinelli. No Democrat has built that sort of lead in a Virginia gubernatorial race since 1985. No Democrat has won this office while a member of his party was in the White House since 1965. And those records are going to be busted by Terry McAuliffe? It baffles Republicans. But in person, it's not baffling at all. On Tuesday, Cuccinelli and McAuliffe hit the trail just 10 miles apart, in separate Northern Virginia suburbs. Cuccinelli is currently losing these suburbs by 24 points and was being outspent on TV even before one of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's shell groups started spending money here. It's getting more liberal as more government contractors and nonwhite voters move in. McAuliffe has effectively disqualified Cuccinelli with these people, telling them with incessant TV ads that the attorney general opposes legal contraception and shutters abortion clinics. Cuccinelli's Fairfax rally was meant for the other voters, the ones being outnumbered. Shortly before 3 p.m., they streamed in, signed up for get-out-the-vote operations, and picked up Cuccinelli or ""I Am the NRA"" signs being passed out by volunteers. When Cuccinelli arrived, it was side by side with Paul, the two of them hoisting 64-ounce Double Big Gulps. ""I heard Mike Bloomberg wanted to buy the governor's office down here,"" Paul explained, ""and I figured after he took my Big Gulp, he'd come after my guns."" Earlier in the day, in Lynchburg, Va., Paul had warned conservatives that genetic testing could lead to a dystopian eugenic future. He stayed away from that in Fairfax, delivering a shorter version of his speech about the dangers of war-on-terror policing. ""They're writing one warrant to apply to millions and millions of people,"" said Paul. ""We fought the Revolution because we were mad about the British soldiers coming into our homes to enforce the Stamp Act."" ""And we won!"" yelled a Cuccinelli backer. This was rather disconnected from the issues of the gubernatorial race. In his own 24-minute speech, Cuccinelli stayed closer to the point, deriding McAuliffe as an obvious charlatan and fool who would do the bidding of the Democratic Party. ""Remember when he was running on GreenTech?"" said Cuccinelli, referring to the electric car company McAuliffe founded after his failed 2009 run for governor. ""Two federal investigations later, he's not talking about it so much!"" Cuccinelli's audience knew every beat of this. They were, generally, well-versed in talk radio and aware that a McAuliffe win would boost the people he spent his life working for--the Clintons. ""Hillary Clinton? I hate her,"" said April Hudson, a libertarian-minded Cuccinelli supporter. ""I think she's a murderer. I think she should be in jail. She disgusts me. Everything she did in Benghazi, it disgusts me. She should be disqualified from running for president."" ""Virginia's a real plum for the Clintons,"" said Margaret Hobble, a Cuccinelli supporter from Winchester, Va. ""Hillary and Obama worked under the same man, Saul Alinsky."" The point of this rally was to rev up the Republican base, in the hope that the April Hudsons have more clout than they do when turnout is higher on the other side. Before the race is over, Cuccinelli will have stumped with Paul, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a crew of conservative state attorneys general, and the radio host and author Mark Levin. Off-year Virginia electorates are whiter and older and more conservative than the electorates that elected Barack Obama twice. ""We've got to close like we've closed every race we've been in, and that is--better than the other side,"" said Cuccinelli. He evoked the memory of a 2007 state Senate race that he won after days of recanvassing ballots. ""You know what they call you when you win an election in a recount? Senator."" But apart from the die-hards, few people expect this race to be in the margin for a recount. I drove up the road to Herndon, Va., stopping at one of the convenience stores that remind Republicans every day of how the region is ebbing away from them. Outside, a few groups of day laborers loitered away the afternoon. Inside, a mostly Hispanic clientele wandered past the bargain stacks of Corona and Modelo Especial to buy Red Bull and--yes--Big Gulps. And a few minutes away, the line for McAuliffe's rally stretched around most of Herndon Middle School. Bill Clinton was coming in for the sixth event on a nine-stop ""Putting Jobs First"" tour. Mark Herring, the state senator who's running for attorney general with McAuliffe, worked the line and told voters that his opponent, Mark Obenshain, was a Cuccinelli cheerleader. This is the closing message that has built a small lead for Herring in the only race that still seems competitive. Cuccinelli's rally had felt like a typical state election rally. McAuliffe's was inflated to presidential campaign proportions--multiple checkpoints, special guests, personalized media tags, PA blasting the U2 and Bruce Springsteen songs that every Obama campaign embed still hears in his nightmares. Volunteers roamed the gymnasium signing up warm bodies for their get-out-the-vote drive. Time-filling local Democrats took the stage to ask, repeatedly, for the ambitious to sign up for three electioneering shifts. McAuliffe arrived only after Herring, Sen. Mark Warner, and local congressman Gerry Connolly gave their own speeches lighting into the radicalism of Cuccinelli, Obenshain, and the accidental lieutenant governor candidate/grifter E.W. Jackson. (Connolly stuck to a script about the GOP ticket; Rep. Frank Wolf, who appeared at the Cuccinelli rally, led off with an update into the Benghazi investigation, encouraging people to watch last Sunday's 60 Minutes piece.) Cuccinelli had sort of riffed on an open mic; McAuliffe squared his shoulders and, in his blaring and unaltered Syracuse, N.Y., patois, went through an exhaustive list of Cuccinelli's crimes against moderation, from his opposition to light rail--""isn't it time we got cars off the roads and folks into mass transit?""--to his entitlement philosophies. ""He actually called Medicaid, quote, outright welfare,"" said McAuliffe, ""It's similar to his view of Medicare and Social Security, which he said were created by bad politicians to, quote, make people dependent on government."" McAuliffe's mother took Social Security. ""She's paid into Social Security her entire life--she's not dependent on the government!"" Halfway through this speech, the Washington Post released its final poll on the governor's race. In the back of the room, staffers with the campaign and the Democratic Governors Association flicked through the numbers on their smartphones. All good--McAuliffe up 12, Herring up 3, Cuccinelli's negative rating in the high 50s as McAuliffe's positives went up. Danny Kanner, a DGA spokesman who had just sent out a release about Paul ""bringing the crazy"" for Cuccinelli, told of how the party would frame Jindal when he came to the state. ""He was the one governor who backed the shutdown!"" said Kanner. The speeches ran on. Clinton took 25 minutes to walk the crowd through the ongoing economic crisis, Cuccinelli's suit against climate change scientist Michael Mann, and the risk of higher Republican turnout. ""The enduring virtue of [Cuccinelli's] approach is that everyone who agrees with him will vote,"" said Clinton. ""Are you absolutely sure that everybody in this crowd is going to vote? How will you feel if he's ahead in the polls and people didn't show up? That's what happened in Colorado in this recent recall election."" Duly frightened, the Democrats wrapped up the rally and headed back to their cars. On the way out I ran into Jeff Barnett, a Democrat who'd run against Frank Wolf in the bleak 2010 election. He wondered if a Cuccinelli loss would tell conservatives that they needed to tone it down. He worried that they wouldn't; they were always ""fighting the last war"" and saying the party was simply not conservative enough. ""You send a bunch of boys over the top,"" said Barnett. ""They get mowed down. So you send in another wave of them. They get mowed down. You try again. It's Passchendaele on steroids."""

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/scott_walker_s_relationship_with_the_lord_the_republican_wisconsin_governor.html	"God got Scott Walker out of a serious jam. It was February 2011, well into the showdown between the new Republican governor of Wisconsin and the public sector unions. Ian Murphy, the editor of the Buffalo Beast, called Walker's office pretending to be donor/industrialist David Koch. The journalist, doing his best impression of a rich guy who didn't actually sound much like Koch, goaded Walker into talking about his strategy for passing Act 10, designed to largely end collective bargaining in the public sector. The conversation lasted 20 minutes. Walker talked; Murphy/Koch occasionally goaded him. ""Bring a baseball bat,"" said Murphy/Koch. ""I have one in my office,"" said Walker, ""a Slugger with my name on it."" Walker referred obliquely to Koch's ""guy on the ground"" during the crisis, and when Murphy/Koch asked about the wisdom of ""planting some troublemakers,"" Walker said his team had ""thought about that"" but dismissed it. It was a prank that became the nadir of Walker's crisis. In his new memoir, Unintimidated, Walker (and co-writer Marc Thiessen*, the Bush administration speechwriter turned columnist) devote a whole chapter to the call. The governor claims that he ""hesitated"" to take it, and ""was upset that my staff had let the call get through to my office, making me look so silly."" He never actually ""thought about"" the fake troublemakers--he now writes that he ""did not want to insult Mr. Koch by saying that we would never do something so stupid."" He doesn't mention the baseball bat at all, skipping right ahead to the press conference called to clean up the mess. Walker only took four questions as protesters chanted at a decibel level that rammed right through the office doors. ""Only later did I realize that God had a plan for me with that episode,"" writes Walker. After his press conference, he picked up his daily devotional and saw the title for Feb. 23: The power of humility, the burden of pride. ""I looked up and said, 'I hear you, Lord,'"" writes Walker. ""God was sending me a clear message to not do things for personal glory or fame. It was a turning point that helped me in future challenges, helped me stay focused on the people I was elected to serve, and reminded me of God's abundant grace and the paramount need to stay humble."" Providence gets a starring role in Walker's memoir. Where he travels, ordinary citizens tell him to buck up. An airport worker who hands him a piece of paper reading ""Isaiah 54:17,"" which Walker quickly checks on his phone: ""No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you."" A floor manager for a TV show confides to Walker that ""she and her kids got down on their knees every night and prayed for me and my family."" Walker and Thiessen supply plenty of budget numbers and gruesome details of union contracts to prove that voters would eventually thank him for cutting bloated salaries and pensions. God certainly didn't hurt. Walker could have been stymied; Democrats balked at a last-minute Act 10 compromise, which let Walker slam the door on them and give the email evidence to reporters. JoAnne Kloppenburg, a judicial candidate who nearly defeated a conservative judge in April 2011, was leading in Walker's polls and ""might very well have"" won had she ""made the race about Act 10."" Had she won, she could have blocked Act 10 and Walker ""probably would not have survived"" the recall. But she pivoted to an untrue personal attack, which backfired. Walker's 2012 recall opponent whiffed when he started attacking Walker over a legal investigation instead of Act 10. The celebrities who led protests in Madison? Strictly ""B-list,"" as Walker reminds the reader, twice. But why else did he win? It helped that Walker's version of austerity hit public sector employees, not the rest of the state. Job numbers had ticked up by the time Walker was finally on the ballot again, though the governor notes, strangely, that ""the Obama labor department was not going to speed up the release [of newer numbers] to help us out."" He makes one mention of his fundraising during the recall, $37 million, as ""70 percent of our donors gave $50 or less."" And he did outpace the Democrats in pure donor numbers. He just doesn't mention a loophole that allowed him to raise unlimited funds for a short period of time, eventually outraising the Democrats by better than 7-to-1. For the purposes of Walker's mythmaking, that doesn't really matter. The governor is less-frequently discussed as a presidential candidate than Rep. Paul Ryan is. That might be an example of the media fighting the last war, remembering that another upper Midwestern governor ran in 2012 and collapsed at the second lap. (His name, as you have already forgotten, was Tim Pawlenty.) Walker's sleepy eyelids and Wiscaaaahnson accent are as good a disguise for ambition as Claudius' stutter. After he's finished counting bodies from his rout of local Democrats, he spends pages explaining why Mitt Romney blew the 2012 election. ""Reagan did not dismiss 47 percent of the country as a bunch of moochers,"" writes Walker. ""Reagan would never have uttered the words 'self-deportation.'"" Also, the Romney team's copy of the 1980 anti-Carter campaign was all wrong: ""'Are you better off than you were four years ago?' was Reagan's closing argument, not his entire argument.'"" Walker, it's strongly implied, would not have muffed this. He and his wife, he tells us elsewhere in the story, ""host a dinner each year on Reagan's birthday. We serve his favorite foods--macaroni and cheese casserole, and red, white, and blue Jelly Belly jelly beans."" The message: This governor knows his place in the universe. On the night of his recall victory, his wife Tonette urged him to open with a jokey reference to the pro-union protesters: ""This is what democracy looks like!"" Walker considered it. ""Perhaps,"" he writes, ""after all we had been through, I could have indulged myself for one small moment. But then I remembered that devotional reading after the prank call on 'the power of humility.'"" Correction, Oct. 28, 2013: The article originally misspelled Marc Thiessen's first name.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/obamacare_brosurance_and_mothers_the_affordable_care_act_s_unlikely_allies.html	"Presumably one day large numbers of people will seamlessly sign up for health care on the newly created health care exchanges. When that day comes, the Obama administration will still face its primary challenge: getting large numbers of bros--that is to say, healthy, 18- to-29-year-old single men--to sign up for Obamacare. The economics of the Affordable Care Act make bros matter a lot. Like any insurance pool, the state exchanges will depend on buy-in from young, healthy people, who are cheaper to insure, to ballast premiums. Of the 7 million people the White House wants to sign up for the exchanges by next March, about 2.7 million of them are under the age of 35. The problem is many young people either don't see the value in signing up for the exchanges or don't understand how they work. And that's why this ad from a nonprofit promoting Colorado's health exchange is so genius: ""Keg stands are crazy,"" the ad reads. ""Not having health insurance is crazier. Don't tap into your beer money to cover those medical bills. We got it covered."" Another bro-care ad reads, ""My girlfriend broke my heart, so me and the bros went golfing. Then my buddy broke my head. Good thing Mom made sure I got insurance."" State organizations--like the creators of the ""brosurance"" ad--are faced with the same basic conundrum as Monday Night Football advertisers: How do you convince young men to buy something they don't think they need? The brosurance ad was created by the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative as part of a campaign targeting groups of people who hit the insurance ""sweet spot""--people who aren't poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but are unemployed or don't get insurance through their work.* Other ads feature a pregnant woman, a bike-riding hipster, and an athletic middle-aged rock climber. Adam Fox, the group's director of strategic engagement, says the publicity the brosurance ad has garnered shows the type of viral approach these PSAs need to have if they are going to reach young men. ""This is a demographic that hasn't really been successfully marketed to in health insurance,"" Fox says. ""If people aren't going to look at it, they're not going to learn anything."" So, the success of Obamacare doesn't just hinge on enrolling sick people (or a functional website, for that matter). Ultimately, young people will decide how much they and everyone else will pay depending on how many of them buy into the exchanges. It isn't necessarily a tough sell. In one poll, 70 percent of people under 30 said having health care was ""very important"" to them. Still, many young people are skeptical of whether it's cost-effective to sign up for the exchanges, even though most of them will be eligible for subsidies. A 21-year-old in California making less than $34,470 will receive at least some help from the government to pay for a silver plan. Those who make more than $34,470 (or 300 percent of the federal poverty line) will have to pay at least $216 a month and won't receive any federal subsidies. They can also turn down the exchanges and pay a $95 fine for the first year. Aside from cheeky ads, how can states get young men to buy in? Enter Mom. Mothers make the health care decisions in 80 percent of families, and they're the most effective ""messengers"" to persuade their kids to sign up for health care. Anne Filipic, who leads the nonprofit group Enroll America, says men may be the ultimate target for groups promoting the exchanges--they are more skeptical of health insurance and tend to visit the doctor less--but they're focusing on women because of their decision-making role. ""The messenger matters a lot,"" Filipic says. ""The most effective thing we can do is get moms and women the information, so in their day-to-day conversations they can be spreading the word."" Enroll America surveyed young people and asked who they were most likely to trust talking to them about health care. For young women, ""someone like me"" was the most persuasive messenger. For young men, it was their mom, followed by their spouse or girlfriend. That's why the Obama administration has promoted the exchanges on mom-friendly media like allrecipes.com, Good Morning America, and Elle magazine. The group MomsRising is even recruiting mothers to proselytize on the law's benefits for young people through its ""Wellness Wonder Teams."" The AARP has created a site called Your Mom Means It (or, en Espanol, Tu Mama Sabe), with e-cards for moms to guilt their kids into signing up for the exchanges. ""I don't mind being the reason you get health insurance,"" one reads. ""You're the reason that I drink wine out of a box."" Another: ""As a reward for signing up for health insurance, I'll defriend you on Facebook."" Winning the support of moms has become its own battleground between pro- and anti-Obamacare groups. In dueling videos, Americans for Prosperity and Organizing for Action compete to capitalize on mothers' attention to their young children's health. Anti-Obamacare groups are also targeting young people, like Generation Opportunity, which gave a tongue-in-cheek ""Youth Defender Award""  to the creators of healthcare.gov for preventing people from signing up for the exchanges. (You may also remember the group's creepy Uncle Sam ads from September.) The White House worked with Funny or Die on a Scandal spoof, and Rep. Darrell Issa used Lolcats, that memetic workhorse, to make fun of the Obamacare help line. Of course, cat GIFs don't do it for everyone. Young people aren't a monolith. There are high school dropouts and those with graduate degrees; those who are covered by their parents' insurance and those who aren't; single men and pregnant, married women; young people who've never broken a bone in their body and others who have cancer. Whether or not they sign up for government health care or pay a penalty is ultimately up to them. But everyone will be better off if the bros decide to get those totally jacked biceps state-insured. Correction, Oct. 25, 2013: This article originally stated that the brosurance ad was created to target people who aren't poor enough to qualify for Medicare.

""I am reminded of that first revolution,"" said McDaniel, flanked by supporters and a Patton-sized American flag. ""I stand here with you, with the silent majority of Americans who believe we can retake this country, who still believe in liberty."" Cochran, the first Republican to win a direct election to one of Mississippi's Senate seats, did not vote for the Affordable Care Act. But he didn't vote with Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee against the House's continuing resolution--a procedural vote that would have prevented debate on the funding and thus blocked Democrats from adding back funding for the law. He voted with most Senate Republicans on the shutdown-ending bill. So conservatives want to replace him. McDaniel's announcement was echoed by an immediate $1 million ad buy from the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth, introducing Mississippians to McDaniel as an antidote to (unnamed) ""career politicians bankrupting our country."" ""I would have stood my ground and fought on the issue of defunding,"" McDaniel said in an interview. ""We've increased the debt ceiling 77 times since 1962, so when it does happen, let's attempt to get concessions out of the compromise. This time, the Republicans didn't pick up any significant or substantive concessions. I've been practicing law for years, and every time I had a lawsuit settled, both parties walked away with something. That didn't happen here--there were no concessions on health care or the debt. I would have stood and fought."" Any Republican donor who thought that the shutdown would ""break the fever"" of the Tea Party, or that it would prove the pesky base wrong about its strategy, clearly didn't know enough conservatives. ""People started paying attention to Obamacare again"" because of the shutdown, according to McDaniel. The immediate political legacy of the #StandWithCruz moment is a surge of primary challenges, mostly in states or districts that Democrats won't even try to win. The goal: replace the graybeard Republicans who ""caved"" with Cruz/Lee doppelgangers who won't. Conservatives have boasted about this goal with all the secrecy and humility of Kanye West explaining his lyrics. In 2011, while he was just a candidate for Senate, Ted Cruz told the New York Times that it would ""fundamentally shift the character of the Senate"" if ""the five or six strong conservatives elected to the Senate in 2012 became 10 or 12."" This week, after he returned to Texas, Cruz blamed the Republicans who had opposed the defund fight for whatever damage had happened to ""the Republican brand."" Conservative activists want to fix this by removing or replacing anyone who didn't fight. Nebraska Sen. Mike Johanns is retiring, spending his final months in office chastening the conservatives who wanted to defund Obamacare through the CR. ""It's a tactic that promised things that as a minority we do not have any ability to deliver,"" Johanns told the Lincoln Journal-Star. ""I don't see an exit strategy."" But the surprise hope to replace Johanns is Ben Sasse, a 42-year-old former Health and Human Services assistant secretary who calls himself ""the anti-Obamacare candidate"" and says he's ""not looking to meet in the middle."" Sasse is already getting Cruz-like treatment in conservative media. The state's former treasurer, who led early polls, raised $336,000 in the first quarter. Sasse raised $815,000, breaking a record set six years ago by Sen. Johanns. Shortly thereafter he was endorsed by the Senate Conservatives Fund, which previously backed Cruz and Lee. The typical, Karl Rove knock on Tea Party candidates is that they blow elections for the Republican Party in hard-to-win states. Sasse and McDaniel are seeking nominations in states where Democrats can no longer compete; the last serious Democratic recruits in Nebraska and Mississippi, Bob Kerrey and Ronnie Musgrove, lost by double digits. It's been 19 years since Democrats seriously contested a Senate race in Kansas, and that minimizes the risk posed by Dr. Milton Wolf, a distant Obama cousin and Tea Party speaker who's now challenging Sen. Pat Roberts over his vote to put Kathleen Sebelius (the state's former governor) in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services. And by 2014 it'll have been a decade since Democrats made a run at a Senate seat in South Carolina. No Democrat, says 43-year-old state Sen. Lee Bright, will win statewide office there as long as Barack Obama is president. That argument is helping his primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham, who voted against the Cruz/Lee stratagem and trashed it whenever a microphone or camera came into view. ""I would have voted with Cruz and Lee,"" said Bright. ""There's nothing they've done up to this point that I disagree with. Look, people are going to ask: Where were you? Did you do everything you could to stop this? The Republican minority in the Senate blinked, as Obama knew they would."" How could Bright or McDaniel have changed that? Neither of them suggested a play that Cruz hadn't already tried. Both candidates said they were disinclined to raise the debt limit, and would only do so if conditions were met. Both would have voted against any of the deals that ended the last few showdowns. ""When the Democrats proposed Obamacare, a lot of people gave them no chance of succeeding,"" said McDaniel. ""But they worked, and they fought. The point is, you fight every day, you get in the trenches, you do the right thing for your republic even if it hurts. In life, sometimes victories don't come overnight."" Bright was just as optimistic, and hopeful that a few more conservative senators could put the fear into ""squishy moderates"" the next time Congress was asked to fund the government or raise the debt limit. ""We lost, but at least we've got a roll call vote in the Senate,"" said Bright. ""We know which senators fought for liberty, and which ones caved to Obama. They put up the white flags before the battle started. We've got a list."""	Meet Three Republicans Who Want to Be Just Like Ted Cruz	['Roberts', 'Cruz', 'Sasse', 'Obama']	[]
22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/kathleen_sebelius_blamed_by_republicans_for_healthcare_gov_problems_gop.html	"STERLING, Va.--The polling in the Virginia governor's race turned against state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli months ago. The government shutdown was blamed on his peers in the Republican Party. (It didn't help that Sen. Ted Cruz, whom Cuccinelli had praised lavishly, forded the Potomac for a campaign event.) His opponent, Terry McAuliffe, has endured multiple scandals, including a fictional one that led to two Associated Press journalists getting sacked. ""This launch has been a national embarrassment, but it's just a symptom of much bigger problems,"" said Cuccinelli. ""I believe President Obama ought to fire Kathleen Sebelius."" That got the loudest applause of a 20-minute speech in front of 200-odd Republican activists. A blonde, middle-aged female Tea Partier, who had spent the time before the speech telling people nearby not to talk to reporters, shouted, ""Sebelius must go!"" So Cuccinelli said it again. ""Kathleen Sebelius ought to be fired."" Before the speech was over he'd called on the secretary of Health and Human Services to resign three times, and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey (one of four AGs from other states who'd come to campaign with Cuccinelli) chastised Sebelius for ""going to a gala"" instead of agreeing to testify in front of Congress about healthcare.gov. When the speech was over, Cuccinelli was asked whether he was asking for something President Obama would never do, something not pertinent to a race for governor. ""It's very realistic, certainly given that people in his own party are calling for people to be fired,"" said Cuccinelli. ""I don't think it's anything novel for someone from the other side to say that, when all we want is competency. And because we did win some of the [legal] arguments, we still have this debate. The Medicare debate is an Obamacare debate. Having the exchanges is an Obamacare debate."" Democrats fully expect Cuccinelli to lose this election, and they will make no personnel decisions based on his advice. He was actually late to the blame-Sebelius party. The former governor of Kansas has never tingled the conservative id as much as Attorney General Eric Holder or departed Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano (""Big Sis,"" as the Drudge Report called her). Savvier conservatives have warned for years that the Affordable Care Act gives incredible new regulatory power to whomever happens to run HHS, but they trained most of their fire on the ""Obama"" prefix of ""Obamacare."" That changed in October. The disastrous launch of healthcare.gov coincided with the government shutdown; Republicans were slow to take advantage of the mini-crisis. It was really Sebelius's interview with The Daily Show on Oct. 7 that made them see the roadkill bleeding out on the interstate. Jon Stewart started the segment by opening a Macbook and offering Sebelius a ""dare"": ""I'm gonna try and download every movie ever made, and you're gonna try to sign up for Obamacare, and we'll see which happens first."" By the end, Sebelius was struggling to convince Stewart--who wanted the law to work!--why it didn't make sense to delay the mandate until the exchange site was at least as functional as a Geocities page. Slowly, methodically, as the site errors persisted, Republicans lit into Sebelius. On Oct. 11, Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts called on Sebelius to ""resign for gross incompetence"" after ""even Jon Stewart"" saw through the failure of Obamacare. Five days later, at a congressional forum sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, multiple House Republicans told reporters to watch the Jon Stewart interview to 1) learn how journalism was done and 2) see how sensible the one-year delay truly was. By this time, non-Comedy Central news organizations were running their own investigations into the site failures. (Slate, which has been gathering reports from people signing up this year, published their ""site didn't work"" tales on Oct. 3.) The House Energy and Commerce Committee was asking Sebelius to show up on Oct. 24 and explain why the exchange site wasn't loading Sebelius passed. On Monday morning, hours before the Cuccinelli rally, the same House committee issued a statement asking, ""Will President Obama Call on Secretary Sebelius to Skip the Gala and Testify Thursday?"" For the aid of lazy reporters, they attached a video of Sebelius getting interviewed by Jon Stewart. Sebelius has agreed to testify before the committee on Oct. 30. That means nine more potential days of human pinata-bashing. Republicans are making up for two wasted weeks of shutdown politics, arguing that healthcare.gov's disaster presages the collapse of Obamacare. They think they got a substantial assist from the president's Monday speech, where his fellow Americans were asked to remember that Obamacare was ""not just a website,"" and given the phone numbers to call if the pages didn't load. All that was missing, snarked Republican Study Committee chairman Rep. Steve Scalise, ""was an offer for free T-shirts to the first 100 callers."" And Obama's speech probably was a favor to Republicans. Those crusades against high-level members of the administration have largely failed--Eric Holder has a job, Chuck Hagel has a job, and Susan Rise became national security adviser after Republicans thought they'd scalped her. Focusing on Sebelius gets the administration's back up, because it has no fear whatsoever of congressional inquisitors. It creates the impression that one firing could right the program, like swapping out generals in Iraq kind-of-sort-of-won that war. ""Congress should legally pass a one-year delay of the individual mandate,"" said Cuccinelli at Monday's rally in Sterling. The House GOP had just spent two weeks failing to do as much, but that was before the Big Glitch. ""The big boys got their delay illegally from a president who waved his magic president wand. Didn't know there was one, but apparently there is."""	Why Kathleen Sebelius Won't Be Fired	['Roberts', 'Napolitano', 'Stewart', 'Obama']	['healthcare']
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/barack_obama_was_the_winner_the_showdown_between_the_president_and_republicans.html	"At his Thursday press conference, President Obama declared, ""There are no winners""--just before he proceeded to act like a man who had just won. The morning after the budget crisis ended, the president's remarks were extensive and clear about who was to blame for the 16-day standoff that cost the economy roughly $24 billion, by one estimate.* The president outlined all that had been sacrificed--from slowed economic growth and higher deficits to America's damaged credibility in the world. He suggested his opponents were too witless to avoid being cowed by bloggers and talk radio, and had risked the very American experiment our predecessors spent two centuries building. The public, which had overwhelmingly blamed Republicans, no doubt knew who he was talking about and who to blame. If it wasn't clear, the president had a piece of advice for those Republicans: Rather than trying to ""break"" the government because they disagreed with him, they should ""go out there and win an election."" Well, that should settle them down. The disconnect between what the president said about there being ""no winners"" and the way he behaved demonstrates that something important is missing from our public discourse: We need to come to an agreement about what we mean when we talk about winners and losers in politics. The president's remarks about winning echoed a statement from House Speaker John Boehner more than a week ago. ""This is not some damn game,"" said Boehner, slamming a copy of that morning's Wall Street Journal on the lectern in which a White House aide had been quoted saying, ""We're winning."" Both men are appealing to a strong public sentiment that I hear a lot in emails, on Twitter, and in conversations with voters. What happens in Washington affects real people. That's especially true with the government shutdown and sequestration. When the politicians, journalists, and other Washington dwellers talk about it--either in terms of raw numbers or in terms of which party is up or down--we risk losing the essential humanity at the center of the enterprise. When the public hears us talking in this way, they want to punch us in the nose. They are right to want to do this. But there are some other considerations to take into account. First, this is a game. Not in the sense that it's fun (though some people do find entertainment in politics), but in the sense that very high-stakes poker is still, at bottom, a game. If you don't like the term game, then perhaps we should use the word contest. But whatever we call it, there are important elements of this drama that are gamelike. The game is fueled, in part, by pure personal ambition to win that has little to do with the merits of the cause being debated. Perhaps we'd prefer every debate to be a contest of ideas in which each side weighed the policy prescriptions the other wanted, but that's not the way it is. And it's not the way the Framers envisioned it either. ""If men were angels, no government would be necessary,"" wrote James Madison, in that Federalist 51 passage you could have seen me winding up to quote from a mile away. Government, he wrote, ""the greatest of all reflections on human nature,"" is full of all the messy aspects of it: emotion, greed, pride, and lots of other messy stuff. A lot of good policy rides on the back of human ambition. Most great legislation exists in part because of it. If you believe in some particular value or policy, you'd better hope there is an audacious politician out there willing to champion it. Winning is also a perfectly appropriate way to talk about the clashes of the day because these battles are also sometimes a legitimate contest of ideas, which means you want your side to win so that your policy idea becomes law. The person who wins, whether through guile or persuasive argument, gets the idea enacted. Just because some politician or party is winning doesn't mean that others don't also stand to benefit. In politics that's necessarily the case. Shutdown 2013, however, was less about policy than it was about raw power. Obamacare may have provoked the fight, but the mess quickly swerved into some other lane and then the disputes became about who was or was not willing to negotiate with the other. The quintessential nature of this battle--a clash of power between two sides--makes the ""winner"" and ""loser"" language all the more apt. It would be better if we didn't have stupid fights about the basic functioning of government, but if we are going to have those battles, we should use the appropriate words to describe them. That's the real reason there's so much talk about winning and losing. It is the shorthand conversation about power in any high-stakes contest. That is the way lawmakers, strategists, policy analysts, and journalists talk about the process of governing. It is blunt and messy and sometimes crass, but to gloss over it or pretend it doesn't exist is to tell an incomplete story. So, for example, what President Obama was doing in his remarks Thursday might have sounded like a high-minded appeal to reason and fair dealing, but the message that hit you in the gut was to highlight his victory. He was putting the Republicans in the stockade, and pointing at them on national television so that he might gain even more leverage over them in the coming legislative battles. The president thinks he won, and he wants to keep on winning. Correction, Oct. 18, 2013: This article originally said that the standoff cost taxpayers roughly $24 billion. The estimate was for the overall economic cost. (Return.)"	Why Obama's Showdown With Republicans Was a Game With Winners and Losers	['Obama']	[]
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/republican_party_lose_on_government_shutdown_and_debt_limit_the_gop_rewrites.html	"For the men and women of the U.S. Senate, Wednesday morning was a time of jubilation. Hark--a deal was born! Sens. Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell came bearing a bipartisan agreement that punted the debt and government funding deadlines with a minimal amount of riders. ""Political adversaries set aside their differences and disagreement,"" said Majority Leader Reid. ""I think we have the framework for the kind of bipartisanship that the American people need and want,"" said Sen. John McCain. The Arizona senator, who'd logged hours of TV interviews blaming the House Republicans for the shutdown, was closing the book on the whole mess. At the same time, far away from the sound of handshakes and backslaps, the House Oversight Committee was conducting an investigation into the real culprit of the shutdown. Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, had been subpoenaed in an investigation of why beloved open-air parks and memorials--the World War II Memorial, especially--were barricaded during the shutdown. Why, asked Rep. Darrell Issa, did an anonymous park ranger tell the Washington Times that the feds would make the shutdown ""as difficult as possible""? Why did parks stay open for Occupy Wall Street but closed to the men who stormed Omaha Beach? ""You came before one of our committees and made it clear that you were going to reinterpret the First Amendment to include basically people sleeping in the parks, defecating on the lawns, creating a health hazard for the people of the District of Columbia,"" said Issa. ""Do you consider it an exercise of your First Amendment right to walk to a monument that you helped build,"" asked South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, ""or is it only just smoking pot at McPherson Square?"" Within hours, Gowdy and Issa would join their fellow House Republicans for a short meeting. House Speaker John Boehner would admit defeat. But some Republicans were declaring a victory of sorts--maybe not now, but down the road--for what the media had already judged to be a historic debacle. They had revealed President Obama to be a cynical political operator. They had proved to voters that they did everything they could to stop Obamacare. When the next spending fight comes around, they insisted that enduring this shutdown would strengthen their position. ""It depends on whether or not we're able to articulate why we did what we did,"" said South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a conservative who voted against Boehner for speaker but sings hosannas for him now. ""We believe we did it for the right reasons. We believe it was good policy. We believe good policy makes good politics. But we have to be able to explain that policy in order to accomplish it. I did an interview with a local radio station back home a week ago, and it started with them saying it was 'just seven days until default.' That was an indication that our message was not getting out."" Human beings have been putting their best spin on defeats since the invention of ""winning"" and ""losing."" Obviously, the many Republicans who don't want to trash their colleagues on the record are going to look for the Alamo underneath the rubble of this loss. But this shutdown had meant a lot to the party. Only a few dozen current members of the GOP conference had endured the last shutdown in 1995-1996. Those who hadn't--and some of those who had--have insisted for years that it was not truly a defeat for the party. In his 1998 memoir, Newt Gingrich blamed the media for making that shutdown a ""story of Republican heartlessness."" By 2010, when he reminisced about the shutdown, Gingrich argued that its real lesson was that his GOP had held onto the House in 1996 and balanced the budget--and that if the GOP shut down the government to stop Obamacare, the country would rally to the cause. As dealmania spread across the Capitol on Wednesday, this spin remained battered but alive. ""I haven't been home now for close to a month, and so it's not an easy venture all the way across the board,"" said Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon, a class of 1994 Republican who returned to Congress this year after a decade in retirement. ""As we saw last time, in 1996, we had the last government shutdown, 20-some days, and just a couple of years later we did the unimaginable: We balanced the budget for the first time in 40 years. We got through some of the most meaningful welfare reform that this country never believed was possible. I think part of it is that when both sides see that you're actually willing to stand and fight on principle, it changes the dynamic. It's not evident right now, but I think it will be."" According to Salmon, shutting down the government for more than two weeks probably proved to most people that the feds could do more with less. ""Most Americans probably thought, 'Wait a minute, I thought this was supposed to be cataclysmic.' Like with sequestration--we were told the sun wouldn't come out the next morning, and it did. It was much ado about not a lot,"" Salmon said. When it hurt, it was because President Obama wanted it to hurt. ""We don't think like that. We don't shut down monuments to make a shutdown as painful as possible."" Salmon was one of a half-dozen conservatives who met to talk this over at an on-the-record Wednesday panel sponsored by the Heritage Foundation. As the audience chowed on Chick-fil-A, conservatives denounced any suggestion that the party had been weakened by the shutdown. Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador's main quibble with the party's strategy--apart from all the weak-kneed members trashing their colleagues--was that it didn't raise the debt limit while continuing to debate the continuing resolution, a ploy that would have lengthened the shutdown. ""I actually think we wouldn't have been able to highlight the mistakes of the [healthcare.gov] rollout without the government shutdown,"" said Labrador. ""Every major newspaper would have relegated it to A7 or A8. Now it's on the front page of every newspaper."" Even outside the Chick-fil-A chamber, Republicans were full of reasons why the shutdown hadn't hurt. Arizona Rep. David Schweikert tore into one reporter's question about the ""polls"" showing the GOP's reputation falling. ""Did you look at the samples?"" asked Schweikert. After the reporter slumped away, Schweikert told me that the media's polls missed the target. ""We were in the field last week doing some polling,"" he said. ""I think the left and some of the media supporters on the left are going to be shocked when they look at these underlying numbers--the margin against the health care law among swing voters. The left hates me--the left has always hated me!--the right is with me, and the swing voters are moving. There was some amazing data in there."" Does this mean that Republicans would enter into another shutdown standoff with no fear? That's not how they look at it. They view any attempt to blame them for the shutdown, and not the president, as media bias in concentrate. This shutdown proved them right, and they'll carry that knowledge into the budget battle. ""I think this exposed the president and made clear to the public that he's unwilling to compromise,"" said Michigan Rep. Justin Amash. ""There's going to be a lot of focus over the next few months about the failures of Obamacare. It'll help Republicans because we stood up and fought--and there's nobody who can blame Republicans, at this point, for Obamacare. We did what we could.""

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/congress_still_deadlocked_ahead_of_debt_limit_deadline_can_republicans_and.html	"It's easy to forget, what with the exciting minute-to-minute details of who will be denied health care in order to fund the government, but the lurching, teetering, drunken movement in Washington really does suggest there'll be some sort of deal. The latest versions of this deal provide some buffer room--until Dec. 15, in the new House bill--when the government will operate and the debt limit will be redrawn. This compromise is supposed to buy time for Congress to work out an actual budget agreement, in a conference committee, the way God and the founders intended. The sentiment is universal. ""I want a budget agreement,"" wrote Rep. Paul Ryan in the Wall Street Journal column that re-established him (in the punditocracy's view, anyway) as the sane Republican dealmaker. ""When this shutdown does come to an end, as Senate Budget Committee chair I will be ready and willing to negotiate a long-term budget plan and end these constant crises,"" wrote Sen. Patty Murray in a less-noticed Seattle Times column. Hang on--hasn't Congress already failed in spectacular fashion, under extraordinary conditions, to do anything like this? Yes, it has. The Great Debt Limit War of 2011, or Debt War I, ended with the Budget Control Act that we're still living under. It created a ""supercommittee"" (not the official term, but the annoying one that stuck) empowered to craft a long-term spending deal as long as it reduced the deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. If it failed, there was a ""trigger""--$1.2 trillion would be automatically cut in ""sequestration."" The theory: Automatic cuts would terrify Congress into fixing the debt with a plan that could pass easily under special rules. It did fail. When you bring up the supercommittee now, to the unlucky senators and members of Congress who were part of it, they give you a look like you've discovered the yearbook photo of him or her before the perm set in. ""Don't talk about triggers, now!"" said Rep. Jim Clyburn, one of the old supercommittee's Democratic wise men. ""You're comparing the budget conference to the supercommittee?"" said Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, when asked how a fall/winter budget conference would work if the triggers didn't. ""I don't think anybody knows the answer to that question definitively. Maybe one would hope that after an experience like the one we're going through, it might lead to a different outcome, but there's no assurance. You know--maybe the disruptive nature that's inherent to a shutdown changes things."" There was a reason for the supercommittee, the same reason that prevented a budget conference all year. Republicans realized that they could never get the main goals of their budget--repeal of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare privatization--through a bipartisan committee. Their budget reduced $4.6 trillion in spending over 10 years by locking in those changes, and a series of other cuts, and general guesswork about how much tax reform could save. The Senate Democrats' budget did none of that, raised taxes, and reduced $1.85 trillion. ""Why we're here, primarily, is that the appropriations process broke down and we're working on different numbers,"" said Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, one of the party's Senate spending hawks and anti-Keynesians. ""If we were working on the same number, we wouldn't be here today. I said that to the president when he had [senators] up to the White House last week. He didn't agree on the number, but he agreed on that."" Shelby sounded less confident that the pain of sequestration and shutdown would force real bargains. ""It's punting, to use a metaphor from football,"" he said, swinging his leg to fully illustrate his point. ""No one, Democrats or Republicans, wants to face up to the tough reality. If we could ever do this, and keep sequestration, we'd be on the right road. The road of pain, but the right road economically and financially."" ""We're on an unsustainable fiscal path here,"" added Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. ""The sequester, as bad as that is in terms of policy, not actually making Congress do the hard work of prioritizing spending, has at least added some fiscal discipline."" That's getting into one of the ironies of the impasse. The 2011 debt deal and the 2012/2013 ""fiscal cliff"" punt did cut spending and raise some taxes. The economy grew. The ""trillion dollar deficits"" of 2011 have plunged. (That was one reason why the debt limit apocalypse, originally expected for early summer, fell back to October.) ""That helps us make the numbers work,"" said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons. ""The deficit's falling. There are changes in assumptions because the rate of growth in health care costs is at a 40-year low. Now, hopefully, we won't be going to a negotiating table after default which would push us back into a recession and pushing these numbers back up."" Democrats had sort of hoped this would happen--they didn't want a shutdown, obviously, but they preferred a short-term disaster that scared people straight to the market/credit crisis of a debt limit standoff. Coons thinks sequestration still could move the parties closer to a deal. ""We have lived with it,"" he said. ""All of us have federal agencies, communities--everything from parents of kids with cancer to schoolteachers to veterans who are calling in and meeting with us and saying the effects of sequestration are reckless and thoughtless."" ""I don't think any of us want to go through this again,"" said Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. ""That's on the side of sanity. That's what's new. None of us want to do it again--well, maybe I shouldn't say that. Maybe the Tea Party wants to go through it again. Maybe they want to do it every month."" Certainly, none of them would admit it. On Monday, before more panic set in, a reporter told Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions that the current crisis might end in a budget conference. ""You think it might happen?"" joked Sessions, the ranking member of the budget committee. ""Would that be a victory for you guys?"" asked the reporter. Sessions didn't miss a beat. ""Unless the Senate budget passes,"" he said. ""It spends a trillion dollars more than the [Budget Control Act]."" Read more of Slate's coverage of the debt ceiling negotiations."	The Silver Lining: Congress May Be Running Out of Ways to Fail	['Paul', 'McCaskill', 'Coons', 'Murray', 'Shelby']	['god']

Around 10 a.m., when the meeting ended, Republicans had little good to say about the latest offers from the president and the Senate. Most of them avoided the cameras and returned to their offices. A handful of members spun out of the room and headed to the park on the west of the Capitol, just a couple hundred feet away. They found sanctuary inside a small, triangle-shaped clearing blocked off by portable fences. Tea Party Patriots and FreedomWorks, two of the movement's oldest organizing forces, had asked activists to help ""fix up D.C."" by filling in for the furloughed custodians of the national mall. Glenn Beck, who's been paid at least $1 million to work with FreedomWorks, had flown in to lead the clean-up. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, one of the capos of the ""defund Obamacare"" campaign, was his co-star. A hundred or so people gathered around the fences, snapping photos and listening to members of Congress update Lee and Beck. ""We were told in conference that the president wants to use the Senate to break Republicans,"" Rep. Michele Bachmann told Lee. Lee explained that some silly Republicans were already willing to try to cut a deal with Obama--""trust us this time."" Beck sketched out his speech and smiled for photos with Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, who'd come wearing jeans and a green trucker's hat that read, ""VOLUNTEER."" None of them got any privacy to strategize until FreedomWorks' outreach director Deneen Borelli stepped up to a microphone to address the crowd, the noise drowning out everything else. ""Today brings back great memories for me,"" she said, ""because four years ago FreedomWorks had the amazing march on D.C.--9/12. And that event drew over 800,000 freedom-loving Americans. Because of that rally I was launched as a national figure to stand for liberty."" Anyone not at this rally would have been confused. Was Borelli, the author of Blacklash: How Obama and the Left Are Driving Americans to the Government Plantation, a ""national figure?"" Was it the best idea to invoke the heyday of the Tea Party, when scores more people could have flooded the space around the Capitol? Two weeks into the shutdown, Sen. Ted Cruz's ""grassroots tsunami"" to defund Obamacare hasn't materialized. Polling suggests that the Republican position is waning from week to week. The activists simply don't believe it. Washington was occupied all weekend by conservatives who insisted that the shutdown was an act of malice by President Obama, exemplified by the closure of national monuments. ""Truckers for the Constitution,"" a group of conspiracy theorists who occasionally appear on Fox News, won a mind-blowing amount of media attention for an attempt to ""shut down the Beltway"" with their several-dozen trucks. The Values Voter Summit, an annual meeting of social conservatives, made light of the shutdown by putting barricades on its stage--a reminder of the haphazardly enforced gates in front of monuments on the National Mall. The Washington Examiner, a magazine that recently reduced its local reporting staff to focus on politics, told readers that an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showing the GOP badly losing was skewed toward government workers. That made it ""all but useless as support for strategic decisions by anybody involved in the shutdown debate,"" but ""perfectly consistent with the conventional wisdom of the traditional media."" ""I haven't seen much public reaction except people criticizing the administration,"" said Regis Campbell, a Maryland activist who'd bought two rakes to the clean-up rally. ""Sure, the polls do say people blame Republicans, but I don't know--I think when push comes to shove, people will realize where the blame really lies. All [Obama] has to do is come down with an executive order to stop the mandate, OK? Then we could give him a clean CR."" ""It's fascinating,"" said Pat Jakowski, a Maryland physical therapist who brought a garbage-picking wand to the Saturday rally. ""If you really look at the demographics of the polls, you can see how easily they skew them. It's another misleading source of information. The intelligent people who really pay attention to information can't count on that."" Beck's speech tested the theory. The former Fox News host, who now runs a subscription-based online news channel, regaled the crowd with the story of anti-slavery Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner. ""He was, I think, the Ted Cruz or Mike Lee or Rand Paul of his day,"" said Beck. ""The most hated Whig! He was the guy who was kind of really leading the Whig Party. There were only 20 of them, but they were tired of the lies. They knew the Whig Party was playing around with slavery, but it was time for slavery to end."" Sumner, according to Beck, was hated because he proved how phony the rest of his party was when it pretended to oppose a law, and that his Whigs needed to be replaced by a new, honest party. ""When Charles Sumner was on the floor of the Senate, a guy came from the House of Representatives came in with a big cane and beat him almost to death. Almost killed him! Nobody helped him--the only reason he survived was that he was able to drag himself underneath his desk. It took him two years to heal. They never prosecuted the guy with the cane, because he was popular. He was in a special, protected class!"" Beck got the caning right, but basically nothing else. By 1856, when Sumner was caned, the senator was already aligned with the new Republicans. Rep. Preston Brooks--the congressman who delivered the caning--was a Southern Democrat, not an angry Whig punishing Sumner for making the party look bad. He resigned after a failed vote to expel him from Congress, and he was fined $300--not the punishment he deserved, obviously, but a fluke of his support from the South, not a protection racket by the elites. Details, details--Beck's tailored history was much more inspiring than the truth. After he wrapped, the conservatives fanned out to clean the mall; dozens followed behind Beck to watch him work, share their stories, or join him in picking up a few cigarette butts and tossing them in garbage bags. After a few blocks, Beck reached one of the useless gates, warning passersby that the mall was closed. ""He's going to flagrantly defy the law!"" laughed a cameraman. Beck cartoonishly ""sneaked"" around the fence in the manner of Bugs Bunny coming up behind Elmer Fudd. His reward on the other side: A garbage can where one of the ""DO NOT ENTER"" signs had been junked. ""That's too good,"" said Beck. ""We've got to keep that for the museum."" The clean-up went on for hours. If you stood anywhere on the mall between the Capitol and the World War II Memorial, you'd see a conservative activist, or two or three, hunting for garbage on wet grass. It wasn't cynical for them. The media was cynical. The Republicans who trusted the media were cynical. When Beck wrapped up at the World War II Memorial (""humbling to meet our veterans""), he zoomed up Connecticut Avenue to the Values Voter Summit. ""You're on the verge of winning,"" he told conservatives and C-Span cameras. ""It's going to happen quickly if you don't compromise your values--if you stay the course."" After Beck left, I stuck around the summit for some conversation and a couple of closing breakout sessions. With the cameras off, the optimism about defunding Obamacare this year faded. ""John Boehner's primary fear is the media,"" said Terry Jeffrey, a conservative journalist who now edits the Media Research Center's news arm. ""He doesn't believe he can win with a conservative message in media."" ""The inside game has failed,"" said Dean Clancy, vice president for policy at FreedomWorks. If Republicans couldn't be trusted to fight, conservatives needed to get 34 states to launch a new constitutional convention and undo the damage of the Progressive era. ""We ought to look at the other way of amending the Constitution, and that's the Article V process. I think Mark Levin is right. I think George Mason and the founders put that in there for a reason. It's an 'in case of emergency, break glass' provision."" Jeffrey agreed with that. ""We are going to have to engage in organized, peaceful disobedience,"" he said. On Sunday, the conservative movement did just that. Lee returned to the mall alongside Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin, and hundreds of activists who swore to ""storm"" the World War II memorial and liberate it from the ""Barrycades."" Activists picked up the hated gates and dumped them as close as they could get to the White House, a few blocks away. ""This belongs to you!"" thundered Lee at the memorial. ""This does not belong to the government--this belongs to the people!"" ""Is this any way that a commander-in-chief would show his respect, his gratitude, for our military?"" asked Palin. In the conservative new media, and among House Republicans, the protest was a powerful success--a game-changer even. ""The press will try to keep today's events secret, but I doubt whether they can succeed,"" wrote Power Line, the blog that became famous in 2004 for breaking and aggregating news about Dan Rather's botched story on George W. Bush's National Guard service. ""Time will tell, but this seems like the sort of revelatory moment that will reverberate and gain force with time."" And if it doesn't? Conservatives have a long, long list of the people they're ready to blame. Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the government shutdown."

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/paul_ryan_ted_cruz_and_the_government_shutdown_can_the_wisconsin_congressman.html	"Sen. John McCain says the Obamacare defund detour may hurt the Republican Party for years to come. The polls show that the damage from the government shutdown has certainly been acute. The Gallup poll that tracks the approval rating of Republicans in Congress looks like the bend of a hockey stick. At 28 percent approval, it is the lowest since the organization started measuring and down 10 points from last month. The Wall Street Journal poll has an identical finding: The GOP has never been less popular. By a margin of 22 points, the public blames Republicans over President Obama for the government shutdown, a bigger gap than the last major shutdown in the mid-1990s. Seventy percent say that Republicans are putting their ""political agenda"" ahead of the good of the country. Whether this is a permanent condition or a temporary one depends on getting Sen. Ted Cruz off the stage and Rep. Paul Ryan on--substituting a bristly champion of an unpopular strategy that divides the party with a congenial representative of the GOP's traditional views on taxing and spending. That's why House Republican leaders are trying to craft a deal with the White House to reopen government and start budget negotiations where House Budget Committee Chairman Ryan will be the key player. Overnight Thursday White House staffers worked with their House counterparts to find a way to give Republicans cover to reopen the government while not making it look like the president had given in to their demands. House Republicans need some kind of ""win"" to take to their constituents to prove that this battle wasn't pointless. On Friday, the president met with Senate Republicans to discuss their plans to return the government to full operations. There is obviously a premium for Republicans getting something from the White House related to Obamacare, but for now the White House isn't offering much. Obama's negotiators probably won't concede anything other than a promise to talk about the health care plan until after the spigot funding government is turned back on. This debate on sequencing is akin to the debate over the shape of the negotiating table that precedes the debate over what's on that table. Whatever deal allows the larger budget talks to begin will further mark the end of the Obamacare push. Even an agreement to remove the medical devices tax used to fund the Affordable Care Act--an item Sen. Susan Collins is asking for in her proposal to end the partial government shutdown--is a tinkering within the framework of the law that accepts the reality that the larger law is here to stay. Agreeing on the conditions to end the shutdown is not a small hurdle, but once it is cleared, the GOP has a chance to start healing. That's where Ryan can come into the spotlight. He will be at the center of negotiations over spending and taxes, issues where the GOP has a better case than the one it had over defunding Obamacare. As one of the authors of the current calamity, Cruz will have no formal role in the next stage. And his colleagues are eager to push him under the rug to show that he doesn't define the party. They have plenty of ammunition. It's not just that his Obamacare misadventure has tanked the party's popularity. It also has failed to change opinions about Obamacare, except to marginally improve them. In the latest Wall Street Journal poll, public attitudes about the legislation appear unmoved. Forty-three percent think it's a bad idea, and 38 percent think it's a good idea. That's about where those numbers stood three years ago. To the extent they have shifted recently, the movement is not in Cruz's favor. Those who strongly support the law are up to 31 percent from 24 percent. The number of Americans who oppose defunding Obamacare has increased from 44 percent to 50 percent in the past month. Cruz predicted a tsunami of grassroots support. It has not materialized. Forty-four percent of the country doesn't know who Cruz is, so it's too soon to talk about the Cruz Curse. But he causes upset and infighting within his own party. Ryan doesn't. Indeed, there are also lots of inside-game reasons Ryan is a good choice to take the lead. He is trusted by both conservatives and establishment types. Though Ryan's op-ed in the Wall Street Journal signaled the final step in the GOP's movement away from the crusade to defund Obamacare, Ryan nevertheless has credibility on the issue. Ryan voted against the Simpson-Bowles commission because it did nothing about Obamacare. He'll need all the credibility he can muster since there's likely to be a lot of grassroots disappointment with whatever deal is struck with President Obama. When Cruz faced criticism during the shutdown fight, many lawmakers who disliked Obamacare were uncomfortable defending his strategy--because they thought it was nuts. (Some saw him sinking and just wanted to throw him an anvil.) If Ryan gets in hot water in debates with the White House, Republicans will rush to his defense. They know the language of the fight: taxes bad, spending cuts good. Ryan operates within predictable guidelines, and he's worked tirelessly to implement conservative ideas while showing he puts party first. (He did run with Mitt Romney after all.) He's the kind of team player Cruz is not. Ryan can help the Republican Party with its political problems and its unity problems, but his involvement in larger budget talks doesn't mean they'll be successful. (This is similar to the savior role he played in the Romney campaign. Great news for the base, but that's it.) Ryan has a fine personal relationship with Sen. Patty Murray, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, but they've never really negotiated anything together, and they are far apart on the substance. Ryan's highly partisan convention speech undoubtedly torched any goodwill he may have had with Democrats. During the general election, Ryan's presence inadvertently helped Democrats turn out their voters in his home state of Wisconsin. His approval rating isn't very strong, which will limit his ability to set the terms of any national debate in a faceoff with the president. In a March Rasmussen poll, Ryan's favorable rating was 35 percent, and his unfavorable rating was 54 percent. The biggest impediment to success, however, is that both sides are still just as far apart as ever on taxes and spending. To remind you of the essential fix: The White House is reluctant to embrace benefit cuts to entitlements unless Republicans contribute to shrinking the deficit by allowing some tax hikes. Republicans don't want to agree to raise taxes unless the president embraces big spending cuts on entitlements. It's instructive to look back at this summer's so-called Diners Club--a series of informal meetings between Republican senators and the president's senior aides--where even under the best circumstances the two sides could not cross these familiar bridges. In Cruz the White House got a foil that it never really had in House Speaker John Boehner. ""Every day I imagine the president wakes up and thanks God for Ted Cruz,"" said one GOP senator. For the party to recoup and rejoin, it needs a healer. That's a process Paul Ryan can guide. But given how far apart Republicans and Democrats still are, there's little reason to hope for much more.

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/house_republicans_the_hell_no_caucus_and_moderates_which_house_gop_members.html	"Earlier this week, after the morning meeting of House Republicans, I found myself deep in a three-way conversation with California Rep. Tom McClintock and another reporter. The reporter's questions were well-researched and dogged, ranging from previous House offers to entitlement reform to what ""default"" really meant for what the Senate might do next. McClintock, a former candidate for governor of California, has plenty of question-dodging experience and proved to be a master evader, turning every question back to how ""the House and the Senate are designed to come to independent judgments."" It felt a little useless, but I didn't realize how useless it must have been to my colleague until McClintock left. At that moment the reporter who'd just pressed this congressman with at least 11 questions turned to me and asked: ""Who was that?"" I tell this story not to disparage someone. Days earlier, I'd asked a colleague the exact same question after quizzing a white-haired, middle-aged Republican congressman with a Southern accent. (Hello, Rep. Mo Brooks.) The current House Republican majority, the 232 people who run half the Congress, is mostly male, mostly middle-aged, and mostly white, making it sometimes impossibly hard to differentiate one member from another. That is one of the many reasons that the press corps--and readers, surely--have so much trouble identifying who really matters as the shutdown drags on. The Atlantic tried to identify ""32 Republicans who caused the shutdown,"" admitted it wasn't ""a comprehensive roll,"" and then came back with a viral feature that has influenced how thousands of Facebook-using liberals now view the crisis. The Washington Examiner's Byron York confidently cited ""insiders"" who insist that ""about 30 House Republicans"" backed the party into the defund Obamacare cul-de-sac. The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza identified the 80 signatories of Rep. Mark Meadows' defund-Obamacare letter as the ""suicide caucus."" In an interview with Barney Frank, the New Republic referred to the holdouts in Congress as ""these faceless Republicans,"" and you can see why--no one even knows which faces to look for. But we can try. There's no easy way to accurately denote the unbending conservatives and the moderates in the House GOP. The ""Tea Party caucus,"" often cited as a guide to the party's right wing, largely existed to rebrand Republicans who weren't really members of the movement. Much more useful: the Republican Study Committee, which consists of 164 dues-paying (literally) conservatives, and the Washington Post's Chris Cillizza's ""complete guide to understanding"" House Republicans. Cillizza put Republicans into five groups, related to their votes on six bills: the fiscal cliff compromise of 2011, the 2013 vote for speaker, the Hurricane Sandy relief bill, the January 2013 debt-limit delay, the Violence Against Women Act, and the farm bill. Listed below are some of the key votes and stances that have identified the most hard-core Republicans. If a Republican is on this list, or voted against leadership on one of Cillizza's items, assign a point. (I'm repeating two of Cillizza's items, with a different emphasis.) Speaker Boehner. On Jan. 3, 2013, 12 Republicans made their rebellious nature known by casting votes, in vain, against the party's speaker. Which Republicans? Justin Amash (Mich.), Jim Bridenstine (Okla.), Paul Broun (Ga.), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Raul Labrador (Idaho), Tom Massie (Ky.), Mick Mulvaney (S.C.), Steve Pearce (N.M.), Steve Stockman (Texas), and Ted Yoho (Fla.). No Budget, No Pay. On Jan. 23, House Republican leaders delayed the debt limit deadline by agreeing to lift it for most of the year as long as the Senate agreed to vote for a budget. Who voted for it? 199 Republicans and 86 Democrats. Who voted against it? 33 Republicans and 111 Democrats. Which Republicans? Justin Amash (Mich.), Michele Bachmann (Minn.), Jim Bridenstine (Okla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Paul Broun (Ga.), Doug Collins (Ga.), Scott DesJarlais (Tenn.), John Duncan (Tenn.), Phil Gingrey (Ga.), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Joe Heck (Nev.), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Richard Hudson (N.C.), Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Peter King (N.Y.), Steve King (Iowa), Tom Massie (Ky.), Tom McClintock (Calif.), Markwayne Mullin (Okla.), Randy Neugebauer (Texas), Steve Pearce (N.M.), Tom Petrie (Wis.), Ted Poe (Texas), Bill Posey (Fla.), Dana Rohrabacher (Calif.), Matt Salmon (Ariz.), Jim Sensenbrenner (Wis.), Steve Stockman (Texas), Mike Turner (Ohio), Roger Williams (Texas), and Ted Yoho (Fla.). The Farm Bill. On June 20, House Republicans brought down their own farm bill--one that had been amended to cut food stamps--with 62 members voting no. On July 11, Republicans split the bill and passed only the farm aid component, losing 12 members anyway. Which Republicans? Justin Amash (Mich.), Paul Cook (Calif.), Ron DeSantis (Fla.), John Duncan (Tenn.), Trent Franks (Ariz.), Phil Gingrey (Ga.), Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Frank LoBiondo (N.J.), Tom McClintock (Calif.), Mark Sanford (S.C.), and Matt Salmon (Ariz.). Defund Obamacare Act of 2013. On July 11, Georgia Rep. Tom Graves introduced the bill that would bar funds for the health care law--the bill that became the basis of the continuing resolution defunding Obamacare. Who signed it? 155 Republicans--most of the conference. But more importantly, 75 of these people signed the Mark Meadows letter. OK, which Republicans did both? Justin Amash (Mich.), Michele Bachmann (Minn.), Andy Barr (Ky.), Joe Barton (Texas), Dan Benishek (Mich.), Kerry Bentivolio (Mich.), Gus Bilrakis (Fla.), Rob Bishop (Utah), Jim Bridenstine (Okla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Paul Broun (Ga.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Steve Chabot (Ohio), Doug Collins (Ga.), Mike Conaway (Texas), Rick Crawford (Ariz.), Steve Daines (Mon.), Ron DeSantis (Fla.), Jeff Duncan (S.C.), Blake Farenthold (Texas), Chuck Fleischmann (Tenn.), John Fleming (La.), Bill Flores (Texas), Trent Franks (Ariz.), Phil Gingrey (Ga.), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Tom Graves (Ga.), Tim Griffin (Ark.), Ralph Hall (Texas), George Holding (N.C.), Richard Hudson (N.C.), Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), Bill Huizenga (Mich.), Randy Hultgren (Ill.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Steve King (Iowa), Jack Kingston (Ga.), Raul Labrador (Idaho), Doug LaMalfa (Calif.), Doug Lamborn (Colo.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Kenny Marchant (Texas), Tom Marino (Pa.), Tom Massie (Ky.), Mark Meadows (N.C.), Tom McClintock (Calif.), Luke Messer (Ind.), Mick Mulvaney (S.C.), Randy Neugebauer (Texas), Steven Palazzo (Mich.), Steve Pearce (N.M.), Scott Perry (Pa.), Ted Poe (Texas), Mike Pompeo (Kan.), Bill Posey (Fla.), Phil Roe (Tenn.), Todd Rokita (Ind.), Keith Rothfus (Pa.), Matt Salmon (Ariz.), Steve Scalise (La.), David Schweikert (Ariz.), Jason Smith (Mo.), Steve Stockman (Texas), Marlin Stutzman (Ind.), Tim Walberg (Mich.), Jackie Walorski (Ind.), Randy Weber (Texas), Brad Wenstrup (Ohio), Joe Wilson (S.C.), and Ted Yoho (Fla.).* So, what have we learned from these ugly blocks of text? - There's a small group of a dozen Republicans who will always vote against the leadership, often enough to make the votes tight--but not enough to defeat them. After Cillizza, let's call them the ""Hell No"" caucus, and agree that when Reps. Ted Yoho or Justin Amash announce their opposition to something, the leadership doesn't care. - There's a larger group, about 60 Republicans, who'll vote for a deal if needed, but will take every possible on-the-record stance against compromise. Call them the Heritage Action caucus, if that doesn't cause any trademark issues. - There really are more than 75 Republicans who have not signed on to any showpiece conservative bills or petitions, and a smaller number who vote with the leadership at all times. When New York Rep. Peter King appears on TV and swears that he has dozens of moderates ready to bolt and vote for a ""clean CR,"" he's not wrong about the numbers--only about the motivations. It's the Invisible Caucus, suburbanites with statewide dreams (Pennsylvania Rep. Jim Gerlach), committee chairmen who want to actually achieve things (Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers), and Boehner allies who do not fear primaries (Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson). You could draw up a similar guide for Democrats, but it wouldn't be as complicated. Only five House Democrats represent districts carried by Mitt Romney in 2012. Only five declined to sign a letter from Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi pledging to support a ""clean"" continuing resolution--three from that first group, plus the budget hawks Reps. Ron Kind and Jim Cooper. The Republican conference can show that sort of unity, too, and it has on all of the gimmicky bills produced during the shutdown. Republicans like King have lambasted the Gohmerts of their party, then voted with them. That isn't because there's a secret cabal of 30 conservatives holding the party hostage. It's because most of the members are conservatives, and they're more responsive to movement activists than to anyone in ""the business community."" If you followed the ""defund Obamacare"" movement through the various profiles of a star, like Sen. Ted Cruz, you might have assumed that his crushing defeat would end the standoff. It didn't. Whether the standoff ends is up to the anonymous likes of Reps. Chuck Fleischmann or Luke Messer, people that Jack Lew probably couldn't pick out of a lineup. *Correction, Oct. 17, 2013: This article misidentified Rep. Tim Griffin as an Arizona congressman.

You could call it Press Release-ese; actually, call it Flackspeak. After nearly every funding vote in the House of Representatives, the National Republican Congressional Committee has dashed off perfect Flackspeak prose to explain how devastating this vote was to various Democrats' chances of re-election. So we've heard a lot about Jim Himes. The 47-year old congressman, a former investment banker who won a third term last year, does not appear to be in any real danger. President Obama won his district with 55 percent of the vote; Himes ran five points ahead of the president. Himes's district, one of the last in the Northeast to swing to the Democrats, captures the country club-laden Connecticut suburbs just east of New York City--Stamford, Fairfield, Greenwich. Like all but five Democrats, he has signed a letter in support of a ""clean"" continuing resolution to fund the government, and like most, he has voted against the GOP's alternatives. This has unleashed a torrent from the NRCC's communications director, Andrea Bozek. After Himes voted against the GOP's penultimate offer before the shutdown, Bozek told us that ""Jim Himes' disgraceful vote proves just how out of touch he truly is,"" and ""Instead of fighting for families, he voted to protect ObamaCare's exemptions for Congress and unfair delay for big business."" After Himes voted against a ""mini-CR"" to open national parks: ""It's disgraceful that Jim Himes would put President Obama's government shutdown ahead of our nation's veterans. Jim Himes is so blinded by his loyalty to Obama, he's willing to halt veterans' pay and keep our nation's bravest from visiting their memorials."" After Himes voted to fund back pay for furloughed workers, then against a mini-CR for the National Institutes of Health: ""Why is Jim Himes putting federal workers' pay ahead of funding for vital government programs like cancer research? Connecticut families are struggling to understand why Himes can't be bothered to help cancer patients, low income families, and veterans, yet he will rush to ensure that federal workers are taken care of."" After he voted against another rabbit-from-the-hat plan to send House negotiators to talk to Democrats in the Senate: ""Connecticut voters know that we simply cannot spend more money than we take in. Instead of sitting down with Republicans and working toward a solution to our fiscal crisis, Himes is keeping the government shut down and continuing his pattern of reckless spending."" Congratulations: You may be the second person ever to read those quotes. The Stamford Advocate, which covers Himes, never mentioned the mini-CRs or the Republican attacks. Neither did the Greenwich Time, which never mentioned the NRCC until running a he-said, she-said Associated Press story about a Democratic group blaming Republicans for the shutdown. Himes and local papers have described the shutdown and its consequences as brought on by Republicans. On Tuesday, when Fox News' Sean Hannity tried the Republican line on Himes--""the NIH is being impacted, all of those things separately have been funded""--Himes called it ""total malarkey."" He has since been written up locally for scrapping with Hannity, not for any hypocrisy. Republicans desperately need that to change. The piecemeal strategy of the past week--the passage in the House of small bills to fund whatever closures are causing headline agita--is meant to tag Democrats now and in the 2014 elections. ""If there's no political heat, if there's no television story on it, then nothing happens,"" snarked President Obama on Tuesday. The Beltway press is skeptical; local reporters, alternating between different shutdown human-interest stories, are not devoting much time to bills of the day being thwarted in the Senate. Will the heroic mini-CRs and the Democrats' cowardly votes against children/troops/et al have more oomph in 2014? Assuming the shutdown does eventually end, and the government runs again after every member of Congress has cast some vote for or against funding, the piecemeal attacks will fly into the buzzsaw of the fact-checkers. ""You can't take a vote out of its political context and say it means something that it doesn't mean,"" says Angie Holan, the editor of PolitiFact. ""If someone voted against funding for Program X in one bill, and in another they voted for it, you can't say this vote against Program X means they hate Program X. We have always been very skeptical of political ads that cherry-pick votes."" But ad-makers--and I want to be as respectful as I can--do not always craft their art with an eye toward the fact-checkers. As every member of Congress knows, the Affordable Care Act shunted lawmakers and congressional staffers into health care exchanges because Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley thought this would embarrass Democrats. This made staffers and lawmakers the only people in America who worked for a large employer but were denied premium subsidies from said employer. After Congress and the president worked out a fix, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter introduced an amendment to nix the subsidies again, and other Republicans, such as Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, denounced the ""unlawful"" compromise. Cotton, now running for the U.S. Senate, made this the focus of his first campaign ad--the first Senate ad of 2014. Cotton's Democratic opponent, second-term Sen. Mark Pryor, hit back quickly with an ad shaming his opponent for fundraising with ""Texas fat cats"" and a press statement calling the ""goose and gander"" attack ""blatantly false."" Hours later, PolitiFact weighed in and denounced the ad as both false and--keeping with the excruciating animal theme--""fowl."" But perhaps we should be thankful that the Cotton campaign ran with this attack and not some version of ""Pryor voted to deface the coffins of veterans [by tabling a Republican bill and voting for a clean CR instead], and Arkansas wants to know why."" If this current trolling stage of the shutdown simply peters out as the House rallies behind a new plan, we should be grateful. There may be a few tricks voters still refuse to fall for. Congress will deploy them a few more times, just to make sure. Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the government shutdown."	Will Republicans Trolling the Shutdown Hurt Democrats in 2014?
