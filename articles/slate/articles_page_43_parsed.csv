The bulk of the speech was devoted to the opportunities and challenges that women of all classes face. But at the midpoint, she took a slight turn toward electoral politics. ""We need to get paid leave provisions on every state ballot by 2016 that we can possibly manage to do,"" said Clinton. ""[T]he lack of flexible and predictable work schedules, no paid family leave, very few affordable and reliable child care options--this is all part of a larger story about how hard it is today for families to hold together, hold together their lives, hold together a middle-class lifestyle. It can feel like pushing a boulder uphill every single day."" Now, compare this with Tuesday's State of the Union, where President Obama gave an assertive defense of Democratic Party liberalism and announced the party's agenda for the post-recession era. ""Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. ... Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home,"" he said, continuing on to a call for equal pay. ""[T]his Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work."" It's not that Obama is lifting from Clinton as much as they're both reading from the same playbook. The ""war on women"" of the 2012 and 2014 election cycles has morphed into an anti-inequality pitch centered on the economic concerns of women and families. And Tuesday night, President Obama brought the language to the national stage, elevating women's economic issues as a core priority of both Democrats and his administration. This is risky. If Clinton runs, Obama's standing will shape the structure of her campaign. If Obama is unpopular, then Clinton will have to run away from the president and present herself as a decisive break from a failed administration. But it's to her good fortune that Obama is relatively well-liked and should finish his term with decent approval ratings, if the economy continues on its present trajectory. In which case, the language of this year's State of the Union will form the core of Clinton's economic rhetoric--a way to frame the variety of Democratic proposals as tools for protecting the interests of women as workers (equal pay and the minimum wage), caregivers (child care tax credit), and as women (health care and reproductive rights). It also provides a useful way to talk about distribution: not as a grab from the successful, but as a way to give families a share in our growth. Of course, there's a political side here, and it's easy to see: Democrats want to solidify their advantage with single, working, and low-income women. A platform centered on their broad concerns--and not just reproductive health--stands to strengthen their ground and expand the appeal of the party. We shouldn't underestimate the electoral gains of winning more women's votes. Because of its terrible performance with minorities, the GOP needs to increase white turnout--and maximize its share of white voters--to win national elections. A Clinton who peels white women from the Republican coalition--even in small numbers--is a Clinton who does huge damage to GOP chances in critical states such as Florida, Virginia, and Ohio. Strong performance with white women could buoy Clinton against the drop-off among other demographic groups, like black Americans (although there's slim evidence that blacks will leave the electorate with Obama off the ballot). One big question is how Republicans respond to this female- and family-focused platform. In some ways, it's an opportunity. ""If you contrast what was on offer last night with some of the ideas that, say, Utah Senator Mike Lee has proposed,"" writes Ross Douthat for the New York Times, ""there's a very interesting right-left debate to be had around higher education reform, tax reform (family-friendly and otherwise), and other issues as well."" This isn't a vision for compromise as much as it's a starting point for conservatives who don't want to cede the ground of ""middle-class economics"" to Democrats. Then again, for as much as Republicans such as Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney have begun to treat inequality as a serious concern, it's also true that key parts of the GOP--and the congressional party in particular--are still stuck in a pose of constant opposition. Rather than build better policies, these Republicans might redouble their commitment to the present orthodoxy of deregulation and upper-income tax cuts. Indeed, this urge to stick to the script was on view in the Republican response to the State of the Union, helmed by Joni Ernst, the newly minted senator from Iowa:"	The Economic Concerns of Women Are Now the Economic Concerns of the Democratic Party	['Clinton', 'Obama', 'Romney', 'Ross']	[]
1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/barack_obama_s_state_of_the_union_tax_proposal_the_president_s_program_will.html	"The most notable Republican reaction to President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night did not come from official respondent Joni Ernst, the rookie senator from Red Oak, Iowa, with the camouflage high heels. It came from Mitt Romney, newly back in the fray as a possible presidential candidate for the third straight election. On his Facebook page, Romney countered Obama's speech by zeroing in on the president's proposal to pay for $235 billion in middle-class tax breaks, as well as new spending on education and infrastructure, by raising taxes on capital gains and inherited assets for the very wealthy by $320 billion. ""His tax proposal is a maze of new taxes and complexities,"" Romney wrote. ""The best way to lower the tax burden on all American families is straightforward: lower rates and simplify the tax code."" This reaction may seem entirely predictable--after all, Romney spent his entire 2012 presidential campaign calling for across-the-board tax cuts that independent analysts found would disproportionately benefit the top 5 percent of taxpayers. What's striking about Romney's reaction, though, is precisely that it is such a rehash of his 2012 stance at a time when he has been seeking to recast himself as a different sort of Republican, one far more concerned with poverty, inequality, and middle-class wage stagnation. At a GOP gathering last week in San Diego, Romney lamented that, ""Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are more people in poverty than ever before,"" and called for Republicans to tackle the ""scourge of poverty."" And it's not just Romney. A whole assortment of 2016 aspirants, including Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, as well as prominent congressional Republicans such as Rep. Paul Ryan and Utah Sen. Mike Lee, have been rushing to show their concern for the plight of the economically immobile and downtrodden. In essence, Republicans have responded to the increasing signs of a strong economic rebound under Obama by arguing that the rebound has failed to reach those lower down the economic ladder--a rather remarkable turning of the rhetorical tables by the party that in 2012 nominated a candidate who wrote off the bottom 47 percent of taxpayers. Some of these Republicans' proposals--to expand the earned income tax credit or child tax credit, for instance--hold real promise. But there is a big problem with this new anti-poverty, anti-inequality platform, one that gives all this new rhetoric an air of unreality: The party remains at its core committed to fighting solutions that would come at the expense of the very wealthiest Americans, even at a time when that upper-upper echelon is achieving truly historic levels of affluence. Just look at what has been the first order of business for Republicans after they won full control of Congress for the first time in eight years this past fall. It's not expanding the earned income tax credit, but rather pushing a Wall Street wish list for tweaks to weaken the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010. This will likely prove to be the primary achievement of Obama's new tax proposal, which, as he bluntly put it in Tuesday night's speech, is targeted at ""giveaways the superrich don't need"" and ""lobbyists [who] have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight."" No, it's not going anywhere in a GOP-led Congress. But it has served to call the bluff of the Republicans now claiming the mantle of inequality warriors. The proposal has led them into a political trap, prompting them into an instinctual, reflexive defense of the wealthiest Americans. And it has thereby clarified the discussions to come on the campaign trail over the next year and a half. Talk all you want about restoring shared prosperity, Obama is saying, but this is the kind of reform it will take to bring balance to an economy that has gotten so top-heavy and out of whack. The proposal will implicitly admonish not only Republicans but also Hillary Clinton, should her own Wall Street sympathies and upper-bracket aspirations keep her from adopting an aggressive platform to tackle inequality. Romney was hardly the only figure on the right being provoked into a clarifying response by Obama's speech and proposal. Jeb Bush declared on his own Facebook page that it was ""unfortunate President Obama wants to use the tax code to divide us--instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every American."" Then there was Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute analyst who has helped drive the latest legal challenge that threatens to upend Obamacare, who tweeted during the speech: It was a tart reaction, but also one that contained more candor than much of the talk of poverty and inequality amelioration now coming from top Republicans. These are the real stakes at play, Cannon and Obama both recognize, and they haven't changed just because Romney and a handful of GOP presidential hopefuls have decided it's time to show a new, more caring face.

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/barack_obama_s_state_of_the_union_address_the_president_offered_a_vision.html	"If you only judged by the pomp and circumstance of the event, you'd assume that the State of the Union address was a singular product of the president and his administration, a bold statement of his priorities, his goals, and his agenda. And this is partly true. The speech President Obama gave Tuesday night was likely different from the one a President Hillary Clinton would have given if she were elected in 2008. At the same time, this agenda isn't formed in a vacuum; it's a collective affair, and specifically, a product of the party the president represents. The best way to understand the State of the Union, in other words, is as a statement in the constant conversation between the president and his party. In his sixth such address--as it's been since the beginning of his presidency--his message was as mediated by party debates as it was bounded by party limits. And if you want to see how the political and ideological limits of the Democratic Party have expanded since the 2012 election, just look at the scope of Obama's rhetoric. Following the path paved by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren--who has captured the energy of the Democratic grass roots--Obama has offered a muscular defense of the party's liberalism and the programs it has produced. ""[A]t every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot,"" said Obama, detailing his vision for a ""middle-class economics."" ""We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet--tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them,"" he continued. His vision--and thus the Democratic Party's--is to expand this even further with a new set of policies, ranging from free community college and a continued commitment to universal health insurance, to child care subsidies, paid sick leave, equal pay for women, and a higher minimum wage. Indeed, this list stands as a direct answer to the core question of the political moment: How can our government deliver the gains of economic growth to ordinary people? It's worth noting that none of this is out of sync with the Democratic Party's agenda through the 20th century. In his own sixth-year State of the Union address, President Bill Clinton touted Social Security and proposed a tax credit for long-term care of the disabled. The difference is that Obama has almost abandoned the ""Third Way"" approach of his Democratic predecessor. Where Clinton proposed private accounts for Social Security, touted deficit reduction, and called for Congress to toughen its drug laws, Obama has pushed for infrastructure spending, ignored presidential ledger counting, and asked Congress to ""reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all."" If anything, Obama's confident, assertive liberalism is a return to the immediate postwar era, when Democratic governance was broadly popular and ascendant. ""I think everybody knows that social insurance and better schools and health services are not frills, but necessities in helping all Americans to be useful and productive citizens, who can contribute their full share in the national effort to protect and advance our way of life,"" said President Truman in his 1952 address, the sixth and final one of his presidency. The rhythm is different but the rhyme is the same: Government has a place in securing prosperity and protecting ordinary people. With that said, there are still limits to the scope of this new Democratic liberalism. Obama's speech was strong, but his agenda was relatively modest. Even if Congress adopted all of Obama's economic proposals, it would put just a small dent in the towering inequality that defines modern American life. Core problems of wage stagnation, social mobility, and retirement security remain unaddressed by most Democrats. Explicit redistribution for all Americans--of the kind we see in our entitlement programs--is still largely off the table. Policies that would unambiguously boost incomes--broader and higher subsidies in the Affordable Care Act, direct wage assistance, an expanded Social Security program for retirees--haven't reached the mainstream of the Democratic Party. But it's now clear, from this State of the Union to statements from key party elites, that inequality will stand as the main agenda item of the post-Obama Democratic Party. The questions now, and the ones Democrats will fight over in the coming presidential primaries, are of ambition. Are the modest policies of the late Obama administration enough? Or do we need something more drastic to bring our economy back into balance? See more of Slate's State of the Union coverage."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/joni_ernst_will_be_the_16th_woman_to_respond_to_the_state_of_the_union_female.html	"On Tuesday night, Sen. Joni Ernst will join a tiny but power-packed club. She'll be the 16th woman to deliver a response to the State of the Union, putting her in an elite group of women who have left a mark on history--or, in some cases, were forgotten by it. We haven't had a female president yet, but more than a dozen women have gone head to head with commanders in chief with these carefully scripted rejoinders. Some of these women are inspiring heroes. Others aren't. They are worth remembering because they show how much things have changed for female politicians--and also how much they haven't. Rep. Charlotte Reid, an Illinois Republican, made history in 1968 as the first woman to deliver a State of the Union response. She inadvertently garnered even more attention a year later by being the first woman to wear pants on the House floor. The Washington Post reported that many congressmen were gobsmacked and rushed to the floor to see if the rumors of a woman sporting a woolen bell-bottomed pantsuit were true. ""I was told there was a lady here in trousers, so I had to come over and see for myself,"" said one. Reid said she didn't get any criticism for her historic outfit and noted that then-Rep. Gerald Ford told her she should rock a pantsuit more often. But she didn't. ""I am really quite serious about my service in the Congress and I wouldn't want to do anything that seemed facetious,"" she said at the time. ""Neither would I want to do anything to take away from the femininity of the women in the House, even though I think pants are feminine-looking."" Her State of the Union response--which she presented along with more than a dozen other congressional Republicans--got less press and tougher reviews. A St. Petersburg Times editorial that ran on Jan. 25, 1968, called the Republicans' response ""political vaudeville."" ""Some performances were only in bad taste,"" it continued, ""such as Illinois Rep. Charlotte Reid figuratively wrapping herself in the American flag and waving the banner of motherhood, in an effort to discourage protest over Vietnam."" You'll find more reporting on Reid's historic pantsuit than her historic State of the Union response. Make of that what you will. Rep. Patsy Mink, a Hawaii Democrat whose time in the House overlapped with Reid's, joined six male colleagues to respond to Richard Nixon's 1970 State of the Union. Like Reid's, her speech seems to have garnered minimal coverage. The (Kingsport, Tennessee) Daily News reported that Mink and her fellow female House members made news more often just for doing lady stuff. Mink and Massachusetts Republican Margaret Heckler ""frequently show up on such lists as 'prettiest woman in the Capitol.' "" Heckler had a sense of humor about it. ""I suppose when compared to most of the men, I am among the prettiest congressmen,"" she said. ""But what does it all prove?"" Like Mink and Reid, Missouri Democratic Rep. Leonor Sullivan joined a host of colleagues to respond to Nixon's 1972 address. Again, Sullivan's response didn't earn headlines, likely because she had to share the stage with tons of dudes. A recent St. Louis Beacon story called her ""the Elizabeth Warren of her day,"" detailing her work on consumer protection issues and in food stamp policy. The passage of the Consumer Credit Protection Act was one of her biggest victories. Rep. Martha Griffiths of Michigan was also part of the gaggle of Democrats that responded to Nixon in 1972. Though little was reported on her talk, it was probably pretty good. Her bio page on the House's history, art, and archives site describes her as ""peppery and quick-witted. Her Los Angeles Times obituary notes that she once wrote a letter to an airline president whose company required flight attendants to be young and attractive, asking, ""Just exactly what are you running--an airline or a whorehouse?"" Griffiths was an outspoken advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment, and she fought to include sex discrimination in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. After 1972, women had a bit of a dry spell on State of the Union night. For Gerald Ford's and Jimmy Carter's presidencies, the multimember jumbo-respond-a-thons fell out of favor, and fewer responders meant no women. That changed in 1983, when Barbara Kennelly, a Connecticut congresswoman, was part of a 28-minute multimember prefilmed response to Ronald Reagan's State of the Union. An AP story about the speech noted that then-Sen. Joe Biden responded to the president's speech by saying, ""It's time we put up or shut up."" It sounds like Kennelly took a slightly wonkier approach; she talked about the Democrats' plan to require the Federal Reserve Board to automatically lower interest rates during times of inflation. When she wasn't talking about monetary policy, Kennelly didn't shy away from criticizing her own party. In a January 1983 Miami Herald story on the differences in voting patterns between men and women, Kennelly said Democrats needed to give more time to issues women cared about. ""It's a typical Democratic reaction of taking those they have in their corner for granted,"" she said. The year after that, then-Rep. Barbara Boxer of California joined a group of a dozen Democrats--also including Biden and Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill--to pile on Reagan's next State of the Union address. Boxer's moment didn't make for major national news, but it doesn't seem to have hurt her any. The tenacious liberal went on to win a Senate seat--one that she will retire from next year--and became a hero for supporters of abortion rights. It's doubtful her response was particularly acrimonious. When Reagan died in 2004, she issued an affecting tribute of the former president, writing that she keeps a picture in her home office from an evening she spent in the White House with him and his wife, Nancy. Missouri Lt. Gov. Harriett Woods was the last woman to go up against Reagan. She joined four other prominent Democrats to push back against the president, and per University of California-Santa Barbara's American Presidency Project, she's the only lieutenant governor (male or female) to deliver a response. The Democrats' response to the president's speech that year was tricky; the State of the Union had been postponed because of the deadly crash of the Challenger space shuttle, and Reagan had just given a historic speech on the tragedy. Woods' speech, which you can watch here (it starts at 9:30), took a nonpartisan, feel-good tone, and didn't even mention Reagan. But her political legacy was much harsher for Republicans. After almost beating conservative Republican incumbent Sen. John Danforth in a Senate race that shouldn't have been close, some of her allies started Emily's List, a group that backs pro-choice female Democratic candidates. Emily's List deserves significant credit for the fact that Democratic women outnumber Republican women by 14 to six in the Senate and 62 to 22 in the House (65 to 23 if you count delegates). Woods' role in inspiring the creation of Emily' List is part of the reason Democrats dramatically outpace Republicans in getting women elected. The first woman from either party to go solo responding to a State of the Union address was Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in 1995. She spoke to a raucous crowd in the Trenton, New Jersey, legislative chamber (also the first response given to a live audience) and described ""a revolution of ideas"" in favor of tax cuts and smaller government. She praised fellow Republican governors, and the room erupted in lengthy cheers and whistling when she mentioned her own New Jersey tax cuts. On the history of Republicans sometimes choosing a woman to respond to the State of Union, Whitman told the Los Angeles Times last year, ""It's hard for me to phrase this politely: Sometimes Republicans think that just putting a woman up front means somehow that women are going to feel good about the party."" She continued: ""It is not about the messenger. It's about the message. And until we figure that one out--while it's nice that we have a woman as a spokesperson--if the message itself doesn't get changed a bit, it's not going to work."" Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington in 1999 (with Oklahoma Rep. Steve Largent) and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in 2000 (with Tennessee's Sen. Bill Frist) were the next two women SOTU responders, both also following up Clinton. Their Washington careers suggest that the theory of a State of the Union responder curse--detailed exhaustively by Politico, Time, Salon, and plenty of other publications--is goofy nonsense. Dunn, who had already become the first woman on the House Republican leadership team, continued to exert substantial influence in Washington. And Collins coasted to easy re-election win after easy re-election win. Counterpoint on that SOTU curse, though: Then-Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius delivered the Democratic response to George W. Bush's 2008 address, and it didn't go so well. (Here's video.) She spoke in a soporific monotone and drew sneering from Jon Stewart. ""Wow, flat and boring,"" he said. ""What state is she governor of again?"" Sebelius' fame--or infamy--really skyrocketed when, as secretary of health and human services, she oversaw the notably awful rollout of healthcare.gov. Ultimately, she resigned. SOTU responders, beware (maybe). Nancy Pelosi, who needs little explanation, responded to two back-to-back Bush States of the Union, accompanied by then-Sen. Tom Daschle one year and Sen. Harry Reid the next. And in 2008, Texas state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte (who made an unsuccessful bid for Texas lieutenant governor in the 2014 midterms, alongside Wendy Davis) delivered Democrats' Spanish response. And finally, Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen teamed up to deliver, respectively, English- and Spanish-language responses to Obama's 2014 address. (Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American member from Florida, also gave a Spanish-language response in 2011.) McMorris Rodgers has dealt with some of the same nonsense that's been around since the days of Patsy Mink and Charlotte Reid. A few months ago the National Journal promoted a story on the congresswoman with a headline that blithely asked, ""Is Cathy McMorris Rodgers More Than a Token?"" And Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, per Roll Call, called the congresswoman ""a very pleasant person. ... She gives a good appearance [and] she speaks well,"" adding that he believed Republicans only picked her because they wanted to ""project some diversity."" Female privilege! Ernst has plenty of experience dealing with the same cheap digs. A few days before the midterm elections, retiring Sen. Tom Harkin said Iowans shouldn't care if Ernst was ""as good looking as Taylor Swift""--the suggestion being, of course, that women only rise to power and prominence because they're so dosh garn pretty. Even Emily's List made a similar jab, blasting out a press release about her coming SOTU response that dubbed her ""window dressing."" It's an age-old, bipartisan strategy for glossing over the accomplishments of women like McMorris Rodgers--a savvy politician who built a coalition of conservative and moderate Republicans to propel her ascension to House leadership--and Ernst, a combat veteran and the first woman to represent Iowa in the House or Senate. But if diversity gets projected--as Hoyer put it--and nobody hears it, does it make any sound? Whitman says no. ""Nobody much listens to it,"" she flatly told the Los Angeles Times of the SOTU response speech. They come on late in the evening for an audience that's probably already had its fill of political pontification. This year may have a little more interest than most. Ernst is a rapidly rising Republican star--the rare figure adored by both Palinites and Romney nostalgists--who last November took down a Democrat whose win was supposedly inevitable. On Tuesday night, she'll join a small club of women who have stepped up to rebut the commander in chief. And who knows? Maybe the main story won't be about what she's wearing.

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/robert_e_lee_day_some_southern_states_still_celebrate_the_confederate_general.html	"Every state celebrates Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but not every state celebrates it the same way. In New Hampshire, King's birthday is ""Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Day,"" an explicit celebration of the entire civil rights movement (and a compromise with lawmakers who didn't want a day devoted to King alone). In Idaho, it's ""Martin Luther King, Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day,"" a celebration of justice writ large. And in three states--Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi--MLK Day is also Robert E. Lee Day This isn't a different Robert E. Lee--some forgotten crusader for human equality. No, this is the Gen. Robert E. Lee who led Confederate armies in war against the United States, who defended a nation built on the ""great truth"" that the ""negro is not equal to the white man,"" and whose armies kidnapped and sold free black Americans whenever they had the opportunity. Despite his betrayal of the Union (a stark contrast to fellow Virginian Winfield Scott, who refused to join the Confederacy) and his treatment of enslaved black Americans--as a slavedriver, he sold children and oversaw brutal punishments, including sewing brine into the wounds of returned fugitives--Lee's popular image is of an honorable and decent man who fought well and loathed slavery. (The former is debatable and the latter is true, in that Lee thought slaveholding a burdensome occupation.) There are three other states that commemorate the life of Lee: Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. The difference is that their celebrations are all separate from MLK Day, if only by a few days: Virginia's Robert E. Lee Day was this past Friday. In fairness, Lee Day isn't a recent invention. The general's birthday falls on Jan. 19, and the first official commemoration was marked by the Virginia legislature in 1889, a decade after the end of Reconstruction and well into the period of racial regression, when Southern state legislatures dismantled efforts at biracial education, imposed Jim Crow, and turned a blind eye to anti-black terrorism. And in 1904, Robert E. Lee Day became ""Lee-Jackson Day"" after Virginia added Confederate Gen. Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson to the holiday. All of this raises an obvious question: How did Lee get tangled up in our national commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement? The best answer is convenience. In states that commemorated Lee, lawmakers who approved of MLK Day didn't want to create two holidays in January. Instead, they combined the two days. As a concept, it was a poor pairing. As a bureaucratic solution, it worked. But over the next two decades, under pressure from civil rights groups, several states would either end their Lee commemorations or move them to a different day. In 2000, pushed by Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore, Virginia would end the state's ""Lee-Jackson-King Day"" and reserve the third Monday of January for the civil rights leader. It should be said that the ""Lee"" part of ""Lee-King Day"" is mostly downplayed in states that have the holiday. Outside of a few towns and counties, there aren't any public events in honor of Lee's memory. The general, a symbol of the white South--or at least, a version of it--exists in quiet tension with King, a symbol of a more modern, integrated South. Still, it's not hard to find some commemoration of Lee, who continues to capture Southern imaginations. ""If the image of Lee changes in history, the man himself did not, even in the face of the greatest provocations,"" writes Paul Greenberg for the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette in its annual editorial on the life of Lee, ""His victories were great, but his honor greater."" As a Virginian, I understand the drive to praise Lee. His honor is an undeniable and worthy quality. But we shouldn't forget what Lee fought for. Not for freedom or for liberty, but for perpetual bondage and a South that forever held its black citizens as slaves and servants. And while Lee spent the post-war period as an advocate for reconciliation, he also opposed the nascent moves toward racial egalitarianism, condemning black suffrage, even as many black leaders favored voting rights for former Confederates and the education for their children. Indeed, if anyone should want an end to official celebrations of Lee and the Confederacy, it's the white Southerners who hold on to this memory. The general isn't just a totem of the Confederacy or an avatar for abstract qualities of honor and service; he's a symbol of destructive white resistance to the opportunities of Reconstruction. If the white South had moved in a direction that opposed Lee's values--if it had embraced the great potential that came with the end of slavery--we would have a different, and likely better, America than the one we live in."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/duke_reverses_decision_on_muslim_call_to_prayer_in_campus_chapel_the_university.html	"Duke University, under pressure from angry Christians, has backed down from a plan to allow a Muslim call to prayer from its chapel tower. Many students and civil libertarians call this rank capitulation. They may be right. But the story is more complicated than it appears. Let's be clear: Much of the sentiment behind the Duke backlash is tribal, xenophobic, and stupid. Franklin Graham, the bigoted son of evangelist Billy Graham, stirred things up by accusing Duke of ""promoting"" Islam while ""followers of Islam are raping, butchering, and beheading"" unbelievers. Another Islamophobe suggested Duke was trying ""to favor religions seemingly at war with Western civilization."" These statements, by conflating Islam with terrorism, lie and foment prejudice. But the evil and folly of the uprising don't settle the question of how to respond to it. Evil and folly are social facts. Sometimes you have to take them into account as you work your way toward a better future. That's true of any social transition, from the civil rights movement to public acceptance of gays and lesbians. These transitions are full of judgment calls, often involving prudence, patience, and finesse. The Duke backlash is arguably one such situation. First, the question on the table--how to give Muslims a fair and open place to worship on campus--isn't binary. Muslim students and teachers have been holding services in the chapel for years. As attendance increased, the location moved from smaller rooms to bigger ones. The latest decision, to move the call to prayer from the chapel's basement to its tower, was a big leap. It didn't have to be that big. Nor were the other details of the original plan essential. The plan was to allot three minutes for the call, including an Arabic chant and an English translation, with ""moderate"" amplification. The problem, apparently, was the use of the tower, which made some non-Muslims feel threatened. When Duke scrapped the tower idea, it didn't put the call to prayer back in the basement. The revised plan is to conduct the call in a quadrangle next to the chapel. The sound factor appears to be unchanged: Muslim students will be allowed to amplify the call as they see fit. So when students and civil libertarians accuse the school of denying Muslims ""the opportunity to openly worship,"" that's just not true. Second, there's a plausible case for the revised plan. Many people who objected to the original plan worried that the use of the tower elevated Islam above other faiths, conveying an exclusive imprimatur. That's a stretch, given Duke's Christian history, Christian bylaws, and overwhelmingly Christian administration and student body. But it's reasonable to propose that the iconic tower should stand above all faiths, leaving each to its space below. As one student put it: ""Religion is good. But it has its place--inside the chapel."" Any rule that the university applies to all faiths equally, including nonuse of the tower, ought to be open to discussion. Third, Duke's administrators may be right that ""what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect."" Michael Schoenfeld, Duke's vice president, correctly attributed the unintended backlash to xenophobic delusion and deceit: ""The purposes and goals and even the facts had been so mischaracterized as to turn it into a divisive situation."" Omid Safi, the director of Duke's Islamic Studies Center, put it more bluntly:"	In Defense of Duke	[]	[]

For a cool $5.7 million--culled from tax dollars the state has raked in on pot sales--Coloradans are getting their own version of the hipster ""Cover Oregon"" ads. The campaign is called ""Good to Know,"" and features banjo music, a rhyming cowboy, a website with precious animation, lots of warm fuzzies, and not much else. It aims to ""educate without alienating,"" according to USA Today and teaches a few basics about the state's pot laws, including that it's illegal to take pot out of the state, to provide it to someone under 21, or to consume it in public. It's a waste of money--Google, after all, is a thing that exists--but it's also a teachable moment. By producing a mediocre, safe, bland campaign, the state has managed to helpfully highlight everything wrong with the way we talk about cannabis. On the one hand, the campaign's overly modest goals are understandable. USA Today says state legislators ordered ""comprehensive tracking of marijuana use and its perception"" and found that less than a quarter of Coloradans know it's still illegal to sell pot to people under 21. (Dispensaries card pot-shoppers, so those who don't know about the under-21 law are either abstaining or will find out pretty quickly.) The main strength of this campaign is that, unlike previous efforts, it's not a huge awful mess. Gov. John Hickenlooper's office, for instance, rolled out a campaign last summer called ""Don't Be a Lab Rat"" that aimed to dissuade Colorado youths from getting high by putting huge metal hamster cages around the state. It didn't go well; the city of Boulder announced it was not interested in participating, and Colorado Democratic Rep. Jared Polis called the effort ""bizarre."" ""Good to Know"" and ""Don't Be a Lab Rat"" are both parts of a long and storied history of marijuana messaging that totally misses the point. Though their tones and content couldn't have less in common, they both fall into the same trap: giving would-be (and current) cannabis users maximum fluff and minimal information. Instead of detailing how to mitigate the health risks of cannabis consumption or touching on how to consume edibles for the first time without ending up on the floor in the fetal position, ""Good to Know"" repeats information that anyone who's remotely interested could find in less time than it's taking me to type this sentence. These campaigns waste taxpayer dollars that would be better spent on basically anything else, and they do precious little to actually make Colorado a better place for stoners and squares to peacefully coexist. That said, there's a larger problem here. There are two vocal, dogmatic schools of pot thought. I'll call them the prohibitionists and the libertines. The prohibitionists--whose longtime dominance is slowly waning--hold that pot is basically the same as sticking blood-sucking leeches on your body. Former Bush speechwriter and Atlantic senior editor David Frum, who called medical marijuana ""a laughable fiction,"" exemplifies this thinking. And Bustle has a great roundup here of TV ads made in this tradition. The libertines, on the other hand, hold that smoking pot is no big deal, that it's way safer than alcohol, and that, come on man, everybody smokes pot, at least everybody I know, and it's totally fine and, like, don't even worry about it. The first school of thought has a single goal: keep people from smoking pot. The second also has a single goal: make it legal for anyone to smoke pot whenever. And both of these schools of thought have perverse incentive mechanisms that discourage them from doing any sort of messaging on marijuana risk-management. Prohibitionists will never be interested in teaching people how to safely consume a substance that they believe is inherently unsafe. And for the libertines, talking about the risks of marijuana is a dicey prospect, since acknowledging any unique risks associated with cannabis consumption undercuts one of their key arguments for legalization--that consuming cannabis isn't that risky. These twin dogmas--that marijuana is fundamentally unsafe and that marijuana is utterly safe--dominate the national conversation about pot. And they tend to drown out any discussion about how to responsibly consume cannabis. It's a problem we see in the new Colorado PSAs: They're incredibly eager to talk about the letter of the law--easily accessible information that anyone who's curious could find in two seconds on Google--and totally uninterested in exploring tricky, important questions about cannabis and responsibility. It's easy to explain how to follow Colorado's marijuana laws. It's much more difficult to explain how to sensibly smoke pot. But the latter has much more social value than the former. And, fortunately, it's not unprecedented. The Marijuana Policy Project, which almost single-handedly got Colorado to change its pot laws, ran a campaign last autumn that mocked Maureen Dowd and gave its audience practical advice on consuming edibles. The website that accompanied the campaign's Dowd-mocking billboards (the site itself is run by the Council on Responsible Cannabis Regulation) is straightforward and practical; it explains what constitutes a serving of THC and how much first-time users should consume. It also details how different kinds of edibles can affect consumers. (For instance, THC-infused drinks hit faster than brownies. Now you know!) Marijuana legalization advocates argue that cannabis ought to be regulated like alcohol, which is what Colorado and Washington are trying to do. But legal cannabis consumption is just a means; responsible cannabis consumption ought to be the end. Messaging campaigns like ""Good to Know"" that treat lawful cannabis consumption like an end unto itself miss the point. They also miss the opportunity to teach their audiences what they need to know."	Why Can't Colorado Tell People the Few Things They Actually Need to Know About Pot?	['Polis']	[]

At Murphy's Diner, when the morning hour matched the temperature on the street, he said the free market was the solution to shrinking the budget and strengthening the economy. At lunchtime, in the Quonset hut of the Londonderry Fish and Game Club, he preached to the standing-room-only crowd about ""the freedom to own things."" In the library at the Founders Academy, a charter school with rules for proper behavior written on a yellow sheet on the wall and volumes of Shakespeare stacked like sandbags, he argued that market competition among states should replace Common Core education standards. So of course he has a free market answer to the growing size of the Republican presidential field. ""The more the merrier,"" he said as we talked in the ""primary room,"" across the hall from the Manchester mayor's office at City Hall where the walls are decorated with buttons, yard signs, and newspapers from previous elections. (A placard in the room reads, ""Assume that cameras and audio are always recording,"" which is good advice--and nearly encapsulates Paul's view of government surveillance). It's good for the voters to have choices, says Paul, and it seems like Republican voters have more every day. Mitt Romney is seriously considering a run. Former three-term New York Gov. George Pataki just visited New Hampshire to see if anyone remembers him. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is making soundings. It's getting to be the case that the R next to a politician's name stands for ""Running for president."" ""I saw in the paper recently they listed who might run for the Republican primary,"" said Paul. ""It was like the whole page."" But Paul isn't just being ideologically consistent when he says, ""More the merrier."" He's happy to see the others split the vote. On the establishment side of the party, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, and Chris Christie will fight for the share of voters who want a pragmatist with executive experience. Social conservatives will splinter between Rick Santorum, Ted Cruz, and Mike Huckabee. Paul will have relatively less competition for the libertarian conservatives of the kind who supported his father in the state in 2012, when Rep. Ron Paul came in second to Mitt Romney with 23 percent of the vote. But the son is not the father. To make that clear he has said his father will not be campaigning with him. Sen. Paul's foreign policy views are less confrontational and isolationist than his father's are, and he is running a more traditional campaign, assembling constituency groups, not just relying on tribal loyalism. At Murphy's, Paul talked to small government legislators, at the gun club it was Second Amendment enthusiasts, and at Founders it was education activists. You could almost see the chart on which the careful constituent tending had been mapped out. It's also important to keep his dad in Texas because the son is promoting newness as an attribute of his campaign. Almost every likely GOP candidate is presenting himself as the solution to The Problem: how to reverse the trend where Republicans lose the popular vote in presidential elections, something that has happened in five of the past six contests. For Paul he is the solution because he thinks his message of limited government at home and limited engagements abroad will attract untraditional GOP voters. That's why he's casting aside Mitt Romney. ""Gov. Romney a month ago said, 'I've had my chance, it's time for somebody fresh and new,' and I kind of still tend to agree with what Gov. Romney said,"" he told me. ""I supported him, I endorsed him, I traveled for him. But he couldn't attract enough people. The constituency to win a presidential election has to be bigger and more diverse than we've ever had or we will not win or cannot win, and so I think that some of that, there will be an argument for winnability, that we need to try something new."" Later, Paul said nominating Romney would fulfill Einstein's ""definition of insanity,"" by doing the same thing again and again while expecting a different result. Paul is also different than his father in just how far he's willing to go when talking about foreign policy. He told voters the Iraq war was a mistake, and so was the intervention in Libya. ""We made a mistake, we made the world less stable by toppling Qaddafi, we should have not gotten involved,"" he said. But as he talks about combating Islamic extremists, he is careful not to go as far as his father did and claim that they want to kill Americans because America's foreign policy provokes them. He focuses on tightening the net to keep jihadists out of the country but says ""think tanks and philosophers can discuss the whys"" of their desire to do so. Paul's trip to New Hampshire was a presidential campaign stop. He says he will make his decision whether to run some time in the spring, but the veneer that he wasn't a candidate was like the black ice on the street--you didn't see it until someone slipped. You were only reminded that he wasn't running when someone corrected themselves after calling him a presidential candidate by saying, ""If he runs."" When Paul spoke to the members of the Londonderry Fish and Game Club he referred to himself as a member of the class of presidential candidates. ""I don't think you'll probably find anybody in our primary who's going to come up here and say they don't support the Second Amendment. So really the job of voters sometimes is sifting through who they think can best advocate for the position, who has advocated for the position, and how do we do it best."" He then engaged the audience on the hypothetical policies of a Paul presidency, including dropping out of the United Nations. By late in the afternoon Paul was actively poking the presidential bear. A woman asked what voters could realistically expect from their elected officials that would stop federal meddling in education. ""It depends what you elect me to,"" he said with an impish smile, an unmistakable reference to the presidency. Paul, like many presidential candidates who hold office in Washington, is running as the one true voice in Babylon. ""The knowledge in Washington circulates around and everyone reinforces each other with the wrong information, so what's very popular in Washington has absolutely no popularity out in the country,"" he says. As proof of his credentials he boasts about his failures. He was one of only a handful of supporters on bills to extend even greater Second Amendment rights that didn't pass and pushed to stop the reauthorization of the Bush-era education bill, No Child Left Behind, a gambit that also didn't work. In making his case, Paul engages in considerable hyperbole. He told lawmakers at Murphy's Diner, ""In Washington, there is not a war anywhere where they don't think there should be boots on the ground."" He said this was true of both parties. It's obviously not--there are plenty of wars on the planet neither party cares about at all. (Who has argued for U.S. intervention in the Kivu conflict?) And, even where U.S. interests are engaged, like in Syria in the fall of 2013, the president couldn't get congressional support for a bombing campaign. Paul assigns these exaggerations to the fact that all campaigning happens in hyperbole. He's certainly not the first to bring a few straw men in his black SUV, but we'll have to see how this works toward Paul's larger goal of enlarging his party. These lines thrill already convinced Republicans with a dark view of Washington, but do they offer enough of a vision to lure converts? This isn't a problem at the moment. For now, Paul's goal is to gather together the members of his party, which means building on his existing base of support. Then, as the contest heats up, he'll have to take his guidance from the beneficent motions of the free market."	Why Rand Paul Hopes You Too Will Run for President	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Christie']	[]
8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/grassroots_conservatives_want_mitt_romney_to_run_they_think_he_will_hurt.html	"The only people excited about Mitt Romney running for president in 2016 are excited because they think he will fail. The Washington Post reported on Monday that the Netflix star and former Republican presidential nominee told a ""senior Republican"" that he ""almost certainly will"" launch a third presidential bid. Among Romney's fellow GOP compatriots, this news engendered a collective gulp. Of course, it's possible that lots of Republicans are thrilled about potentially renominating the gloriously-coiffed former Massachusetts governor. But those people--at least thus far--have kept pretty darn mum. As a quick preface, there are exceptions. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, seemed genuinely pleased about a third Romney bid; the Washington Post reported that he's already promised to back Romney if he formally enters the race. And Sen. Orrin Hatch, also of Utah, told ABC that he'd like ""very badly"" to see Romney run again and that he thinks he would win if he did. But beyond the Beehive State, Republican reactions were one collective cringe. The Hill compiled responses from top Congressional Republicans, and the results aren't pretty. Sen. John Hoeven, who supported Romney in 2012? ""I'm going to reserve judgment."" Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa icon: ""I haven't had a conversation with Mitt Romney since the last time he was in Iowa in 2012, so I wouldn't know his motivations."" Sen. Rob Portman, Romney's debate sparring partner: ""Who?"" House Speaker John Boehner helpfully pointed out that ""there will be a lot of candidates."" Former megadonor Randy Kendrick told the Daily Caller that he ""will work early and tirelessly now to make sure he is not our nominee again."" The Wall Street Journal editorial board called his political profile ""protean"" and charged that his 2012 team was ""notable for its mediocrities."" And, most tellingly, a guy who got a Romney ""R"" face tattoo told BuzzFeed he won't be backing him this time around. So that covers all the bases. Donors, members of Congress, RINO #surrendercaucus editorial boards, people with poor judgment--they all come together to share some nose-wrinkling over the possibility of a third Romney bid. That said, there's one major Republican constituency that's tickled pink about Romney 2016: grassroots conservatives who hope he'll siphon fundraising dollars away from fellow Establishment-friendly contenders like Jeb Bush and Chris Christie. Steve Deace, an influential Iowa conservative radio host, said he's overjoyed about Romney's plans. He said he expects Romney and Bush to tear into each other. And given their tetchy personal history, which the Washington Post detailed here, it could theoretically get ugly. ""This is going to be corporatist on corporatist crime,"" Deace said. ""And whenever corporatist blood gets spilled, we all win."" ""[Romney's] going to provide a lot of free opposition research for conservatives out there,"" Deace added. ""It's the best of both worlds. He will go nowhere."" At RedState, a conservative site with substantial clout among some Republican primary voters, Leon Wolf made the same argument. And Daily Caller's Chris Bedford is also on board. ""A three-way battle for the soul of the [establishment] GOP? For its money, consultants, and votes?"" he wrote. ""Good news, we think."" Brent Bozell of ForAmerica, a conservative group that was an early backer of Eric Cantor's successful primary challenger, falls in the same camp. ""If you recall the Lurch character from the Adams family who'd just groan all the time, that's how I feel,"" he said. ""It's like Groundhog Day. It's 6 a.m."" He sees the same upside as others, though. Romney, Bush, and Christie will all compete for backing from the Chamber of Commerce and other big-business interests, he argued. In the process they'll damage whomever finally emerges as moderate Republicans' favorite, forced to invest their finite resources in their own circular firing squad instead of in targeting grassroots favorites like Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Republican presidential primary candidates usually focus on courting the conservative movement voters who show up in outsize numbers on primary day. They tack to the right, and then the nominee inevitably tacks back to the middle. But Bush, Christie, and Romney share a similar base: moderate, business-oriented Republicans who may find issues like Common Core and immigration less galvanizing than your typical Tea Partier does. Conservatives hope it will be tough for these candidates to simultaneously battle for the Chamber's backing and for the support of red-meat Iowa caucus-goers. So there's an element of schadenfreude in their glee. But putting aside the delight of those vultures, one thing's for sure: Romney 2016 has a major happiness gap."

In a statement released on Monday, the Wisconsin congressman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee explained that his work as the newly minted chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee ""deserves undivided attention"" and that he could do more for the country in that role than as a presidential candidate. For now, at least, there will be no more talk of ""Ryan for Rushmore."" Ever since Ryan was first elected in 1998, a grim year for Republicans, the former think-tanker has been a one-man policy innovation machine. But during President Obama's first term, he became something more than that. In effect, Ryan became the leader of the opposition, in spirit if not in name, fighting against Obamacare and for fiscal restraint. He managed to unite risk-averse House Republicans around a controversial Medicare reform proposal. After Republicans won back the House in 2010, Ryan took the helm at the House Budget Committee, and he used its considerable resources to weigh in on income inequality and entrenched poverty. Ryan might not have won the 2016 Republican presidential nomination had he decided to run--he didn't exactly set the world on fire as Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012--but the field would have been stronger with him in it. He would have been the candidate of ideas and would have pressed his Republican rivals to think seriously about upward mobility and the need to modernize America's safety net, among other issues conservatives tend to neglect. Yet there is a silver lining in Ryan's decision not to run, which is highlighted by the sweeping tax overhaul just proposed by House Democrats. Though Ryan is more open-minded and intellectually serious than we have any right to expect from an elected official, on tax policy, at least, he's failed to come to terms with how the country has changed. A supply-sider to the bitter end, Ryan has made it clear that his first priority in reforming the tax code is to lower tax rates for everyone, including high-earners. In a conversation this summer with John McCormack of the Weekly Standard, Ryan insisted that ""the best way to help the economy is to reduce rates across the board"" and that ""if you want faster growth, more upward mobility, and faster job creation,"" lower tax rates are ""the secret sauce."" Well, this is a secret sauce that is past its expiration date. Don't get me wrong. Like Ryan, I favor lower tax rates. I just don't believe that lower tax rates for high-earners should be our highest tax reform priority. In Room to Grow, an essay collection from the conservative YG Network, Robert Stein, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, explains why across-the-board cuts should no longer be seen as a cure-all. In 1980, when Ronald Reagan campaigned on cutting taxes, the top rate was 70 percent. Right now, it is 39.6 percent. In other words, today's top rate is much, much lower than it was in the bad old days. Granted, this isn't the whole story, as high-earners face a number of other levies that didn't exist in earlier years (like the ultra-stealthy Unearned Income Medicare Contribution) while several tax shelters that were available in the late 1970s have since been swept away. Moreover, the state and local taxes faced by high-earners are generally much higher now than they were in the Carter years. But it's hard to deny that incentives for high-earners to work, save, and invest are stronger now than they were when Reagan came on the scene (for which Reagan deserves credit). It shouldn't be too shocking that cutting a 70 percent top marginal tax rate to 50 percent had a big effect. Cutting a 39.6 percent top rate a few percentage points isn't going to make nearly as big a difference. To be fair to Ryan, he isn't just talking about cutting the top rate. He is calling for lower rates across the board. That is, he doesn't just want to lower rates for those in the top tax bracket but also for those in the bottom bracket. But here's the thing: Your work incentives depend on the tax rate applied to the last dollar you earn. If I'm earning half a million dollars, the tax rate you apply to my first $10,000 in income is entirely irrelevant to whether or not I choose to work another hour. (And yet, because of the scheduled nature of our tax system, tax cuts for lower brackets are not irrelevant to what I pay--I, too, would reap a benefit from any lower-bracket cuts, but without any attendant boost in my incentive to work.) If your goal is to encourage low-wage workers to work longer hours, a targeted approach like increasing the earned-income tax credit, a policy that Ryan favors, is a much better bet. It raises after-tax incomes for low-wage workers without also reducing the tax burden of the high-flying professional earning $500,000. Then there is the fact that where we are in life influences how we respond to tax rates. If you're approaching retirement age, high taxes might convince you to go ahead and leave the workforce. If you're in your 30s or 40s and you have a mortgage and two kids, you might not be in a position to cut your work hours by much, even if your taxes go up. Some economists have even suggested that because female labor supply appears to be more tax-sensitive than male labor supply, we ought to consider imposing higher marginal taxes on men. Yes, there is something vaguely sinister about squeezing people who have no choice but to pay the piper. That's one reason I favor lower tax rates, all other things being equal. But if your argument is that lowering tax rates is going to boost economic growth, you have to account for the fact that there are many people who will work more or less the same amount whether you cut their taxes or raise them. And indeed, there are some who might even reduce their work hours in response to a tax cut, as it will allow them to work less yet still have the after-tax income they need to lead their lives. Now, you could believe that today's tax rates on high-earners are a bad thing even if they're not holding back our economy all that much, as they're an affront to the right of free women and men to keep what they earn. I'm sympathetic to this line of thinking. It just so happens that it's shared by very few Americans. In April, the Gallup survey found that only 13 percent of Americans felt that upper-income people were paying too much in federal taxes while 61 percent felt they were paying too little. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that most of those who believe that upper-income people pay too much are reliable Republican voters. Far more Americans (49 percent) believe that middle-income people pay too much. It stands to reason that backing tax cuts that benefit middle-income households will get you much further politically than backing those that benefit high-income households. Many voters are already convinced that Republicans care more about the rich than people of modest means, and Ryan's devotion to cutting the top tax rate reinforces that false narrative. Worse yet, it drowns out his convincing arguments about how conservative policies can benefit Americans struggling to climb the economic ladder. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the Democrats were completely incompetent. But recent evidence suggests otherwise. Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen has rallied House Democrats around a shrewd, if gimmicky plan that could've been dreamed up by master-panderer Bill Clinton. The plan calls for financing a new ""Paycheck Bonus Tax Credit,"" among other new middle-class tax breaks, with higher taxes on the high-earners and a new financial transactions tax. As it happens, this Paycheck Bonus Tax Credit will benefit two-earner families making up to $200,000, families that might be considered middle class in Bethesda or Brentwood, Maryland, but which almost anywhere else would be seen as very well-off indeed. Larding the tax code with complicated new tax breaks is bad policy, but its great politics. The Democrats are upping their game while Ryan seems stuck in the 1980s I'll miss having Paul Ryan, a man of great intellect and integrity, in the race. But my hope is that his absence creates space for another candidate of ideas who understands that Republicans badly need a new approach to cutting taxes."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/republicans_comparing_barack_obama_to_hitler_my_favorite_examples_of_the.html	"On Sunday, dozens of world leaders joined French citizens in a march in Paris to honor the victims of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine. Absent from the crowd were major American leaders. Neither President Barack Obama nor Vice President Joe Biden joined the march; instead, the United States was represented by its ambassador to France, Jane Hartley. It's only natural that this sparked criticism, with tough treatment from Republicans like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who wrote in Time, ""The absence is symbolic of the lack of American leadership on the world stage, and it is dangerous."" This criticism isn't especially fair, but it lives within the world of reality. That's more than you can say for the critique from Rep. Randy Weber, a backbench Republican congressman from Texas. ""Even Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris. (For all of the wrong reasons),"" wrote Weber on Twitter, ""Obama couldn't do it for [the] right reasons."" So much of this is hard to understand. Are we supposed to draw an analogy between the infamous dictator and the president of the United States? And are we supposed to think there's something comparable about Hitler's wartime drive to conquer Paris and Obama's decision to stay home and support the marchers from afar? Nothing in this attack makes sense, but--in choosing Hitler as his point of comparison--Weber has revived an erstwhile tradition of American politics: Comparing the president to Adolf Hitler. This was a part of life during the George W. Bush administration, and it picked up steam with Obama's arrival on the national stage. Of the hundreds (maybe thousands) of examples, here are a few of my favorites. Who thinks Obama is Hitler? Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell. A few days before the 2008 presidential election, Sowell penned a broadside against then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's call for ""change"" in American life. Warning that it could mean anything, Sowell pointed to examples of ""change"" that claimed millions of lives. ""[M]any today seem to assume that if things are bad, ""change"" will make them better. Specifics don't interest them nearly as much as inspiring rhetoric and a confident style. But many 20th-century leaders with inspiring rhetoric and great self-confidence led their followers or their countries into utter disasters. These ranged from Jim Jones who led hundreds to their deaths in Jonestown to Hitler and Mao who led millions to their deaths."" There's still time, but thus far, President Obama has not led hundreds of his followers to suicide or condemned millions of Americans to death. Who thinks Obama and Hitler are pals? The Republican Women of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. In June 2009, the GOP group published a letter from its president, who explicitly compared the recently elected president to the Nazi leader. ""Obama and Hitler have a great deal in common in my view,"" she wrote. ""Obama and Hitler use the ""blitzkrieg"" method to overwhelm their enemies. FAST, CARPET BOMBING intent on destruction. Hitler's blitzkrieg bombing destroyed many European cities--quickly and effectively. Obama is systematically destroying the American economy and with it AMERICA."" As of December 2014, United States unemployment has fallen to 5.6 percent after 58 months of consecutive private sector job gains. What's more, economy-wide growth has hit a healthy pace, reaching 5 percent in the third quarter of last year. Who paid cash to call Obama ""Hitler?"" The North Iowa Tea Party. In summer 2010, just a few months after President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, a Tea Party group near Mason City, Iowa purchased a billboard meant to ""draw attention to socialism."" The sign--which warned that ""Radical leaders prey on the fearful & naive""--showed large photographs of Obama, Hitler, and communist leader Vladimir Lenin beneath the labels ""Democrat Socialism,"" ""National Socialism,"" and ""Marxist Socialism."" National Tea Party leaders condemned the billboard--""That's just a waste of money, time, resources, and it's not going to further our cause,"" said one spokesperson from the Tea Party Patriots--and the leader of the Iowa group that purchased the sign later expressed his regrets. ""The purpose of the billboard was to draw attention to the socialism. It seems to have been lost in the visuals,"" said Bob Johnson. Which country music singer made an awkward Hitler quip? Hank Williams Jr. In a 2011 interview with Fox and Friends, Williams attacked a ""golf summit"" President Obama had held with House Speaker John Boehner. It was ""one of the biggest political mistakes ever,"" said the singer, most famous for his presence in the Monday Night Football broadcasts. ""It would be like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu, OK?"" When a confused Brian Kilmeade asked Williams to clarify the statement--""Yeah, I don't understand that analogy, actually""--Williams snapped back. ""Well, I'm glad you don't, brother, because a lot of people do,"" Williams said. ""You know, they're the enemy. They're the enemy,"" he said, referring to the president. Williams later apologized--""I have always respected the office of the President""--but he lost his spot with the NFL and ESPN, which pulled his contract. Whose sermon compared health care reform to Hitler? Bishop Daniel Jenky. In a 2012 homily, the Peoria, Illinois bishop accused President Obama of waging war on Christian believers through health care policies, and the ""contraception mandate"" in particular. ""Hitler and Stalin, at their better moments, would just barely tolerate some churches remaining open, but would not tolerate any competition with the state in education, social services, and health care,"" Jenky was quoted as saying. ""In clear violation of our First Amendment rights, Barack Obama--with his radical, pro-abortion, and extreme secularist agenda--now seems intent on following a similar path."" In the years since, the Supreme Court has weakened the mandate, broadening religious exemptions for a wide group of religious organizations, nonprofit and otherwise. There's no indication (yet!) that Obama wants to close churches and curtail religious freedom. Which elected official used social media to compare the president to ""Hitler?"" Arizona state Rep. Brenda Barton. In a post on Facebook, the Arizona lawmaker blasted Obama for closing federal monuments during the October 2013 government shutdown. ""Someone is paying the National Park Service thugs overtime for their efforts to carry out the order of De Fuhrer...where are our Constitutional Sheriffs who can revoke the Park Service Rangers authority to arrest??? Do we have any Sheriffs with a pair?"" Barton wrote. Even after strong criticism from local and national outlets, Barton stood by her take. ""It's not just the death camps. [Hitler] started in the communities, with national health care and gun control. You better read your history. Germany started with national health care and gun control before any of that other stuff happened. And Hitler was elected by a majority of people,"" she said. Who is the billionaire who thinks Democrats are a goose step away from becoming the Nazi Party? Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone. In a 2014 interview with Politico, the major GOP donor fretted over Democratic appeals to populism and against the ""1 percent,"" including those from President Obama and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. ""I hope it's not working,"" he said. ""Because if you go back to 1933, with different words, this is what Hitler was saying in Germany. You don't survive as a society if you encourage and thrive on envy or jealousy."" I should say that, for the most part, I don't think any of these are sincere. I'm not sure that anyone who calls Obama ""Hitler""--or who did the same to George W. Bush--is thinking much about their analogy. Instead, they're reaching for the most evil name they can imagine, and attaching it to their chief political opponent. The simple truth is that there's no one in mainstream American life who is like Hitler or the Nazi Party. But given the popularity of that comparison--it has fueled success for at least one conservative writer of note--I don't expect it to fade away, not now or for the next president."

That's because Agema--the Republican National Committeeman for the state of Michigan--has become an embarrassment for much of the party. Specifically, he has a bad habit of posting racist, Islamophobic, and homophobic screeds on Facebook. He's expected to attend the Winter Meeting in San Diego later this week, and some conservatives say the RNC isn't doing enough to muscle him out. Agema, formerly an Air Force fighter pilot, served three terms in the Michigan House of Representatives--the maximum allowed by the state's term limits--and then challenged Saul Anuzis for his spot as RNC committeeman at the 2012 Republican state convention. MLive reported that consultant John Yob, now the national political director of Sen. Rand Paul's RANDPAC, ""engineered Agema's victory,"" a win that capitalized on the state delegates' Tea Party fervor. Paul Welday, the chairman of the Michigan GOP 14th district committee, said that contest was a proxy war between Yob and Anuzis, who have feuded in the past. ""Dave Agema proved to be the beneficiary as the result of that fight,"" Welday said. Before becoming committeeman, Agema had a controversial tenure in the Michigan statehouse. He has said that Muslims intend to implement Sharia in the state, energetically opposed same-sex marriage, and was known as one of the most far right members of the chamber. ""He's not a shrinking violet,"" said Susan Demas, the editor and publisher of Inside Michigan Politics. ""He's been very vocal about his opinions about Muslims and the gay community for a long time."" After becoming committeeman, Agema got a lot more vocal. In March 2013, according to MLive, he linked to a blog post on Facebook saying that ""the homosexual agenda"" is looking to ""get the public to affirm their filthy lifestyle"" and ""turn people from Christianity."" Then, in January 2014, also per MLive, he posted an anti-Muslim rant on Facebook that asked, ""Have you ever seen a Muslim do anything that contributes positively to the American way of life?"" Two weeks ago, on Dec. 31, 2014, he was at it again, posting the text of an article that ran in the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance. ""Very interesting article by a public defender,"" Agema wrote. ""We are in a cultural battle. Very enlightening for anyone who is concerned about crime in America ...""

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/_jesuischarlie_the_default_mode_of_showing_solidarity_in_the_hashtag_age.html	"It took less than an hour for the hashtag to appear. When gunmen attacked the Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday morning, French onlookers mourned the murdered journalists by tweeting #JeSuisCharlie. Soon, Charlie Hebdo had updated its website with a guide to translating the call for supporters around the world--#YoSoyCharlie, #IchBinCharlie, #IAmCharlie. As the violence spread in Paris, the hashtag fractured into countless iterations: #JeSuisAhmed, in support of the Muslim police officer Ahmed Merabet, killed while patrolling the street outside the newspaper's offices; #JeSuisJuif (""I am Jewish""), after hostages were taken inside a kosher grocery store; #JeSuisParisien extended solidarity to all the people of the city. #JeSuis, #IchBin, #IAm--this is now the standard opener for expressions of social media support. We express empathy, outrage, and horror by subsuming ourselves into victims' identities--#WeAreTrayvonMartin, #ICantBreathe--or stepping into their shoes--#IfTheyGunnedMeDown, #WhyIStayed. When a 15-year-old Houston girl was raped at a party last summer then ridiculed on social media with the hashtag #JadaPose, supporters countered her harassers with the hashtag #IStandWithJada, until Jada herself proposed a more powerful one: #IAmJada. When a racist soccer spectator threw a banana on the field near Barcelona star Dani Alves, fellow players responded with the hashtag #SomosTodosMacados (""We are all monkeys""). And when Boko Haram kidnapped 276 Nigerian girls, they quickly became ""ours."" This is, of course, not just an Internet thing. The ""I am"" construction has roots in the famous 1960 ""I am Spartacus"" scene, where rebel Roman slaves assumed their leader's name in an attempt to prevent his execution; the Charlie Hebdo response in particular has a #JeSuisSpartacus vibe, as the more people who republish the newspaper's provocative cartoons, the harder it is for terrorists to silence the message. The meme also mirrors John F. Kennedy's 1962 ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech, where the president expressed America's support for the people of Berlin by literally claiming himself as one of them. In the late 1960s, California journalists affixed ""I am not Paul Avery"" buttons to their shirts as a show of strength and self-protection against the Zodiac killer, who had pledged to target the journalist, Avery, who was investigating his crimes. And before the #WeAreTrayvonMartin hashtag and hoodied selfies were used to challenge racist images of black boys, a 1990s staple, the ""This Is What a Feminist Looks Like"" T-shirt, attempted to upend a cultural stereotype by putting a face--or rather, faces--on a stigmatized ideology. But what was once a rhetorical flourish has become the default mode of showing solidarity in the hashtag era, where the political only reaches viral heights if it's suitably personalized. As with all enduring memes, the ""I am"" construction appears almost endlessly flexible: ""We are the 99 percent"" was constructed to recast the radical Occupy movement as a populist one. To conceal their identities, members of the hacker collective Anonymous don identical Guy Fawkes masks (in public, on YouTube, and in their avatars) and favor the catchphrase, ""We are Anonymous. We are Legion."" And American nurses printed ""I am Nina Pham"" stickers in a bid to encourage medical facilities to provide better protection to nurses charged with treating Ebola patients. In each case, the #IAm construction functions like a politicized selfie, drawing attention to both the speaker and the subject (often, as with #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, the conceit actually requires a photo to spread). So while #IAm often begins as a way to grant a voice to the voiceless--it typically arises in death, as it did for Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, and the staffers of Charlie Hebdo--it's also designed to grant a platform to another silenced demographic: ourselves. The simplicity and accessibility of the meme also means that it risks veering off message. When white people began contributing to #WeAreTrayvonMartin, many were attempting to show empathy and support, but they were also inserting themselves into a movement designed to lift black voices, which made them seem culturally clueless and self-aggrandizing. Similarly, the wrong subject can stop the meme in its tracks. Counter-efforts like ""I am Darren Wilson"" or ""I Can Breathe"" have failed not just because they lack popular support, but because the optics are so inartful--we know that white cops can breathe, because other cops aren't putting them in chokeholds on the street. #JeSuisCharlie had all the elements to become the broadest iteration of the ""I am"" meme yet. The Venn diagram of people who both value their speech and condemn terrorism is expansive. But in the days since the attack began, its broad coalition began to collapse under the weight of its own meaning. The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg argued that we are, in fact, not all Charlie Hebdo because most of us have never exhibited the ""genuine display of bravery"" required to continue to publish offensive materials after our offices have been firebombed by terrorists. And at Gawker, Maria Bustillos distanced herself from the sentiment, reminding readers that a ""lot of the stuff that Charlie Hebdo published was really gross and racist.""  Other onlookers took a different approach. As the attacks continued, mourners on social media began stacking the emerging hashtags atop one another, hoping to extend their empathy as far as character limits allowed: #JeSuisCharlie, #JeSuisAhmed, #JeSuisJuif, #JeSuisParisien.

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/no_child_left_behind_republicans_should_use_their_newfound_clout_to_reform.html	"Shortly after taking the reins as Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a man dubbed ""Dr. No"" for his determined opposition to President Obama's domestic agenda, told CNN's State of the Union that Americans ""want us to look for things to agree on and see if we can make progress for the country."" This is in keeping with McConnell's earlier pledge to pass legislation, and his optimistic November declaration that ""this gridlock and dysfunction can be ended."" I happen to think that there is much to be said for gridlock, particularly when it reflects principled disagreement. The chief reason Congress has so far failed to pass sweeping immigration or tax reform legislation is that Americans are as divided on these issues as their elected representatives, and there is nothing remotely dishonorable about standing athwart history, yelling Stop. That doesn't change the fact that if Republicans hope to hold on to Congress and win the White House in 2016, when the electorate will be less old, less white, and less conservative than it was this past fall, they need to demonstrate that they can do more than just oppose. They need to offer a compelling domestic agenda of their own, something they've utterly failed to do during the Obama years. So where is the best place for Republicans to make their mark over the next few months? One can easily imagine the congressional GOP working with the White House on overhauling corporate taxes, reining in a patent system run amok, and promoting freer trade, and progress on these fronts would be very welcome. But if I were in charge, I'd focus the party's energies on beating back federal overreach in public education. Not only would this be in line with conservative principles--it might win over parents and teachers who'd otherwise never dream of voting Republican. Ever since LBJ's Great Society, when the federal government ramped up its spending on public schools, conservatives have warned that federal funding would eventually lead to federal control. Back in 1978, as Congress debated the creation of a federal department of education, Harrison Schmitt, at the time a GOP senator from New Mexico, peered into its future, and he didn't like what he saw. In a long-forgotten address, Schmitt laid out a step-by-step process by which the federal government would seize control of public education. First, he imagined that the department would at some point establish a series of national ""advisory"" standards. Next, these ""advisory"" standards would become compulsory, lest federal aid be discontinued. And then, of course, the department would have no choice but to mandate tests to ensure that the new compulsory standards were being met. Finally, Schmitt warned, ""state and local authorities will be coerced into acceptance of a standardized curriculum as the 'only possible' guarantee of meeting compulsory standards."" How far along are we on Schmitt's road to educational serfdom? If you ask grassroots activists hell-bent on scrapping the new Common Core State Standards initiative, the answer is very far indeed. Over the past few years, the Common Core, a fairly banal checklist of reading and math skills that has been adopted by the vast majority of states, has sparked fierce resistance, which has already led three states--Indiana, Oklahoma, and South Carolina--to jettison the standards, with more states likely to follow. This is despite the fact that the Obama administration has leaned heavily on states to adopt the Common Core, and that virtually the entire education reform establishment, including Republican luminaries like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, stand behind it. Frederick Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, does a masterful job of laying out the battle lines in a recent essay in National Affairs. The short version is that Tea Party conservatives fear that the Common Core (or, as they like to call it, ""Obamacore"") will eventually morph into a standardized federal curriculum that will be imposed on public schools across the country, just as Schmitt feared. Teachers unions see it as part of a larger assault on the interests of their members, who dread the prospect of being judged on the basis of how their students fare on standardized tests. Many parents, meanwhile, worry that the Common Core will crowd out the teaching of history, literature, and music, among other things, and that it will turn their children into test-taking automatons. These fears are almost certainly overblown. The Common Core is not in itself a grave threat to public education. If anything, the standards it sets are more lame than menacing. But the fight against the Common Core is not really about the Common Core. Rather, it is about the rigid rules and regulations that are making life a living hell for teachers, administrators, and students. In many school districts, the small trickle of standardized tests of yesteryear has become a flood. Teachers are constantly fending off contradictory directives from their administrators, and administrators are struggling to keep up with ever-changing, ever-expanding requirements from state education agencies that, in turn, are struggling to keep up with the seemingly arbitrary demands of federal bureaucrats. And perhaps the biggest driver of this brand of stultifying overregulation is the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. If you haven't been following education debates closely, you might be surprised to hear that No Child Left Behind has grown so unpopular. Maybe you remember it as one of the few bipartisan domestic policy measures that united the conservative Bush White House with liberals like then-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and then-Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. Like many muddled compromises, alas, it has aged badly. To convince suburban swing voters that he was ""a different kind of Republican"" during his 2000 presidential campaign, George W. Bush emphasized that unlike his GOP predecessors, he fully embraced a federal role in education. Unlike Ronald Reagan or Newt Gingrich, Bush never talked up the idea of abolishing the U.S. Department of Education. What separated him from liberals who wanted a bigger federal role is that he wanted to promote choice and accountability while also granting states and school districts more flexibility. Once in office, Bush sketched out a vision for achieving those goals that even now sounds pretty attractive to conservatives. Schools receiving federal funds would have to test their students once a year from the third to the eighth grade, and they'd have to disclose educational outcomes by race and income. Schools that failed to adequately serve their low-income students would be given a couple of years to improve their performance. By the third year, low-income students attending schools that had failed to shape up could take their federal dollars to another school, public or private. Essentially, Bush was calling for transparency and a national voucher program for poor kids. Of course, vouchers had no hope of ever garnering Democratic support, and Kennedy and Miller started to tweak Bush's NCLB concept until it was all but unrecognizable. Instead of offering schools more flexibility, Kennedy and Miller stuffed misguided directives on teacher quality and harsh penalties for failing to meet federally determined goals into the law, tying the hands of innovative districts--exactly the opposite of what Bush hoped to achieve. Most importantly, the final legislation included a requirement that 100 percent of America's elementary school students be proficient in reading and math by 2014, and if states failed to reach this ludicrous benchmark, they'd be punished. NCLB hasn't been all bad. By strong-arming states into disclosing educational outcomes by race and income, it has struck a blow for civil rights. Advocates can finally point to reliable data on how low-income and black and Latino kids are faring in public schools across the country, and which states and which districts are doing the best job of meeting their needs. If that were all the legislation had done, it would be a triumph. But by requiring universal proficiency, it set off a mad scramble to water down standards so that the proficiency bar was easier to clear and to subject students to a barrage of standardized tests to better prepare them for the annual tests required under NCLB. The Obama administration, recognizing that NCLB gave it enormous power, used the threat of NCLB sanctions to advance a number of goals. Even with watered-down standards, no state has come close to achieving universal proficiency, so the Education Department, led by former Chicago schools chief Arne Duncan, started granting waivers to states that toed the line in some other way--by, say, adopting the Common Core standards, or a fashionable new approach to teacher evaluation. Some critics, like Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina, allege that the unrestrained use of these conditional waivers amounts to unconstitutional coercion on the part of the federal government. Unconstitutional or not, the intrusions have turned many educators against the federal role in education in recent years, and that creates an opportunity for the congressional GOP. Right now, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., the chairmen of the Senate and House education committees, are gearing up for an overhaul of NCLB, and they're weighing how far to go in dialing back NCLB's excesses. Back in 2011, Alexander wrote a New York Times op-ed that called for getting rid of the worst of NCLB's micromanagement while retaining its emphasis on transparency, and one hopes he'll follow through now that he has the power to do so. As Hess and his AEI colleague Andrew Kelly often argue, the federal government is simply not well-suited to running America's schools. Solutions that work in Tucson, Arizona, aren't necessarily going to fly in Memphis, Tennessee or Newton, Massachusetts. Instead of wielding threats, the federal government should focus on solving collective action problems, like funding basic research into the science of learning that state and local governments can't or won't pay for, and enforcing transparency requirements to provide parents and students with reliable information. Over time, this will make it easier for educators to build schools that better serve the needs of America's very diverse student population. The beauty of this more modest approach is that it attracts the support not just of conservatives who are forever wary of federal meddling, but also unionized teachers who feel jerked around by one-size-fits-all rules that threaten their autonomy. No, this doesn't mean that conservatives will suddenly see eye to eye with the teachers unions on vouchers, pension reform, and any number of other issues, nor should they. Conservatives are absolutely right to want more innovation and competition in public education. But conservatives will have a much better shot at winning these policy debates if they understand that many teachers look to unions to protect them from bureaucrats run amok, which is something that conservatives, of all people, should appreciate. If Republicans can get education right, and if they can turn at least some unionized teachers into allies, they'll have demonstrated that they can reach beyond their narrow base. Think of this as a dry run for selling the country on replacing Obamacare and modernizing the safety net, the big enchiladas of conservative domestic policy."

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/police_departments_shouldn_t_fear_reform_it_makes_their_jobs_easier_and.html	"On social media and other forums, there's a vast gulf--and a lot of shouting--between critics of police departments (""Black Lives Matter"") and police defenders (""Blue Lives Matter""). But this ideological divide belies the fears and worries they have in common. ""They don't go out every day saying, 'I'm going to take a life today,' "" said Mary Jo Graves, referring to police officers after she organized a pro-police march in Cleveland last month. ""They go out saying, 'I want to come home.' They want to come home to their families."" This sympathy--police officers just want to do their work without fear of death--isn't too different from what police critics have to say about their friends and family. ""I am tired of being scared that my son is not going to make it home from work,"" said Dinetta Gilmore, who participated in the Justice for All march in Washington in December. ""It's time that this stops,"" she said. ""When are we going to be able to stop marching?"" All of this fear is understandable--but it's not equal. High-profile cases aside, policing has never been safer. The rate of officer assaults has been on the decline since the 1990s, and the rate of officer deaths is at its lowest point in a century. ""You're more likely to be murdered simply by living in about half of the largest cities in America than you are while working as a police officer,"" writes journalist Radley Balko. And while black Americans are at greater risk of criminal victimization than they are police violence, it is also true that compared with other Americans, they are more likely to be shot or killed by police, regardless of circumstances. There's also the fact of power. Police officers are empowered by the state to use lethal force, and when that doesn't come with accountability--and in the case of wrongdoing, punishment--it appears arbitrary and frightening. Put differently, most Americans who kill other Americans--including blacks who kill blacks--will face justice. Most cops who kill will not. With that said, fear isn't always a bad thing. In the case of the ""black lives matter"" protests, it's been constructive, prompting new calls for police reform and other efforts to improve minority communities. The problem is on the other side, the police side, where fear is an impediment to embracing beneficial reform. In New York City, mild criticism from Mayor Bill de Blasio--following the Eric Garner grand jury decision--sparked a bona fide police rebellion with work stoppages and aggressive, inflammatory rhetoric. At funerals for slain officers--killed by a criminal who claimed Garner and Michael Brown as a cause to commit violence--cops turned their backs on the mayor, shunning his leadership and the city he represents. The problem, besides the illiberalism inherent in the rejection of civil authority, is that de Blasio is on their side. The goal of police reform isn't to punish cops; it's to better connect them to the communities they serve, which makes it easier to fight crime and more likely they'll come home at the end of each day. The best example of this is Los Angeles, which completed a major experiment in police reform a few years ago. If the 1992 Los Angeles riots revealed deep tensions and anger toward the LAPD, then the 1999 Rampart scandal--named so after the division in question--unveiled the astounding amount of corruption in the department. An investigation uncovered countless acts of police misconduct involving dozens of officers, from beatings and unprovoked shootings to stealing, drug dealing, evidence planting, and bank robbery. In 2000, the Department of Justice announced it had enough evidence to sue the LAPD for pervasive misconduct, and later that year, the city government entered into a ""consent decree,"" where it agreed to reform the department under supervision from federal courts. This was a huge task. As researchers for Harvard University note in a study of the LAPD reforms, ""The fact of federal oversight itself ... can erode morale in a police department, sapping the confidence and spirit that effective policing requires."" In the first years of the consent decree, officials resisted any changes to their approach. But the result wasn't a more confident police department; it was higher crime and lower morale. This changed after Los Angeles brought in new leadership--including current NYPD Police Commissioner Bill Bratton--who embraced the decree. Over the next decade, the LAPD would work to comply with the decree while also reducing crime and improving morale. It was a success. Not only did crime decline over the period of the consent decree, but officer morale rose. The Harvard researchers, for instance, found a marked drop in crime and a decrease in the number of officers who were afraid of being ""punished for an honest mistake"" or having their career ""negatively affected by civilian complaints."" What's important is that this improvement happened under a policing regime that discouraged the use of force, even as it ramped up enforcement. Under the consent decree, ""The total number of ... force incidents declined by almost 30 percent."" By 2009, there were fewer officer-involved shootings, chokeholds, head strikes, and suspect hospitalizations than at any point in the previous decade. And while minorities still experience police force out of proportion to their numbers, fewer blacks and Latinos have been subject to force than ever before. Other, less flashy changes have also been essential to the LAPD's effectiveness. Supervisors and senior officials have been tasked with devising stronger oversight procedures to increase accountability. And critically, there's greater engagement with minority communities, through forums; active recruitment of black, Latino, and Asian officers; and regular activities with schools and other community institutions. The result is a marked increase in the number of Los Angeles residents who say that the police ""treat all racial and ethnic groups fairly,"" from under 40 percent in 2005 to roughly 50 percent in 2009. The LAPD is not perfect, but it has improved, and that has made policing better for ordinary citizens and safer for officers themselves. Indeed, for a sense of what happens when police neglect communities, you only have to look east from L.A. to Missouri. One of the reasons Ferguson was such a flashpoint was the pre-existing relationship between residents and police. For decades, the citizens of Ferguson and nearby towns were subject to unfair treatment, from targeted stops--used to collect revenue for individual municipalities--to unjustified violence. In 2000, for example, two unarmed men were killed by plainclothes detectives, who later escaped indictment by a grand jury. That mistrust doesn't dissipate--it builds. And when an event like the Michael Brown shooting occurs, it can explode into anger and disorder. It almost doesn't matter that the details of Brown's shooting were murky or that key parts of the early narrative were incomplete, impossible to verify, or false--Brown's death was traumatic enough to prompt a huge response from Ferguson residents. At a time when local police needed the trust of the community, they didn't have it. The NYPD and so many other police departments are gripped by a fear of criticism and what could happen if it has to bend to change. But there's no reason for fear; reform improved the NYPD in the 1990s, it turned around the LAPD in the 2000s, and it could strengthen New York cops for the next decade. Greater accountability and community contact doesn't harm policing; it makes it better. If you're skeptical, consider this: At the same time that Los Angeles burned amid the Rodney King riots, San Diego--just a few hours away--was calm. It's not that there weren't racial tensions or episodes of police brutality, but that for several years--in the wake of San Diego's own King-esque event and the killing of an officer--police had worked with city and community leaders to build bridges and improve policing. When turmoil came, notes Balko, ""those goodwill gestures and the relationships they built paid off,"" and police officials ""could build a strategy around empathy, not antagonism."" The NYPD can continue its strike, and its allies can continue their attacks on reformers. But they're only hurting themselves and the city they serve."	Police Officers Shouldn't Fear Reform. It Makes Their Jobs Easier and Safer.	[]	[]
15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/obama_s_foreign_policy_why_late_term_presidents_look_internationally.html	"President Obama devoted more time to foreign policy Tuesday night than he has in past State of the Union addresses, appropriate after a year seemingly packed full of international crises. But in contrast to how he discussed his domestic agenda, the president wasn't really asking Congress for much when it comes to the rest of the world. The president called for new cybersecurity legislation and asked for a new authorization for military force to fight ISIS, though this seemed a bit less than urgent given that the White House has been completely comfortable bombing Iraq and Syria under the decade-old legal framework already in place. On Iran, he asked Congress not to do anything, threatening to veto any new sanctions that might undermine international negotiations over that country's nuclear program. In part, this reflects this White House's recent strategy of doing as much as possible on foreign policy without having to involve Congress, but it also reflects something more universal about second-term presidents. Given that the Constitution gives the president more latitude to act unilaterally on foreign policy than on domestic issues, presidents often decide late in their terms, with their domestic momentum starting to stall, to look abroad in search of monsters to destroy. Dwight Eisenhower created NASA, effectively launching the space race with the Soviet Union, in 1958, midway through his second term. Ronald Reagan spent much of his last two years on negotiations with Mikhail Gorbachev. Bill Clinton deepened his involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process ahead of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and launched the U.S. intervention in Kosovo. George W. Bush attempted to reboot his unpopular foreign policy in his second term with a new troop surge in Iraq, a new initiative to combat AIDS in Africa, and an ultimately unsuccessful push to restart Middle East peace talks. Since last November's midterm defeat, Obama has shown signs of a similar tendency, with a flurry of initiatives including reopening diplomatic relations with Cuba after half a century, inking a new climate change agreement with China, and deepening U.S. involvement in the fight against ISIS. The reason why second-term presidents take a greater interest in foreign policy initiatives isn't just because they're out of other options--it may be partly a reflection of political incentive. A study published in the most recent American Journal of Political Science by Christopher Gelpi of Ohio State and Joseph M. Grieco of Duke looks at how a president's perceived foreign policy success impacts his ability to pass legislation. Looking at public support for military engagements between 1953 and 2001 (for the United States, this is sadly a pretty large sample), the authors find that an ""public disapproval of presidential handling of militarized disputes has a significant and substantial negative impact on the president's ability to persuade Congress to pass laws that move policy in his preferred direction.""

Some Republicans in the audience applauded that line. It wasn't intended as an applause line, and the president couldn't let it go unanswered. ""I know, because I won both of them."" He did not go on to refer to his rock-hard abs, but given the president's confident, forward-leaning posture, it seemed like he might. On Tuesday night a  president who half a year ago seemed exhausted with the office seemed to be enjoying himself as he declared that the verdict was in: His policies had helped turn around the economy. His good cheer showed in ways big and small, including that for the first time in a State of the Union he has given, he used the familiar line ""the state of the union is strong"" high up in the speech. The State of the Union offers a microcosm of the challenge for the entire Obama presidency. The form of the speech is full of constraints and compulsory items, much like the office itself. Tuesday night was Obama's best effort yet at breaking out of the binds of the speech, and it echoed the escape he seems to be making from the lame-duck label as well. It was not a new Obama but a man who seemed to have figured out how to be more himself in the moment. It won't win him any support from Republicans, but if he is trying to win a conversation, it was a strong opening gambit. The president has offered policies to help the middle class in the past, but he lacked standing because the economic recovery was not underway. Now, if people buy his argument that the economy is improving--and that the progress is durable--they may be more open to his ideas. Republicans now are in a different position, too. They can't get as much political mileage out of just saying no. They have to come up with policies that will be popular and can pass both houses of Congress. That's difficult, and because they are now in control, they are more on the hook for providing alternatives. What helped Obama rhetorically was that he'd outlined his proposals in the previous two weeks. He didn't have to cram everything in the speech again, which allowed him to tell a story. But he wrapped his message in the narrative of the American people, returning to the storytelling style that was a part of his 2008 campaign. At the center of the speech was the Erler family of Minnesota who had struggled but come back during the economic downturn. Their story was America's story, said the president. The president pitched a series of policies aimed at the Erler family and all American families like it. The Erler Plan consisted of relief for their daily struggles--help with child care, relief for two-earner households, and paid sick leave. Those policies are popular, but they are also an appeal to show that he understands what people are going through. They are an opening statement in a debate in which he and his fellow Democrats are claiming to be on the side of regular people. He was also trying to put Republicans in a box by forcing them to answer the question Who are you for? It was a very partisan speech, even though the president said he was going to offer policies that were ""practical, not partisan."" Though Obama referenced his 2004 speech in Boston where he spoke of a unified America that was better than its partisan divisions, he said plenty to keep the GOP roiling. He painted Republicans as protectors of lobbyists and the super-wealthy. He issued a host of veto threats. He tweaked them as limited in vision--""let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline""--and said they were hypocrites on the minimum wage. Republicans were not amused. ""It was long. Defiant. Untethered from reality,"" said a House leadership aide. The reality Republicans recognize is the one that Sen. Joni Ernst mentioned near the top of her Republican response. ""We heard the message you sent in November--loud and clear. And now we're getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country."" The president has won two elections. Ernst and her colleagues won the last one. The winner of the debate that kicked off Tuesday night may go a long way to determining which side wins the next one.

Even before the speech, Republicans were already critical, and one of the most interesting things about the annual ritual is how well it showcases the depth of our partisan divide. Nowhere is that more visible, and entertaining, than on Twitter. Below are live tweets from top pundits and politicos. On the left-hand side of the screen, you'll see the liberal tweets. On the right-hand side, you'll get the conservative ones. You can watch the bickering ensue in real time as Obama delivers his address and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst presents the GOP response.

Many of the GOP newcomers believe they won because voters repudiated the president's policies. Republicans feel emboldened. The president will tell the new majority that for the first time in six years he can declare the economy on sound footing. His policies have been a success. He feels emboldened. ""The economy is stronger, and he feels in a stronger political position as a result,"" says an Obama aide. There is always a political disconnect at the heart of the State of the Union--just watch a member of the opposing party fuss over whether to applaud--but the gap is wider this year. It's the difference between showing up to a fire with an extinguisher and showing up with grilling tongs. We know what the president will say because for the last few weeks he has traveled to Iowa, Michigan, and Arizona to lay out programs like items at a yard sale. He's promoting lower mortgage insurance rates, free community college, new consumer protections, a paid family-leave plan, and new financing for infrastructure projects. His biggest thematic thrust revolves around a tax swap: increased rates for the wealthy to pay for special targeted relief for the middle class. ""I'm kind of in a rush,"" the president said last week in Cedar Falls, Iowa. ""So I didn't want to wait until the State of the Union to share some of my ideas and some of my plans."" The president is going to be aggressive, optimistic, and liberated in this new thrust, according to one White House aide who has seen the speech. Whereas in the past the president has promised that economic stability is around the corner, now he will declare that it has arrived. He will try to turn his claim of vindication for his past policies into political capital for a set of policies he says will allow the middle class to thrive. In the past the president has had to hedge any good news about the economy against the reality that the majority of the country didn't feel the progress. According to one Cabinet official, Tuesday night's speech will focus less on those left behind and more on those who have made it through the last few years because of their grit, pluck, and reliance on Obama administration policies. In keeping with that idea, the president has invited Americans who fit that description as guests. One woman was able to expand her small business through a Small Business Administration loan. Another is a veteran of Afghanistan who has returned home because of Obama's commitment to end combat there. Another is a student who received a loan with help from the Income-Based Repayment Plan and who has health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. The public has been wisely resistant to claims that the economy has improved. Sure, some economic indicators are on the upswing, but chaos and a reversal of fortune are always around the corner. But heading into Tuesday night, there are some suggestions that actual optimism may be fluttering to stay alive. In a CBS poll last week, 53 percent rated the economy as ""good."" That's a 13-point jump since October and the first time a majority of the public has held that view since 2007, the start of the Great Recession. A recent Gallup poll found that Americans' assessment of their personal finances is as high as it has been since 2007. But public opinion is fickle, and the thaw has some way to go. In a new Washington Post poll, 41 percent see the economy in positive terms, compared with 27 percent who expressed that view in October. That may be heartening for the White House, but it means 60 percent still see the economy in negative terms. If middle-class voters don't see their lives reflected in the strong economic statistics--steady economic growth, 58 consecutive months of job gains, and a deficit that is a manageable percentage of GDP--the president hopes they will see themselves in the programs he is proposing. A White House aide says that when the president talks about his plans for a week of paid sick leave, tax breaks for two-earner couples, and expanding the child care tax credit, he will connect with people by showing he understands the specific challenges of their daily struggles. The president has suggested paying for these middle-class proposals by closing loopholes that benefit the wealthy and raising the capital gains rate.* An administration official affirms the political intent behind this Robin Hood approach: forcing Republicans who oppose the president's agenda to defend the wealthy at a time when a vast majority of the public already thinks the economic system is tilted in favor of the wealthy. ""It's going to be pretty dangerous to support not closing the trust fund loophole to pay for community college,"" the official said. Republicans respond that the president is putting forward programs to raise his approval ratings that have no chance of passing and only seek to demonize Republicans. ""If he is going to go to his corner, we're going to go to our corner,"" says an adviser to House GOP leadership characterizing the likely Republican response. If the president were really interested in reforming the tax code, as he says, he would be putting his political power behind that, say Republicans. Instead, by proposing new measures in the tax code that are complicated and costly, the president shows that he's not really serious about tax reform. That was one of the areas both sides say they want to work on together, but it's harder, say Republicans, if money you'd use to soften the blow of tax changes is being spent on the president's programs. The president likes to say that he is in the fourth quarter of his presidency, and in sports a lot of exciting things happen in the waning minutes. (Just ask the Packers.) It may be the first time a president has tried this transitive trick: By saying it will be exciting, perhaps he can make it so. Normally though, presidencies are not like sporting events. They are like Thanksgiving dinner: exciting at first, but by the time the drawn-out affair is over, everyone is tired and wants to take a nap. The State of the Union speech offers a window into Obama's challenge. It is full of conventions and restrictions. Like the lame duck designation, the State of the Union speech is hard to break out of its confinement. The president is trying, though, and although the biofeedback from his more skeptical audience Tuesday night might be the coldest of his presidency, he's not going to stop moving his wings. *Correction, Jan. 21, 2015, 10:25 p.m.: This article originally misstated that the president has proposed raising revenue for his economic program by lowering the capital gains rate. He has proposed raising the capital gains rate. (Return.) See more of Slate's State of the Union coverage."	Why President Obama Is Looking Forward to This State of the Union	['Obama']	[]

Whether these policies actually reduced crime is an open question, but it's incontestable that they opened the door to mass incarceration, police militarization, and a wide range of easily abused programs. In the last few years, however, some Democrats--like Attorney General Eric Holder--have tried to mend the mistakes of the past, working with Republicans in Congress to reform federal criminal justice policies. In 2013, Holder announced a plan to sidestep mandatory minimum sentences for low-level drug offenders. The goal, he explained, was to avert the five- to 10-year sentences that had swelled prison populations while harming minority and low-income communities. On Friday, Holder announced a new reform push aimed at asset forfeiture, a practice that lets authorities confiscate cash and property obtained through illegal means or used for illicit funds. While asset forfeiture has been legal for almost a century, it gained wide use during the 1980s in the war on drugs. As Dara Lind explains for Vox, state and federal asset forfeiture laws have been used to build police ""slush funds"" that get used for everything ""from buying armored cars and military weapons to $600 coffeemakers and party clowns."" A 1984 law allows state and local police forces to share the proceeds with their federal counterparts, and a Justice Department program called ""equitable sharing"" helped facilitate these transfers. ""Since 2008, thousands of local and state police agencies have made more than 55,000 seizures of cash and property worth $3 billion,"" reports the Washington Post. These funds are split between federal agencies and police forces, with the latter keeping up to 80 percent of the proceeds. This sounds like a good idea--using criminal property to fund crime-fighting. In practice, however, it's been a disaster. While citizens are allowed to challenge forfeitures--and while some departments have been sued--the vast majority of asset forfeiture happens with little oversight or accountability. The result is a parade of abuse and corruption, to say nothing of the problems inherent in a program that lets police confiscate property without due process afforded to criminal suspects. Indeed, according to a September Washington Post investigation, ""police have made cash seizures worth almost $2.5 billion from motorists and others without search warrants or indictments since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001."" Likewise, in the New Yorker, reporter Sarah Stillman detailed the extent to which countless people have been trapped by unscrupulous police departments and deprived of thousands of dollars of property and cash:"	Holder's Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Is the Newest Example of Democrats Fixing Failed Drug War Policies	[]	[]
20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/one_year_in_colorado_s_great_pot_experiment_has_been_a_sweeping_success.html	"Legal retail weed in Colorado turned one year old this month. While legalization remains more experimental than established at this point, the early returns make a compelling case that the first year was a sweeping regulatory success in the Rocky Mountain State. Exhibit A: what didn't happen in 2014. Despite the nightmare scenarios that anti-legalization advocates foretold, there was nothing to suggest a major jump in marijuana use among Colorado teens. The number of drug-related crimes in the state held steady or dropped. And the spike in traffic fatalities resulting from drugged driving that naysaying opponents had predicted failed to materialize. Yes, a lot could still change as the nascent retail market matures, but it's now clear that the state's first-of-its-kind experiment with recreational weed is off to a blazing start. Colorado voted to make recreational pot legal in late 2012, and the state spent the next year crafting an innovative licensing system to tax and regulate retail sales, which then began on New Year's Day 2014. The rollout has gone so well that Gov. John Hickenlooper, who once said Colorado voters were ""reckless"" to legalize weed, has changed his tune. ""To date, evidence shows that our regulatory system is beginning to work,"" the Democrat declared during his State of the State speech Thursday. Likewise, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said he's now ""cautiously optimistic"" about how things will ultimately pan out in Colorado. That doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement until you remember that his Justice Department still classifies pot on par with heroin. Even some Republican state lawmakers who originally opposed legalization have done an about-face now that they've seen the new policy in action. ""I just [originally] had the same knee-jerk opinion as all of the other elected officials,"" state Sen. David Balmer told the Wall Street Journal last week. Think tanks from both sides of the aisle have also offered their own qualified endorsements. The Brookings Institution has called the rollout ""largely successful,"" while a Cato Institute working paper found the new law ""had minimal impact on marijuana use and the outcomes sometimes associated with use."" That's not to suggest that the retail rollout has been perfect--it hasn't. There has been plenty of justified handwringing about inexperienced users accidentally overindulging by consuming more-potent-than-expected weed, or mistaking a pot-infused brownie as a single serving when in reality it was meant for a party of 10. The number of pot-related calls to Denver's Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center last year reportedly topped 200 by the end of November, nearly twice the number made during all of 2013. And, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, some local hospitals also saw an increase in the number of patients arriving in their waiting rooms while uncomfortably high. But there is only so much we can glean from that anecdotal evidence; the more immediate takeaway when it comes to safety is that despite the increase in users and freak-outs, pot-related deaths and serious injuries have remained nearly nonexistent. Things are on pace to get even better this year. State regulators are at work tweaking the rules to address those existing safety concerns. They're ramping up potency testing and considering changing how edibles are packaged. There's good reason to believe that Maureen Dowd's next canna-venture to Colorado will provide a much more mellow high than her first one. Pot proponents and state regulators, meanwhile, can point to more than simply the absence of negatives for proof of their success. Retail and medical weed generated more than $60 million in tax and licensing revenue for the state in 2014, the lion's share of which is helping to pay for school construction and the regulatory system that legalization requires. Opponents looking to nitpick can--and do--point to the fact that the total is a far cry from the $100 million windfall that state officials predicted at the start of last year. But even though legalization advocates hyped a major influx in tax revenue as a selling point, evaluating legal weed on a metric tied so tightly with consumption has always been an awkward proposition. The goal, after all, was never to encourage more people to light up a joint or gobble down a brownie. More revenue would be better, but too much more would represent its own type of problem. Still, comparing actual tax revenues to expected ones can serve as an imperfect proxy for one of the state's chief goals: moving sales from the illegal and medical markets into the retail one, where the transactions can be better-regulated and more heavily taxed. That remains a challenge for the state, particularly given how easy it is to get a prescription to buy medical marijuana. Still, even in that respect, 2014 finished with good news. While medical marijuana made up more than half of pot legally sold in the state last year, sales dropped 17 percent to their lowest monthly total of the year in November, the most recent month for which the state has tallied the numbers. It's just one month, of course, but it at least raises the possibility that the retail market is beginning to attract some users who might have otherwise opted for cheaper medical weed. In a perfect world, the retail market would have already resulted in the end of the black market, but each new dollar in taxes last year was one more than the state would have had otherwise. Focusing on only the incoming side of the ledger also doesn't tell the full story. According to a 2010 Harvard study, Colorado was spending an estimated $145 million every year enforcing its marijuana laws. It's safe to assume that the state was able to spend significantly less last year now that retail weed is legal. Fewer pot-related arrests, meanwhile, mean a more racially fair justice system, while simultaneously decreasing the societal and economic costs of incarceration. So, case closed? Of course not. It remains to be seen how the consumers will react as more states get in on the legalization action, or what impact eventual consolidation in the pot business will have on the product and the user experience. But, one year in, the outlook for the state's great pot experiment is getting less hazy by the day."	One Year In, Colorado's Great Pot Experiment Has Been a Sweeping Success	[]	[]
21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/hillary_clinton_will_face_no_serious_democratic_opponent_her_campaign_team.html	"The Hillary Clinton campaign exists in something like a state of quantum uncertainty. On one hand, it's there. There are staffers and strategists and donors who are preparing for the start of the Democratic presidential primaries. But Clinton herself hasn't agreed to run, and until she does, this organization is the equivalent of Schrodinger's cat--both alive and not-so-alive. But even in its uncertain state, this quantum campaign is practically the only game in town. Without announcing a candidacy--or even signaling a decision--Clinton has amassed a team of big-name Democratic operatives. On Tuesday, for example, the not-quite Clinton campaign enlisted Joel Benenson as chief strategist and Jim Margolis as media adviser. Benenson comes from Team Obama, having worked as lead pollster on both of the president's campaigns, while Margolis is a longtime adviser to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Also joining the Clinton effort are two other Obama pollsters--John Anzalone and David Binder--and rising operative Robby Mook, who managed Terry McAuliffe's 2013 campaign for Virginia governor and is expected to handle day-to-day operations for Hillary 2016. Former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina is leading the pro-Clinton Priorities USA super PAC, while--as Alex Seitz-Wald reports for MSNBC--Jennifer Palmieri, a former spokeswoman for John Edwards and the current White House communications director, is ""said to be in the mix"" to lead Clinton's communications team. And White House adviser John Podesta--who served in the Bill Clinton administration, managed Obama's 2008 transition, and led the Center for American Progress--will join the Clinton operation next month. Most measures of Hillary Clinton's inevitability rely on polls, and for good reason. By the polls, Clinton is absolutely dominant. In the most recent Huffpost Pollster average of the Democratic primary field, Clinton takes 62 percent of the vote. Her closest competitor, Elizabeth Warren, earns just 12.3 percent of the vote. The sitting vice president, Joe Biden, receives even less, at 9.6 percent. President Obama aside, there's no one in the Democratic Party as popular as Clinton. At the same time, polls aren't durable. A sudden change in the landscape--an immensely appealing alternative, for instance--could destroy Clinton's polling advantage. The real measure of strength in a presidential primary isn't polls, it's institutional strength. The candidate with the greatest party support--from activists and professionals to lawmakers and donors--almost always wins the nomination, even if he or she stumbles in the actual contests. Clinton's problem in 2008 was that she couldn't consolidate the party. There were powerful dissenters, and they coalesced behind another, equally viable candidate in the form of Barack Obama. Yes, there are still anti-Clinton dissenters in the Democratic Party. But unlike in 2008, they don't seem to have an institutional base. Indeed, if these hiring choices are any indication, the large bulk of the party's machinery is already in Clinton's corner. Take Margolis. The fact of his relationship with Reid is a huge deal, given the extent to which Reid encouraged and supported Obama in his presidential bid. It's a sign of lowered resistance to Clinton. The same is true of her support from key members of Team Obama. If there were a viable anti-Clinton faction, odds are good it would draw from the last party fight. But the veterans of 2008 aren't interested in tackling Clinton again--they want to fight under one standard. The Republican field is larger and more fractured than the Democratic one, but this basic rule still applies. The candidate with the most institutional support is the candidate most likely to win the nomination. And ""institutional support"" goes beyond the billionaires and Northeastern hedge fund managers; it includes South Carolina precinct captains, Texas county officials, Iowa activists, red-state governors, and everyone else with any influence in Republican politics. If you want to know if someone stands a chance of winning--if Sen. Rand Paul is more viable than he looks or if Gov. Scott Walker has a shot at rounding the bases--look to his staffing and his endorsements. And to that point, while Jeb Bush looks like the favorite, we don't know how deep his support goes. It's possible that he's in Clinton's present position--the consensus choice of the entire party--but it's far more likely that he's in Clinton's position circa 2007: strong, but not quite dominant, and still very vulnerable."

Riots in Tompkins Square in 1988 earned it some headlines but didn't stop its creeping advance. It moved on to lower Harlem, then jumped the river to Park Slope. Williamsburg and Fort Greene followed; today, it threatens even Bedford-Stuyvesant. New York isn't the only city where it spreads. San Francisco, Washington, and Boston have arguably been even more affected by it. Seattle, Atlanta, and Chicago have experienced it on a large scale, too. The ""it,"" as you may have guessed, is gentrification. If you live in one of these cities, you probably think you know how it works. Artists, bohemians, and gay couples come first. They move into run-down--but charming and historic--homes and loft spaces close to the urban core. Houses are restored. Funky coffee shops appear. Public safety improves. Then rents and home prices start to go up. The open-minded, diversity-loving creative types who were the first wave of gentrifiers give way to lawyers, bankers, and techies. As rents and home prices continue to rise, the earlier residents--often lower-income people of color--are forced out. That's the story, at least. Read the Atlantic's City Lab, and you regularly encounter titles such as ""Why Gentrification Is So Hard to Stop"" and ""There's Basically No Way Not to Be a Gentrifier."" Liberals and conservatives alike agree that it is bad (although liberals blame developers, and conservatives blame onerous regulations that limit development). Even Jezebel has joined in. It recently chided Taylor Swift (who earlier this year traded her comparatively affordable $2 million apartment in Nashville for a $20 million penthouse in Tribeca) for including an ""obtuse"" ""gentrification anthem"" in her latest album. That gentrification displaces poor people of color by well-off white people is a claim so commonplace that most people accept it as a widespread fact of urban life. It's not. Gentrification of this sort is actually exceedingly rare. The socio-economic status of most neighborhoods is strikingly stable over time. When the ethnic compositions of low-income black neighborhoods do change, it's typically because Latinos and other immigrants move into a neighborhood--and such in-migration is probably more beneficial than harmful. As for displacement--the most objectionable feature of gentrification--there's actually very little evidence it happens. In fact, so-called gentrifying neighborhoods appear to experience less displacement than nongentrifying neighborhoods. It's time to retire the term gentrification altogether. Fourteen years ago, Maureen Kennedy and Paul Leonard of the Brookings Institution wrote that gentrification ""is a politically loaded concept that generally has not been useful in resolving growth and community change debates because its meaning is unclear."" That's even truer today. Some U.S. cities do have serious affordability problems, but they're not the problems critics of gentrification think they are. Worse, the media focus on gentrification has obscured problems that actually are serious: the increasing isolation of poor, minority neighborhoods and the startling spread of extreme poverty. * * * Gentrification, as it is commonly understood, is about more than rising housing prices. It's about neighborhoods changing from lower-income, predominantly black or Latino neighborhoods to high-income, predominantly white neighborhoods. Demographers and sociologists have identified neighborhoods where this kind of displacement has occurred. Wicker Park in Chicago, Harlem and Chelsea in Manhattan, Williamsburg in Brooklyn--these places really did gentrify. Sociologists and demographers captured these changes in case studies and ethnographies. But starting a decade ago, economists began to ask more nuanced questions about the displacement the other social sciences were documenting. Simply documenting that low-income people were being forced out of a neighborhood whose housing prices were rising didn't mean in and of itself that gentrification was causing displacement, they noted. Poor people often move away from nongentrifying neighborhoods, too. Indeed, low-income people move frequently for a variety of reasons. The real question was whether low-income residents moved away from ""gentrifying"" neighborhoods at a higher rate than they did from nongentrifying neighborhoods. One of the first people to explore this question in a sophisticated way was University of Washington economist Jacob Vigdor. In 2002, Vigdor examined what had happened in Boston between 1974 and 1997, a period of supposedly intense gentrification. But Vigdor found no evidence that poor people moved out of gentrifying neighborhoods at a higher than normal rate. In fact, rates of departure from gentrifying neighborhoods were actually lower. It wasn't just Boston. In 2004, Columbia University economists Lance Freeman and Frank Braconi conducted a similar study of gentrification in New York City in the 1990s. They too found that low-income residents of ""gentrifying"" neighborhoods were less likely to move out of the neighborhood than low-income residents of neighborhoods that had none of the typical hallmarks of gentrification. Of course, displacement is not the only way in which gentrification could harm the poor. Residents of gentrifying neighborhoods might stay put but suffer from rising rents. Freeman and Braconi found that rents did rise in gentrifying neighborhoods in New York. But rising rents had an unexpected effect: As rents rose, residents moved less. ""The most plausible interpretation,"" the authors concluded, ""may be the simplest: As neighborhoods gentrify, they also improve in many ways that may be as appreciated by their disadvantaged residents as by their more affluent ones."" In 2010, University of Colorado-Boulder economist Terra McKinnish, along with Randall Walsh and Kirk White, examined gentrification across the nation as a whole over the course of the 1990s. McKinnish and her colleagues found that gentrification created neighborhoods that were attractive to minority households, particularly households with children or elderly homeowners. They found no evidence of displacement or harm. While most of the income gains in these neighborhoods went to white college graduates under the age of 40 (the archetypical gentrifiers), black high school graduates also saw their incomes rise. They also were more likely to stay put. In short, black households with high school degrees seemed to benefit from gentrification. McKinnish, White, and Walsh aren't the only researchers whose work suggests that blacks often benefit from gentrification. In his book, Stuck in Place: Urban Neighborhoods and the End of Progress Toward Racial Equality, sociologist Patrick Sharkey took a close look at black neighborhoods that saw significant changes to their ethnic composition between 1970 and 1990. He found that when the composition of black neighborhoods changed, it wasn't because whites moved in. That rarely happens. For black communities, neighborhood change happens when Latinos begin to arrive. Sometimes these changes can be difficult, resulting as they often do in new political leaders and changes to the character of the communities. But Sharkey's research suggests they also bring real benefits. Black residents, particularly black youth, living in more diverse neighborhoods find significantly better jobs than peers with the same skill sets who live in less diverse neighborhoods. In short, writes Sharkey, ""There is strong evidence that when neighborhood disadvantage declines, the economic fortunes of black youth improve, and improve rather substantially."" In other words, the problem isn't so much that gentrification hurts black neighborhoods; it's that it too often bypasses them. Harvard sociologists Robert Sampson and Jackelyn Hwang have shown that neighborhoods that are more than 40 percent black gentrify much more slowly than other neighborhoods. The apparent unwillingness of other ethnic groups to move into and invest in predominantly black communities in turn perpetuates segregation and inequality in American society. While critics of gentrification decry a process that is largely imaginary, they've missed a far more serious problem--the spread of extreme poverty. Last year, economists Joseph Cortright of the Portland, Oregon-based Impresa Consulting and Dillon Mahmoudi of Portland State University set out to examine how America's poorest urban neighborhoods had changed over time. They started by going back to 1970 and identifying 1,100 census tracts--the county subregions that demographers use as a basic unit of analysis--located within 10 miles of the central business districts in the 51 largest cities with high levels of poverty. They then asked a simple question: How did the socio-economic status of these places change during the next 40 years? The answer: Most had not. Two-thirds of high-poverty neighborhoods in 1970 were still high-poverty neighborhoods in 2010. Only about 100 neighborhoods saw their poverty rates decline to below the national average. The typical metropolitan area had one or two high-poverty neighborhoods that could conceivably be described as gentrifying. However, Cortright and Mahmoudi did find another, more significant change. Whereas in 1970, 1,100 census tracts within 10 miles of central business districts had poverty rates of 30 percent or higher, by 2010, the number of poor census tracts had jumped to 3,100. In other words, the number of high-poverty areas close to central business districts had nearly tripled. To make matters worse, the number of people living in extreme poverty in those areas had doubled. The residents of these neighborhoods are disproportionately black. * * * If gentrification occurs so infrequently--and if it may help rather than hurt existing residents--why are so many people so upset about it? There are at least a couple of reasons. The first has to do with where it happens. According to Cortright and Mahmoudi, just three cities--New York, Chicago, and Washington--accounted for one-third of all census tracts that saw poverty rates decline from above 30 percent in 1970 to below 15 percent in 2010. Half of all the areas in the nation that ""gentrified"" (if we still want to call it that) were located in those three cities. No wonder New Yorkers and Washingtonians think gentrification is a big deal. The other reason we continue to talk about gentrification probably has more to do with middle-class fears. Housing prices in America's most expensive coastal cities have risen sharply since the end of the Great Depression. Expressing concern about ""gentrification"" in those cities may simply be another way of expressing concern about rising housing prices. But in fact, different types of cities have very different kinds of affordability problems. In coastal cities, the cost of housing is often far higher than the cost of construction. That is primarily because supply is constrained. Builders in Washington can't turn Adams Morgan's row houses into a high-rise apartment district, so row house prices rise. High demand plays a role too, of course. Some of that demand reflects a preference for older, close-in housing stock. The fact that global cities deliver high wages to the most skilled workers is almost certainly more important though. Gentrification isn't the cause of these cities' affordable housing problem. It's a symptom. There's a large group of cities with a very different affordability problem. These are Rust Belt cities such as Detroit where housing sells at or below the cost of construction. These are cities with an income problem. Cities where the cost of housing is far higher than the cost of construction require different policy solutions than cities where the situation is reversed. Coastal cities can benefit from requirements that developers set aside a portion of new units as affordable housing, although some economists argue that such zoning requirements can actually backfire by raising the cost of new housing even more, and all agree that the effect of such set-asides will be minimal. It certainly won't reverse the transformation of these cities into enclaves for the rich. In contrast, many residents of Rust Belt cities would benefit from rent subsidies (or cash subsidies, period), not set-asides. Yet policymakers all too often fail to fit remedies to the circumstances. Rust Belt cities require set-asides just like San Francisco, while Bay Area institutions such as Stanford hand out generous housing subsidies to new faculty, a measure that only serves to drive housing prices up, instead of searching for ways to increase supply. Retiring the term gentrification won't do anything to address these problems, of course. But it will remove a distraction. Let's examine how neighborhoods really change and why some don't. Let's debate supply constraints (in addition to providing affordable housing) in the San Franciscos of America and figure out how to provide rent subsidies in the Rust Belt. It won't be as fun as decrying or defending gentrification, but at least it will be directed at problems that are real."

For the Slate offices, the water cooler story of December was the recent turmoil at the New Republic. There were different kinds of gossip. ""What this means for journalism's future"" gossip. ""My friend who works there and what they will do now"" gossip. And there was also ""When I worked there"" gossip, since many Slate staffers have also worked for the New Republic. And thankfully, this discussion surfaced this bit of archival treasure, a 1986 C-SPAN interview with reporter-researcher interns from the New Republic. It features current Slate Group editor-in-chief Jacob Weisberg and Slate national correspondent William Saletan. -Jeff Friedrich Who found the video? Jacob Weisberg: I just saw a link to the video on Twitter. I had no choice but to watch it immediately. How do you think the internships of the 1980s differ from today? William Saletan: My recollection of those days (and I don't know whether it's accurate) was that it was really hard to get an internship where you could write and be published. The good news is, now it's a lot easier to get that kind of internship, because the old media elite has given way to content-churning websites. The bad news is, being published no longer guarantees you much of an audience, or even the education of being carefully edited. Weisberg: There's probably no place today that's as good as TNR was back then to start a career as an opinion journalist. Slate aspires to be the same kind of talent farm, and I think we come close. One of the many talents we launched was Frank Foer. It's easier now than it was then for young writers to get published and find an audience, but it's much harder to stand out from the much bigger crowd. If you were just starting out in your writing careers today, do you think you would have applied to the current iteration of the TNR researcher-reporter internship? Saletan: Yeah, I'd probably try the same thing again, if I were coming out of college with the same level of inexperience. But if I were going back to those days now, having enjoyed the life I chose, I'd try the road I didn't take, which was to write music. I'm pretty sure that would have ended badly, but it might have been fun to find out. I think that for a lot of us who came of age in the Marty Peretz era, his sale of the magazine was the big upheaval, in terms of ending that era. The mass resignations feel like the other shoe falling. Not really bearing on former TNR people, but a total bummer for our friends and colleagues who were there at the end and have quit. What did you do after you left the reporting program? Where else did you go before you arrived at Slate? Saletan: I went back and finished college, then I worked at the Hotline, then I wrote a book and freelanced for a bunch of magazines. And then one day Mike Kinsley called me and told me he was starting an online magazine. People were laughing at him. That was 18 years ago. Jacob, how has Will changed since that video? Weisberg: Will is EXACTLY the same, and I mean that in the best way: same brilliant analytical mind, same delighted guffaw, same weird immunity to gaining weight. Will, how about Jacob? Saletan: Jacob worked incredibly hard and was fearless. He took down people like Roger Stone, who thought they could charm or bully him. I think he understood that life is short, and you should use your time well, and you don't have to back down from anyone just because you're young. That put a little extra backbone in the rest of us. I think he's still doing that. Slate is what TNR was, and then some. That guy in the video is reason No. 1."

The push to greenlight construction of the Keystone XL pipeline cleared its biggest procedural hurdle in the Senate on Monday, making its passage in the coming weeks all but inevitable. Republicans are in a win-win situation here: If the president signs the bill into law, the GOP can point to the pipeline as proof they're delivering on their campaign promises. If Obama vetoes, he hands Republicans ammunition to argue ahead of 2016 that it's the Democrats who are responsible for Washington's gridlock. Either way, the new GOP-controlled Congress will be off to a running start. But politics isn't always the zero-sum game it's made out to be. A Republican victory on Keystone won't preclude the president from finding one of his own. To do that, though, Obama will need to finally say once and for all whether he thinks the pipeline should be built. That question has become a high-profile litmus test in the larger climate debate--one the president has gone to great lengths to avoid taking for the past six years and counting. On the rare occasion Obama has spoken publicly about the 1,700-mile pipeline, he's been careful to make his veto threat about the process, not the pipeline. He has maintained that the State Department simply needs more time to weigh the economic pros against the environmental cons of a project that would carry 830,000 barrels of carbon-heavy crude per day from Alberta's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. That wait-and-see approach has left Obama in an awkward position--one that's drawn fire from pipeline supporters and opponents alike--but has arguably proved to be politically beneficial to date. But now that Republicans have the votes to pass their fast-tracking bill, the president can't afford to hide behind the bureaucratic red tape of his own creation any longer. Pipeline opponents argue that the project would significantly accelerate the development of oil sands, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet. Industry groups and their more business-focused friends, meanwhile, can't imagine putting climate concerns above the nation's near-term economic and national security interests. They contend that the oil deposits will be exploited one way or the other, so the United States might as well get in on the action. So what should Obama do once the Keystone bill reaches his desk? He could try to trade his approval of the project for something else on his environmental wish list. As the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza has pointed out, the pipeline makes for the perfect bargaining chip for Obama: It's a top priority for Republicans' but toward the bottom of the president's list of concerns. While Obama's clearly not a fan of the project, he also appears skeptical of climate advocates' doomsaying when it comes to the pipeline's construction. The president, then, could offer his signature in exchange for something that is squarely on his own climate radar, be it a large green infrastructure project or protecting his climate regulations, like the new limits on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry his administration is unveiling this week, or the carbon limits on existing coal- and gas-fired power plants the White House hopes to finalize this summer. Greenlighting the pipeline might enrage environmentalists who have questioned the president's commitment to slowing climate change, but any short-term outrage would be a small price to pay to protect EPA rules that will have a much larger impact on global emissions than the pipeline ever could--rules that Republicans have made clear they plan to target this year. Such a move would also keep alive the sliver of hope that the president and congressional Republicans might be able to work together during the next two years. The other option for Obama would be to stop hiding behind the State Department review and just say he won't approve the pipeline on its merits alone. While the project would have only a marginal impact on global emissions, the president could make a forceful case that every little bit matters in the larger fight to combat man-made global warming. He could also argue that the pipeline likely won't create nearly as many jobs as its backers claim, and point to the fact that the current economics of oil could make the project largely moot. By the EPA's own estimates, the tar sands oil that would pump through the pipeline would add 18.7 million additional metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere each year than would be produced by conventional oil--a sliver of the 5.5 billion tons the United States was responsible for in 2011, the most recent year for which we have comprehensive international data. In the grand scheme of carbon emissions, then, coming out against the pipeline would be a largely symbolic gesture in place of the more pragmatic and wonky efforts that Obama has tended to opt for when it comes to the climate. He'd be sending what amounts to a rallying cry to the environmentalists and their climate-conscious allies, one that would be greeted with cheers from the left heading into next year's U.N. climate convention in Paris, where the president will have to convince other world leaders that the U.S. government does not think that global warming is a hoax, despite what they are hearing from GOP leaders in Congress. Using his executive authority to kill the pipeline would also make it clear that, finally freed from electoral politics, Obama is serious about using every tool he has to go it alone on the climate. Neither option would cancel out the Republicans' short-term political gains from their Keystone vote, but either would help the president cement his long-term environmental legacy. The only way Obama can fail to capitalize on the long game that he has been playing on Keystone is to continue to take bureaucratic cover. Doing that would waste a golden opportunity to turn a surefire short-term political loss into a long-term policy victory.	Two Ways Obama Can Still Win on Keystone	['Obama']	['creation']
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/mitt_romney_s_reasons_to_run_the_former_republican_presidential_candidate.html	"When Jeb Bush formed his leadership PAC, he said he wanted it to encourage other like-minded candidates. It worked. He encouraged Mitt Romney. The two-time presidential candidate is now seriously considering another run. ""It's real,"" says a veteran of the last go-around. ""He's probably going to run."" When I asked another veteran of the Romney campaign, who spoke to the candidate this weekend, he explained why Romney had moved into high gear: ""Bush stepped on the gas."" For months, Romney has been contemplating another presidential candidacy. He has told donors that he would be interested in running, but left them with the impression that his interest was conditional. He told one that he wouldn't run if Jeb Bush ran. A number of his backers told him that he could wait to get in--let the other candidates splash around and look amateurish and then swoop in. He had the fundraising network and staffers who could build a campaign quickly. But then Bush rushed headlong into the race and started asking for commitments from donors. He also started hiring staffers. That kicked off Romney's more aggressive posture. He could no longer wait--as he once thought he might be able to--because his old edifice was being eaten away. Last Friday in a meeting with donors, Romney wanted to send a signal to stop the commitments to Bush and buy himself some time. Some of his donors had already participated in fundraisers for Bush. One donor I spoke to on Monday has already switched his allegiance to Team Bush. He attended one of Bush's New York stops last week, and came away impressed by the former Florida governor's authenticity, his forceful articulation of his positions, and his plan for running a different kind of race. Accounts differ on whether Romney intended to light up the phone bank as much as he has. His message intended to freeze donors also created pressure to move. Romney supporters say they have received a very positive response and the once and future candidate is now trying to capitalize on that. The 67-year-old Romney has called supporters and staffers from his last campaign in key states such as New Hampshire and Iowa to see how many have defected to Bush and to see if he could rebuild the machinery to run again.  Those who have talked to him say a decision could come within 30 days. His argument to his former supporters, says one who spoke with him, is that he came very close in the last election against an incumbent president with a good economy. He wouldn't face an opponent with those kinds of advantages again. (Romney ran against Obama arguing that the economy was terrible; now its health in 2012 is part of the case why he should run again.) He also feels, says one supporter who has spoken with him recently, that he would be crazy to pass up a chance to challenge a ""beatable candidate"" like Hillary Clinton and let someone like Sen. Rand Paul have a shot at it. Supporters say that what's still true about Romney is that he has the skills that would be useful in the White House. Since his defeat, a series of management failures in government agencies like the IRS, Veterans Affairs, and the botched rollout of Obamacare have demonstrated a need for someone with Romney's talent for turning around big institutions. Romney and his boosters also say his foreign policy assessment about Russia was validated after the election, giving him standing in a field that at the moment doesn't contain anyone with substantial foreign policy experience. Romney's supporters also say that while he may have flaws, other candidates do too and he has advantages they don't have. He has run before and they describe him as more relaxed and looser. With his name recognition and ability to raise ready cash, Romney could possibly take advantage of a shortened campaign calendar that party strategists say will favor well-funded candidates who can compete in multiple states and afford the complicated delegate husbanding operation. The big question for Romney to consider is this: Now that he has enjoyed a resuscitation of his reputation among Republicans, could he handle coming in fifth in a primary or enduring the everyday indignities of a modern campaign? That would be an especially deep price to pay if he shows the more personal side that he--and particularly his wife, Ann Romney--believe he was never allowed to show in the last race. That reliance on the hidden Romney is another possible trap. During the last two presidential races, Romney has been dogged by accusations that he has no core convictions and changes his positions opportunistically. A third candidacy based on the idea of presenting the ""real Romney"" might be better, but it will also animate that underlying charge because voters might conclude that anyone who needs three tries to find their authentic self might not have a good map of the territory. If Romney were to run again and win, it would earn him the Reagan-esque label that he and all other Republicans covet. The Gipper set the modern high water mark for redemption when he won the presidency in 1980 after two failed attempts. In that campaign, he also did something Romney will likely have to do. He defeated a primary opponent whose last name was Bush."	Why Romney Wants to Run	['Clinton', 'Paul', 'Romney', 'Obama']	[]

""Mike Dukakis, you know, he can't get a job mowing lawns,"" he joked. ""We just brutalize whoever loses."" It's an accurate observation, but for Romney, it hasn't been true. While he ended 2012 a scorned member of the Republican family, he has spent the past year a virtual kingmaker. His endorsement carried weight in the 2014-midterm primaries and he was a sought-after surrogate on the campaign stump. This ""failed"" nominee was so important to the GOP that his ""ideas"" summit, held last summer in Utah, drew the whole field of party luminaries and presidential contenders, from former running mate Rep. Paul Ryan to Sen. Rand Paul, Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Rob Portman, and former Gov. Mike Huckabee. The former presidential nominee turned influential insider is more than just a nice sinecure for a politician in the twilight of his career. It's the foundation for another presidential run. Which is why it was no surprise when, on Friday, the former standard-bearer announced that he was, once more, a presidential contender. ""I want to be president,"" he told a group of 30 donors in New York. And while he hasn't begun the long process of building a campaign, close advisers believe he's serious.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/elizabeth_warren_does_well_in_peter_hart_focus_group_voters_not_excited.html	"When 12 voters gathered in Aurora, Colorado, for a political focus group on Thursday night, it wasn't surprising to hear them compete to see who could bash politicians more. ""If we got rid of every member of Congress and elected new people tomorrow who had no experience, I don't think we could do any worse,"" said Charlie Loan, who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. When the group was asked to come up with phrases members of Congress should wear on wrist bracelets, they suggested ""Don't trust me, I lie,"" ""Looking out for me,"" and ""Two Faced."" But one politician escaped the voters' ire: Elizabeth Warren. Six of the 12 said they would like to have Warren over to their house to talk, more than any other possible 2016 presidential contender they were asked about. They said she was ""down to earth"" and ""knowledgeable."" When asked a separate question about which politician they would like to have live next door, they picked Warren over every other contender as well. Jenny Howard, an accountant with student-loan debt who voted for Romney in 2012 and Sen. John McCain in 2008, also liked Warren: ""If she ran, she could be the next president because she is personable and knowledgeable and has a good handle on what's going on in the country."" Peter Hart organized this Colorado focus group. Hart, a Democratic pollster for more than 40 years, helps conduct the Wall Street Journal/ NBC poll and has been holding these kinds of sessions for the past four presidential elections.  The focus group was the first of a series of such two-hour interviews of swing voters that Hart will do leading up to the 2016 presidential election, for the Annenberg Public Policy Center to track how voter sentiment changes. These people do not represent metaphysical certitude about the country's political opinion--it's only 12 people after all--and we are still far from the next election so much can change, but they offer glimpses of the current stirring in the public. Their desire for change, concerns about the economy (despite news that things are better), and interest in a candidate who cares about the middle class have appeared consistently in polls and other voter forums. The affection for Warren among the group of five self-described independents, three Republicans, and four Democrats may not tell us anything about the Massachusetts senator herself. It's possible that she is a vehicle through which they are signaling their desire for change, for something authentic and maybe new. Charlie Loan, an IT manager, says he voted the straight conservative line in the most recent election but he'd listen to what Warren had to say. ""The little I have seen and heard from her, she seems genuine--people from [Oklahoma] usually are. Since she was formerly devoted to the Republican Party, maybe she fits in the middle somewhere, which is where I would like to see most of them be. She is clearly well-educated and seems level-headed."" If Warren is a possible vessel for change, so too is Sen. Rand Paul, whom several of the conservatives found intriguing. (Sen. Ted Cruz wasn't mentioned, even though he, like Paul and Warren, is also trying to position himself as an outsider on the inside.) Paul had a bit of the crossover appeal that Warren had. ""He's a reasonable choice,"" said Andrew Regan, who described himself as a strong Democrat. ""I would consider him, but I don't know who the Democratic nominee is going to be."" Regan was emblematic of the strong desire for something new. Despite his ideological affiliations, he was happy to see Republicans in control of Congress. ""I'm happy to see that Republicans took Congress. Instead of a 'Do Nothing' Congress we have a 'Do Something' Congress."" Once a Democratic nominee is chosen, it's almost certain that Regan, a self-employed beekeeper, will vote as he always has. That's what voters usually do. The same is true with conservatives who express an openness for Warren. But Warren's authenticity, anti-corporate message, and outsider status all reflect the desire for change that came across so clearly from most of the participants. The 2016 contenders who didn't fare well are also two of its marquee names: Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. Six of the 12 said they would back a law to bar all Bushes and Clintons from running. ""He's running off the Bush name and thinks that's something,"" said Howard. In a free-association exercise, the words people used to describe Bush included:  ""joke,"" ""no thank you,"" ""clown,"" ""interesting,"" ""don't need him,"" ""intriguing,"" ""greedy,"" and ""bad scene."" (By contrast, Paul was described as ""entertaining,"" ""interesting,"" ""very intriguing,"" ""honest,"" and ""freedom."") Mention of Hillary Clinton conjured ""hopeful,"" ""crazy,"" ""strong,"" ""spitfire,"" ""don't like her,"" ""untrustworthy,"" ""more of the same,"" and ""next candidate, please."" Although the antipathy toward Bush and Clinton was often specific, it also could be read as a broad dislike of American politics today. Not surprisingly, the economy was the issue everyone was most concerned about. Jobs numbers were solid again on Friday and the unemployment rate is at 5.6 percent (lower than Mitt Romney said it would be under his administration by the year 2017), but the good numbers didn't do anything to assuage the participants' worries. Though they said lower gas prices have helped, most were skeptical things were genuinely getting better. ""It's nice to have the extra money,"" said Susan Brink, a 56-year-old independent who voted for Barack Obama. ""But I do kind of feel like they give us a little bit to make us happy, and then they take it away."" Rick Lamutt, a right-leaning independent who works as ""a cable guy,"" said that despite the good numbers, he sees the truth of the real economy in all the houses he visits where family members are moving in together and struggling to make do. ""The simple fact is, regardless of what the numbers say, there's a lot of hurting people out there,"" he said. ""You've seen on the news, 'Everything's fine, the economy's great, there's jobs everywhere!' Well, if you want to make $9 an hour, you can go get a job, but if you want to make a wage that can support your family, good luck."" This pervasive feeling of economic insecurity drove what these voters are looking for in candidates, too. Kimberly Tyler, a 61-year-old veterinarian, wanted a candidate who understood the pinch of the middle-class lifestyle. ""Most in politics have money and it's a money game for them and they don't relate to the middle class, and everyone in the middle class is hanging on by their fingernails."" There's a long road before the election and while these views give us some idea of the mood, it's important to keep in mind that even these voters are a long way off from drawing any real conclusions about specific candidates. Hart asked everyone to place themselves at a racetrack that showed how far along they were in their thinking about the next presidential contest. Most said they were in the parking lot. One woman said she was in her car taking allergy medicine--she said she was allergic to both horses and politicians. When asked whom she'd like to see in the race, she replied, ""Superman."" But he hasn't even formed a leadership PAC yet."	Is Elizabeth Warren Who Voters Are Looking for in 2016?	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'McCain', 'Cruz', 'Paul', 'Obama', 'Warren']	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/charlie_hebdo_the_french_satirical_magazine_is_heroic_it_is_also_racist.html	"The editors and cartoonists murdered in Wednesday's attack on French magazine Charlie Hebdo are now martyrs for the cause of free speech. Threatened with death for publishing drawings of the prophet Mohammed meant to mock Islamic radicals, they refused to censor themselves, and so were gunned down. They died bravely for an ideal we all treasure. But their work featuring Mohammed could be sophomoric and racist. Not all of it; a cover image of the prophet about to be beheaded by a witless ISIS thug was trenchant commentary on how little Islamic radicalism has to do with the religion itself. But often, the cartoonists simply rendered Islam's founder as a hook-nosed wretch straight out of Edward Said's nightmares, seemingly for no purpose beyond antagonizing Muslims who, rightly or wrongly, believe that depicting Mohammed at all is blasphemous. This, in a country where Muslims are a poor and harassed minority, maligned by a growing nationalist movement that has used liberal values like secularism and free speech to cloak garden-variety xenophobia. France is the place, remember, where the concept of free expression has failed to stop politicians from banning headscarves and burqas. Charlie Hebdo may claim to be a satirical, equal-opportunity offender. But there's good reason critics have compared it to ""a white power mag."" As Jacob Canfield wrote in an eloquent post at the Hooded Utilitarian, ""White men punching down is not a recipe for good satire."" So Charlie Hebdo's work was both courageous and often vile. We should be able to keep both of these realities in our minds at once, but it seems like we can't. Much of the debate following the massacre has focused on the binary question of whether it's ever acceptable for Americans and Europeans to offend Muslim traditions. Should we defend depictions of Mohammed on free speech grounds? Or should we discourage them altogether? Jonathan Chait says the answer is obvious. ""The right to blaspheme religion is one of the most elemental exercises of political liberalism,"" he writes at New York magazine. ""One cannot defend the right without defending the practice."" New York Times columnist Ross Douthat concurs. If an act of blasphemy can land you on a hit list, he argues, it should be ""welcomed and defended"" as a defense of liberal values against thuggery. But it's wrong to approach this issue as an either-or question, to blaspheme or not blaspheme. Free speech allows us to say hateful, idiotic things without being punished by the government. But embracing that right means that we need to acknowledge when work is hateful or idiotic, and can't be defended on its own terms. We need to recognize, as Vox's Matt Yglesias argues today, that standing up for magazines like Charlie Hebdo is a ""regrettable"" necessity, in part because it provides cover for anti-Muslim backlash. ""Blasphemous, mocking images cause pain in marginalized communities,"" he writes. ""The elevation of such images to a point of high principle will increase the burdens on those minority groups."" And the more those groups are mistreated, the more angry radicals we can expect to see. So what should we do? We have to condemn obvious racism as loudly as we defend the right to engage in it. We have to point out when an ""edgy"" cartoon is just a crappy Islamophobic jab. We shouldn't pretend that every magazine cover with a picture of Mohammed is a second coming of The Satanic Verses. Making those distinctions isn't going to placate the sorts of militants who are already apt to tote a machine gun into a magazine office. But it is a way to show good faith to the rest of a marginalized community, to show that free speech isn't just about mocking their religion. It's hard to talk about these things today, when so many families, a country, and a profession are rightfully in mourning. But it's also necessary. At the moment, Google has offered almost $300,000 to Charlie Hebdo, so it can continue publishing. The Guardian Media Group has chipped in $150,000 of its own. And France's government has pledged more than 1 million euros. It's a powerful gesture in favor of free expression. But I'm not sure it's the kind of expression a government should want to pay for.

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/scott_walker_s_unexpected_defense_of_obamacare_the_wisconsin_governor_may.html	"Obamacare advocates have had a rough time of it lately. In November, the Obama administration admitted to erroneously overstating the number of enrollees by counting people who signed up for dental plans. In December, MIT economist and Affordable Care Act architect Jonathan Gruber got dissected by a House panel for a string of excruciatingly candid comments about the law's design. (Its success, Gruber had previously argued, was in part due to ""the stupidity of the American voter."") And this month, the New England Journal of Medicine is running a paper saying the ACA's supporters ""have good reason to worry"" about an upcoming Supreme Court decision that could gut the law. But on Wednesday--finally!--ACA defenders thought they may have caught a break. ""Republican Governor Caught on Tape Demolishing the Legal Case Against Obamacare,"" blared a ThinkProgress headline. In the piece, the site's justice editor Ian Millhiser detailed comments that Wisconsin Gov. (and potential 2016 Republican presidential contender) Scott Walker made to the Wall Street Journal in 2013 about his interpretation of the president's health care law. Walker's money quote is this: ""But, in the end, there's no real substantive difference between a federal exchange, or a state exchange, or the in-between, the hybrid, the partnership."" No, it's not exactly eye-popping. But Millhiser argues that the governor's comments could be relevant for the Supreme Court's upcoming decision in King v. Burwell. The plaintiffs in King argue that the plain reading of the ACA dictates that subsidies to make health insurance affordable for low-income people are only available to those who live in states that set up their own health insurance exchanges. In other words, the plaintiffs contend that if you purchase your health insurance through the federal exchange, the government can't give you a subsidy to help offset the cost. The government is the defendant in the case (the case's title refers to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell). Its lawyers argue that the Internal Revenue Service rule--used to clarify the intent of the law and allow the government to give you a subsidy--is legal. This is where foot-in-mouth-disease-carrier Jonathan Gruber comes in. Gruber was a key creator of the ACA, and in one video he says, ""What's important to remember politically about this is if you're a state and you don't set up an exchange, that means your citizens don't get their tax credits."" Opponents of the ACA use that quote to undergird their argument that subsidies are only available to people who buy health insurance through exchanges run by their home states. Gruber has been a slow-motion car accident for the ACA's defenders. So the discovery of years-old, on-camera comments from a prominent Republican that boost their argument should be a marvelous delight. Is that what they got? Of course, it depends on whom you ask. Chris Lillis, the Virginia state director of the unabashedly pro-ACA Doctors for America, celebrated the comments. ""Walker said what we all know: that this law was written in a way to provide subsidies to low-income Americans to get health insurance,"" he said. ""Full stop."" ""For those of us who support the law, what's great about this is that he said [these comments] on camera, so they're really unassailable,"" he added. And professor of social service administration and public health sciences at the University of Chicago Harold Pollack--also a vocal ACA supporter--also found Walker's comments helpful. ""It provides a valuable reminder that this is the way everyone approached the implementation of this law,"" he said. If Millhiser, Lillis, and Pollack are all correct, then Walker's comments could be a big problem, both for his political prospects and for his party's efforts to stop the ACA. Naturally, that's a big if. And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, doesn't buy it. ""The irony is, you have someone saying you have to read the ACA in context, and completely ignoring the broader context of Walker's remarks,"" he said. Cannon argues that Walker was making a narrow comparison between the state and federal exchanges in terms of how much control state governments would have over the law's implementation. ""As a gotcha? Come on,"" said Cannon. ""This is weak sauce. This is just lazy, awful, dumb stuff."" And Phil Kerpen, who runs the fiscal conservative advocacy organization American Commitment, was also unimpressed by ThinkProgress's finding. Walker ""correctly assessed the situation under the IRS rule and we all saw this interview years ago,"" Kerpen emailed. ""This is pure [Center for American Progress] spin for their health-insurance industry funders."" The Center for American Progress Action Fund runs ThinkProgress. Its 2013 corporate donors included America's Health Insurance Plans, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, and Blue Shield of California. But Cannon doesn't think this means Walker gets off scot-free. ""He is the only Republican governor who refused to establish an exchange but still put forward a proposal that relied on there being subsidies in a federal exchange,"" Cannon said. ""That was a pretty questionable move."" In other words, Walker might not have had an on-camera gotcha moment, but his policy shop operated under the assumption that the federal exchange customers would get subsidies. The Wisconsin State Journal detailed how the federal exchanges were ""a key aspect"" of the governor's 2013 health care proposal that he put forward as an alternative to accepting the Medicaid expansion offered under the ACA. ""You're going to hear some detractors claim that moving people to the private market or to the exchanges isn't affordable,"" Walker said at the time, according to Kaiser Health News. ""I think most people would find it hard to imagine that with the tax subsidies, that $19 a month is somehow not affordable. I think it is."" That means that the governor assumed people would be able to get subsidies for insurance purchased through the federal exchange. It's possible he assumed this while privately agreeing with the King v. Burwell plaintiffs' reading of the ACA. His office didn't respond to a request for comment. Regardless, Walker can expect substantial scrutiny of everything he's ever said about health care if he launches a presidential bid. Even if these charges are ""weak sauce,"" there could be more to come."	Did Scott Walker Just Become the Newest Obamacare Defender?	['Obama']	[]
