For the next two years, Democrats will have to deal with conservative legislation, right-wing hijinks, and--in all odds--a vacancy crisis, as Republicans freeze confirmations and refuse to fill spots in the executive branch and on the federal bench. That is bad for the Democratic Party. What's on the horizon is worse. As Amy Walter notes for the Cook Political Report, Democrats lost big at all levels of government, including the states. ""Today,"" she writes, ""about 55 percent of all state legislative seats in the country are held by Republicans. That's the largest share of GOP state legislators since the 1920s."" What's more, ""just 11 states have an all Democratic-controlled legislature,"" and Democrats hold single-party control in just seven states. By contrast, ""Republicans have a legislative majority in 30 states, including the battleground states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina,"" and single-party control in most of the South. This, Walter says, is a slow-moving disaster for congressional Democrats. She's right. Absent major gains in 2016, 2018, and 2020, Democrats will be shut out of the next round of redistricting. If, she writes, ""Democrats can't get a seat at the redistricting table in 2020, they may find themselves locked out of a congressional majority for another 10 years."" And even if they do get a seat at the table, argues Greg Sargent for the Washington Post, there's still the problem of population distribution; even in blue states, most Democratic voters are crammed in a handful of urban areas, which dilutes their strength in House elections. Sargent quotes David Wasserman (also of the Cook Political Report): ""If Democrats were to get neutral maps drawn by God in all 50 states, they would still fall well short of winning back the House,"" says Wasserman. ""What Democrats really need is a massive resettlement program."" With that said, there are more costs to Democratic weakness in the states than just House elections. States are where parties build talent and try new ideas. Here, the GOP is instructive. Its brightest stars are either governors (Scott Walker, John Kasich, and Chris Christie) or former state officeholders (Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Joni Ernst). And Republican-controlled statehouses have been incubators for conservative ideas, from experiments in tax cutting (Bobby Jindal's Louisiana and Sam Brownback's Kansas) to full-fledged assaults on public-sector unions (Walker's Wisconsin and Christie's New Jersey). In all likelihood, the next Republican president will either come from the states, or will borrow his approach from the present generation of GOP governors. Likewise, if Democrats win the White House for a third term, they'll face opposition from Congress and empowered Republican majorities at the state level. Indeed, if not for statehouse Republicans, the Affordable Care Act would be a smoother project, with broader buy-in for exchanges and the Medicaid expansion. Democrats might have strong national prospects in the form of Hillary Clinton, but they have little to look to in the states. Only a few places stand as incubators for progressive strategies and ideas, and nationwide, Democrats have close to nothing in the way of a bench for federal and statewide office. The liberal counterparts to Walker, Christie, Brownback, and Mike Pence--ideologically motivated governors with national profiles--don't exist. And as a result, liberals can't point to a forward-looking agenda that exists outside the bounds of the presidency. Worse, without a strong presence in the states, liberals lack a base for institutional pressure. Outside of Congress, there are few party voices pushing President Obama to the left, or urging a more liberal approach to key policy matters. And while part of this is just the nature of the game--parties try to maintain unity when they control the White House--part of it has to do with the lack of strong liberal voices (and strong liberal agendas) throughout the country. If you have your doubts, you just have to look at the field of presidential candidates for the 2016 Democratic primary who aren't Clinton. At most--for viable, liberal alternatives outside of Congress--there's outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. The rest are either sitting senators or moderate governors, like New York's Andrew Cuomo. Put simply, the two statewide Republican waves have put Democrats and liberals on the near-term defensive. The former will struggle to build a new bench for the post-Obama era, and the latter will fight to put effective pressure on a national party that--if it follows the lead of its likely nominee--isn't eager to embrace the unapologetic liberalism of its activist class. And the honest truth is that things could get worse. With a sudden economic downturn, Democrats could enter 2016 as serious underdogs, giving Republicans a real chance to elevate new talent and give their statewide strategies a spin on the national stage."	The Democratic Party Is in Worse Shape Than You Realize

The criminal justice system's default setting is to give the overwhelming benefit of the doubt to the officer. That's a problem for the public, of course, but also, in some cases, for the police. A system that is biased in the cop's favor gives him the legal sanction to take a life. What it can't do, however, is provide the moral authority for the government to justify that officer's actions to a rightfully skeptical public. So, the system is broken. How exactly should we fix it? A number of promising options have already been floated, most notably proposals either to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate police-involved killings or to shift that responsibility to the state attorney general. Both would put some much-needed distance between the officer being investigated and the officials doing the investigating. But neither would address the core problem of a system that is tasked with coming to a conclusion about guilt and responsibility, but not with figuring out what actually happened. Our legal system is designed to absorb complex stories and spit out oversimplified verdicts: indictment or no indictment, guilty or not guilty. When the St. Louis County grand jury returned a ""no true bill"" against Darren Wilson, all the jurors were saying was that they didn't believe there was enough evidence to indict the officer in the death of Michael Brown. From that single conclusion came the de facto narrative that Wilson was justified in killing Brown because he felt he had no other choice but to open fire. Likewise, we can only speculate why the Staten Island grand jury ultimately decided against indicting Pantaleo. Nevertheless, the implicit conclusion we've been left with is that the jurors believed that the officer didn't intend to harm Eric Garner when he put him in a chokehold. How do we resolve this disjoint between a binary system that sees things only in black and white and the public's need for an honest investigation of the shades of gray in between? One little-discussed option comes from Paul MacMahon, a law professor at the London School of Economics. He argues in a forthcoming Yale Law & Policy Review article that the solution may be an inquest, a quasi-judicial proceeding with medieval roots that has largely fallen by the wayside in the United States. Inquests--which are still common in England and Ireland--are called in the aftermath of an unexpected or unusual death. Typically, a jury, with the help of a judge or coroner, seeks to establish the facts of the case but, importantly, has no legal authority to indict or convict. Think of this as akin to a civilian review board, but with more power, a clearer task, and an actual platform to make sure its conclusions are heard. How would such an inquest work? MacMahon proposes launching one automatically anytime a police officer kills someone in the line of duty. Having either a judge or coroner lead the jury would remove the apparent conflict of interest of a district attorney investigating an officer who he relies on to do his job. The inquest would have the power to compel witnesses to testify under oath, but unlike a grand jury, the proceedings would play out in public. The bigger wrinkle, though, is that the jury would have no power to decide the question of criminal or civil liability. The findings wouldn't necessarily even be admissible as evidence in a court of law. Prosecutors would still be the ones to decide whether to take the case to the grand jury; the grand jury would still decide whether to indict the officer. But an inquest would bring a heavy dose of public accountability. In England, for instance, when an inquest concludes a homicide was an ""unlawful killing,"" the state doesn't have to prosecute the case. If it chooses not to, however, it has to formally explain that decision. The inability of an inquest to bring charges itself may sound like a weakness, but it's what makes the process so valuable. Because the panel wouldn't be preoccupied with the guilty/not guilty or indictment/no indictment binary, it would have more leeway to pursue the facts wherever they lead. ""The inquest, more than any other institution, is charged with pursuing the truth--sometimes including the moral truth,"" MacMahon writes. Inquests don't just ask whether someone's actions were justified in a legal sense, he says; they ask ""whether or not a person's conduct was justified in distinct and important ways from the question of whether or not the person should be held criminally responsible or liable to pay damages."" In the case of Wilson or Pantaleo, then, an inquest could try to answer not just whether the officer was legally justified in his use of force, but whether the officer was right in a larger sense to do so. There's no guarantee the inquest's jurors would be able to settle that question once and for all, of course, but simply publicly attempting to would be a big step forward for a government that is struggling to convince communities of color that their lives matter in our criminal justice system. The benefits of an inquest don't end there, either. As MacMahon argues, the proceedings would provide another chance to root out systematic police failings and to make credible recommendations to fix them. For wrongful deaths, the inquests would have an agenda-setting function, making sure cases stay in the news cycle so there's a chance to push for reforms or pressure officials to prosecute. Just as important, an inquest would be invaluable for those officers involved in killings that are truly justified. The public investigation wouldn't stop at probable cause or even reasonable doubt. It would provide the rare chance for an officer to be fully vindicated in the eyes of the public. I'll add two of my own benefits on top of the ones that MacMahon notes. First, making an inquest automatic in the aftermath of a police killing would send a clear message to officers that they will have to answer for their actions every single time they take a person's life. That won't stop an officer from pulling the trigger if his life is in danger, but it may make him think twice when it's not. Second, automatic inquests would provide the public with something the government has so far been unwilling to provide: a definitive tally of just how many lives police officers take each year. That's not to say that an inquest would be a panacea in every case. It wouldn't end what President Obama calls the ""simmering distrust"" between predominantly white law enforcement agencies and the communities of color they police. And it's unfair to expect that anyone could provide definitive answers about exactly why an officer took a citizen's life or whether he truly had no other choice. But an inquest wouldn't need to answer those questions to be a success. At this point, just asking them in a transparent way would represent a huge amount of progress."	A Better Way to Pursue Justice When Cops Kill in the Line of Duty

While some politicians billow to make their political moves seem high-minded, Sen. McConnell is blunt. Senators who have worked with him (and those who have failed to do so) describe a transactional clarity. You have not done this for me and so I will not do that for you and vice versa. It was in that spirit of transparency that the incoming majority leader described his support for fellow Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's presidential run on Wednesday morning. ""Obviously I'm going to support someone from my own state, everyone understands that."" McConnell didn't wax on about Paul's fresh vision for America or his penetrating ideas. He singled out that they are both from the same state. Like nearly all senators who have been in that position before, McConnell is standing by the hometown candidate, should he choose to run. When asked to elaborate on the junior Kentucky senator, McConnell highlighted Paul's political outreach to blacks and younger voters, which he sees as a way to grow the Republican Party. McConnell didn't endorse the efforts, but said, ""... we're all watching with great interest to see if this is successful."" The somewhat arid endorsement might result from the fact that Paul has very little of the executive or legislative experience that McConnell has previously said was important to be president, and which he believes makes Barack Obama self-evidently unequipped for the top job. In its current condition, McConnell's endorsement isn't likely to carry much weight, but then McConnell knows that endorsements don't carry much weight anyway. Though that's not exactly the way Paul's strategist Jesse Benton put it in 2013 when asked why he was working for McConnell. Benton told a conservative Iowa activist that he was ""sort of holding my nose for two years because what we're doing here is going to be a big benefit to Rand in '16, so that's my long vision."" McConnell understands that type of political pragmatism and may not even resent Benton for saying it. He was speaking his language. Plus Benton, who had helped Paul win his Senate seat in 2010, helped McConnell get past a primary challenge and win the general election. The thing to watch between McConnell and Paul is the favors the new majority leader does for him in the Senate. We know he's not inclined to do favors for Paul's likely opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz, who has promoted himself at the expense of establishment Republican leaders in the Senate. Cruz bucked McConnell on the strategy that led to the government shutdown, which McConnell referred to Wednesday as ""a foolish tactic that had no chance for success."" McConnell will be fascinating to watch as leader of the Senate because of his brand of candor. It is in part why Vice President Joe Biden has been able to work with him in crafting a variety of budget deals. Perhaps that will help with negotiations on trade, tax reform, and infrastructure, the areas of common interest that the White House and Senate Republicans have both highlighted. Though McConnell expects there to be differences even on those areas of possible agreement, they might be hammered out after the president vetoes the first Republican offering. McConnell is both traditional and cold-blooded. When asked which Senate majority leaders he would model himself on, he wouldn't pick favorites among Republicans, but praised Democratic Senate leader Mike Mansfield, because he treated Republicans fairly--sometimes putting Republican amendments ahead of Democratic ones. If he makes good on his promise to allow open debate and more amendments than outgoing Majority Leader Harry Reid, the deliberative body will be a more interesting place. But it won't be less partisan. McConnell also hopes to reinvigorate the Congressional power of the purse as a weapon to roll back the Obama agenda. He also praised Democratic leader George Mitchell because ""he was pretty skillful at sticking the knife in and you hardly noticing it."""	Why Mitch McConnell May Be Exactly What the Senate Needs
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/conservative_media_s_new_online_generation_twitchy_tea_party_news_network.html	"Not many political reporters have scored exclusives with both Sens. Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid. Scottie Nell Hughes, of the Tea Party News Network, has. She's part of an emerging class of conservative news sites that mesh clickbait headlines and social media-friendly content with stories that bash President Obama, laud Sen. Ted Cruz, and rack up remarkable traffic. The dirty secret of new conservative news sites is that the ones that get the most readers are practically ignored by their fellow media outlets. Sites like the Washington Free Beacon and the Federalist have quickly won fans among conservative D.C. insiders, and their work has drawn friendly coverage--and deservedly so--from outlets like Bloomberg and Politico Magazine. (Disclosure: I wrote a freelance piece for the Federalist last year, and I think it's a smart, important publication.) But a bunch of sites you've probably never heard of outpace those sites when it comes to actual readership. These new-media operations generally have tiny staffs, low national profiles, and #TCOT-friendly sensibilities. What they lack in plaudits from their peers, they compensate for in eyeballs. What this means for the future of conservative media is an open question. What it means for conservative media at the moment, though, is that there's a voracious demand for viral-friendly, often-trashy news stories that reify right-wing ideas. Expect to see more of those stories in the future. If there's one conservative news site that's been sorely overlooked by media reporters, it's Twitchy. Twitchy is an enigma: sometimes baffling, sometimes amusing, and--and this is really saying a lot--unlike anything else on the Internet. The site, which political commentator Michelle Malkin founded in 2012, aggregates tweets, basically Storifying them into short posts. Its tagline is ""Who said what,"" and it has verticals for U.S. Politics, Entertainment, Media, and (as of now) Ferguson. You might think this is a bad concept for a website. You would be wrong. According to analytics website Alexa.com, Twitchy has more readers than the Weekly Standard, the Federalist, and the Free Beacon. It also trounces Roll Call, Reason, Commentary, and the left-wing feminist site Feministing in these rankings. Quantcast, an imperfect measure but one of the better publicly available traffic counters, estimates that Twitchy gets more than 2 million unique visitors a month. Free Beacon's Quantcast audience is less than half that size. And Twitchy generates that traffic with a teensy staff. Lori Ziganto, the site's managing editor, said it has seven full-time employees and two part-time writers. The staff lives across the country, and they don't have their own office. Ziganto, who lives in South Carolina, ran a blog called Snark & Boobs before Malkin tapped her to run the site, and still tweets from the same handle @snarkandboobs. ""I keep that name because feminists hate it and it makes me laugh,"" she said. According to Ziganto, the site can produce 40 to 45 stories on a busy day. The first writers get started at 6 a.m., and members of the team are hunting for news on Twitter until late into the night. Celebrity meltdown stories always do well, she said, as well as stories based on tweets from Fox News hosts and conservative stars like Adam Baldwin. ""Also Jake Tapper,"" she added. ""Everybody seems to love Jake Tapper. He's excellent at Twitter."" Twitchy stories come in a host of iterations. A number of their headlines use the term gigglesnort, which Ziganto says she coined (i.e. ""Gigglesnort: Gov. Jerry Brown says fart""). Highbrow it is not. But the site boasts a few scoops, including chronicling Twitter death threats against Gov. Scott Walker that earned it a Drudge link and led to a police investigation. The site has also brought a new word into reporters' lexicons: Twitchied, which refers to the often days-long onslaught of Twitter attention (and, sometimes, abuse) that journalists get after being featured on the site. One D.C.-based politics reporter, who didn't want to go on the record, said one uncharitable Twitchy story about him came up on a date. His date had Googled him before they went out, and the Twitchy story bashing him was close to the top of his results. Igor Bobic, Huffington Post's associate politics editor, has also faced Twitchy's wrath. ""It's become somewhat of an inside joke among reporters, and even prompts a round of congratulations,"" he emailed. ""What's not fun is the avalanche of hate it immediately brings to your Twitter page, often forcing you to sign off for the next 24-48 hours."" For some left-leaning reporters, getting Twitchied is a rite of passage. ""It's one of my great professional failures that I've never been Twitchied,"" emailed Salon's Jim Newell. ""I mean I've tried, I talk a lot of shit!"" Newell's Salon colleague Simon Maloy also rues that he's never been Twitchied. ""There's nothing substantive to it; it's rage just for the sake of it, fueled by ideological tribalism,"" he emailed. ""Were I to be Twitchy'd at some point, it would make me happy knowing that something I tweeted helped so many people fulfill that raw emotional need."" So Twitchy is the rare site that has both broad-based and cult appeal (though ""appeal"" may be a strong word in the latter sense). Regardless, it's quickly carved out its own odd niche in the D.C. media world. Tea Party News Network doesn't get that kind of inside-the-Beltway attention, but its traffic is higher. TPNN gets more traffic than the Washington Examiner, Hot Air, and Town Hall, according to TopConservativeSites, which aggregates Alexa data. Most of the site's content is clickbait-y news aggregation (""What This MSNBC Host Said About Ferguson Rioting and Looting Will Cause You to Shout, 'Shame on You!',"" ""No Wonder People Think He's A Weakling: Wait Until You See Why Obama Was Hospitalized"") that's free of original reporting. It's also one of the few news-oriented sites willing to give a platform to birther conspiracy theories; one October headline asked, ""Could Barack Obama Be Deported Over Using a Fraudulent Birth Certificate? Yes, Says Former DOJ Attorney."" And on Dec. 8, it ran a story arguing that the president ""benefits from 'black skin privilege.' "" More surprising, the site also has remarkable access to Republican lawmakers and activists, which sometimes garners buzzy tidbits (for instance, Wayne Allyn Root told TPNN he was thinking about running against Sen. Harry Reid in 2016). Talking with TPNN gives Republican politicians and candidates a chance to talk to the base; one assumes the Wall Street Journal editorial page's overlap in readership with TPNN is not particularly large. Scottie Nell Hughes, the site's news director, conducts most of the interviews. She said the site has a good working relationship with soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office. But Kentucky's other senator hasn't spoken to her yet. ""I have yet to sit down with Sen. Rand Paul, and it's not for the lack of trying,"" she said. ""And you'd think that would be very odd, that Mitch McConnell would have his doors open to us and Rand Paul wouldn't."" House Speaker John Boehner won't talk to them either, she added, but Sen. Marco Rubio talks to them ""all the time."" Sen. Ted Cruz, not surprisingly, is another favorite. Then there's Independent Journal Review. It doesn't seem to have TPNN's access or Twitchy's cult following, but it still tops all of them in traffic. (According to Quantcast, the IJReview brought in more than 25 million readers last month.) It also wins out over Breitbart News, Real Clear Politics, the Daily Caller, and the Washington Times. Per one of its founders, Alex Skatell, its aims are lofty. ""We're presenting stories for every American to see in a way they're more likely to click and share,"" Skatell told BuzzFeed last year. ""This helps because people who don't care as much about politics can still stay informed through engaged friends."" Readers also stay up to speed on stories that, um, have little discernible connection to conservative politics, like ""Bikini-Clad Model Annoys 'Tough Guy' on Live TV & Finds Out in Russia You Can Get You Walloped for That"" and ""A Trashy Mom Runs Her Mouth a Little Too Much. Then a Security Guard Shows Her How a Taser Works"" and ""UK Man Thinks Guys Should Rule Barbershop Roost, No 'Hens' Allowed."" Those stories intermingle with stories about how much it cost for the president to attend the G-20 summit and the latest from the Louisiana Senate race. The site doesn't seem to have any anti-establishment animus, instead highlighting the president's perceived foibles and missteps while touting the Republican lawmakers who needle him. The site's owners use a huge email list and the Conservative Daily Facebook page (more than 6 million likes) to promote their stories. Bubba Atkinson, the site's editor-in-chief, is a Facebook savant. He always keeps an eye on the site's analytics--""I never let that leave my sight for very long,"" he says--and sometimes tweaks stories if he thinks they're underperforming. The most interesting thing about these sites might be their ability to rake in traffic without relying on links from the Drudge Report. They've scored a few links, but not nearly enough to explain their collective traffic bonanza. The best explanation for their success might be that there's a huge, underserved population of would-be news consumers who care about national politics but aren't interested in the inside-baseball coverage that dominates many conservative sites. But will these new entrants reshape the conservative media landscape? I'm not so sure. I don't have any empirical evidence for this claim, but it seems likely that the speediness of a site's ascent could be inversely proportionate to its staying power. In other words, my suspicion would be that in the case of many viral news sites, clicks are easy come, easy go. And, in the case of sites like the Federalist and the Washington Free Beacon, slower growth could spell greater longevity. It may take a few years to see whether this hypothesis bears out, but I'd bet on it."	The Most-Read Conservative Media You've Never Heard Of
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/senate_intelligence_report_on_cia_torture_america_s_spy_agency_lied_to_the.html	"On Nov. 4, 1977, moments after the legendary CIA director Richard Helms received a suspended two-year sentence and a $2,000 fine for committing perjury by lying about U.S. covert action in Chile before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, his former CIA colleagues gave him a standing ovation at a local country club. Two hats were passed around the room, and the group quickly collected more than enough to pay off the fine for their friend. The CIA brotherhood was proud of their leader for protecting secrets from those who had no business knowing them, even if that meant the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The country was at a turning point in its relationship with its spies, and the arrogance in that room was just the sort of thing that had produced fears that the CIA was uncontrollable or, as it was said then, had become a ""rogue elephant."" These fears led to the creation of permanent intelligence oversight committees in the House and the Senate. Tuesday's release of the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's damningly detailed report on the CIA's detention and interrogation program provides the first proof in a generation that the U.S. government may have lost control of the CIA again, at least in the critical first years after 9/11. Page after page of the report details how the CIA misled Congress and President Bush's White House about the essential elements of its most controversial covert activity--in other words what forms of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" they were employing, and whether this use of torture was producing any meaningful results. The Senate intelligence committee staff spent four years writing this report and updated it to refute a CIA response provided to the committee in 2013. Tuesday's release is only the 488-page summary. The actual report is more than 6,000 pages long and has not yet been submitted for declassification. In the footnotes to the summary, the committee refers to sections of the report. Although at this point we have to take the committee's word that the sections match up with the topic-sentence conclusions, there is more than enough evidence to conclude that the Bush administration's oft-repeated public defense of the CIA's interrogation techniques was false. The Senate committee takes up the 20 cases that the program's advocates most often cite in its defense, instances where the information collected came solely from these harsh methods. The report then demonstrates how each one of these claims dissolves under careful examination. Some of the story of the torture program we have known for a decade thanks to journalists such as James Risen and Jane Mayer. Additional details were revealed in 2009, when the Obama administration declassified a report that the CIA's inspector general had produced five years earlier. The main points are as follows: The capture of Abu Zubaydah in March 2002, a man whom the U.S. government had actually sought since late 1999, caught the Bush administration unprepared for how to handle al-Qaida detainees. With Zubaydah's capture imminent, the CIA requested presidential authorization to hold the captive at a secret site in an obliging foreign country (whose identity is still secret). When Abu Zubaydah stopped talking, the CIA sought permission to move to unorthodox measures of questioning. Permission came in the first of what became known as the ""torture memos"" from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in August 2002. Zubaydah would be the first of 39 people subjected to torture. That number was not known until Tuesday. Also unknown until Tuesday was that the CIA managed the program in a surprisingly slipshod manner. It never produced a master list of the detainees at its secret sites. Senate investigators concluded that there were at most 119 detainees, and though not all of them were subjected to torture, Langley did not have sufficient control of its own secret prison system to know about, let alone authorize, every instance where torture was used. Early on the CIA convinced itself that it would be impossible to undertake an objective assessment of this program, so it never tried. It was only when President Bush went on record against torture in the summer of 2003 that the CIA scrambled to justify its walk on the dark side. Senate investigators have found that the origins of most of the misinformation about the interrogation program dates to the summer of 2003. It starts, ironically, when President Bush said the following in June 2003 at the United Nations International Day in Support of the Victims of Torture:"	Did the CIA Go Rogue After 9/11?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/the_conservative_case_for_reforming_the_police_and_how_to_do_it_in_three.html	"If a neoconservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality, as Irving Kristol once put it, what do you call a conservative faced with video footage of the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a man the New York Police Department confronted for the crime of selling contraband cigarettes? In the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, conservatives and liberals found themselves taking familiar stances. Those on the right were by and large inclined to give a local police officer the benefit of the doubt. Those on the left maintained that use of lethal force against Brown was unjustified, and that the failure to indict Darren Wilson reflected the deeply ingrained racism of the American criminal justice system. The case of Garner has met with a strikingly different response from conservatives, as Tim Lee of Vox recently observed. Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, a man known for channeling the populist id of older white conservatives, somberly expressed his horror at Garner's death on Wednesday night. More pointedly, Tim Carney, a leading light of the conservative intelligentsia and a columnist for the Washington Examiner, pointed to Garner's death of an illustration of the dangers of an unaccountable, excessively strong government. Having grown up in Brooklyn in the 1980s and lived through the explosion of violence that accompanied the crack epidemic, I came to deeply appreciate the dangerous and difficult work done by the NYPD. Like most conservatives, my gut-level sympathies are with police officers who find themselves in situations that can quickly spiral out of control. And I believe that the most important job of the police is to protect innocent people from harm, a job the NYPD has generally done well. But there is no question that something has gone badly wrong with policing in many of our cities. When high-crime neighborhoods grow to distrust local law enforcement, local law enforcement finds it more difficult to do its job. Anger and anxiety build, and sometimes it explodes. Of course, conservative fears about law enforcement run amok are different from those invoked by liberals. Conservatives, particularly libertarian-minded conservatives, are far more likely to point to the expansion of government as a driver of police abuses, a claim that at least some liberals find risible, or even offensive. Moreover, they are far less likely to chalk up police brutality to straightforward racism. Fear of the police, a fact of life for young black and brown men--particularly those living in neighborhoods plagued by violent crime, ironically enough--is largely unknown on the American right, which is disproportionately white and either suburban or rural. Yet it is an oversimplification to see our excessive reliance on punitive crime-control policies through a racial lens. Consider the invaluable work of James Forman Jr., a clinical professor at Yale Law School, who has argued that black Americans played a larger role in the rise of ""broken windows"" policing and mass incarceration than is commonly understood. Forman has recounted the role of Harlem-based black activists in the late 1960s in pushing for New York state's notorious Rockefeller drug laws. Those laws imposed draconian sentences for drug offenses and set the tone for a wave of similar tough-on-crime measures that spread around the country in the years that followed. He details the rise of more punitive policies in black-majority jurisdictions with black-majority police forces, focusing in particular on Washington, D.C. Forman's work absolutely does not prove that racism played no role in the incarceration boom that has done so much to devastate poor black neighborhoods. Rather, he reminds readers that the fact that young black men face shockingly disproportionate rates of violent crime had led a not inconsiderable number of black Americans to embrace tough-on-crime policies. The fear of crime that drove these policies was not unique to whites, and it is not just whites who bear responsibility for the many ways these policies have gone wrong. If conservatives accept that the worst excesses of law enforcement need to be reined in, what are the appropriate next steps? And is there room for common ground with liberals who see the roots of the dysfunction of our criminal justice system very differently? There are grounds for optimism. In 2012, Steven Teles and David Dagan described how a coalition of conservative policy entrepreneurs and GOP elected officials had set out to reduce incarceration levels, having grown troubled by the ugly moral consequences of separating fathers, boyfriends, and husbands from their families. This impulse needs to inform every aspect of policymaking around criminal justice. What government routinely fails to do is account for the costs the criminal justice system imposes on the civilians who get caught in its web. Mark A.R. Kleiman, a public policy professor at UCLA and author of When Brute Force Fails, made this point vividly in a Democracy Journal essay published last spring. Instead of fixating on the dollar costs of running the criminal justice system, he asks that we also account for ""the suffering inflicted by arrest, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration, including all of the residual disabilities that go with the label 'ex-convict,' and the fear created by overaggressive policing."" Imagine if, as Cardozo Law School professor Richard A. Bierschbach has suggested, we had in place a ""punishment budget."" Given such a budget, we would accept that the criminal justice system would cause some degree of suffering. At the same time, we'd insist that if you pass some measures that increase suffering in some way--say, by making more arrests--you'd have to reduce the sum total of suffering in some other way, for instance by reducing prison sentences for nonviolent offenders. This would impose a useful check on the creep of new laws, rules, and regulations that steadily increase the government's coercive powers, as if on autopilot. Establishing a punishment budget is only the first step that the right can and should rally around. The second is insisting on greater transparency. We need better, more reliable data on policing so that communities have a clear sense of what local law enforcement agencies are doing in their name. The chief resistance to greater transparency comes from police unions. Conservatives, who've long been critical of public sector unions for imposing rigid work rules and contributing to soaring compensation costs, should have no qualms about calling for their abolition. When teachers unions fight tooth and nail on behalf of teachers accused of misconduct, it's a problem. When police unions do the same on behalf of police officers accused of endangering the lives of civilians, and in some cases killing them, it's a very big problem indeed. Republicans are often wary of curbing the collective bargaining rights of public safety employees, due to their political influence and their conservative sympathies. That has to change. The third step is to encourage a more localized approach to criminal justice, an idea that's been championed by Bierschbach and by Stephanos Bibas of Penn Law School. Both have pointed to the encouraging example of the Red Hook Community Justice Center, a court that employs people with a deep knowledge of their Brooklyn neighborhood, and that is more likely to mandate community supervision than to send low-level offenders to jail. Because the men and women who work for the center know the neighborhood so well, they have a better sense of which offenders represent a serious and ongoing threat to law-abiding citizens and which need nothing more than structure and discipline in their lives. Better still, the center's approach leads local residents to think of it as an ally working to keep the neighborhood safe rather than as an enemy looking to snatch away their troubled young men. The community court model is no panacea. It works better in some places than others. But it does resonate with many of the things that conservatives care about most: It makes use of the ""little platoons"" of civil society, it respects local priorities and values, and there is at least some evidence that it's much cheaper than business as usual. If local law enforcement is ever going to become more humane and more legitimate, becoming more local is absolutely essential."	The Conservative Case for Reforming the Police
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/police_shootings_president_obama_must_demand_an_accurate_count_of_the_number.html	"This week, President Obama vowed to use his final two years in office to address the ""simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color."" The first tangible step toward that goal: the president's request for $263 million to buy 50,000 body-worn cameras for police departments around the country, and to pay for expanded officer training. Those proposals are promising, but the president is missing a more obvious first step. He should immediately call for all law enforcement agencies to keep an accurate count of how many people the police kill each year. As has been well-documented, the federal government keeps no such definitive tally. The closest thing to an official estimate can be found in the FBI's annual Supplementary Homicide Report, which suggests the number is somewhere around 400 per year. But that data set is severely flawed, and the government knows it. For starters, the report counts only ""justified homicides."" There isn't even a category for those police killings that are deemed to be unjustified (on those exceedingly rare occasions that they are classified as such). More frustrating is the fact that the report is nowhere close to a full tally. The FBI relies on statistics from state and local police departments. Those same agencies, though, are under no obligation to submit the data, and most don't. In a typical year, only about 750 of the nation's 17,000 law enforcement agencies self-report their officer-involved shootings to the FBI. That must change if Obama is serious about addressing the tension between the nation's predominantly white law enforcement agencies and the minority communities they police. As the last several months have illustrated, the most high-profile source of that tension is the use of lethal force. The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has garnered the most national attention, but it was hardly an isolated event. Young black males are 21 times more likely to be shot and killed by police than their white counterparts, according to a ProPublica analysis of the limited data that are available. Without a formal and comprehensive reporting system, the president, lawmakers, and everyone else have no way of knowing the true scope of the problem. Even if the government is willing to believe that police officers are almost always justified when they kill suspects in the line of duty, Washington still owes the nation a full accounting of those killings that it has implicitly sanctioned. How can the president hope to limit the number of lives lost if he has no way of knowing how many lives are actually lost? How will Congress evaluate whether policies aimed at curbing police shootings are successful if it has no way of tracking the success or failure of those policies? This isn't a matter of a handful of homicides gone missing, either. The Wall Street Journal analyzed the most recent data from 105 of the nation's largest police agencies and discovered that between 2007 and 2012 there were roughly 500 police killings that were nowhere to be found in the bureau's national tally. The FBI's tally suggests that there had been 1,242 justified homicides in those same departments' jurisdictions over that period. In reality, the paper found, the number was closer to 1,800. The WSJ investigation leads with an example of one such killing that, based solely on the federal records, never happened. In 2012, 24-year-old Albert Jermaine Payton was shot and killed in Washington, D.C., after he allegedly wielded a knife in front of police. D.C. police didn't provide the bureau with any information on its justified homicides from that year, so Payton's death remains uncounted by the federal government. We don't have to look too hard to find another example of a police killing that appears destined to go unrecognized by the feds. When the FBI releases its 2014 report, don't expect to see Eric Garner counted. New York does not report justifiable homicide data to the FBI. The state revamped its reporting system in 2002 and again in 2006, but it still doesn't track police killings, according to the Journal. The best a spokeswoman for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services could offer was that the agency was ""looking to modify our technology so we can reflect these numbers."" In the meantime, the death of Garner, who was killed this summer after being put in a banned chokehold, will not be counted by the FBI. With government agencies unable or unwilling to do this important work, news organizations and not-for-profits have attempted to fill the gap. Brian Burghart, the editor of the Reno News & Review, has spent the past two years tracking police-related deaths at his website, Fatal Encounters. Deadspin launched its own crowdsourced effort this summer, creating a database of police-involved shootings between 2011 and 2013. Perhaps the most comprehensive effort is the Gun Violence Archive, which launched last year with the goal of counting every gun-related incident in the country, including an individual tally of police-involved shootings. As of Friday, the project had counted a staggering 2,886 officer-involved shootings this year alone. That figure includes all shootings, not just deaths, but it's still striking that it dwarfs the 420 justified homicides the FBI counted each year on average between 2009 and 2013. The more you look at these grass-roots efforts to track down the real numbers, the more absurd the ""official figures"" seem. Burghart and Deadspin and the Gun Violence Archive are all doing difficult and important work, but the best they do is paint a better picture, not a complete one. They're relying on local media reports to fill in gaps in the government data, but news stories can be outdated or incorrect, and not every death makes its way into print. ""We're not going to get everything,"" says Kyle Wagner, who's leading Deadspin's effort. ""We'd love it if we could, but that's just not what's going to happen."" (In 2013, Slate ran into similar problems while attempting to keep a running tally of every gun-related death in the country. After a full year our database was at least 20,000 deaths short of reality.) It's shameful that all of these workarounds are necessary. If Obama wants to help mend the frayed relationship between the police and the public, then he needs to make it an honest conversation. That can't happen unless the government starts counting each and every life that law enforcement takes. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away. The deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner are only the latest proof of that--and the limited data we do have make it clear they won't be the last."	President Obama Must Demand an Accurate Count of the People Killed by Law Enforcement

Not surprisingly, the billionaire wants something in return. That something is legislation to outlaw online gambling. But Adelson may have overplayed his hand by putting too much into the pot--and in the process providing a cautionary lesson in why spending so many millions may actually be counterproductive, It all began in 2011. Up until December of that year, the Justice Department treated Internet betting as illegal--a violation of the Wire Act of 1961. But in late 2011, the Justice Department changed its position. It decided that only online sports betting was illegal; other types of betting like online poker--where most of the online gambling action is--were no longer prohibited. That was obviously bad news for brick-and-mortar casino owners like Adelson who have no online presence. If poker players could ante up in their pajamas, why travel to Las Vegas? Earlier this year, the odds on Adelson's online gambling ban looked good. In March, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Jason Chaffetz introduced the Restoration of America's Wire Act, a bill to make online gambling illegal, and did so with solid bipartisan support, including Democrats Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii as co-sponsors. House Speaker John Boehner appears to have been on board, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was on board, too. (Reid always had a detente with Adelson, given their mutual interest in the Nevada travel and tourism business.) But the bill lingered. Then, a House hearing was scheduled for December. The idea, it seems, was to get it passed quietly. Then, last month, former Rep. Ron Paul spoke out, calling the bill payback to Adelson and therefore the worst form of ""cronyism."" Amid dissension among the Republican ranks, the hearing was postponed. The quiet politics of doing Adelson a favor had become noisy. And the noisy politics of doing Adelson a favor are bad for those who would do the favor. Now there was no way to push the bill forward without it looking like the worst type of corruption. If I were a betting man, I'd put good money down that Adelson will not get his Internet gaming ban in this Congress. If Adelson loses, should we then conclude that money doesn't buy results? After all, if you spend $100 million and you can't get your bill passed, what gives? As with all other ways we spend money, there are ways to spend money intelligently in politics and ways to spend it dumbly. So, what did Adelson do wrong? Adelson's biggest mistake is that he spent too much money. Spending $100 million in such public fashion is a great idea if you want to obtain a certain type of celebrity. It also works well if you want presidential aspirants begging for your largesse. But it's actually a bad idea if you want to get anything done because it makes you the story. And unless you are a sympathetic character (which Adelson is most definitely not), it is not good to be the story. Good politics might be described as the art of cloaking your special interest in the general interest.  But when you become the symbol of big money in politics, it is very hard to pull off this sleight of hand. Adelson caught on to this axiom late in the game. In February, he told Politico, ""When I started to imagine what would happen with legalized Internet gaming, it scared the heck out of me ... because of what's it's going to do to our society. ... I'm concerned about college students. They are of age, and I'm concerned about poor people who really can't afford to do it, that we're putting all these temptations smack on their kitchen table."" He's doing his best to lend legitimacy and moral urgency to his cause. He's set up the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, with former Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln, former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, and former New York Gov. George Pataki as co-chairs. He's gotten Judicial Watch to investigate the Obama administration's decision to change the interpretation of the Wire Act, alleging that the move ""allowed companies--and big Democratic Party donors--with connections to Attorney General Eric Holder to amass huge profits."" The coalition has even taken to BuzzFeed with its highly shareable listicle: ""10 Reasons Why Internet Gambling Is a Bad Bet."" Adelson even took a page from the old Jack Abramoff casino lobbying playbook, getting a laundry list of Christian family values groups to sign on to his anti-online gambling cause. But online gaming companies aren't sitting still. After all, they have their entire business at stake here. They're fighting back--hard. They've activated the Poker Players Alliance, which channels the energy of those who love playing poker and don't want to have their online poker cut off. They've aggressively lobbied on the issue and have a very active social media presence. And unlike Adelson, the online gaming industry does not have a visible mega-donor. Specifically, the online gaming folks have built alliances among libertarians, including a special relationship with Grover Norquist. Norquist, along with leading conservative organizations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the American Conservative Union, has come out against the federal ban on Internet gambling. Right-wing think tanks like the Heartland Institute have taken to calling the bill ""Crony Socialism."" Of course, one could argue that had Adelson not given so generously, the bill to ban online gambling wouldn't have gotten as far as it has, and instead nobody would be even discussing it. That may be true. But my guess is that if Adelson had given only a few hundred thousand to campaign organizations (still putting him among the ranks of the top donors) and instead put most of his $100 million into a message machine to call attention to the dangers of online gaming, he'd have been better off. Adelson always faced longish odds. Defenders of the status quo (in this case the online gaming industry) always have a built-in advantage. Because Adelson needs a change in the existing policy, he needs to pass a bill. That is always hard to do, given the many veto points in the U.S. system of government, which is especially true in the current Congress. Adelson's opponents only need to undermine the urgency for action, and creating doubt and dissent is a very good way to accomplish that. Perhaps Adelson will still find a way to tuck his proposal into must-pass legislation, and we will read stories of how money directly buys policy. But if he gets what he wants, it will be because he built the necessary coalitions and alliances, neutralized the American Gaming Association on the issue, and then had his allies use congressional procedural legerdemain. He will have won, despite the fact that he spent his $100 million poorly. Whatever happens, the larger point is that politics is neither a vending machine nor an auction. Strategy matters, and changing the status quo is always hard, especially when its defenders have their livelihood at stake. In Washington, money helps a great deal, but it isn't a simple transaction."	Is It Possible to Spend Too Much Money in Politics?

""The grand jury kept interviewing witnesses but you didn't need witnesses,"" Garner's widow told the New York Daily News this afternoon, referring to the fact that her husband's death was caught on camera. ""You can be a witness for yourself. Oh my God, this shit is crazy."" The decision comes a little more than a week after a St. Louis County grand jury also declined to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. It's impossible not to pair the two cases. Both involved a white officer who took the life of an unarmed black suspect. Both prompted public demonstrations that forced authorities to press forward with legal proceedings they might not otherwise have undertaken. Both featured a protracted grand jury hearing that saw the defendant take the witness stand to tell his side of the story. And both concluded with the jurors deciding there was not enough evidence to indict the officer. The decision not to indict Wilson sparked protests around the nation; Wednesday's announcement could do the same. But as frustrating as the respective grand jury outcomes may be, neither should come as a surprise. As I explained earlier this week, the default setting for our criminal justice system--both explicitly and implicitly--is to believe that an on-duty officer who takes another citizen's life was justified in doing so. Unless that baseline assumption changes, we should expect the same result the next time a cop takes someone else's life in the line of duty. Even when the killing is caught on video. Even when the police officer uses a chokehold that's been barred by his department. The lack of serious second-guessing of police behavior is baked into the system at all levels. Our laws give officers broad leeway to use force, either when they fear their lives are in danger or when they are making an arrest. The Supreme Court cemented the scope of that authority in 1989's Graham v. Connor, in effect barring courts from scrutinizing most of the split-second decisions a cop makes in the heat of the moment. Even so, while few observers expected Wilson to be indicted, Pantaleo's fate was less certain. In Ferguson, there were conflicting reports about what happened in the moments before Wilson opened fire. There was much less dispute on Staten Island, where the incident was caught on camera. The cellphone video shows Pantaleo placing Garner, who police allege was illegally selling cigarettes, in a chokehold after he resisted the officer's attempts to put his hands behind his back. Garner is then forcibly taken down and pinned to the ground by a handful of cops. An asthmatic, he can be heard on the recording uttering what would turn out to be his final words: ""I can't breathe."" Pantaleo contends that he didn't use a chokehold--he says it was a takedown maneuver he was taught by the police department. With the exception of the police union, no one seems to have bought that claim. ""It looked like a chokehold to me,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters this summer after viewing the video. The coroner's report came to the same conclusion, ruling that Garner's death was a homicide caused by ""compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest, and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."" That's important. NYPD officers have broad authority to use force to apprehend a suspect, but the department explicitly bars officers from using chokeholds, which have been blamed for the deaths of untold suspects over the past several decades. City officials restricted the use of the dangerous maneuver in 1985--allowing it only when an officer's life was in danger, and it was the ""least dangerous alternative method of restraint""--before banning it outright in 1993. At the time, then-chief John Timoney summed up the policy shift like so: ""Basically, stay the hell away from the neck."" Still, Timoney offered a caveat that he could imagine ""extreme circumstances"" in which an officer might have no other choice but to break the rule. There is no indication in the video that this case involved any such ""extreme circumstances."" The officers' lives did not appear to be in danger, nor is there anything to indicate that Garner is attempting to flee. While the video does suggest that Garner was unlikely to be taken into custody quietly, he resists arrest only in the strictest sense of the term. He can be heard yelling, ""Please, just leave me alone!"" and, eventually, attempts to keep the officers from forcing his hands behind his own back. But Garner was unarmed and does not strike any of the officers as they take him to the ground, where he would ultimately die. Why then, if chokeholds are banned by the NYPD, wasn't Pantaleo indicted? While the officer's use of the banned maneuver received significant scrutiny in the court of public opinion, it likely received much less in the court of law. As Eugene O'Donnell, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, argued earlier this week, there is a difference between an act that is banned in the NYPD's rulebook and one that is deemed criminal. ""There is no explicit law that criminalizes the use of a chokehold on someone either by a police officer or someone else,"" wrote O'Donnell. Grand jury proceedings happen behind closed doors, so we may never know exactly what convinced at least 12 of the 23 jurors to vote against an indictment of any kind. But by deciding--despite the damning video--that there was not enough evidence to justify the case going to trial, the jurors are effectively declaring that Garner's death was, at worst, a horrible mistake, one that might amount to misconduct but that falls short of murder or manslaughter. The only reasonable way the jurors could come to that conclusion is if they focused on the twin questions of intent and expectations. When Wilson fired his weapon at Brown in Ferguson, the officer knew the likely fatal outcome. It's tougher to say whether Pantaleo should have reasonably expected his chokehold to end Garner's life. ""It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner,"" the officer said in a prepared statement following Wednesday's announcement. With the system we have in place, Pantaleo's assurances could have been all that was needed to convince the grand jury. In the United States, cops get the benefit of the doubt in almost all circumstances. If you believed that a case where an unarmed man was choked to death might be a rare exception to that rule, then you were wrong."	Why NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo Wasn't Indicted in the Chokehold Death of Eric Garner
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/darren_wilson_no_true_bill_why_cops_are_almost_never_indicted_for_shooting.html	"A St. Louis County grand jury spent more than three months hearing evidence about the shooting death of Michael Brown. It took jurors less than three days to decide that there wasn't enough to convince them to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. That result would have been exceedingly rare if Wilson were a regular citizen. Because he was a cop the outcome was close to inevitable. As we've all heard by now, any halfway-decent prosecutor can get a grand jury to ""indict a ham sandwich"" if that's the outcome she wants. The most recent data back that up: According to the FBI's Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. attorneys prosecuted 162,000 federal cases in 2010, with grand juries returning an indictment on all but 11 of them. The indictment rate in an individual state like Missouri is probably lower because--like many states--prosecutors there are allowed to bypass a grand jury in more routine cases. But the general point remains: When a prosecutor stands before a grand jury and asks for an indictment, the jurors almost always do what they're told. In Wilson's case, though, St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch's team didn't ask the grand jury for an indictment. Instead, they bombarded jurors with all the available evidence and--depending on how you read the court transcripts--either crafted a defense of the officer or sat back and let the jury make up its own mind. Setting aside the unusual mechanics of these particular proceedings, there's plenty of reason to believe that Wilson was never going to be punished by our criminal justice system. The reason? Nearly everyone involved in the system is willing--perhaps even eager--to believe that an on-duty officer who takes another citizen's life was justified in doing so. Police officers get that benefit of the doubt at every step along the way. It starts with the officers who decide how aggressively to investigate in the first place, then goes to the government attorneys who decide whether to prosecute, then to the citizens who make up the grand jury that decides whether to indict, and then (sometimes) to the regular jurors who decide whether to convict. The lack of serious second-guessing is baked into the system. Our laws give officers broad leeway to use lethal force when they believe their or someone else's life is in danger. The Supreme Court cemented the scope of that authority in 1989's Graham v. Connor, a case involving police officers who apparently mistook a diabetic who was behaving erratically due to his low blood sugar for a belligerent drunk. ""The 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight,"" Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote in the opinion. In short, it's not whether the officer is objectively correct when he uses force; it's whether he subjectively believed that he was right in the moment he did. Wilson told the grand jury that he feared his life was in danger during his encounter with Brown. The jurors weren't tasked with assessing whether Wilson was actually in danger. Rather, they had to surmise whether it was reasonable for him to assume he was in peril. There's that benefit of the doubt. There is no definitive tally for the number of officers who are indicted by grand juries after they shoot and kill a suspect on the job. But perhaps the best snapshot of a society that's willing to take an officer at his word comes from Philip Stinson, an assistant professor at Bowling Green State University who has spent years researching the arrests of police officers for various crimes. According to Stinson's research, 41 U.S. officers were charged with either murder or manslaughter in connection with an on-duty shooting between 2005 and 2011. For comparison, the FBI reported a total of 2,718 ""justified homicides"" by law enforcement officers during that seven-year time period. That tally is widely considered incomplete by those familiar with how those numbers are counted. Still, even that low-end estimate suggests that police shoot and kill someone in the United States more than once a day, on average. The overwhelming majority of those killings are deemed justified before the case ever reaches a jury. When officers do get charged, meanwhile, they are significantly less likely to be convicted than your run-of-the-mill citizen. According to the Cato Institute, the conviction rate for officers charged with criminal misconduct is about 1 in 3--half the typical rate among the general population. ""Juries and trial court judges are seemingly reluctant to convict in criminal court an officer whose crimes rose out of an on-duty incident that occurred as part of their job,"" Stinson, who compiled his research with the help of a federal grant, recently told the Wall Street Journal. Another reason that cops get the benefit of the doubt is that ordinary people are inclined to give it to them. In a Gallup survey this June, the police were the third-highest-rated institution in terms of public confidence, trailing only the military and small business. The criminal justice system, meanwhile, finished a distant 10th with 23 percent of respondents saying they had either a ""great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, less than half the amount who said the same thing about the police. (The only institutions that ranked below the criminal justice system: newspapers, organized labor, big business, news on the Internet, television news, and Congress.) If you suspect there's probably a racial disparity in how citizens view the police, then you're right. Polling indeed suggests that blacks are more skeptical than whites when it comes to trusting the cops--still, 45 percent of black respondents to a separate Gallup survey rated officers' general honesty and ethics as ""high"" or ""very high,"" with less than 1 in 5 giving them a grade of ""low"" or worse. Now extend that trust-the-cop dynamic to police shootings. There's always at least one officer who says the shooting was justified: the cop who pulled the trigger. It doesn't hurt the officer's case that in fatal shootings there's no competing story from the person who was shot. In lieu of that alternative narrative is the baseline assumption that the cops are the good guys and the victims of police shootings are criminals. Meanwhile, as FiveThirtyEight's Ben Casselman has argued, prosecutors rely on the police to do their jobs day in and day out, so they have few reasons to prosecute a cop aggressively and plenty of incentive to present a less persuasive case than they might otherwise, consciously or not. There are times when an officer has no other choice but to open fire. Those cases certainly exist, even if they are likely more uncommon than is generally accepted. But in the wake of the decision not to indict Wilson, it's worth acknowledging that our criminal justice system--both explicitly and implicitly--backs the police officer who does the shooting rather than the person who gets shot. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that Darren Wilson wasn't indicted. In reality, it's a wonder that any cop ever gets indicted for killing someone in the line of duty.

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/black_community_is_concerned_with_black_on_black_crime_suggesting_otherwise.html	"In cities across the country, crowds are protesting police violence against unarmed black men. Demonstrators want justice, not just for Michael Brown, but for Eric Garner, John Crawford, and Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old boy killed by Cleveland police last month. To that end, they've stopped parades and blocked highways in an effort to show the value of a black life. But to some critics, this outrage is misplaced. ""Somebody has to tell me, something somebody needs to tell me why Michael Brown has been chosen as the face of black oppression,"" said MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on Monday morning, during his daily show. His co-panelist, Donny Deutsch, agreed. ""It's not a black-white situation. It's a thug-police officer situation,"" he said. ""Where are the angry crowds demanding justice for blacks such as these, who were wiped out in St. Louis by other blacks in recent memory?"" wonders Deroy Murdock in a column for National Review. ""One can hear birds chirp while listening for public outcry over the deaths of black citizens killed by black perpetrators. Somehow, these black lives don't seem to matter,"" writes Murdock, who doesn't note that--in those cases--perpetrators are usually caught and convicted. And then there's former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who--after President Obama spoke on Ferguson--told CNN that ""[Obama] also should have spent 15 minutes on training the [black] community to stop killing each other."" This basic question--""Where is all the outrage over black-on-black crime?""--is raised whenever black Americans protest a police shooting, or any other violence against unarmed black men. ""Nationally, nearly half of all murder victims are black,"" wrote conservative commentator Juan Williams after Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012, ""And the overwhelming majority of those black people are killed by other black people. Where is the march for them?"" There are huge problems with ""black-on-black crime"" as a construct, mostly dealing with the banality of intra-racial crime, the foolishness of attributing violent criminality to blackness--rather than particular conditions faced by some black people--and the injustice of treating all blacks as criminally suspect because of the actions of a small minority. Let's ignore those. Instead, let's look directly at the question raised by Murdock, Giuliani, and Williams--""Do black people care about crime in their neighborhoods?"" They treat it as a rhetorical concern--a prelude to broad statements about black American concerns. But we should treat it as an empirical question--an issue we can resolve with some time and research. This isn't as easy as it sounds. While blacks are more likely to face criminal victimization than other groups, that doesn't tell us how black Americans feel about crime and where it ranks as a problem for their communities. For that, we have to look to public opinion surveys and other research. And while it's hard to draw a conclusive answer, all the available evidence points to one answer: Yes, black people are concerned with crime in their neighborhoods. First, a little context: In the last 20 years, we've seen a sharp drop in homicide among blacks, from a victimization rate of 39.4 homicides per 100,000 in 1991 to a rate of roughly 20 homicides per 100,000 in 2008. Likewise, the offending rate for blacks has dropped from 51.1 offenders per 100,000 in 1991 to 24.7 offenders per 100,000 in 2008. This decrease has continued through the 2010s and is part of a larger--and largely unexplained--national drop in crime. But while black neighborhoods are far less dangerous than they were a generation ago, black people are still concerned with victimization. Take this 2014 report from the Sentencing Project on perceptions of crime and support for punitive policies. Using data from the University of Albany's Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, the Sentencing Project found that--as a group--racial minorities are more likely than whites to report an ""area within a mile of their home where they would be afraid to walk alone at night"" (41 percent to 30 percent) and more likely to say there are certain neighborhoods they avoid, which they otherwise might want to go to (54 percent to 46 percent). And among black Americans in particular--circa 2003--""43 percent said they were 'very satisfied' about their physical safety in contrast to 59 percent of Hispanics, and 63 percent of whites."" More recent data shows a similar picture. In 2012, Gallup found that, compared to the general public, blacks were more worried about ""being attacked"" while driving their car, more worried about being the victim of a hate crime, and--most salient for our discussion--more worried about ""being murdered."" Likewise, according to a 2013 survey for NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Harvard School of Public Health, 26 percent of black Americans rank crime as the most important issue facing the area they live. That's higher than the ranking for the economy (16 percent), housing (4 percent), the environment (7 percent), social issues (4 percent), and infrastructure (7 percent). And in a recently published survey for Ebony magazine and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, 13 percent rank violent crime as a top issue--which sits in the middle of the rankings--and 48 percent say that the black community is losing ground on the issue. Finally, Atlantic Media's ""State of the City"" poll--published this past summer--shows an ""urban minority"" class that's worried about crime, and skeptical toward law enforcement, but eager for a greater police presence if it means less crime. Just 22 percent of respondents say they feel ""very safe"" walking in their neighborhoods after dark, and only 35 percent say they have ""a lot"" of confidence in their local police. That said, 60 percent say hiring more police would have a ""major impact"" on improving safety in their neighborhoods. And while ""urban minority"" includes a range of different groups, there's a good chance this is representative of black opinion in some areas of high crime and victimization, given the large black presence in many American cities. It's important to note that this concern with crime doesn't translate to support for punitive policies. Despite high victimization rates, black Americans are consistently opposed to harsh punishments and greater incarceration. Instead, they support more education and job training. Beyond the data, there's the anecdotal evidence. And in short, it's easy to find examples of marches and demonstrations against crime. In the last four years, blacks have held community protests against violence in Chicago; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Pittsburgh; Saginaw, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana. Indeed, there's a whole catalog of movies, albums, and sermons from a generation of directors, musicians, and religious leaders, each urging peace and order. You may not have noticed black protests against crime and violence, but that doesn't mean they haven't happened. Black Americans--like everyone else--are concerned with what happens in their communities, and at a certain point, pundits who insist otherwise are either lying or willfully ignorant. To that point, it's worth noting the extent to which ""what about black-on-black crime"" is an evasion, an attempt to avoid the fundamental difference between being killed by a citizen and being killed by an agent of law. And it's not new. ""When Ida B. Wells ... tried to explain to a wealthy suffragist in Chicago that anti-black violence in the nation must end,"" writes historian Khalil Gibran Muhammad for The Nation, ""Mary Plummer replied: Blacks need to ""drive the criminals out"" of the community. 'Have you forgotten that 10 percent of all the crimes that were committed in Chicago last year were by colored men [less than 3 percent of the population]?' "" Regardless of cause or concern, a community doesn't forfeit fair treatment because it has crime. That was true then when the scourge was lynching, and it's true now that the scourge is unjust police violence. Say what you will about ""black-on-black crime,"" just don't pretend it has anything to do with unfair killings at the hands of the state."	Actually, Blacks Do Care About Black Crime
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/washington_d_c_s_ferguson_protests_march_leads_to_walmart.html	"The H Street Walmart in Washington, D.C., got a bit of a surprise on Tuesday night when dozens of Ferguson protesters took a detour from their march around the nation's capital to march through the store. Thousands of protesters made their way through Northwest D.C., starting at 7 p.m. with rally at Mount Vernon Square and ending on the steps of the National Portrait Gallery. Their long, looping route--upward of two miles--took them past one of the district's newly opened Walmart Supercenters. As the protesters marched south along First Street toward the store, they began chanting ""Shut Walmart down!"" Then, while the bulk of the protest turned right to head down H Street toward Chinatown, a few dozen participants headed for Walmart's big sliding doors. They marched into the store, rode up the escalator--chanting all the while--and took a lap around, through the produce section and past the frozen foods cases, ending back in front of the store. I've covered a decent amount of protests--Truckers for the Constitution comes to mind, as well as a huge anti-marriage-equality march led by a woman blowing a shofar and an immigration rally where more than a half-dozen members of Congress were arrested--but nothing matches the surrealism of a ""Justice for Mike Brown! JAIL Ofc. Darren Wilson for Murder Stop Racist Police Terror"" banner hoisted above a Walmart customer service sign. The protesters chanted ""No justice, no peace!"" and ""A living wage! No peace!"" as they re-assembled and headed for the exit. As they headed out, store employees told me nothing was stolen or broken and nobody was arrested. When I was in the store, I saw nothing indicating lawbreaking of any sort. (We'll update this story if we get official comment from Walmart.) Some Walmart shoppers stared at the protesters bug-eyed. Others raised their hands over their heads in solidarity. And one employee, who identified herself only as Jay, said she would join up with them if she didn't have to work. ""If I was off the clock, I'd be with y'all!"" she said. ""No justice, no peace!"" Even given that they're protesting her employer? She dropped her voice. ""If I was off the clock, I would join y'all,"" she repeated. I later asked one of the Walmart protesters, Phillip Brown, why they decided to target the big box store. ""To shut it down,"" he said. ""They need to pay people a living wage. People can't survive on the money that they're paying them."" Eugene Puryear, an activist who ran for an at-large seat on the D.C. city council earlier this month and helped organize the evening's march, said he wasn't expecting protesters to enter the store. ""The spirit kind of moved us,"" he said. He said that Walmart contributes to poverty by paying its employees low wages. ""We believe the police and mass incarceration is a way of reinforcing social problems rather than solving them,"" he continued. ""So we wanted to point out that the low-wage workforce is a big piece of that. And we want to support our brothers and sisters who are working hard every day and just want to make a living for their families."" The crowd was dotted with Guy Fawkes masks, and a rainbow flag materialized when they arrived in Chinatown. One protester, Chene Byrd, held a sign calling for a boycott of the forthcoming Ridley Scott film, Exodus: Gods and Kings. ""It's the story of Moses, and it's all white people cast in the movie,"" he said. ""It's a total misrepresentation of my ancestors, of history. It's just false, totally false. It's a slap in the face, it's disrespectful, it's disgraceful. I think it's just another way to continue to force this image of white supremacy down our throats."" Chants ran the gamut from standard call-and-response protest fare (""Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like!"") and classic chanting formulations (""Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! These racist cops have got to go!"") to explicitly anti-cop chants, including ""Fuck the police!"" A few protesters chanted, ""Cops, pigs, murderers!"" at police officers standing in front of New Jersey Avenue. I asked Puryear if he worried about the anti-police tone some of the marchers took. ""I'm not concerned,"" he said, ""because when every 28 hours a black person is killed in this country by a police officer, a vigilante, or a security guard, when people are harassed and brutalized and abused, it's understandable that people would have that kind of anger and that kind of frustration."" ""This is something that I think is natural when there is so much abuse and misuse and, really, terror happening from police forces,"" he added. Protesters are planning more activity in the district for Black Friday."	D.C.'s Ferguson Protests Take On a Life of Their Own
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/republicans_arguing_over_congressional_budget_office_appointment_doug_elmendorf.html	"The Congressional Budget Office director's odds of being reappointed might not be the single sexiest news story of the day. Then again, Republicans don't need a story to be sexy in order to get themselves worked up about it. And right now the brewing conflict over who will lead the CBO is just one of a growing number of potential rifts among the Republican rank and file. First, a word on one of Washington's wonkiest bodies. The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that calculates the impact pending legislation could have on the federal budget and the economy as a whole. That analysis of how a bill would impact the government's revenues and the economy as a whole is called a score. The speaker of the House and the president pro-tem of the Senate (Rep. John Boehner and Sen. Orrin Hatch, respectively) will soon jointly appoint a CBO director for a term that will begin in January. One important detail in the process for naming the head of the CBO is that the House and Senate budget committees take turns recommending who the new director ought to be. The Senate made the last recommendation, so now it's the House's turn. Since the GOP will control both chambers during the next Congress, some on the right are pushing for Republicans to pick a CBO director other than the current one, former Brookings Institution senior fellow Doug Elmendorf. Elmendorf has loyal backers in conservative circles (more on that in a minute), but he also has drawn substantial criticism for the method he used to score the Senate Gang of Eight's immigration bill and, per Red State, for being ""a dyed-in-the-wool leftist."" CBO directors don't have term limits, so Elmendorf could keep the gig. But many influential activists on the right don't want that to happen. There are two basic schools of thought on the right about whether Elmendorf is the man for the job (and I'm painting with extremely broad brushstrokes here, for what that's worth). The first favors Elmendorf's re-appointment. In this school are the American Enterprise Institute's deputy director of economic policy studies, Michael Strain; the former chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw; and Charles Murray, the author of The Bell Curve. Strain made the case for Elmendorf's continued reign at the CBO in a writeup for National Review Online. He credits him for the CBO's ""reputation of impartiality during his tenure"" and implies that congressional Republicans may not have a better alternative. ""A CBO director less dedicated to solid, mainstream, academic, non-partisan analysis could put a large dent in the quality of the CBO's work and reputation,"" Strain writes. ""That would be bad, a very bad outcome indeed."" But there seems to be a bit of a subtext here: If Elmendorf is out, what kind of loon would House Republicans pick? The other school of thought holds that Elmendorf is totally untenable as CBO director. Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist is a vocal member of this school, as are American Commitment's Phil Kerpen and Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Dan Holler, a Heritage Action spokesman, was unequivocal in his opposition to Elmendorf's re-appointment. ""It's absurd if the Republican-controlled Congress would keep the guy who was at the CBO during Obamacare, especially in light of everything that [Obamacare adviser Jonathan] Gruber has said about the scoring and the sort of implicit misdirection that Congress employed and Elmendorf went along with,"" he said. ""Appointing him again is a sign that they're not ready to change Washington,"" he added. ""And the message from the last election is that Washington needs to change."" Kerpen was comparably vehement in his opposition to Elmendorf's return. ""I would imagine that if this actually looked like it were going to happen, we could get a very large and vocal contingent of almost every conservative to weigh in against it,"" he said. (The specifics of this debate get really wonky really fast. If you're interested in more detail, you can read much more here at the Washington Post.) So is it going to happen? A House aide close to the ongoing process said decision-makers are currently looking at an array of candidates. The aide didn't mention specific names. The big question now is: Will this disagreement flare up? Heritage Action has long been a thorn in the House leadership's side, and grass-roots conservatives' anger with Jonathan Gruber could well tarnish Elmendorf's reputation as a nonpartisan and an honest broker. Capitol Hill Republicans aren't even in charge yet, but a number of potential conflicts are already being set in motion. Elmendorf may be the wonkiest, but Republicans have fought over less."	The Newest Obscure War Among Republicans
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_police_timeline_a_comprehensive_chronological_accounting_of_the.html	"After the announcement that a grand jury had declined to indict Darren Wilson, Ferguson, Missouri, was the site of ""many fires, frequent bursts of gunshots, looting, and waves of tear gas,"" in the words of the New York Times. Before the night was out, ""West Florissant Avenue--the epicenter of the summer riots after the shooting--was again in flames,"" reports the Washington Post. According to the Associated Press, ""Monday night's protests were far more destructive than any of those that followed Brown's death."" More than a dozen businesses were burned, at least 14 people were injured, and 61 arrests were made in Ferguson, with an additional 21 in nearby St. Louis. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, speaking at a press conference at 1:30 a.m., said that he personally heard at least 150 gunshots in the Ferguson area. The grand jury's findings were never going to settle the debate about Wilson's decision to open fire on the unarmed Michael Brown--an indictment simply would have pushed prosecutors to move forward with a trial. What's happening now isn't just about the decision not to charge Wilson. It's about how the community is voicing its frustration and how--or perhaps whether--authorities are allowing them to do so. When the unrest began this summer, police escalated confrontations on the ground, brandishing military-grade riot gear in response to both the largely peaceful protests and the occasionally violent ones. That crackdown was greeted by an aggressive response from protesters, which in turn brought an even harsher crackdown from police. That cycle repeated itself on a nightly basis for more than a week. In the wake of this summer's most heated protests, we offered our best attempt at a comprehensive timeline that documented law enforcement behavior that ranged from rational and possibly justified to highly questionable and downright unconstitutional. The question this time is whether authorities have learned from their mistakes or are doomed to repeat them. Below, you'll find our latest installment documenting the interplay between how the protesters are protesting and the police are policing. We will continue to update the timeline in the days to come. Our original timeline is also reprinted below the rundown of more recent events. THE LEAD-UP Monday, Nov. 17: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declares a pre-emptive state of emergency. The governor, who was criticized this summer for his slow response to the original protests, was eager to avoid being caught flatfooted again. ""Regardless of the outcomes of the federal and state criminal investigations, there is the possibility of expanded unrest,"" Nixon said in his executive order, which authorized the deployment of the National Guard to Ferguson. ""The state of Missouri will be prepared to appropriately respond to any reaction to these announcements."" Not everyone was pleased with the plan to declare an emergency before anyone had done anything, particularly given how the police's aggressive response this summer fanned the flames of unrest. As my colleague Jamelle Bouie reminded us: ""[A]t first dozens, then hundreds of people gathered to peacefully protest the shooting and demand answers for why Brown's body was allowed to lie in the sun for four hours before police took action. If there was unrest that day, it was less because of the protesters and more because of police."" THE ANNOUNCEMENT Monday, Nov. 24: St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch schedules a prime-time press conference to announce the grand jury's decision. Community leaders had asked that McCulloch provide a 48-hour warning before announcing the grand jury's decision in hopes that the delay would help keep the peace. Not only was McCulloch unwilling to wait two days--he scheduled the announcement for 8 p.m. local time, ensuring that the early demonstrations would occur overnight. The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery pointed out on Twitter that ""Announcing at night allows for rush hour traffic to clear, schools to get all children home."" Still, it's hard to image that an 8 a.m. press conference, followed by hour upon hour of daylight, could have made things worse. McCulloch's announcement itself, meanwhile, was lengthy and yet somehow still frustratingly vague. THE DEMONSTRATIONS BEGIN Monday, Nov. 24: Protests begin in earnest. Small groups had been demonstrating in and around Ferguson for days ahead of the decision, and a large group had gathered at the Clayton courthouse to await the grand jury's announcement. Almost immediately after McCullouch announced there would be no charges for Wilson, the protests began in full force. While many of the protesters behaved peacefully, some demonstrations devolved into violence. News cameras captured a group of protesters vandalizing a police car. Before the night was out, several buildings were burned and some businesses were looted. Monday, Nov. 24: Local authorities deploy tear gas to break up demonstrations. According to CNN, officials suggested prior to the grand jury announcement that they would not deploy tear gas as they had this summer. That promise quickly went unfulfilled. Shortly after the demonstrations began, police began firing tear gas canisters into the crowds of protesters, small groups of which had already turned destructive. As Dahlia Lithwick and Daria Roithmayr previously explained in Slate, the use of tear gas by police for crowd control is generally unconstitutional. The due process clause of the Constitution bans officers from using excessive force even when they are attempting to control a crowd or arrest a suspect. ""And tear gas is in a category all its own,"" Lithwick and Roithmayr wrote. ""Not only is unleashing it into a crowd an unconstitutional exercise of excessive force, but its use is banned by international law."" Monday, Nov. 24: Police justify calls for dispersal by pointing to traffic. Local authorities had suggested they would give demonstrators a relatively wide berth to voice their frustrations. The one catch? Protesters are not allowed to disrupt traffic--a requirement that led even the most peaceful demonstrators to run afoul of the ground rules. Monday, Nov. 24: The Federal Aviation Administration places temporary flight restrictions over Ferguson after deeming it a hazardous area. The restrictions bar media helicopters and commercial planes from flying within a 3-mile radius of the city if they're flying under 3,000 feet. According to the Los Angeles Times, the ""no-fly zone is the strictest kind legally available to the FAA."" The agency issued the same restriction this summer at the request of local police, who claimed at the time that the ban was needed because one of its own choppers was shot at ""multiple times."" Despite those ostensible safety concerns, audio recordings show that ""local authorities privately acknowledged the purpose was to keep away news helicopters during violent street protests,"" according to the Associated Press. Tuesday, Nov. 25: Gov. Nixon orders more Missouri National Guardsmen to Ferguson. Shortly after 1 a.m. local time, the Missouri governor announced that he had ordered the deployment of additional guardsmen. ""The Guard is providing security at the Ferguson Police Department, which will allow additional law enforcement officers to protect the public,"" the governor said in a statement. Tuesday afternoon, Nov. 25: Gov. Nixon triples National Guard presence. At an afternoon press conference, Nixon announced that there would be 2,200 guardsmen available Tuesday, more than triple Monday's total. ""Last night was a disaster. It's very disappointing,"" Nixon said. ""Criminals intent on lawlessness and destruction terrorized this community."" The governor's announcement came after Ferguson Mayor James Knowles complained that state officials had been slow to deploy the National Guard on Monday. ""Unfortunately as the unrest grew and further assistance was needed, the National Guard was not deployed in enough time to save all of our businesses,"" the mayor said at his own press conference. Tuesday night, Nov. 25: Second night brings skirmishes, but less destruction. The second night of post-grand-jury protests was significantly less chaotic, a result that officials and some observers credited to the heavier law enforcement presence. Still, there were a handful of flare-ups and skirmishes, including several instances of people throwing ""rocks, tents poles, and bottles--some containing urine--at officers,"" according to the Associated Press. Some demonstrators took their anger out on a police car, breaking its windows, flipping it, and ultimately setting it on fire. A second blaze was set at a local Walgreens. The most significant confrontation occurred outside Ferguson City Hall, where several windows were shattered--an act that prompted police to deploy tear gas for what officials said was the only time that night. Shortly before midnight local time, police instructed the crowd to leave the area, an order that was eventually imposed with physical force. ""It took about an hour for the authorities to clear the street, by charging into the crowd with shields and clubs, and spraying some people with pepper spray,"" according to the New York Times. All told, officials said they had made 45 arrests overnight, seven for felonies with most of the rest for failure to disperse. ""I think, generally, it was a much better night,"" St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. * * * THE ORIGINAL FERGUSON POLICE TIMELINE, published Aug. 21, 2014 THE SHOOTING Saturday, Aug. 9, early afternoon: A white Ferguson Police officer, later identified as Darren Wilson, shoots and kills Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old. Two competing narratives quickly emerged about the incident, one from police who say that the officer acted in self-defense and one from several witnesses who have said that Wilson was the aggressor. What both sides agree on is that Brown was unarmed at the time of the shooting. County prosecutors began presenting evidence to a grand jury 11 days later, but it will likely take months before jurors reach a decision on whether Wilson should be charged. If he ultimately is, many details of the official investigation could remain sealed until trial, making it likely that questions about what happened in the moments before Wilson opened fire will remain unanswered for the foreseeable future. THE CRIME SCENE Saturday, Aug. 9, early afternoon: Wilson allegedly does not alert dispatch to the shooting. This detail remains unconfirmed. It stems from comments made by the attorney for Dorian Johnson, the friend who was with Brown during the confrontation with police. The lawyer complained to the Washington Post that in the immediate aftermath of the shooting the ""officer doesn't attempt to resuscitate [Brown]. ... He does not call for medical help. The officer didn't call it in that someone had been shot."" But, as PunditFact has explained, there is reason to doubt that claim. Incident reports later released by Ferguson police indicate a prompt response, and an audio recording from the St. Louis County dispatch also suggests that police requested assistance with crowd control in the area. Saturday, Aug. 9, afternoon: Brown's body remains at the scene of the shooting for several hours, a large portion of that time uncovered. This grisly detail is undisputed. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told reporters that one reason for the delay in processing the crime scene was that officers at the scene heard gunfire nearby (although those shots were never confirmed). Adding to the community's anguish at seeing Brown's body in the middle of the road was the fact that his mother, Lesley McSpadden, was at the scene pleading with police. ""Why y'all got my son out in the street?"" McSpadden told the officers, according to a neighbor who was present. Even Jackson would later admit that he was ""uncomfortable"" with how long Brown's body remained in the open. Sunday, Aug. 10, morning: Police provide only limited information about the shooting. At a morning press conference, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting was sparked by a physical confrontation instigated by Brown, and that Brown at one point reached for the officer's gun. Belmar declined to provide further details or release the name of the officer. As for the number of times the unarmed teen was shot, Belmar offered up a sound bite that encapsulated what many saw as authorities' cavalier attitude about Brown's death. ""It was more than just a couple, but I don't think it was many more than that,"" the chief said. THE PROTESTS BEGIN Sunday, Aug. 10: The police respond to growing protests with military-grade riot gear. Ferguson residents gathered at the scene of Brown's death on Saturday, and a smaller group of roughly 100 people rallied outside Ferguson police headquarters later that night. The demonstrations gained significant steam on Sunday night, with a growing number of residents congregating on West Florissant Avenue. While largely peaceful, the protests were not entirely so. A candlelight vigil was marred by violence as protesters smashed car windows and looted local businesses. Fearing the worst about what was then still largely a peaceful demonstration, authorities responded by deploying officers in military-grade riot gear and armored trucks, quickly setting the tone for what would unfold over the following days. Radley Balko, who literally wrote the book on the militarization of American police, has already documented how dressing for battle increases the chances that you'll engage in one. Several police chiefs have also expressed reservations about the gear in the past. ""Some say not using it exposes my officers to a little bit more risk,"" Chris Burbank, a police chief in Salt Lake City, told Balko last fall. ""That could be, but risk is part of the job. I'm just convinced that when we don riot gear, it says 'throw rocks and bottles at us.' It invites confrontation. Two-way communication and cooperation are what's important."" Sunday, Aug. 10: Officers respond with rubber bullets and tear gas. Local police, playing the part for which they are dressed, confronted protesters by firing rubber bullets and tear gas into the crowd. Dahlia Lithwick and Daria Roithmayr have already explained in Slate how such actions are unconstitutional. The due process clause of the Constitution bans officers from using excessive force even when they are attempting to control a crowd or arrest a suspect. ""And tear gas is in a category all its own,"" Lithwick and Roithmayr wrote. ""Not only is unleashing it into a crowd an unconstitutional exercise of excessive force, but its use is banned by international law."" Sunday, Aug. 10: Authorities dispatch officers with police dogs to help control the crowds. Deploying tear gas and rubber bullets garnered the most attention, but the police made another highly questionable decision in attempting to control the crowds. Authorities also dispatched a number of officers with police dogs, a move that drew comparisons to how police used similar tactics during the Jim Crow era. As former Seattle Police Chief Norman Stamper, who was in charge during widespread protests in his city in 1999, later told Vox, ""using dogs for crowd control is operationally, substantively, and from an image point-of-view just about the worst thing you can do."" Sunday, Aug. 10: Officers use an LRAD sound cannon in an attempt to disperse the crowd. A journalist live-streaming the demonstrations for Argus Radio captured the sound cannons, which blast pain-inducing noises over long distances, on film. The technology has previously sparked fears that it can cause permanent hearing loss, particularly if an officer isn't properly trained in how to use it. ""Human discomfort starts when a sound hits 120dB, well below the LRAD's threshold,"" Gizmodo explains. ""Permanent hearing loss begins at 130dB, and if the device is turned up to 140dB, anyone within its path would not only suffer hearing loss, they could potentially lose their balance and be unable to move out of the path of the audio."" Tuesday, Aug. 12: Police backtrack on releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting. Chief Jackson canceled plans to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing concerns for the safety of the officer and his colleagues. This decision further inflamed an already frustrated community, further fueling unrest among protesters who had been demanding answers (and getting none) for several days. Tuesday, Aug. 12: The FAA bans low-flying aircraft over Ferguson. The agency issued the temporary restrictions--which effectively barred news helicopters from the city's skies--at the request of local police, who claimed the ban was needed after one of its own choppers was shot at ""multiple times on Sunday night,"" according to a spokesman.  The ban was originally supposed to last one week but was extended for another seven days on Monday, Aug. 18, ""to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities,"" according to the FAA. Wednesday, Aug. 13: Ferguson police officers reportedly remove their nametags and refuse to identify themselves when asked. Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly was among the first to point out the lack of ID, a fact that was then confirmed by numerous photos. Some states require a police officer to identify him- or herself, but former St. Louis Police Chief Dan Isom, now a professor of criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, told Slate that he was ""not aware"" of any law that required police in Missouri to wear identification or give their names if asked. Still, the seeming anonymity, and resulting unaccountability, of officers in Ferguson would become a running theme. Wednesday, Aug. 13: Police arrest the Washington Post's Wesley Lowery and the Huffington Post's Reilly at a local McDonald's. The two reporters were using the fast-food joint as a staging area during their coverage of the protests outside when police entered the establishment and instructed them to leave. According to Lowery, the police gave conflicting instructions on how they were supposed to exit and eventually decided that they weren't leaving fast enough, at which point they were taken into custody. The arrests prompted critical responses by a number of media organizations, as well as President Obama, who had this to say the following day: ""Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground."" Even in the moment, Ferguson authorities appeared to see the problem. Told what had happened by a reporter from the Los Angeles Times, the local police chief responded, ""Oh, God."" Wednesday, Aug. 13: Police arrest Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman, along with a dozen or so protesters. The detention of reporters generated the most coverage of any arrests in Ferguson, with this possible exception. French, a local official who had been meeting with protesters and documenting the actions of police, remained in jail overnight (unlike Lowery and Reilly) despite no formal charges ever being filed. French said that his arresting officer told him he was being taken into custody ""because you didn't listen."" Wednesday, Aug. 13: A group of Al Jazeera America journalists is hit by tear gas while preparing to broadcast. The incident was captured on camera, and the images quickly spread on social media, along with rumors that police also confiscated the crew's equipment. The following day, however, the St. Charles County Sheriff's Department released a statement saying that the journalists were not specifically targeted. Once a SWAT team discovered the Al Jazeera crew had been caught in the cloud of tear gas, the department said, members helped the journalists to safety and later disassembled their equipment for them. A representative for the department also said the reporters ""thanked their officers"" for the help. Al Jazeera later confirmed that police eventually did come to the aid of its crew, but cameraman Sam Winslade disputed the suggestion that he and his colleagues weren't originally targeted. ""We were fired at from a police MRAP vehicle,"" Winslade told the Wrap, referring to the armored vehicles the police were using. He said that after seeking shelter between houses, a different police vehicle eventually pulled up. ""They opened the back of the vehicle and ordered us inside,"" he said. Thursday, Aug. 14: Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson takes charge of operations on the ground. Johnson, a black Ferguson native, was brought in to coordinate the police response and quickly instituted a less aggressive policy toward protesters. That night's demonstrations went smoothly. The iconic moment of the night was Johnson marching with--and hugging--protesters. As the Associated Press put it: ""Within hours [of the change in command], the mood among protesters becomes lighter, even festive. The streets are filled with music, free food and even laughter."" Friday, Aug. 15: The Ferguson Police Department releases the name of the officer--but also surveillance footage purporting to show Brown robbing a convenience store shortly before he was shot and killed. Almost a week after the shooting, the Ferguson police finally heeded the calls to name the officer who shot Brown: Darren Wilson. But they released the surveillance footage at the same press conference, despite the fact that police would later admit that Wilson was unaware that Brown was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting. The release of the video came against the wishes of the Justice Department, which reportedly feared that the footage would only elevate tensions. Such concerns proved correct: The good will that Johnson earned the previous night was in fact largely undone after the Ferguson Police Department's press conference. Saturday, Aug. 16: Gov. Jay Nixon declares a state of emergency and imposes a curfew. The curfew--from midnight to 5 a.m.--largely failed as a crowd control effort, with clashes between protesters and police beginning on Saturday and Sunday in the hours before the curfew even began. Sunday's unrest was particularly intense, marking one of the more violent days since the demonstrations began. It's impossible to know if the curfew was to blame for the chaotic events, or if it simply failed to prevent them. Either way, the curfew was lifted on Monday, Aug. 18. Sunday, Aug. 17: Officers make explicit threats to members of the media. MSNBC's Chris Hayes was threatened with mace and, in one of the more troubling moments caught on film since the demonstrations began, Mustafa Hussein, a journalist who had been live-streaming the unrest for Argus Radio, was warned by an officer to turn off his camera light lest he be ""shelled."" While the previous week's arrest of Lowery and Reilly appeared to happen almost by accident, Sunday night's events suggested some officers had begun to specifically target members of the media. Sunday, Aug. 17: A police officer is captured on camera shouting at protesters, ""Bring it, all you fucking animals! Bring it!"" Such language, Samuel Walker, the emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, told Slate, was only a sign of the larger problems. ""If they know they can get away with that type of language, that really defines the culture of the department,"" Walker said. Monday, Aug. 18: An anonymous source leaks details from the official autopsy that suggest Brown had marijuana in his system at the time of his death. While the official results of the death investigation were still under wraps, an unnamed source leaked this detail in what many said was an attempt to smear Brown's character. ""Let me be real clear to everyone here,"" Anthony Gray, an attorney for Brown's family, told reporters. ""This family never said Michael Brown was a perfect kid."" Monday, Aug. 18: The governor calls in the National Guard. Nixon made the decision to bring in the guardsmen without first alerting the White House. Calling in the guard was within Nixon's rights, but clearly it irked the president. ""I'll be watching to see that it's helping, not hindering, progress,"" Obama said of Nixon's decision to use the guard in a support role. Officials would not say how many members of the National Guard were deployed to Ferguson, although they suggested that they would mostly be used as a second line of defense at the unified command center. Monday, Aug. 18: Several more reporters are arrested while doing their jobs. CNN's Don Lemon was shoved by police, and his colleague Jake Tapper was forced to flee tear gas. Getty photographer Scott Olson was arrested after he ventured outside one of the preapproved areas that police had been using to sequester reporters, and the Intercept's Ryan Devereaux and others were detained overnight. ""[N]eedless to say, it's an outrage that he was stopped and handcuffed by police in the course of lawfully doing his job on the streets of Ferguson,"" Intercept editor John Cook wrote in the hours after Devereaux's arrest. Tuesday, Aug. 19: Gov. Nixon says he won't replace the county prosecutor despite concerns about his strong ties to police. Residents, already fearing that there wouldn't be a fair investigation into Brown's death, worry that St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch's family history will further stack the deck. According to the Associated Press, ""McCulloch's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect."" Nixon, however, was unmoved by that evidence. Tuesday, Aug. 19: An officer points his weapon directly at a protester. The protests were largely peaceful Tuesday night, leading Johnson to declare at an overnight press conference, ""I believe there was a turning point made."" But despite the relatively good vibes, there were still isolated issues that caused concern. An officer was seen pointing a semiautomatic assault rifle at a protester. When members of the crowd verbally confronted the officer, he responded: ""I will fucking kill you. Get back."" Asked his name, he offered a similar rejoinder: ""Go fuck yourself."" After the ACLU lodged an official complaint, the officer was relieved of duty and suspended indefinitely the following day. Wednesday, Aug. 20: Cooling down. The protests shrunk from large demonstrations to smaller groups circling the streets downtown. ""The story of Ferguson isn't over,"" Slate's Bouie wrote in a dispatch from the ground the following day. ""There's still a lot of energy, and local activists hope to channel it into something durable and long lasting. ... But if [Wednesday] night is any indication, the large, mass protests of the last week are over."" Thursday, Aug. 21: The National Guard begins to leave. Nixon orders the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson, saying that the situation on the ground has greatly improved. In total, at least 155 people have been arrested since Brown's shooting, with roughly 80 percent of those charged with ""refusal to disperse."" While the large-scale demonstrations appear to have subsided for now, protesters are far from satisfied. On Thursday, attention shifts to those who are outraged by Nixon's decision to allow McCulloch to lead the investigation into Brown's death. Read more of Slate's coverage of Ferguson."	A Comprehensive Timeline of the Police Mistakes in the Latest Round of Michael Brown Protests
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/darren_wilson_was_never_going_to_be_indicted_for_killing_michael_brown_our.html	"The first Ferguson protests had two slogans: ""Hands up, don't shoot""--referring to Michael Brown's final actions before he was killed--and ""Justice for Michael Brown."" And when you asked protesters what they meant by ""justice,"" they replied with a plea for accountability. In their minds, justice could only come with an indictment of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot him. No, he probaby wouldn't go to prison. But if nothing else, an indictment would show that Brown's life mattered. That the lives of people like Brown matter. And that their communities deserve answers and explanations for police violence. On Monday night, St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCullough told Ferguson that after three months of deliberation, the 12 members of the grand jury had its decision: Darren Wilson would not be indicted. In his statement announcing the decision, McCullough explained that the grand jury considered five separate charges--ranging from manslaughter to first-degree murder--and that the jury was convinced by the available evidence that Wilson had reasonable grounds for shooting Brown, and wasn't liable for a crime. None of this was a surprise. It's extremely rare for a police officer to face an indictment for a shooting, much less criminal punishment. ""The FBI reported 410 justifiable homicides by law enforcement in 2012,"" noted Talking Points Memo in an August story following the events in Ferguson, ""The number of indictments appear to be minimal after a TPM review of available press reports."" And it's not just shootings; earlier this year, Georgia police mistakenly raided a home and seriously injured a young child. Prosecutors convened a grand jury, and the grand jury voted against an indictment. ""The drug investigation that led to these events was hurried, sloppy, and unfortunately not in accordance with the best practices and procedures,"" wrote the grand jury in its decision. Still, no one from the police force was held accountable. The truth is that the law gives wide berth to the police's use of deadly force. Just two months before Brown was killed, the Supreme Court gave its ruling in Plumhoff v. Rickard, where the plaintiffs were suing after police officers ended a high speed chase by shooting 15 rounds into the car, killing the driver and a passenger. The court held that this wasn't ""excessive force"" in violation of the Constitution, affirming years of deference to police departments. ""It stands to reason,"" wrote the justices in a 9-0 opinion, ""that if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended."" Beyond this, there are the general standards for use of deadly force by police, which give wide latitude to officers who use their weapons. The Supreme Court allows police to use their weapons in two circumstances: To defend their lives and to stop an escaped felon. If Wilson believed that Brown was a felon--or committed a felonious offense--then he was justified under existing law. And if Wilson believed he was in danger of losing his life--a belief that only has to be ""objectively reasonable,"" not likely or even possible--then, again, he was justified under existing law. When you add this climate of legal deference to the particular circumstances of the grand jury trial--including McCullough's reputation for supporting police officers, and his decision to avoid a recommendation for charges--the non-indictment was almost inevitable. Barring something extraordinary, Wilson was going to walk free. The judicial system as we've constructed it just isn't equipped--or even willing--to hold officers accountable for shootings and other offenses. Or put differently, the simple fact is that the police can kill for almost any reason with little fear of criminal charges. Which is to say this: It would have been powerful to see charges filed against Darren Wilson. At the same time, actual justice for Michael Brown--a world in which young men like Michael Brown can't be gunned down without consequences--won't come from the criminal justice system. Our courts and juries aren't impartial arbiters--they exist inside society, not outside of it--and they can only provide as much justice as society is willing to give. Unfortunately, we don't live in a society that gives dignity and respect to people like Michael Brown and John Crawford and Rekia Boyd. Instead, we've organized our country to deny it wherever possible, through negative stereotypes of criminality, through segregation and neglect, and through the spectacle we see in Ferguson and the greater St. Louis area, where police are empowered to terrorize without consequence, and residents are condemned and attacked when they try to resist.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/pew_poll_on_white_perception_of_ferguson_and_staten_island_grand_jury_decisions.html	"In recent weeks, two grand juries--one in Ferguson, Missouri, and the other in Staten Island, New York--have failed to indict police officers in the deaths of unarmed men. In each case, the victim was black, the officer who killed him was white, and most grand jurors were white. According to a new survey by the Pew Research Center, more than 60 percent of black people, compared with 16 to 18 percent of white people, believe that race was a ""major factor"" in both decisions. But the survey presents a puzzle. If race played an equally strong role in both grand juries--presumably by influencing white jurors or a white-dominated process--you'd expect the poll results to be consistent with that. Since both cases centered on a white cop and a black victim, you'd expect whites to view the two cases somewhat similarly. Instead, whites judged the case in New York quite differently from the one in Missouri. It's a good bet that race did influence the grand jurors. Plenty of research has shown that race affects almost everyone's perceptions, at least in subtle ways. But what's striking here is that Pew's black respondents believed the degree of influence was roughly the same in both cases. In the Ferguson case, 64 percent of blacks said race was a major factor in the grand jury's decision, 17 percent said it was a minor factor, and 9 percent said it wasn't a factor. In the Staten Island case, the numbers were almost identical: 62, 18, and 11 percent. You can argue that this perception of racial bias fits what white respondents said about the Ferguson case. Sixty-four percent of whites in Pew's sample said the grand jury was right not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown. Only 23 percent said this outcome was wrong. Sixty percent of whites said race was a nonfactor in the grand jury's decision. (Seventeen percent said it was a minor factor, and 16 percent said it was a major factor.) But how, then, do you explain what the same white respondents said about the New York case? Only 28 percent said the Staten Island grand jury was right not to indict the officer who killed Eric Garner. More than half of the whites who agreed with the decision in Ferguson did not agree with the decision in New York. Same-colored victim, same-colored officer, same white poll sample, different conclusion. How did whites arrive at different opinions in the two cases? The crucial variable appears to be information, not race. In the Ferguson case, 47 percent of whites who had read or heard a little about the grand jury's decision said it was right; 26 percent said it was wrong. Among whites who said they had read or heard a lot about the decision, 70 percent said it was right; 23 percent said it was wrong. That's a 26-point increase in the net margin of support for the decision (the percentage who said it was right, minus the percentage who said it was wrong) In the New York case, the trend went the other way. Among whites who had read or heard a little about the grand jury's decision, 40 percent said it was wrong; 33 percent said it was right. Among whites who said they had read or heard a lot about the decision, 61 percent said it was wrong; 27 percent said it was right. That's a 27-point increase in the net margin of opposition to the decision. In the Garner case, unlike the Brown case, the more whites learned, the more they disagreed with the outcome. The poll doesn't tell us what these respondents learned. The question simply asked how much they had read or heard ""about the decision by [the] grand jury."" In the Ferguson case, maybe they heard about autopsy results or witness testimony. Maybe they saw Wilson's interview on ABC News, or the surveillance tape of Brown in a convenience store. In the Staten Island case, maybe they saw the unflinching video of Garner's death. The quantity, quality, and clarity of evidence differed between the two cases. Maybe that mattered. And that's the point: Evidence, not race, separated Garner's death from Brown's. The poll numbers don't mean that race wasn't a factor, or that there isn't a lot of bias and injustice to clean up in the legal system. But they do indicate that many whites have assessed these cases based on information and that this factor has been strong enough to produce sharply different results, even when the most obvious racial factors are identical. I wonder what Pew's black respondents would make of these numbers. Maybe they'd point out that the legal process was tilted in favor of police in both cases, regardless of what whites tell a pollster. Or maybe they'd say that race remains a major factor in whites' judgments, alongside information about the case at hand. But I bet that many of the black respondents would be favorably surprised and that if they were put together with the white respondents in a focus group, there would be surprises all around. Fortunately, we don't need a pollster to arrange that kind of conversation. We can have it right here. What do you make of the white split on the Brown and Garner cases? Does it affect your assessment of racism in this country? Why or why not?"	Why Do Whites See Ferguson and Staten Island So Differently?
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/the_forever_war_when_will_we_stop_using_a_september_2001_authorization_of.html	"It's now been more than a year and a half since President Obama told an audience at the National Defense University that ""this war, like all wars, must end. That's what history advises. That's what our democracy demands."" The ""war"" he was referring to was the amorphous set of military engagements around the world launched by his predecessor George W. Bush following the 9/11 attacks. That war has now been raging for 13 years. And despite Obama's declaration in 2013, it shows no sign of ending anytime soon. The United States doesn't actually declare war anymore--the last time it did was World War II--but Congress still sanctions American combat through authorizations for the use of military force. The AUMF, which authorized the president to use ""appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized,  committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons,"" was passed by Congress with only one nay vote--Rep. Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California--on Sept. 14, 2001. The 2001 AUMF specifically applied to the perpetrators of 9/11 (al-Qaida) and those that harbored them (the then-Taliban-controlled government of Afghanistan). Over time, though, the Bush and Obama administrations have interpreted it more broadly to apply to ""associated forces"" of al-Qaida--language that was not in the original authorization. It has also provided the legal basis for strikes on groups that didn't exist at the time of 9/11, like the Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as entities like Somalia's al-Shabaab that share the global terror network's ideology but whose goals are primarily local. Osama Bin Laden is dead, the global network he created is a shell of its former self, and most of the planners of 9/11 have been killed or are languishing in Guantanamo. But whenever the CIA launches a drone attack against a Taliban target in Pakistan or U.S. special operations forces swoop in to nab an al-Qaida suspect in Libya, the mandate of the 2001 AUMF--a two-page resolution passed into law 13 years ago for a completely different purpose--lives on. To borrow the title of Dexter Filkins' book on Afghanistan and Iraq, it has created a forever war, one limited by neither time nor geography. In his speech at the National Defense University, Obama acknowledged that the AUMF was looking a bit long in the tooth and that it probably shouldn't continue to apply to every group that calls itself al-Qaida. ""Unless we discipline our thinking and our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don't need to fight, or continue to grant presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states,"" he said. ""So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF's mandate."" This was a rare instance of a president asking Congress to limit his own power. But since that time, the AUMF hasn't been refined or repealed and Obama hasn't brought the war to an end. Rather, he's expanded it. The U.S. began launching airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq on Aug. 8. The campaign expanded into Syria on Sept. 11 of this year. The War Powers Resolution, passed in the wake of the Vietnam War, gives the president 90 days to conduct a military operation before Congress must approve it, but as of now, 124 days after it began, the war against ISIS has not been authorized. To the extent that the White House has offered any legal rationale for this, it's relied on the trusty old AUMF. In a background statement sent to the New York Times in September, the White House argued that it didn't need a new authorization for the use of military force against ISIS, as the group was covered by the 2001 AUMF due to its ""longstanding relationship with al-Qaida."" This may be the most dubious extension of the AUMF's authority yet. It's true that ISIS began as an al-Qaida affiliate. On the other hand, it did not exist at the time of 9/11 and has been fighting against al-Qaida since last year. Nonetheless, Secretary of State John Kerry argued to a skeptical Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week that ""in my judgment, everybody knows this group merely changed its name, but it's been al Qaeda in Iraq."" The White House has also made the case that the operation is covered by the 2002 AUMF that authorized the original invasion of Iraq. One might have assumed that the scope of that authorization ended when U.S. troops pulled out of the country in 2011, and that it did not amount to permanent permission to bomb Iraq whenever and however the president wanted. Despite its claim that the 2002 AUMF should cover the fight against ISIS, the administration told the Times that ""our position on the 2002 AUMF hasn't changed and we'd like to see it repealed."" In the case of both AUMFs, then, the White House wants to have it both ways: The administration thinks they're no longer valid, but so long as they're still on the books, it's perfectly willing to continue using them. It's looking likely that Congress will adjourn this week without issuing a new authorization for the fight against ISIS. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the issue should be tabled until the newly elected, Republican-controlled Senate is in place. But this week, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led by outgoing Chairman Robert Menendez, are making a final effort to craft an authorization. Previous authorizations, authored by Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Adam Schiff of California, have failed. (Paul's bill would have taken the now-unheard-of step of formally declaring war against ISIS, a throwback to the days of World War II.) Menendez's proposal would put the ISIS ""war"" on firmer legal footing, limit the engagement to three years, repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF, and--much to the consternation of Republicans on the committee--place constraints on the use of ground troops. It would also leave the 2001 authorization in place. Even if the measure passes through committee, full congressional approval seems almost impossible this week. Schiff, a Democrat representing part of Los Angeles, tells Slate that such a measure is better than nothing. But so long as the 2001 AUMF persists, he says, the forever war will just keep going. ""It's highly problematic just to focus on ISIS,"" Schiff says. ""As long as the other authorizations persist, then even when the new authorization expires, this administration or a subsequent one can fall back on the argument that White House uses now, which is that the previous authorization covers everything they want to do."" Schiff has twice unsuccessfully proposed amendments that would sunset the original AUMF. His proposal for a specific ISIS authorization would also have repealed the 2001 AUMF. Schiff says he believes the president was serious about his desire to repeal the AUMF and would likely be ""uncomfortable leaving a legacy of unbridled war-making power in the executive."" When it comes to the lack of movement on a new AUMF, either for Syria or generally, he says there's plenty of blame to go around. ""It's a combination of the administration not being confident in whether it can get what it needs out of Congress and therefore not coming to Congress with a draft, and a Congress that isn't eager to take up an issue that may later come back to bite them,"" he says. These attitudes may be cynical, but they aren't unfounded. The last time Obama asked for authorization to bomb Syria came following Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons in the summer of 2013. At that time the president faced heavy public and congressional opposition to the idea of a new military engagement in the Middle East. (The rise of ISIS and, in particular, the gruesome videos showing the beheadings of American journalists in Syria have since changed these attitudes.) In the end, a last-minute deal facilitated by the Russian government, under which Assad agreed to ship his remaining chemical weapons out of the country, prevented what could have been a humiliating political defeat for the White House. The stakes are even higher this time, with an operation already underway that involves U.S. troops and more than a dozen allies. If Congress voted against war in Syria today, it seems unlikely that the U.S. military would just pack up and leave, but the already threadbare legal rationale for the operation would look even flimsier. Even if Congress approved an AUMF before the year were out, it could include limits on the methods that could be used--namely, ground troops--and how long the operation would last. This week Kerry told Congress that a new AUMF should not ""preemptively bind the hands of the commander in chief or our commanders in the field."" From Congress's point of view, there's not much to be gained politically from taking ownership of a military operation that could turn out to be a costly disaster. The fact that so many congressional Democrats were willing to authorize Bush's wars is part of the reason why Barack Obama, who publicly opposed those wars, is president today. For the soon-to-be Republican-controlled Senate, the shrewder move is to sit back and criticize the administration's conduct of the war without getting its own hands dirty. Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has covered the AUMF debate extensively, says that Congress and the White House are like nervous teenagers at a high school prom. ""Everybody wants there to be a dance, but nobody wants to ask first,"" he says. ""Meanwhile, the music is playing and there's no dancing happening."" As Wittes puts it, ""You have an understanding between the executive and the legislature that amounts to 'don't ask, don't tell.' "" Everybody seems to know this is no way to run a war, but nobody's in a huge hurry to do anything about it. This may work out well politically for both sides--the White House gets to have its war, and Congress gets to attack it. But in the long run, Congress isn't performing one of its most important oversight functions. ""We're really derelict in our constitutional duty in putting this off during a war,"" says Schiff. Meanwhile, the White House continues conducting its foreign policy as if Congress doesn't exist. And as long as the AUMF stands--as well as the legal interpretation that holds that it applies to groups like ISIS--Obama and his successors can continue to use it to launch wars against enemies with only the most tenuous connection to 9/11. Or, as the president himself put it in his speech, against ""every collection of thugs that labels themselves al-Qaida."" ""It's a fundamental violation of the rule of law,"" says Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman, one of Obama's most prominent constitutional critics from the left. ""I would hope that the president wouldn't accept a carte blanche for any future war-making activity by any future president. This is a serious constitutional lawyer. He actually understands what he's doing in a way that presidents in the past didn't."" This has implications beyond Syria. The White House announced last month that the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan would be extended into 2015, despite an earlier pledge that U.S. troops wouldn't take part in combat past the end of this year. The forever war is still being fought on several fronts. Some sort of anti-ISIS authorization is likely to be passed in the next Congress, though one that repeals or places a time limit on the 2001 AUMF may be a long shot. Democrats will likely push for an authorization that prohibits ""boots on the ground,"" while for Republicans, as Wittes puts it, ""there will be a lot of temptation to put in things to make the administration look weak, to authorize things they would never do."" This could include expanding the operation to target Bashar al-Assad's military, something that some Republicans--notably John McCain--have pushed for but the White House has steadfastly avoided. The upcoming AUMF debate could be a test case for Rand Paul's brand of anti-militarist conservatism heading into the 2016 election cycle. Repealing the bill will require a combined effort from the Democratic left and Republican right against the generally more hawkish middle. Ackerman, a self-described liberal Democrat, notes with some satisfaction that Paul has lately taken to citing the Yale professor's arguments to contend that Obama's wars are unconstitutional. There's also the risk that, like its predecessors, a new AUMF could metastasize. In his Senate testimony on Tuesday, Kerry argued that a Syria AUMF should not include a ""geographic limitation"" to just Iraq and Syria. ""We don't anticipate conducting operations in countries other than Iraq and Syria, but to the extent that ISIL poses a threat to American interests and personnel in other countries, we would not want an AUMF to constrain our ability to use appropriate force against ISIL in those locations if necessary,"" he said. (The administration uses ISIL rather than ISIS to refer to the terrorist group.) ""In our view, it would be a mistake to advertise to ISIL that there are safe havens for them outside Iraq or Syria."" The problem we're facing now, though, is that a resolution meant to target a specific group of terrorists was transformed into something else entirely due to a lack of geographic or time constraints. If Congress heeds Kerry's advice, then the forever war against al-Qaida could simply be replaced by a new one against ISIS. Of course, while Congress debates, the situation is shifting on the ground in Syria. Wittes notes one unexpected twist. There have recently been scattered reports of ISIS patching things up with Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaida-affiliated group it has fought against for the past year and that has also been a target of the U.S. bombing campaign. The talks have reportedly involved the Khorasan Group, a clique of veteran al-Qaida fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan. This alliance would lend some credence to the administration's argument that ISIS is covered under the 2001 authorization. ""The more that ISIS and al-Nusra work together, the more valid the argument becomes,"" Wittes says. It would certainly be ironic if ISIS and al-Qaida got on the same page before the White House and Congress did."	Obama Said He Wanted to End the Forever War. So Why Isn't It Over?
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/torture_shouldn_t_be_a_partisan_issue_pardon_those_responsible_to_restore.html	"In its report on the Central Intelligence Agency's torture program--created in the chaotic months after the Sept. 11 attacks--the Senate Intelligence Committee describes a culture of brutal depravity. Not only did the CIA use waterboarding and ""stress positions"" to coerce detainees and obtain (worthless) information; it beat and humiliated its prisoners, subjecting them to ""rectal feedings and hydration""--a euphemism for rape--and gave free rein to officers with ""histories of violence and records of abusive treatment of others."" Still, this parade of horrors has its defenders. The Republican minority on the Senate Intelligence Committee also released a report, and unlike the majority report--which condemns the CIA for its actions--the GOP appraisal is a defense of the spy agency. ""We have no doubt that the CIA's detention program saved lives and played a vital role in weakening Al Qaeda while the program was in operation,"" concluded the Republican senators. What's more, they argued, ""The rendition, detention, and interrogation program they created, of which enhanced interrogation was only a small part, enabled a stream of collection and intelligence validation that was unprecedented."" For the Republican members of the Senate Intelligence Committee--save Maine Sen. Susan Collins--the majority report was misleading and partisan, driven by ""political motivations"" and not an honest concern with the truth of the program. And indeed, with few exceptions, the reaction to the torture revelations splits down partisan lines. ""Those who served us in aftermath of 9/11 deserve our thanks not one sided partisan Senate report that now places American lives in danger,"" said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on Twitter after the report was released. The partisan split--Democrats in opposition to the program, Republicans in support--isn't new. In 2007, as the presidential election began in earnest, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama campaigned against the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. ""The President is not above the law,"" he said in a 2007 Boston Globe Q&A with reporter Charlie Savage, ""and the Commander-in-Chief power does not entitle him to use techniques that Congress has specifically banned as torture. "" Likewise, in a 2007 primary debate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hunkered down on the issue. ""Some people have said we ought to close Guantanamo. My view is we ought to double Guantanamo,"" he said. And of course, a range of Bush administration officials still defend the program, from former Vice President Dick Cheney--arguably the strongest advocate for the program--to former White House lawyer John Yoo, who built the legal rationale for torture. As long as torture is partisan--something for Democrats to oppose and Republicans to accept, if not promote--there's no guarantee the next president won't adopt it as policy, pushed by supporters who just see torture as another tool in the intelligence-gathering kit. There's no easy way to prevent that. But one start, as the ACLU's Anthony Romero argues for the New York Times and as Jonathan Bernstein argues for Bloomberg View, is to rebuild norms against the use of torture. And the first step in that effort is for President Obama to pardon the people responsible for making torture the policy of the United States. Yes, as a matter of morality, prosecutions would be better; the torture program was illegal and the officials who built it should be held accountable. The problem is that--in addition to civil servants and political appointees--this includes a former president and vice president. Prosecutions would immediately polarize the issue--making this a fight over Bush and Cheney, not torture--entrench the pro-torture position in Republican politics, and almost guarantee a return to the ""dark side"" for a future GOP administration that sees torture as just another partisan football. Besides, if we're trying to keep this from happening again, we don't want punishment as much as we want to restore the consensus against torture. With explicit pardons, you can send the message that torture was illegal (and as Romero notes, signal to those ""considering torture in the future that they could be prosecuted"") without taking legal action against the architects. And, as Bernstein argues, you can give generous pardons and lessen the officials' ""reputations as bad guys."" Liberals are certain to see this as a betrayal. Not only did Obama continue key parts of Bush's national security policy, but he pardoned Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, George Tenet, and everyone else responsible for torture. Unfortunately, however, this might a time when what's right isn't what we need. Pardoning the Bush team and defending their reputations isn't as edifying as a prosecution, but it turns down the political temperature, and gives Republicans a chance to disavow the torture program without disavowing their president. And while some officials might reject the pardon--it's likely Cheney would deny he committed a crime--the gesture would still count. Moreover, if--as Bernstein suggests--we still need a ""truth and reconciliation commission"" to answer lingering questions and fully grasp the thinking behind the torture program, then we must pardon the officials in question--they won't testify if they're afraid of legal punishment. Again, there's no doubt that this is an imperfect solution. But if we want to prevent a second torture program--if we want to restore torture as a taboo--then we have to pardon the people responsible. It's the only way to divorce the issue from its practitioners, take it out of the world of partisan politics, and put it back into the realm of public morality, where we can finally close the door on an ugly part of our history."	How to Restore the Taboo Against Torture
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/senate_torture_report_frightens_no_one_americans_have_long_grown_comfortable.html	"The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report on the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques--a report prepared by Democrats--has immediately been processed by the partisan sorting machine. Democrats support it, and Republicans are almost unanimously against it, criticizing how the report was produced and the fact that it was released at all. In the fracas, Americans' underlying distaste for torture, which has been weakening since its revelation during George W. Bush's administration, is likely to get weaker as it starts to look like just any other debate. During the height of outrage about the CIA's use of torture, a series of Republican senators took on the Bush administration. Led by Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and John Warner, a host of Republican senators supported efforts to force constraints on the Bush administration's interrogation techniques. In 2009, as David Corn notes, then-Senate candidate Rand Paul repeatedly said torture was a stain on the Republican Party. ""This is not what America should stand for. If Republicans can't understand that and Republicans want Dick Cheney to be the representative of our party still defending torture, which is not something America stands for, it is just another way to shrink the Republican Party."" On Tuesday, in the wake of the report's new revelations of CIA abuse and misconduct, the Republican discussion about terror was far more muted. McCain praised the report by the Democratic majority and gave an impassioned moral condemnation of CIA practices. Sen. Susan Collins was his only real Republican ally. Sen. Paul still said it's important not to torture, but questioned the amount of transparency: ""The gruesomeness of the details may well inflame people,"" he said. ""Whether or not you have to go into all the gory details, whether that's good for the country, maybe not."" Graham reaffirmed his dislike of torture but focused the thrust of his remarks on criticizing the timing and political nature of the report's release. Republicans charge that Sen. Dianne Feinstein published the report now because she will lose her chairmanship of the committee in the new, Republican-controlled Congress. She worried Republicans would not publish the report, or that if they did, it would be a significantly watered-down version. Most other Republicans criticized the report's release, not its findings (though a minority report of more than 100 pages challenges the report's conclusion that interrogators brutalized terrorists, gained no useful intelligence that could not be obtained through other methods and repeatedly lied to Congress about what they were doing). Republicans argued the issues had already been debated, the policy had been stopped, and releasing the inflammatory details so many years later would only weaken America, confuse its allies, and endanger troops and facilities overseas. ""Those who served us in aftermath of 9/11 deserve our thanks not one sided partisan Senate report that now places American lives in danger,"" tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio. Incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was ""one last thumb in the eye to the Bush administration."" If Democrats pointed to McCain, Republicans pointed to former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey, who said Democrats on the committee had ""slipped into the same partisan mode that marks most of what happens on Capitol Hill these days."" The majority of Republicans didn't mention torture, an issue that was once so toxic even Bush administration supporters had to at least address it, or the allegations the CIA lied to Congress. For Republicans concerned with managing the unpopular portions of the Bush legacy, this is the best political response: avoid debates about the underlying policies but criticize Obama for his policies enacted in the aftermath. Republicans aren't the only ones who have benefited from the reduced toxicity of the torture issue. In 2008, John Brennan withdrew his name from consideration as CIA chief because of his association with the Bush-era interrogation techniques at issue in the report. He is now director of the CIA, and a senior White House official repeated on Tuesday that the president has ""complete confidence in Director Brennan."" Despite the revelations, White House officials said no one associated with the program would be punished, ""The policies were authorized as legal, and people acted with that understanding,"" said an administration official. The Justice Department has declined to prosecute. That decision will not stir the public, which has never been that outraged about torture. At the height of the torture revelations, a majority thought the practice was justifiable in some cases. In 2005, an Associated Press poll showed that 36 percent of the public said torture was never justified. Now, only 27 percent say it is never justified. Given the public's sudden support for military action against ISIS, it's hard to imagine there would be a great public outcry if harsh techniques were used against one of its executioners. In 2009, President Obama blocked the release of photographs showing detainees being tortured, on the theory that they would lead to a backlash against U.S. troops. A senior White House official said in that case the photographs were very similar to what had already been released, there were more U.S. troops in active combat conditions, and the interests of transparency are greater in this case. ""The transparency of this report is qualitatively different,"" said the official. ""It's not an exact science, the president tries to be as transparent as possible, and manage the risks that are associated with transparency as much as possible."" The one risk the president didn't need to calculate was the political one. Because there really isn't one."	Who's Afraid of the Torture Report?
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/jonathan_gruber_sacrificed_by_democrats_why_they_can_t_cut_ties_with_the.html	"Jonathan Gruber did not have a pleasant Tuesday morning. From 9:30 a.m. until nearly 2 p.m., the Affordable Care Act architect who infamously said the president's signature legislation passed because of ""the stupidity of the American voter or whatever"" faced questioning from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. And some of the most blistering criticism came from Democrats. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, tore into Gruber in his opening statement. ""As far as I can tell, we are here today to beat up on Jonathan Gruber for stupid--I mean absolutely stupid--comments he made over the last few years,"" he opened. Then he proceeded to do just that, calling Gruber's comments ""incredibly disrespectful"" and ""insulting."" Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Democrat from Massachusetts who voted against the ACA, seemed to relish the opportunity to tear into Gruber. Other committee Democrats' attitudes toward him ranged from highly irked to patronizing. It had to be that way, for two main reasons. First, as Cummings noted more than once, Gruber has been a PR bonanza for Republicans, snidely affirming many of their worst suspicions about the passage of Obamacare. So for Democrats, there's no value in trying to resuscitate Gruber's reputation, and there's no point in being nice to him. The damage he did is largely undoable, so they might as well throw him to the wolves. But second, and more importantly, Democrats have to distance themselves from the substance of Gruber's comments as well. Though he's gotten the most press for his line about ""the stupidity of American voters,"" he also made numerous comments that counter the White House's line on the how the ACA came together. For instance, when Gruber said, ""This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure [the Congressional Budget Office] did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. OK? So it's written to do that. [If] you made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed."" Yikes. There was also this: ""I wish [economist] Mark [Pauly] was right that we could make it all transparent, but I'd rather have this law than not."" And many other glib, brutally honest comments that you can watch in this two-minute video from the conservative group American Commitment. In the years since the bill passed, Gruber has torn through it, Tasmanian Devil-style, obliviously undermining plank after plank. So Democrats, naturally, were eager to cast him out into the dark, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. It's probably not soon enough, though; Gruber is on the record, King v. Burwell is headed to the Supreme Court, and the damage is done. ""I think what Democrats on the committee did was extremely cowardly,"" says Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, ""because everything Jonathan Gruber said about how this law was put together was true, and he knows it was true, and they know it was true. Jonathan Gruber was pilloried today for being the most honest architect of this law."" But, Cannon adds, the hearing could have been worse for Gruber--if Republicans were better-informed about the law's intricacies. Cannon has written extensively about the upcoming Supreme Court argument that may determine Obamacare's future. In that case, the plaintiffs argue that an IRS rule letting the federal government provide insurance subsidies to people living in states that don't set up their own insurance marketplaces is illegal. Cannon and Case Western Reserve University law professor Jonathan Adler crafted that argument, as Vox details here. One point Cannon and other ACA opponents make is that the legislation deliberately masks its real costs. At the hearing, Gruber was joined by two other witnesses: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner and independent contractor Ari Goldmann, who has pre-existing conditions and received health insurance he likes through the ACA. During the hearing, Goldmann said he doesn't receive a subsidy to help pay for his coverage. That's where Cannon says Republicans on the committee dropped the ball. Cannon argues that because of community rating in the law, health insurance is less expensive for people with pre-existing conditions and more expensive for people without them. That's a de facto subsidy, says Cannon. And Gruber has made arguments along that line, too, as Cannon laid out in a piece in Forbes. ""It is very unfortunate that the Republicans on the committee are as economically illiterate as Jonathan Gruber seems to think they are,"" he says. ""They should have pounced on that."" After the hearing concluded, Cummings told me he didn't think Gruber said anything that would be helpful to the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell. On that point, Cannon concurs. But it's cold comfort for Democrats, who can't ditch Gruber fast enough."	Why Democrats Are Feeding Jonathan Gruber to the Wolves
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/the_new_republic_s_demise_the_magazine_s_heterodox_liberalism_is_what_made.html	"The bloodletting this week at the New Republic--the journal of opinion regarded for a century as the flagship of American liberalism--has been rightly taken to herald the end of a great magazine. With the news that its two top editors, Frank Foer and Leon Wieseltier, resigned, that much of the staff subsequently quit, and that the magazine will halve its yearly output and move its headquarters from Washington to New York, the political and intellectual worlds are thrumming with outrage toward the short-sightedness of the magazine's new leadership and elegies for an august institution. As a former staffer and (until Friday) contributing editor, I share the sadness. But one reason for the New Republic's demise has not been fully appreciated, and that has to do with its unique tradition of heterodox liberalism. The New Republic is being seen as a casualty of the crisis of print journalism that has felled many other newspapers and magazines during the past decade--the drying up of advertising revenue amid free and cheap online commentary. The problem with this line of argument is that ""little magazines"" have always lost money, relying instead on the largesse of rich owners, whose combination of public-spiritedness and vanity has led them to sponsor high-quality journalism. The New Republic was hurt by something more specific: the polarization of a media environment that leaves little room for a strain of liberal thought that not only attacks the right and the far left but also prods and questions liberalism itself. Founded in 1914 by some of the leading minds of the Progressive Era--Herbert Croly, Walter Lippmann, and Walter Weyl--the New Republic from the beginning sought to challenge conventional thinking, including among its own readership. These editors recognized that while liberalism (like all political creeds) needs foundational principles, one of those principles specific to liberalism is openness to debate, experiment, and reconsideration. Dogmatism, even more than conservatism, was its bete noire. Over the years the magazine sometimes wavered in that mission. During the editorial tenure of former Vice President Henry Wallace in the 1940s, it descended into high-minded cliche, and for spells in the postwar years, it lapsed into sleepy predictability. But with its purchase by Harvard professor Martin Peretz in the mid-1970s, the New Republic regained its stature as the most provocative magazine on the left. Peretz hired a bevy of brilliant young minds. Three in particular became the three finest editors of their generation: Michael Kinsley, Hendrik Hertzberg, and Wieseltier. The twentysomethings who cut their teeth at the magazine in these decades include some of the most accomplished nonfiction writers working today. As important, the magazine played a key role in revitalizing American liberalism. When Peretz bought the New Republic, the left was on the ropes. The 1960s had been great years of progressive achievement, but in the 1970s, voters were growing disaffected from the Democratic Party, which failed to develop new ideas to meet the challenges of a changing economy and a turbulent world. Liberal thinking ossified. When I was growing up, the adjective that most often preceded ""liberal"" was ""knee-jerk."" Under Peretz and his editors, the magazine led the way in questioning left-wing shibboleths on issues such as crime and fiscal policy and especially foreign policy, where it championed a revival of the liberal internationalism that had guided the Democratic Party from Woodrow Wilson through John F. Kennedy, until the disaster of Vietnam. The election in 1992 of Bill Clinton, whose candidacy the magazine supported early on, marked a triumph of this reconstructed liberalism. Some old-time subscribers and confirmed partisans disliked the magazine for its willingness to publish conservative voices--Fred Barnes was its ace White House correspondent for years while staff writer Charles Krauthammer migrated during his time at the magazine from Walter Mondale speechwriter to neoconservative paragon. Critics assailed its perceived hawkishness and its unapologetic Zionism, which had long been anathema to the hard left and was now becoming distasteful to certain high-minded progressives as well. But to other readers, the sense of freewheeling debate--as opposed to bien-pensant wisdom or party-line doctrine--gave the magazine its exciting appeal. As a college student in the late 1980s, I found its pages more stimulating than those of rival publications, which tended to toe what was already being called the ""politically correct"" line. I never agreed with all of the magazine's positions--its support of the Nicaraguan contras, its opposition to affirmative action--but its pieces made me think in ways that few newspaper columnists or television pundits did. Beyond affording the pleasures of contrarianism, this breed of journalism honored the journalistic imperative to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. Who, after all, was more comfortable than one's own loyal readers? The New Republic's heterodox liberalism--the willingness (indeed the eagerness!) to test liberal thinking from within the liberal family--is now being squeezed. Internet journalism has made it easy to find opinions that confirm one's own beliefs and flatter one's prejudices. Facebook places soothing assurances before our eyeballs. The left and the right are retreating into cocoons of information and opinion, on cable TV and social media. Accordingly, the New Republic's fortunes flagged amid the polarization of the Bush years, when its full-throated support for the Iraq war was too much for even many liberal internationalists to bear and when, post-Clinton, liberalism now seemed to need a course correction toward the left, not the center. Though Foer dynamically reinvigorated the magazine, it never regained the wider circulation it once enjoyed. Wiser ownership could have recognized that although little magazines must adapt to the digital age with strategies for reaching social media users and mobile phone readers, they will never be cash cows. They succeed through influence, not volume. When I worked there in the early 1990s, it was often said that while the magazine had only 100,000 subscribers, it was ""the right 100,000""--the political movers who turned to the piercing policy critiques, the intellectuals who engaged with Wieseltier's unsurpassed ""back of the book."" The impending transformation of the New Republic from a liberal magazine into a ""vertically integrated digital media company"" is regrettable for many reasons, not all of them sentimental. Conservatives need a liberal magazine that's unpredictable enough to make them want to read it. Liberals and leftists need a magazine that will prod them to question their beliefs, and revise or strengthen them. All of us need robust intellectual debate of a high caliber that treats politics and ideas with the seriousness that they deserve."	What We Lost With the Loss of the New Republic
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/republicans_divided_on_immigration_ted_cruz_accuses_republicans_of_breaking.html	"Republicans had a rare, fleeting moment of consensus on immigration when the president announced last month that he would take executive action to defer deportation and give work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Republicans of all stripes--from the big-business-friendly speaker of the House to the Gadsden flag-toting Tea Party darlings in the rank-and-file--all agreed that his move was an unconstitutional overreach and an assault on our constitutional system of checks and balances. In that moment, Republicans called an intra-caucus cease-fire. That cease-fire is toast. Ten Republicans broke ranks on Thursday to vote against or simply vote ""present"" on a largely symbolic bill introduced by Rep. Ted Yoho intended to block the president's executive action on immigration. One Republican member, Arizona's Rep. Matt Salmon, mocked the bill a few hours before the vote, telling a group of reporters that the House could save time and money by just sending the president a Hallmark card. The central question is this: Should Republicans try to use the appropriation process to defund the president's immigration move? Supporters of that strategy--including Sens. Jeff Sessions and Ted Cruz, as well as Salmon and others--argue it's the only way to keep the president's action from going forward. Opponents of that strategy tremble at the prospect of replaying last year's government shutdown. But the strategy's supporters have been vocal and unequivocal about their positions. And now they're going on the offense. Sessions released a statement suggesting that a plan some Republicans had been coalescing around--to pass Rep. Yoho's ""hallmark card"" bill and then fund the government without any exception for the president's immigration move--would break the party's campaign promises. In fact, a few days before the midterm elections, Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus told reporters on a conference call that the GOP would spare no effort to block the president's move. ""We will do everything we can to make sure it doesn't happen: Defunding, going to court, injunction,"" he said, per Breitbart. ""You name it. It's wrong. It's illegal."" So Republicans are in a tough spot: The chairman of their party promised that defunding would be on the table if necessary, but now the House Leadership seems thoroughly uninterested in that route. It's one thing to rally the base in late October, but it's quite another to follow up on a commitment that could precipitate a second government shutdown. So would Republicans be breaking their campaign promises if they voted to fund the government without any provision blocking funds for the president's immigration action? It depends on who you ask. At a press conference yesterday, Iowa's Rep. Steve King said that members of Congress who vote to fund the president's move would be voting to violate the Constitution and, thus, would violate their oaths of office. Cruz warned that members should do ""what you promised."" ""And doing what you promised doesn't mean, as it so often does in Washington, sending a really stern letter and having a meaningless show vote,"" he added. Later I asked Salmon if he thought members who voted for a funding bill that included funding for the president's move would be breaking their campaign promises. He echoed Cruz's message that it would be a violation of their oath of office. ""I think that it's an abdication of your duty to vote for funding for something that you believe is unconstitutional,"" he said. ""Absolutely. Even for a day."" There obviously isn't a consensus in Republican ranks on that. Michigan's Rep. Candice Miller, who chairs the House Administration Committee, was blunt. ""For anybody to say that if you just don't vote the way he thinks, that you're breaking your campaign promise, I think is wrong,"" she said. And Rep. Bill Cassidy who is all but a lock to win the Louisiana Senate race on Dec. 6, was in the same camp as Miller. ""I'm not sure I accept Sen. Sessions' assessment,"" he said. Eisenhower was successful in the Battle of the Bulge, Cassidy continued, because he waited to counterattack. ""So there's a certain strategy that must come in to play,"" he concluded. ""And so I think that this is a little bit of a chess match, and you have to do your actions with an eye towards completing them in success."" Off the hill, conservatives are a touch less delicate. Radio host Laura Ingraham, one of the most influential voices opposing comprehensive immigration reform, said on her radio show Thursday that she has started looking for someone to primary Kentucky's Rep. Hal Rogers. Rogers chairs the House Appropriations Committee and drew enormous ire for saying that defunding the president's move wouldn't be possible. And Erick Erickson, who runs RedState.com, encouraged readers to mail blue balls to Boehner's district office in Ohio. At about noon on Thursday, he celebrated more than 100 orders to Boehner's office. So yes, this could get ugly."	Why Republicans Are Already Fighting Among Themselves Over Immigration 
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/eric_garner_daniel_pantaleo_and_cop_training_police_departments_must_explain.html	"Eric Garner never had a chance. Or, to be more accurate, the cops never gave him one. Rather than talk to Garner, whom they approached on a Staten Island corner, police used force. Officer Daniel Pantaleo used a chokehold to bring him to the ground, and officers joined the struggle in an attempt to subdue Garner, whose only ""crime"" was asking police to leave him alone. He went into cardiac arrest, and died. That sudden escalation in the use of force isn't unusual. In April, Dontre Hamilton was killed--shot 14 times--after an altercation with Officer Christopher Manney, who confronted him in a Milwaukee park after complaints that Hamilton was sleeping on the ground. An attempted pat-down led to a scuffle, in which Manney says Hamilton took his baton and started hitting him. Soon after, Manney shot and killed the mentally ill man. (It's worth noting that, in his memo detailing the event, Manney described Hamilton as ""muscular"" and ""impossible to control if you were one-man."" According to the autopsy report, Hamilton was 5-foot-7 and an overweight 169 pounds.) In August, just days before Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, 22-year-old John Crawford was killed by police in an Ohio Walmart. Crawford--who was holding an air gun while talking to his family on the phone--didn't have a chance, either. In less than a minute, police rounded a corner, shouted a command, and shot him, hitting Crawford and sending him to the emergency room, where he died of his wounds. Later that same month, in St. Louis, Kajieme Powell was shot by police while allegedly wielding a butter knife outside a convenience store. By all accounts, including a video, he wasn't an actual threat. Despite this, police entered close--erasing any space between them and Powell--and drew their guns, firing several shots and killing the 25-year-old, who also suffered from mental illness. A few weeks later, in South Carolina, Levar Jones was shot and wounded by state trooper Sean Groubert at a gas station near Columbia. According to the dash-camera video, Groubert asked Jones to show his ID. When Jones tried to comply--he was standing outside his car, reaching for his wallet--Groubert drew his weapon, yelled for Jones to ""Get out of the car,"" and opened fire. He shot several times at Jones, striking him in the hip and prompting a bewildered response. ""What did I do, sir?"" he asked. ""Why did you shoot me?"" Most recently, Cleveland police killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice after receiving a call that a ""juvenile"" was in a public area with a gun that was ""probably"" fake. In the video released by authorities, Rice is holding an air gun and standing in an empty park. A police car rolls into view--stopping just a few feet from Rice--and an officer jumps out, shooting. Seconds later, Rice is on the ground, dying. The common thread in all of these isn't police violence as much as it's the sudden use of force. The victims never have a chance to react. Instead, police enter, weapons drawn, ready to kill. And when they do kill, they almost never face criminal charges. On Wednesday a grand jury declined to indict Officer Pantaleo with any charges in the death of Garner, despite video of his escalation, his use of an illegal chokehold, and his history of racial bias. Likewise, grand juries declined to press charges against the officers who killed Crawford, and the St. Louis police department is dragging its feet in the investigation of the officers who killed Powell. Prosecutors have yet to make a decision in the case of Officer Manney, and while the Rice shooting is still under investigation, the odds are that those officers will escape charges as well, despite the fact that the officer who used his weapon--Timothy Loehmann--had been described as ""unfit for duty."" It's only in South Carolina that the officer is facing trial for his actions. In our current conversations on police violence, many observers have focused on the moral value of the victims--do ""black lives matter""? This makes sense. Because black Americans bear the brunt of police violence, they are also the ones most burdened by a legal system that refuses to hold officers accountable. What's more, as Adam Serwer notes for BuzzFeed, this is compounded by potent and prevalent stereotypes about black Americans and crime. ""Police are people, after all, subject to the same flaws and vices as the rest of us. America's police departments tend to be whiter than the general population, and nearly half of whites believe 'many' or 'almost all' black men are violent,"" writes Serwer. But while we should ask the legal system if ""black lives matter,"" we should also ask police departments to explain themselves and their training. Take away the implicit racial bias, the unfair treatment, and pervasive overpolicing, and you're still left with a world where police are empowered by law to use force and are ready to use it without serious provocation. And worse, this is bolstered by a police culture that expects absolute obedience from ordinary citizens, regardless of the circumstances or situation. ""[H]ere is the bottom line,"" wrote veteran officer Sunil Dutta in an August op-ed for the Washington Post, ""if you don't want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton, or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you."" If any reaction--even the nervousness and fear that come with a police stop--is legitimate grounds for violence, then violence is practically guaranteed. And given the heavy policing in black and Latino communities, this means minorities are at the greatest risk for victimization. To that point, Attorney General Eric Holder announced on Thursday that the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department had found a ""pattern or practice"" of brutality and incompetence in the Cleveland police department. According to the report, officers were careless with weapons--""placing themselves, subjects, and bystanders at unwarranted risk of serious injury or death""--and aggressive with the public. In one case, notes the Huffington Post, ""a 300-pound officer punched a 13-year-old boy who was handcuffed inside a police car and kicking the door. The officer, whom the report describes as 8 inches taller than the boy, punched him 'three to four times' until he was 'stunned/dazed' and had a bloody nose."" Changing the culture of policing to de-emphasize violence and leave room for ordinary human behavior won't be easy, but it's possible. And it doesn't have to lead to more crime. In Philadelphia this year, police have shot and killed just three people, compared with 12 by this point in 2013 and 16 by this point in 2012. What changed? The culture, and specifically, the department's approach to the use of force. After a local news story found a spike in officer-involved shootings despite a drop in crime, the police commissioner invited federal officials to examine the department's practices as part of a ""collaborative review."" The full report isn't public, but the recommendations included new directives involving the use of force--in which officers state that they ""hold the highest regard for the sanctity of human life"" and the ""application of deadly force is a measure to be employed only in the most extreme circumstances""--and intensive training designed to de-escalate confrontations before they turn deadly. ""As the new policies have been phased in,"" notes Philly.com, ""the total number of shootings to date--fatal and nonfatal--has plummeted from 48 in 2012 to 35 in 2013 and to 18 so far this year, according to the department."" If police departments are as committed to protecting communities as they claim, then they should welcome these steps. Bad cops--violent cops--hurt the profession as a whole. They create mistrust, and it make it hard for good officers to do their jobs. And on the other end, a legal system that won't prosecute bad officers or hold them accountable for errors--or even record and document police shootings--is one that generates anger and hostility. After the grand jury announced its decision in the case of Officer Pantaleo, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked residents to ""respect the legal process and rule of law."" But respect goes both ways, and a system that tolerates and supports bad police is one that breeds contempt from the people it's supposed to protect. We see it in the mass protests sparked by the Garner case, as people show their anger and disdain for law enforcement. For police, this is dangerous. At best, it leaves you with communities where residents refuse to cooperate with police, where they would rather tolerate crime than work with an institution that hates them and treats them as subhuman. At worst, it explodes into fire, as people reach their limits and rebel against the all-but-official decree that their lives don't matter."	Why Police Officers Are Killing the People They Are Sworn to Protect
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/jeb_bush_s_chances_in_2016_can_the_former_florida_governor_win_over_the.html	"Groucho Marx said that he wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have him as a member. Jeb Bush's future may hang on a political corollary. He would like to be the leader of a club that he doesn't want to join. That's the implicit message of Bush's recent statement to the Wall Street Journal about his presidential deliberations. ""I kinda know how a Republican can win,"" he told the paper's Washington bureau chief, Gerald Seib, ""much more uplifting, much more positive, much more willing to be practical and ... to lose the primary to win the general."" Bush then mused about what a Romney presidency would have looked like and how Bush might run the place. ""Here's a problem, let's go fix it,"" he said. ""Put aside, you know, the ideological differences, let's forge consensus around, this is a problem, how do we go from point A to point B to fix it."" (No wonder 73 percent of the audience of CEOs picked Bush as their preferred nominee.) What the former Florida governor means about the relationship between the Republican primary and the general election is that his party's clubhouse contest for picking a nominee is broken. It forces candidates to do things to get elected by Republicans that make them unappealing to the general election audience. When Seib asked what it would look like to run as a candidate who didn't bend to the requirements of his party's process, Bush replied, ""Frankly no one really knows that, because it hasn't been tried recently."" If he runs, Bush will either be a revolutionary figure who overcomes his party's nominating patterns or he will be this cycle's Jon Huntsman.* The former Utah governor also shared Bush's critical view of the GOP nominating process. In 2012, Republican primary voters did not like that message and the way he delivered it, and Huntsman flamed out after a third place finish in New Hampshire, where he had stacked all of his chips. After the campaign, Huntsman said the primary ""wasn't a period where rational thinking or any kind of commitment to reality or truth or optimism necessarily prevailed."" Presidential hopefuls can run against Washington Republicans. They all are, including Bush, which is smart, given the GOP Congress's low approval ratings. But when Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal calls the Republican Party the ""stupid party,"" he's not referring to its members; he's referring to its Washington representatives who have strayed from the wisdom contained in the grassroots conservative voter. That's not the same message Bush is sending. We know this because in the short period since the Wall Street Journal interview, Bush has already won the endorsement of a non-conservative editorial board. This is not the first time that Bush has criticized the ideologues who have overtaken his party's nominating process. In 2012, he said that his father and Ronald Reagan would have a hard time getting the party's nod today.* His formula for winning, says the 61-year-old Bush, is to stay optimistic and cheerful, and to not get bogged down in the intramural fights that overtake primaries and limit Republicans once they get in office from actually getting things done. There would be a lot of competitors trying to drag Bush into those fights on issues from taxes to immigration to education where he has taken positions that are at odds with vocal conservative activists. Those issues are where the test between the primary and general election would take place. On immigration, for example, the public at large is more receptive to a path to citizenship for undocumented workers than those who participate in Republican primaries. Sixty-two percent of Americans favor a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the United States illegally, according to a nationwide poll published Tuesday by the Public Religion Research Institute. Among Americans who identify with the Tea Party (who tend to reflect the audience in early primary states that votes more conservatively than the party as a whole), only 37 percent favor offering citizenship. The big question with the Bush approach is whether he'll ever get to the battle of ideas. By criticizing the Republican primary process, he strays into offending voters who participate in that process. That can wound in a far deeper way than any policy difference could. The message that gets conveyed--particularly to the die-hards already skeptical of him--is that Bush thinks he is smarter than they are, and if they'd just accept that obvious truth and get out of the way, he'd go ahead and win the election. Bush's defenders say that the criticism is aimed at the candidates who pander to the voters and run campaigns based on attacking their opponents for not being sufficiently pure. This doesn't diminish the sting though, because when you criticize candidates for pandering, you're implicitly criticizing the voters who buy the shoddy goods you say the hucksters are selling. If he ran, Bush would know he needs to avoid the Huntsman trap. But in the heat of the primary it might get hard not to dismiss the criticism from others as the product of the stupid primary system that focuses on trivialities and rewards the candidates who embrace maximalist positions that are untenable in the real world. Bush will also have to field small explosions from the Republican donors who would like to see a Bush candidacy. In conversations with some of those promoting and hoping for a Bush candidacy the words ""yahoo"" and ""crazies"" have been applied to the Tea Party wing of the party. That sentiment is likely to break out into the open at some point in the primary period and cause headaches for Bush. During the interview, Bush said that one of his considerations is the toll a campaign would take on his family, because politics is ""a pretty ugly business right now."" His campaign would seek to elevate politics, and those who support him see his crusade to rescue his party from its ideologues as the only way to rescue the GOP's presidential chances. It will be remarkable if it's successful, because it's likely going to be a pretty ugly business getting from point A to point B.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/a_likely_republican_presidential_hopeful_should_address_ferguson_the_gop.html	"Will a potential Republican presidential candidate give a speech about the crisis in Ferguson, Missouri? It would be a political opportunity, a chance to prove that he is precisely the type of leader the likely 2016 candidates will claim to be. In the GOP jockeying for position, every public flashpoint provides a chance for a candidate to distinguish himself in a crowded field. The men thinking about a run are usually not shy about speaking up. In the crassest political terms, a dedicated speech would allow a candidate to use the public attention surrounding the grand jury verdict and its aftermath to gather some attention for himself. Afterward, he could make fundraising calls and quote from the favorable press coverage. If the speech is good enough, perhaps a friendly columnist would say that he looked ""presidential in addressing the complex issues of the day."" Meanwhile, loyal aides could call reporters and say the speech demonstrated that the candidate had shown he was the unique figure to expand the Republican Party's appeal, something beyond being a party that ex-Republicans described as ""narrow minded,"" ""out of touch,"" and full of ""stuffy old men,"" words used in the post-2012 autopsy commissioned by the Republican National Committee. Perhaps that's not enough political benefit to entice a GOP candidate into giving a risky speech on a topic GOP primary voters don't have at the top of their list. As voters, we should hope several of them give such speeches, though, because they would give us insight into whether the candidates have a few of the attributes that might be useful if they were ever elevated to the top job. The first thing we'd learn is if a candidate can speak across the divide. Almost all GOP candidates are claiming that they could solve Washington's political mess by bringing people together. A central attribute required for that--whether its uniting the religious and secular, poor and wealthy, or conservatives and liberals--is being able to speak to two different constituencies, demonstrating that you understand the frustrations of each side and using that understanding to build a tentative path to progress. Here's a chance to show some of those skills. The bar is low and achievable. No one expects a candidate to have the solutions, he simply needs to show he is sensitive to the challenge. For some candidates--particularly the governors--such remarks would be a special opportunity to show what they've learned in office about race relations. Govs. Scott Walker, John Kasich, and Chris Christie, and former Gov. Jeb Bush, have governed states with large black populations in some cities. Surely they can draw on that experience. Walker was Milwaukee County executive in a county with a 26 percent black population. Christie was a federal prosecutor, which gives him special insight. Perhaps most important, we'd get a window into a candidate's worldview as he framed the issues. ""Ferguson is a manifestation of the racial division as we see it right now,"" Ben Carson, who is thinking about running in 2016, said on Meet the Press. ""There are a lot of people around this nation who feel things are unfair for them, who feel disenfranchised. And it makes them ripe for a tinderbox situation like this to occur."" True, but what is that division about? Is it, as President Obama says, about a ""simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color""? Or is the larger issue about poverty and the legacy of racism, early-childhood education, drug laws, and family structure? These are issues that affect people of color but also white Americans. Every presidential candidate of both parties should have a take on how to frame and address these questions. The least substantive thing we'd learn is whether a candidate has rhetorical power. But speechmaking does matter in campaigns, and a bad speech can muddle the benefit of political gambits. Sen. Rand Paul's speech at Howard University in April of last year was somewhat risky, but it was a bland speech, which gave us insight into the way interesting ideas can die at the edge of the podium. A possible model is Barack Obama's keynote address at the ""Call to Renewal"" in June 2006, in which he tried to bridge the gap between the religious and secular in politics. All of the tough problems of poverty and the environmental stewardship that both parties wanted to address would remain unsolved, said the first-term senator, ""unless we tackle head-on the mutual suspicion that sometimes exists between religious America and secular America."" The speech was a political gambit. Obama wanted to show that he was a different kind of Democrat, one who believed in Jesus and had been transformed by his message--something that would also make him a more appealing candidate to a broader group of voters. Obama was trying to show that he could be a bridge--a leading voice in a secular party speaking for the values of the other party by chastising himself for too easily dismissing their faith-inspired views on issues like abortion. When he was a Senate candidate, Obama's campaign had characterized anti-abortion-rights politicians as ""right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose,"" and a doctor had written him to say that he had been offended by the implicit denigration of his faith. ""I felt a pang of shame,"" recalled Obama. ""It is people like him who are looking for a deeper, fuller conversation about religion in this country."" Future Republican presidential candidates aren't likely to borrow from the man in office they think has been so ineffective, but he was a rather successful politician in 2008 in part because of speeches like this, which appealed to voters' desire for greater national unity. As my colleague Jamelle Bouie pointed out on the Slate Political Gabfest, the most effective speech any politician could give in the wake of the Ferguson verdict might be one given by a Southern Republican. If a Republican, whose party benefits from the overwhelming support of white voters, could serve as a witness, at some level, to the feelings of distrust and anger within the black community, it might contribute to the conversation so many people say we should be having. It would not require abandoning values or offending their core constituency. Such a speech could even eclipse whatever President Obama says on a visit to Ferguson, given that he is hemmed in by the responsibilities of his office and the political crust of the past six years. Of course, a potential GOP presidential candidate might choose an entirely different path. Instead of offering an example of bridge building, he might decide that the requirement after Ferguson is to defend the police force against a media that has convicted an officer trying to do his job in a brutal environment and speak up for the 61 percent of Republicans who in August thought race was getting more attention than it deserved, according to a Pew poll. Whichever route a candidate takes, such a speech would certainly distinguish him, and almost every future candidate wants that right now."	Why a Republican Presidential Hopeful Should Speak Out on Ferguson
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/ferguson_protests_on_the_second_night_after_grand_jury_decision_driving.html	"FERGUSON, Missouri--Lala's car is the matron saint of the Michael Brown movement. The white four-door is present at almost every public protest, usually packed with young demonstrators in Guy Fawkes-style masks. A memorial tapestry has been spray-painted onto its dented surface: the names of black men recently killed by police are written on the hood; ""We The People,"" ""Mike We Out Here,"" ""F.T.P,"" and ""No Justice No Peace!!!"" adorn various panels; and in big lettering across the rear windshield, ""FRONT LINE."" Arguably the protesters' most consistently successful tactic has been stopping traffic along the roadways, but Lala's car is allowed to navigate the streets without arousing the slightest objection. At demonstrations, it is often seen making the rounds with a full load of passengers and several additional riders sitting sidesaddle out the window or reclining on the hood. On Tuesday night, 24 hours after the announcement of the grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for the killing of Michael Brown, the vehicle made an appearance at the memorial for Vonderrick Myers in the South St. Louis neighborhood of Shaw, for a protest organized by a group called Lost Voices. It circled the intersection, honking its horn. The protesters numbered only a dozen or two--a seemingly lackluster response to the events of the day before. But the slim attendance in Shaw belied the energy sustaining the movement beyond the grand jury's decision and the destruction of property that followed its announcement. What happened Monday night confirmed the public's desire for an overhaul of the system. The scope and intensity of those demonstrations could determine how soon. So at 9:45 p.m. Tuesday night, when a group of girls bounded down the sidewalk shouting, ""Everybody go to Ferguson!"" Lala's car pulled out and led the way. For a movement that is avowedly leaderless, Lala's car may be what passes for leadership, in as much as it leads by example. Without a leader, the first person to show up for a demonstration is in charge until others join, and the decision-making begins to spread evenly among all present. The only person who can decide to end a demonstration is the one who's last to leave. The one exception to this rule: the police. When I returned to Ferguson Tuesday night, the National Guard was monitoring the flow of foot traffic along South Florissant Road, where most of the demonstrations and destruction had occurred the night before. Residual tear gas wafted up to the church where I parked, and a medic on the sidewalk kindly offered a pair of laboratory goggles. Across from the Ferguson Police Department, the crowd of protesters occupied South Florissant Road, and there was Lala's car at the center of the action. The protesters were met by a first line, comprised of state troopers in riot gear and a supporting line of combat-ready National Guardsmen. There appeared to be an uneasy balance between the two sides, and before long, people began to loft small objects at the police line. It was never clear to me exactly where or whom these things were coming from--only that it always seemed to come from behind me. A water bottle came winging in from the rearguard and a police officer nearly succeeded in catching it. Over the loudspeaker, a policeman announced that since things were being thrown, the protest constituted unlawful assembly, and that everyone assembled was subject to arrest if they did not disperse immediately. That order offered a clearer explanation of the boundary-line between acceptable protest and an insurrection than I'd heard on Monday night. Still, it didn't noticeably deter the rock-throwers. Then there began a rustling at the front--I don't know what precipitated it. The line of troopers charged forward several paces, and the crowd scrambled backward, but not quickly enough. The police breached the protesters' line, mace bottles drawn, and sprayed plumes into the crowd. People clamored in agony for an empty patch of pavement on which to wash out their eyes. A young man called for help as his eyes burned, but he stayed focused through the pain. ""Hold the line! Hold the line! Hold the line!"" he shouted. As medics surrounded him, he yelled, ""No justice!"" and the crowd replied in unison, ""No peace!"" The allied demonstrators fanned out, their front line crumbled, and the officers briefly retreated. The parking lot was slick where the mace had fallen. The voice of law enforcement rang out again, telling protesters to disperse or face arrest. The officers breached the protesters' line again. The arrests that ensued were forceful, sometimes harsh. Officers hoisted their riot shields and collided with several young men on the front line, and teams of police formed around the arrestees to hold them so their hands could be cinched with plastic handcuffs. Meanwhile the other squads re-aligned and followed play-calls issued by the men who were in charge. The marched in a straight line, chanting, ""Move back! Move back! Move back!"" as they advanced toward the protesters. The police continued to execute their choreographed tactics until they subsumed the parking lot in short order. The troopers then drove protesters down South Florissant Road, and as their unified front advanced, a smattering of small rocks fell at their feet. Next I heard the ""click-click-clicking"" of their nightsticks extending. Then the Meineke storefront shattered, and I saw a group of five or so people fiddle with something in the window and run off. The National Guard moved to occupy the premises, hoisting their rifles and advancing with the signature crouched gait of soldiers. The manifold forces of law enforcement pushed the willful stragglers down South Florissant to a stopper they had created out of armored trucks. We had run out of room to retreat, and the voice over the loudspeaker commanded us to go home now. I'd left my car upstream of the procession, but as I backpedaled away from the police line, I bumped into D-Red, someone who often rode shotgun in Lala's car. He let me hop in the back seat with two other young men, Jeremiah and Deveon. They all seemed collected. We drove away from the flashpoint and kept going until Lala steered toward a rendezvous point. Another car had left the scene when we did, driven by a man named Bishop, and Lala was on the phone with that car. She was trying to find a place we could meet up, but road closures left us fumbling around the dead-end side streets of Ferguson. Lala took special care not to exceed the speed limit. She said she'd never gotten a ticket in her life until this August, when she rendered the Michael Brown tribute on her car. Since then she's gotten 11. She grew anxious when a car with brighter-than-average headlights pulled into the lane behind us, but at the next stoplight we confirmed it was just a Volvo. Nearing 1 a.m., we couldn't find Bishop, so we stopped for a snack and turned off the engine while we thought about where we could go to resume the action. Then a car pulled into the lot behind Lala's with its lights flashing. Lala was spooked. But it wasn't the police. It was Bishop with a flashlight. I thought Lala must be paranoid, but then I realized it's called something else when you've been pulled over as many times as she has in the last four months, and your lips sting with mace. Bishop pulled his car beside Lala's, and she tried to enlist him in her quest to continue the night. ""I'm trying to finish protesting, I'm not ready to go home,"" she intoned, but Bishop was ready to turn in. ""Go to bed!"" he chanted. ""Yes I will!"" Lala laughed. ""That's my protest tonight,"" Bishop said, and even though it wasn't what Lala's carload wanted, it made sense considering the hour. So she dropped off D-Red and made plans to see him at the protest scheduled for the morning, and he fetched his mask from the backseat and walked to the door. Then she dropped off Jeremiah, who grabbed his mask and went inside. Deveon lives farther away, but we agreed it was unsafe for him to walk home at this hour. ""We don't want him to get picked up,"" Lala said. ""We might not know what happened to him."" ""I'd probably get shot just for walking with my mask,"" he said. Read more about Ferguson in Slate."

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/darren_wilson_s_racial_portrayal_of_michael_brown_as_a_superhuman_demon.html	"To his friends, Michael Brown was a ""gentle giant""--a ""quiet person with a wicked sense of humor."" That's a far cry from the man described by officer Darren Wilson in his grand jury testimony in the shooting of Brown. To Wilson, who stopped and scuffled with the 18-year-old on the morning of Aug. 9, 2014, Brown was a ""demon,"" a monster with terrible resilience and incredible strength. ""When I grabbed him the only way I can describe it is I felt like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan,"" said the 6-foot-4, 210-pound Wilson of the 6-foot-5, 290-pound Brown. ""Hulk Hogan, that's how big he felt and how small I felt just from grasping his arm."" In Wilson's story Brown was mouthy, aggressive, and eager to fight. Wilson said he asked Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, why they couldn't walk on the sidewalk instead of the street. ""Fuck what you have to say,"" Brown supposedly said. When Wilson tried to open the door to his police car, he says Brown shut the door and began to strike the officer in the face, handing his stolen cigarillos to Johnson to better attack Wilson. In Wilson's account, Brown punched like Balrog, with enough force to kill him outright. ""I felt another one of those punches in my face could knock me out or worse. I mean, it was, he's obviously bigger than I was and stronger and the, I've already taken two to the face and I didn't think I would, the third one could be fatal if he hit me right."" At this point, Wilson says, he drew his gun. ""Get back or I'm going to shoot you."" Brown--Wilson said--grabbed his gun and replied, ""You are too much of a pussy to shoot me."" Wilson fired, shooting through the glass panel, and prompting Brown to back away. Brown, according to Wilson, ""had the most aggressive face. That's the only way I can describe it, it looks like a demon, that's how angry he looked."" Brown approached again and hit Wilson, who fired another bullet. At that point, Brown ran away, with Wilson following on foot. He fired more shots--striking Brown at least once--and stopped. But Brown wasn't down. Instead--like a villain, or perhaps, an evil mutant--he appeared stronger than before. Wilson fired again. ""At this point it looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making him mad that I'm shooting at him,"" Wilson said. ""And that face that he had was looking straight through me, like I wasn't even there, I wasn't even anything in his way."" Wilson describes an almost animalistic Brown, who--like Wolverine--had gone into a kind of berserker rage. He made ""a grunting, like aggravated sound,"" Wilson said. ""I've never seen anybody look that, for lack of a better word, crazy,"" he explained. ""I've never seen that. I mean, it was very aggravated ... aggressive, hostile ... You could tell he was looking through you. There was nothing he was seeing."" Eventually, after 12 total shots, Wilson hit Brown in the head, killing him and ending the confrontation. This account, given one month after the shooting, fits the facts of the case. It's consistent with forensic evidence and eyewitness testimony, and it was credible enough for a grand jury to defer to police discretion and decline charges. But the fact that it's possible doesn't make it believable, and looking at the story, I think it's ludicrous. Take Wilson's account of Brown's actions and language. He describes a vicious, combative Brown, quick with a quip and eager to fight with police. Based on what we know from his family and friends, this sounds out of character. But more than that, it's weird behavior. Brown and Johnson were just at a convenience store, where they stole a box of Swisher Sweets. Most people who steal want to get away from the police, not charge in their direction. And while it's possible Brown was itching to fight a cop, it just doesn't ring true to who Brown was and how he understood himself. More troubling is Wilson's physical description of Brown, which sits flush with a century of stereotypes and a bundle of recent research on implicit bias and racial perceptions of pain. In so many words, Wilson describes the ""black brute,"" a stock figure of white supremacist rhetoric in the lynching era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The southern press was rife with articles attacking the ""Negro Beast"" and the ""Big Black Brute,"" notes Philip Dray in At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America. To the white public, the ""black brute"" was a menacing, powerful creature who could withstand the worst punishment. Likewise, in northern papers, it was easy to find stories of ""giant negroes"" who ""spread terror"" and rampaged through urban centers. That image never went away; it lingers in crack-era stories of superpowered addicts and teenaged superpredators, as well as rhetoric around other victims of police brutality. ""Jurors in the Rodney King beating trial were warned early on that the black motorist was not on trial,"" notes a March 29, 1993 wire story on jury deliberations, ""Yet they have heard King compared to a 'monster,' a 'Tasmanian devil' and a man with 'hulk-like strength.' "" The idea that Brown could resist bullets is also familiar. In a recent paper, researchers found that whites are more likely to attribute superhuman abilities--like enhanced strength and endurance--to blacks than any other group. That, the authors assert, might explain some of the white tolerance for police brutality. ""Perhaps people assume that Blacks possess extra (i.e., superhuman) strength which enables them to endure violence more easily than other humans."" Add to this what we know about implicit bias--that most people perceive blacks as more violent and dangerous than other groups--and you have a Darren Wilson narrative that reads like a textbook case of racial projection. Indeed, it's worth noting the extent to which Wilson's story echoes George Zimmerman's account of his confrontation with Trayvon Martin. Like Brown, Martin is aggressive; he approaches Zimmerman's SUV, circles it, and threatens him. When he tried to escape, Zimmerman said, Martin punched him in the face, knocked him down, and began beating him on the sidewalk. Like Brown, Martin threatens Zimmerman--""You're gonna die now""--and like Wilson, Zimmerman shoots him, fearing for his life. It's the fear that's most striking. Wilson was trained, armed, and empowered with the force of law. At almost any point in his confrontation with Brown, he could have called for backup and won control of the situation. But, he says, he was too gripped with terror to do anything but shoot. The same was true for Zimmerman, and the same was true for Michael Dunn, the man who killed Jordan Davis in a Jacksonville, Florida parking lot. Maybe Wilson is telling the truth. Maybe--like Zimmerman and Dunn and all the others--he faced a powerful black ""demon"" who wouldn't stop and had to be killed. But this would be an incredible coincidence, or more likely, evidence of some terrible, criminal pathology among young black men. Which is to say, I doubt it's true. Instead, consider this: Maybe Wilson was an ordinary police officer with all the baggage it carries. Maybe, like many of his peers on the Ferguson police force, he was hard on black teenagers. Maybe, like many Americans, he was a little afraid of them. And maybe all of this--his fear, his bias, and his training--met Michael Brown and combined to create tragedy. If so, the lesson of Wilson is that he isn't unique. That his fear is common. And that the same forces that drove Wilson and Brown to confrontation can--and will--drive another Wilson and another Brown to another confrontation with the same deadly results.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/rudy_giuliani_doesn_t_understand_crime_the_former_new_york_city_mayor_is.html	"On Sunday, during a Meet the Press panel on the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, Rudy Giuliani reminded the world that he is an unserious person. Responding to a question from host Chuck Todd on diversity and policing (""How do you make a police force look like the communities they serve?""), the former New York City mayor--whose police department was embroiled in racial controversies throughout his tenure--raised the specter of black crime. ""I find it very disappointing that you're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,"" said Giuliani, challenging the whole discussion of police violence. ""I would like the attention paid to that, paid to this."" His co-panelist, Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson, shot back. ""[F]irst of all, black people who commit crimes against other black people go to jail. No. 2, they are not sworn by the police department as an agent of the state to uphold the law,"" he said, calling Giuliani's claim a ""false equivalency."" He's right; most black people who commit crimes are arrested and convicted. Most cops who kill innocent people aren't charged, much less criminally liable, as the world was reminded on Monday night as it watched a grand jury fail to decide that officer Darren Wilson should stand trial for killing Michael Brown. But Giuliani stuck to his guns, and later in the segment, he argued that white police are only in black neighborhoods because of crime. ""It is the reason for the heavy police presence in the black community,"" he said. ""White police officers won't be there if you weren't killing each other 70 percent of the time."" And on Monday morning, he went to Fox News to defend his take and tout his record as mayor. ""The danger to a black child in America is not a white police officer. That's going to happen less than 1 percent of the time,"" he said. ""The danger to a black child--if it was my child--the danger is another black."" He later added, ""The reason we reduced homicide by 65 percent is because we reduced it in the black community, because there is virtually no homicide in the white community."" What makes this--and Giuliani--unserious? First are the facts of the matter. To start, homicide exists among whites--the third leading cause of death for white men (and fourth for white women) age 19 to 24 is homicide. As for ""black-on-black crime,"" while 90 percent of black Americans are killed by other black Americans, it's also true that this high intragroup crime rate isn't unique--83 percent of white Americans are killed by other white Americans. This is easy to understand. People don't go across town to steal or kill--they commit crime against their neighbors. And in the United States, where most lives are still segregated by race, that means blacks victimize blacks, whites victimize whites, and so on. Any difference in intragroup crime owes more to levels of segregation--most whites live in places where there are some minorities, most blacks live in places where there are mostly blacks--than it does to any particular propensity for crime. And the idea that blacks don't care is demonstrably false--black communities are saturated with messages and marches against crime. But those aren't as interesting as, for instance, the riots in Ferguson. Giuliani's other assertion--that white police only patrol black neighborhoods because of high crime rates--is also wrong. Heavy-handed policing in black neighborhoods--by predominantly white departments--goes back to the middle of the last century and was a key factor in the riots that rocked the urban landscape in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s. More importantly, this policing predates the high crime rates that Giuliani cites as justification. Of course, this is Giuliani's modus operandi. The former mayor built his career on scaring white New Yorkers with fears of black criminals, to the point where he can't help himself; while campaigning for Michael Bloomberg in 2009, he warned that New York City would go back to the way it was if voters made the wrong choice. ""You know exactly what I'm talking about,"" he said during a campaign event. ""This city could very easily be taken back in a very different direction--it could very easily be taken back to the way it was with the wrong political leadership."" In this case, the ""wrong political leadership"" was the city comptroller, Bill Thompson, who is black. But even if Giuliani is banal, he's still worth debunking, not just because he's wrong, but because he's honest. There's no subtext to his remarks. When he tells a Fox News panel that ""there is virtually no homicide in the white community,"" he's explicitly connecting the whole idea of crime to black Americans. In Giuliani's rhetoric, the crime problem is a black problem. This is an old narrative, to which Giuliani is just giving his spin. ""In the interest of the colored folks see to it ... that you war against criminality in your own race with a particular zeal, because that criminality is in the ultimate analysis a greater danger to your race than any other thing can be,"" said President Theodore Roosevelt in a 1906 commencement speech to Hampton University. ""[A]bove all, vice and criminality of every kind, are evils more potent for harm to the black race than all acts of oppression of white men put together."" The difference, as Khalil Gibran Muhammad notes in The Condemnation of Blackness, is that then the alleged preponderance of black criminality was used to justify neglect. In cities like Philadelphia, politicians attacked vice and crime in white neighborhoods while ignoring it in--or even it directing it to--black ones. Now, it's justification for constant police contact and its inevitable, often violent, consequences. None of this is to deny that black communities have more violence and more crime than their white counterparts. It is true. And indeed, blacks are more likely to face criminal victimization--up to and including murder--than any other group. But it's wrong--morally and analytically--to treat these facts as racial problems inherent to black people or any particular aspect of blackness. That's what the idea of ""black-on-black-crime"" does: It collapses a whole world of distinctions, circumstances, and situations into a single frame, where crime in Prince George's County, Maryland, is the same as crime in Gary, Indiana, is the same as crime in Houston, and all are part of a nebulous ""black crime"" problem. Indeed, to rely on the idea for any explanatory power is to embrace racist mythmaking while disavowing any responsibility for the existence of impoverished, high-crime black neighborhoods. Or, to make that more concrete, we need to consider all other options before we attribute high crime in black neighborhoods to ""culture"" or some inherent black criminality, especially given the long abuse of ""culture"" as an explanation for perceived black inferiority. We need to account for the effects of hypersegregation and broad, concentrated poverty. We need to account for the collapse of urban economies and the presence of illicit drug markets. We need to account for the huge, heavy-handed police presences that lead to more crimes being caught and more actions being classified and treated as crimes. And we need to account for the real effects of public policies like the war on drugs and mass incarceration on violent crime rates. ""Without the War on Drugs, the level of gun violence that plagues so many poor inner-city neighborhoods today simply would not exist,"" notes Heather Ann Thompson for the Atlantic. ""The last time we saw so much violence from the use of firearms was, notably, during Prohibition."" It's only when we consider these factors that we can bring culture and alleged criminality into the picture. Anything else is dishonest and treats black Americans as a dangerous exception, not part and parcel of the country's fabric. Crime is complicated. We have ideas of how to reduce it on a local or community level, but we're limited when it comes to a systemic view. Even now, criminologists aren't sure what caused the rapid declines of the past 20 years, which lowered crime rates across all groups and all communities. But we know this: Ideas of black criminality--of ""black-on-black crime"" as a particular phenomenon--have a specific origin in the racist miasma of the post-Reconstruction United States. They were built with marginalization in mind--to justify racism, disenfranchisement, and neglect--and they persist like The Thing (John Carpenter's, not Jack Kirby's), strong, adaptable, and embedded in the national mind. But that doesn't mean we have to indulge them. We can talk about crime and crime control without demonizing an entire class of people. And indeed, with the consequences of those myths in full view in cities as different as New York, Ferguson, Saratoga Springs, and Cleveland, we have no other choice but to talk differently and try to change our image of what crime looks like. Lives depend on it."	Rudy Giuliani Doesn't Understand Crime As Well As He Thinks

Members of the community held signs, led chants, and sat there, policing the police. Early Monday afternoon, only a handful of protesters clustered around the post, a corner of parking lot outside a tire and auto shop. The grand jury's decision was due at 8 p.m., but at 2, the demonstration consisted of scarcely more than one man with a steel beverage cooler and a drumstick. I sat in the backseat of a Chevy Impala parked a few spaces away from the vigil with three young men I'd just met, listening to new tracks by Migos with the windows rolled down. At around 3, a girl toting a bullhorn entered the nearby Subway sandwich shop. A man named Byron pointed toward the Ferguson Police Department and noted that its cramped accommodations were hardly where he wanted to spend his Thanksgiving. The trickle of arriving protesters turned gradually into a stream, and then the sun set and the helicopters began to swarm overhead. The role-players took their places. Amnesty International representatives huddled in their yellow shirts, next to Legal Observers in neon green caps, while the clergy milled about in bright-orange vestments. Those assigned to scout and secure the perimeter assumed their posts, the percussionists gravitated to the center, and the live streamers wired their devices. By 6, the sidewalk had filled with the rank and file, and a rousing rendition of ""We are Family"" rang out from the hub. Shortly after 7, they occupied both sides of the street and converged in the middle, shutting off traffic and ushering in the movement's marquee vehicle, an old white sedan covered in spray-painted messages, with several young demonstrators perched atop it. The county police formed a line outside the station, wearing winter layers rather than riot gear. As the decision approached, the timbre of the crowd grew more frantic with the dread accumulated since Aug. 9. A crowd surrounded an older, white, bearded gentleman who fervently denied affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan while being unceremoniously expelled from the premises. A man in a hoodie that read ""Peacekeeper"" raised his voice to remind people, ""We're out here for a purpose. Keep up with the purpose."" From the hood of a black car parked in the middle of South Florissant Road, local rapper and activist T-Dubb-O explained the organizational structure of the movement: ""We're all in charge."" Five minutes before 8, Lisa Fithian, a veteran organizer, offered a tepid projection of what was to come. ""Everyone's been organizing and kind of has their own plan,"" she said. ""What's going to happen is going to happen."" At 7:59, a siren issued from within the crowd and people jumped, only to realize someone had pushed the wrong button on the bullhorn. The car that provided the platform for T-Dubb-O, along with Sabrina Webb (Michael Brown's cousin), a man wearing a Guy Fawkes-style mask, and several others, doubled as the stereo for the radio broadcast of the grand jury's decision. The crowd encircled the vehicle. A man at the center pointed toward the police department and said, ""If they say the wrong thing, we're going across that gate."" Around 8, the volume of the crowd died down, but NPR was slow in getting to the point. When the conversation between the station's host and correspondent eventually turned to the imminent decision, the host asked, ""What do you hear from the protesters--are they urging peace, defiance? What's their sentiment?"" The correspondent's response was drowned out by a swelling chant of, ""Indict, convict, send that killer cop to jail! The whole damn system is guilty as hell!"" St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch then took the podium to soften the blow that everyone seemed to know was coming--they had known for months. As he neared the end of his prefatory remarks, Leslie McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, worked her way through the masses and arrived at the car and ascended its bumper to look out over the throngs occupying the street. She wore large sunglasses and a white hat. McCulloch was still talking. ""The law also allows all people to use deadly force to defend themselves in certain situations,"" he said. ""Defend himself from what?"" McSpadden demanded at the top of her voice. ""From what? What was he defending himself from? Tell me that!"" McCulloch continued over the stereo, but everyone present was listening to Brown's mother. ""They want him back in Ferguson,"" she cried, referring to Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. ""I can't get nobody back!"" She was sobbing. ""Everybody wants me to be calm,"" she shouted. ""Do you know how them bullets hit my son? What they did to his body when they hit his body?"" Murmurs of ""no indictment"" percolated through the crowd. A fledgling chant of ""No justice, no peace"" was squashed by a bullhorn. When the decision was announced, nobody packing the five-lane road appeared to register it. I didn't hear it, and I was up against one of the car's open windows. When the news did reach the crowd, it seemed to hit everyone like a drop in pressure. McSpadden rocked back and forth in despair. She was comforted by Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, who jumped onto the car and embraced her. In the undulating masses surrounding the car, I heard, ""No indictment, it's going down, it's going down."" Then Head turned and began to shout. ""Burn this motherfucker down. Burn this motherfucker down. Set it off, burn it down. Burn this motherfucker down."" Whether by the grand jury's decision or the response, the protesters were stunned at first. Some collapsed dejectedly on the street as if finally processing the blow they had long expected. Then people began to push up against the barricade in front of the police department. The officers were in full riot regalia now, lined 15 or so wide behind their shields. The first projectile I saw come their way was a bullhorn, which fell flat before them. Then came a couple water bottles. People at the front of the line turned back in censure: ""Stop throwing shit!"" The vanguard of protesters eyed the police battalion through its clear-plastic shields. ""Hands up, they still shooting!"" they chanted. Another projectile--it must have been a water bottle--came hurtling through the sky, and a girl cried ""Stop, this is what they want!"" A girl wearing a Fawkes mask chased down and pointed at someone who was going to throw something. If there had ever been a plan, it was by now completely deserted. One contingent continued to run through its repertoire of chants, adding a couple of new ones. ""This is what community looks like,"" they repeated to the beat of the drum. A group ran into the fray shouting, ""Don't talk to the media."" The rhythm of the chants quickened: ""Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot."" A chorus of competing bullhorns interjected their separate sermons. The police tightened their line. A group of young girls led a march up the street, but few followed their example. Several gunshots were fired at 8:50--no one could tell their source or target--and then the canisters of tear gas were launched. Protesters furnished their masks and ran headlong toward the toxic clouds.  A helicopter's searchlight swept over the ground. Another projectile soared over the police barricade. A man was brought to his knees and encircled by protesters as he claimed with increasing desperation that he was not the thrower. At 9:05, a phalanx of cars approached the police station and shots rang out. Those congregated in front of the station scattered toward the north, and the police officers took cover behind the squad cars out front. Helicopters buzzed ever louder overhead. Minutes later, the police began to sweep methodically through the street, announcing their intent to arrest those who didn't cooperate for unlawful assembly. Someone whizzed by me, saying, ""Teargas is coming."" The police truck inched forward and repeated the command over the speaker: ""You need to get out of the street immediately or you will be subject to arrest. Do it now."" A handful of lingerers subtly moved toward the outer lanes and paced slowly backward. Then another projectile--this one seemingly larger and launched at a greater distance--it hit a car that had comprised the police force's ramparts. And more tear gas shot out from the police station southward, glowing red embers with stark white tails. People ran northward from there, grabbing bottles of water to wash out their eyes. I retreated to my car amid a northward stampede, and sought momentary refuge atop South Florissant Road at the crest of a hill overlooking the Little Caesar's. When it seemed safe to drive downhill toward the center, I passed a flaming trashcan, the first presence I'd seen of fire. I saw a Do It Yourself hardware store that had a shattered window, and Beauty World, whose storefront had also been reduced to broken glass. Toppled mannequin heads had rolled into the middle of the street. Further down, someone breathlessly recounted his run from a teargas offensive that had caught a woman who had just suffered a heart attack and was being brought back to the tents for medical attention. On the corner of the parking lot that had served as the hotbed of protest, a man clutched a Bible in one hand, his other hand outstretched, and prayed feverishly to himself. A pastor warned that arrests were imminent, and the crowd pushed down the street to more military trucks and a car that was engulfed in flames. A helicopter shone its searchlight on the street, and as it came to rest on a protester among the vanguard, he lifted his arms high and shouted, ""Hands up!"" Driven northward by the advancing police line, a band of protesters linked hands and strode five abreast in compliance, but someone had detected the coming onslaught of tear gas. ""Here it comes,"" she said, and the chain was broken in the ensuing scramble. The flares arched overhead and landed back in the parking lot, where a young mask-wearing man gripped one and threw it back at the police. A massive yellow dog that I recognized as a protester's canine then came bounding past us, to the north and out of danger, dragging its leash behind. The eyes of a mass of people are always at the edges. From the interior, you can't see what you're up against, only what insulates you. Wherever the front is, the people there send signals to the assembled ranks, and it travels like a wave through a rope. But each time the tide of tear gas drove the protesters away, an undertow brought them back into the fold. I ultimately did give in and went back to my car and headed up the hill out of town. Driving up South Florissant, I saw a band of kids, some fully masked, some wearing bandanas, come toward me. One lanky kid in a bandana stood in front of my car, so I stopped and he advanced a couple steps then got to the sidewalk, where the others had gathered outside Corner Coffee House. One of them hoisted a metal chair and pitched it through the window before they headed down the hill. I found myself outside the same Little Caesar's, except now it was up in flames. I asked the GPS for directions, and it responded, ""Directions not available--a route is currently not available due to road closures."" I made my way to the interstate. There was hardly any traffic beside a police cruiser, lights flashing, headed the other way. As I drove I remembered Sabrina Webb's benediction at the protest in Shaw the night before. ""When y'all go home, we still gotta deal with this,"" she said. ""I still gotta wake up and look out of my window and see teddy bears."" Read more about Ferguson in Slate."
