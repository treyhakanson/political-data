All praise to him! It's a noble goal, and a posture that's very hard to sustain. When two Washington Post reporters asked the Wisconsin governor if he thought President Obama was a Christian, he refused to answer on account of it not having anything to do with anything. ""To me, this is a classic example of why people hate Washington and, increasingly, they dislike the press,"" he replied. (Nice of him to say ""increasingly ... dislike the press,"" as if that condition were still in transition as opposed to frozen in amber). ""The things they care about don't even remotely come close to what you're asking about."" Walker then tweeted: The link takes you to a page on Walker's super PAC site set up specifically for those who are upset by the press's questions. The challenge for a new presidential candidate is not limited to coming up with a cogent answer for how you would win the war against ISIS or raise wages. You've also got to come up with a strategy for handling the circus. You can engage, duck, or turn it to your advantage. Walker is trying to transform a duck into a weapon by making the press an issue. Walker has had a heavy dose of silliness recently. Two weeks ago, on a trade mission to London, he was asked about his position on evolution, which has nothing to do with the subject of trade. He responded that he would duck the issue. Last week he was repeatedly asked to respond to remarks former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani made about President Obama not loving America because of the way he was brought up. Now he's having to weigh in on the Christianity question. This presents a fascinating experiment. Walker is trying to run his race on his terms. Every candidate tries to escape the tests of campaign life that they find clownish. Remember when Barack Obama briefly tried to argue that whether or not you wore a flag pin was not a sign of your patriotism? They usually fail for a series of reasons. The first is that what seems silly can sometimes have traction with voters. It's the silly stuff that breaks through and defines a candidate because people don't always spend weeks looking over the position papers on their websites or studying their speeches. Or, the silly stuff sets a first impression that sticks. That's why George Bush's campaign in 2004 promoted pictures of John Kerry windsurfing in what one aide at the time called a ""diaper."" The senator looked funny and that was powerful. It was on this basis that conservative columnist George Will said on Fox News about Walker: ""There are certain questions that if you are going to answer them, you answer them 'Yes.' Do you believe in evolution: Yep! Is the president patriotic: Yes.' And then you go on to something else."" A corollary to this is that once you make a stand against silly gotcha questions, it theoretically makes it harder for you to exploit the same frivolous pap when that's what's tripping up your opponents and causing their collapse in the polls. Also, signing yourself up only for serious questions is hard, particularly if you've been a governor and some of those issue areas are unfamiliar. This is what caused Walker problems with ABC's Martha Raddatz. He said he had bold solutions, but when she asked him what bold new solutions he had for combating ISIS in Syria, his answer was neither bold nor new. There are endless policy questions and a host of questions about the attributes required for the presidency that are nettlesome. Plus there are the hypothetical questions about situations Walker might face as president that should keep us all engaged for months. The silly questions are the ones that give you a break from the searing questions that you've just now promised you've committed yourself to in your declaration against the frivolous and obscure. Duck those hard questions now that you've declared yourself guardian of the important and people are going to think you're trying to trick them. Finally, not playing in the silly season requires a pact with your opponents. You all have to agree on what's silly. If they all answer a question that you're labeling as a gotcha, it causes two problems. It makes it look like your stance against the media's dull inquiries is just a fancy avoidance maneuver and it makes it look like you lack the fortitude to answer the question as easily as your opponents did. That is where Walker finds himself on the question of Rudy Giuliani's intemperate remarks. When Walker was asked to react to the former mayor's claim that the president didn't love America because of his upbringing, he avoided the question and testified to his own love of America. It was a safe nonanswer. In the ensuing days, Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Rand Paul, Gov. Mike Pence, Gov. Rick Perry, and Gov. Bobby Jindal all gave actual answers. They all said they were sure the president loved the country but it was his policies they disagreed with. Pence and Paul made a broader point about opposing the practice of questioning a political opponent's motives. Now, even Giuliani is backing down from his own remarks in a Wall Street Journal op-ed trying to revise and extend his remarks. No Republican primary voter will remember this in a week or so. No significant number of Republican primary voters are going to see it as a moral failing on Walker's part. But his reticence does suggest a timidity and caution at this stage in his campaign. That could be prudence and Walker is arguably the riskiest Republican politician in America having taken on the unions and survived a bruising re-election that resulted from it. But in a campaign these gotcha moments are not always worth avoiding. A good politician can take advantage of them. Walker is not well defined. Nearly 60 percent of Republicans in a recent CBS poll say they don't know enough about him. When the spotlight turns--even if it is for stupid reasons--a successful candidate grabs the moment to set himself apart. Walker missed his first opportunity. There is a way this could have been done in fielding the question about Giuliani. Of course the president loves the country and like many dysfunctional relationships, he harms the ones he loves the most. It's a silly, somewhat small answer, but it would have been favorably repeated in the GOP clubhouse, building on Walker's already strong reputation. Or, Walker could have responded by really backing up Rudy. The truth hurts doesn't it? Either way, these kinds of answers are only possible if the silly season is seen as an opportunity and not a burden. When you click through to Walker's website, it contains a quote from Ronald Reagan. Thirty-five years ago this week Reagan may have changed the trajectory of his campaign by knowing how to take advantage of a silly moment. In a debate in Nashua, New Hampshire, the debate moderator tried to cut off his microphone in a pre-debate argument over the rules of who could participate. (Full story here in the Whistlestop podcast). Reagan, who had paid for the debate to get around FEC rules, exploded, ""I paid for this microphone."" The crowd went wild and it was seen as glorious demonstration of his character, toughness, and leadership. The issue at hand didn't have anything to do with the issues people cared about. The confrontation was a silly bit of staged theater, and Reagan went on to win the primary by 27 points over George H. W. Bush and take all but five of the next 33 contests."

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/joe_biden_should_run_for_president_the_vice_president_won_t_win_but_it_would.html	"If you want a sense of what Vice President Joe Biden is mulling for the next stage of his career, just look at his travel plans. On Wednesday, he will visit New Hampshire to collect an award. This comes a week after a trip to South Carolina, and two weeks after a stop in Iowa. In both states, he met with local Democrats and party officials--the kinds of people you talk to when you want to run for president. He even said he would make a decision--by the end of the summer. In a sense, Biden is already running for president; he's testing his party support before jumping on to the stage for another national performance. But unfortunately for his prospects, he's bound to run into the same problem as every other Democratic presidential hopeful: Hillary Clinton, or rather, her massive presence in the Democratic Party. Barring a change to the landscape, there won't be a Democratic primary campaign next year. Instead, Hillary Clinton will announce her bid for the nomination, and we'll almost immediately move to a general election campaign. The former secretary of state is the definition of inevitable: There are dissenters, but after winning second place in the momentous 2008 race, the party and its machinery are mostly behind her candidacy. It's not a bad position. In an uncompetitive primary, the anointed nominee can sidestep narrow appeals in favor of a broader message. And rather than waste time with nomination battles in unwinnable places like Texas or South Carolina, she can focus her fire in critical states like Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Likewise, without a national primary campaign to divide its various factions, the Democratic Party can devote its fundraising to organizing its troops and attacking its Republican opponents. By the time the GOP has picked a nominee, Democrats will have been six months into an onslaught of political ordinance. But this dream for party professionals could become a nightmare for the actual candidate. As Matthew Yglesias notes for Vox, Clinton's uncontested nomination is perilous for her and the Democratic Party. Absent ""real debates, real media strategy, real policy rollouts, and all the other accompaniments of a presidential nominating congress,"" Clinton enters the game ""dangerously unprepared"" against a ""battle-tested"" Republican nominee. The huge advantage of a competitive primary is that it tempers a candidate for the general election. After months of stump speeches, debates, setbacks, and challenges, the eventual nominee is prepped for the rigor of a national contest against a capable opponent. She has a stronger sense of her platform and the kinds of appeals that work for public consumption; she can better account for mistakes, better relate to the press, and is less vulnerable to the kinds of disasters that can destroy a candidacy. If Clinton were an active politician--if she had a long history of successful elections--this wouldn't be a huge problem. But the fact is that Clinton has had three efforts: Her 2000 run for Senate, her 2006 re-election race, and her 2008 primary campaign. And of the three, only the latter was as competitive and high stakes as a presidential election. By all measures, Clinton is a strong candidate for 2016, but she needs the practice. She needs a sparring partner. Which brings us back to Joe Biden. There's almost no chance that the vice president could win the nomination. He lacks party support--most Democrats have all but pledged their fealty to Clinton--and enthusiasm. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a ""Draft Warren"" movement behind her; there are no ""Biden Democrats"" clamoring for him to crisscross the country. At the same time, he's not a marginal figure. He's a sitting vice president and veteran of two primary runs and two presidential campaigns. If Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb runs, they'll run as gadflies. If Biden runs, he'll run as a contender with the skills to challenge Clinton on the trail. And while Clinton could avoid a debate with either of the other figures, it's much harder to sidestep a showdown with Biden. He has stature. In a primary race against Clinton, Biden will lose. But for the sake of the Democratic Party, he should run. Yes, there's little glory in defeat. But a Biden campaign could force Clinton to sharpen her skills for her eventual fight with an eager and thirsty Republican Party. Even Clinton's supporters think this is necessary. ""I wish we would have some other candidates running,"" said the pro-Clinton vice chairwoman of the Indiana Democratic Party in an interview with Politico, ""I think it would give the nation the opportunity to have a debate."" Which is to say that while Biden wouldn't have Clinton's resources, he'd have some support for his challenge, perhaps as the consensus candidate for those Democrats who aren't ""Ready for Hillary."" Here's the truth: Democrats aren't doomed to lose 2016, but they aren't favorites either. By itself, public fatigue with the Democratic Party gives the GOP a clear shot at winning the White House. Add Obama's middling approval to the Republican column and--with the Democrats' demographic advantage--you have an almost even presidential matchup. If Clinton is destined for the nomination, then Democrats need her at the top of her game, and a Biden campaign is the best way to get her there."

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/obama_s_supporters_may_have_forgotten_how_much_they_despised_hillary_clinton.html	"As a presidential candidate, says one political veteran, Hillary Clinton does not offer the country a ""fresh start."" ""For all of her advantages, she is not a healing figure,"" he continues. ""The more she tries to moderate her image ... the more she compounds her exposure as an opportunist. And after two decades of the Bush-Clinton saga, making herself the candidate of the future could be a challenge."" Who said this? Marco Rubio? Scott Walker? A consultant for their fledgling 2016 campaigns? In fact, none of the above. They are the words of David Axelrod, the uber-strategist for Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, and are drawn from his new memoir, Believer. The hefty, engaging book has been dissected mostly for Axelrod's analysis of his former client and his presidency, but it's actually far more remarkable from another vantage: It is a reminder of how far liberals who were in the pro-Obama camp in 2008 have traveled in their view of Hillary Clinton--and how much they've allowed themselves to forget along the way. The reconciliation of Obama's following with the presumptive 2016 Democratic nominee has been the great underexamined story on the Democratic side of the ledger heading into an election year. One simply cannot overstate how much ill will there was between the two camps in 2007 and 2008--that historic, down-to-the-wire primary standoff was based not in policy contrasts (good luck recalling the differences in their health plans) but in a deeply personal clash about the meaning and methods of progressive politics. ""Triangulating and poll-driven positions because we're worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us just won't do,"" Obama said in his breakout speech in Des Moines in November 2007.  ""This party ... has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the American people when we led, not by polls, but by principle; not by calculation, but by conviction; when we summoned the entire nation to a common purpose--a higher purpose."" Clinton fired back sarcastically three months later: ""Now, I could stand up here and say, 'Let's just get everybody together. Let's get unified. The skies will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing, and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect.' "" The legions of young Obama foot soldiers in Iowa, South Carolina, and elsewhere were fired not just by airy notions of hope and change and making history but by the more negative motivation that the prospect of a Clinton nomination stirred in them. And yet here we are, eight years later, and it is almost as if that great showdown never happened. Some of those young Obama loyalists have now assumed leading positions in the vast Clinton apparatus, as have some of his most senior campaign staff. With no serious opposition looming in next year's primaries, Clinton's standing among Democratic voters is vastly stronger than it was at this point eight years ago (right around the time Obama announced his challenge), notes Nate Cohn in the New York Times. As was the case then, the papers are full of eyebrow-raising stories about overlap between her political backers and donors to the Clinton Foundation. Yet whereas in 2007 those stories were seized on by many liberals as confirmation of their wariness of Clinton, this time around there is little sign of the stories--or those about her continuing to rake in $300,000 speaking fees--causing any real agita on the left. It's not hard to come up with explanations for liberals' newfound acceptance. There is the fact that she and Obama reconciled and her (mostly) dutiful service as his secretary of state. There is the letdown that some (many?) Obama liberals have felt about their man and his high-flown aspirations for changing Washington, which has led to a reassessment of Clinton's more Earth-bound approach. There is the simple reality that there is not a credible rival to assume Obama's spot in the field as the more liberal, dynamic, and idealistic alternative--were Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run, she would quickly remind liberals of their misgivings about Clinton, but it really looks like she's not running. The result is a sort of collective amnesia among Obama supporters when it comes to their former estimation of Clinton--a reluctance to reckon fully with their aversion to her then and what has come of it since. This amnesia may seem harmless now, but one can't help but wonder if it might come back to haunt Democrats in the general election if it is not confronted more fully before then. Democrats, including Obama's diehard 2008 backers, may now seem willing to accept Clinton with a shrug or even a hug, and let bygones be bygones. But will that acceptance hold once they start seeing her out on the trail again--giving the stump speeches they found so dreadfully dull in contrast to those of their chosen guy in 2008, giving such hyper-cautious answers in debates, coming off as stumbling and disingenuous in her efforts to align herself with the mood of the moment? Better for Democrats to reckon with that prospect now than in the heat of the 2016 campaign, when they might suddenly find themselves feeling as unenthusiastic about her as they did about another Democrat running to succeed a two-term president with a stronger claim to the party's emotional core. That is why Axelrod's new recounting of the 2008 showdown provides a service to Obama liberals--it cuts through the fog of forgetfulness, like some kind of Ghost of Primaries Past, to bring Obama-ites face to face with the Clinton they could not abide. Axelrod is no Clinton-hater--he did ads for her 2002 Senate campaign and expresses repeated gratitude in the book for her support of his and his wife's efforts to spur research on epilepsy, which their daughter has battled for years. But, unlike Obama 2008 veterans, he has not signed up with Clinton this time around, and is willing to recount the grand clash in clear-eyed terms. He recalls Clinton's weakness for gun-for-hire consultants like the ""bloodless and calculating"" Mark Penn, who ""saw his mission as quashing any liberal impulses"" and ""justified himself with fuzzy polling numbers and a smug self-assurance that made everything grating."" He distinguishes Obama's offer of change in Washington from Hillary's copy-cat rhetoric: ""The 'change' Hillary was offering was not much change at all--certainly not a move away from the raw, divisive politics that had come to define Washington. Rather, she seemed to revel in those politics. ... The change she was offering was not away from Washington's habit of parsing words and passing on tough issues. (She habitually sought safe harbor.) The change she was offering was not away from a system dominated by PACs and corporate lobbyists. (She had taken their money and defended their work.)"" He casts in distinctly unflattering terms Clinton's turn to a more aggressive tone once it became clear how much trouble she was in, calling her ""downright gleeful"" about attacking Obama and describing ""the ardor with which she bared her teeth,"" all of which ""validated our critique that she was a reflection of scorched-earth Washington politics rather than an answer to it."" He singles out for opprobrium Clinton's clumsy suggestion that Bobby Kennedy's assassination late in the 1968 primaries was proof that anything could happen and that she should therefore stay in the race until the bitter end--an ""inexcusable"" and ""thoughtless"" comment that Axelrod says ""enraged"" him. And he reminds readers of Bill Clinton's provocative efforts to rally white voters around his wife in the South Carolina primary, which he says set off another senior Obama adviser, Alabama native Robert Gibbs: ""Gibbs was convinced that Bill Clinton was trying to tap into the ugly impulses in southern politics that he had done so much to allay during his political career. 'This guy had risen above the Old South,' Robert said, 'Now their backs are to the wall, and look at what they're doing. Campaigning right out of the Lee Atwater handbook!' "" Axelrod even gets in a small dig once his narrative turns to the general election, speculating that Hillary was unwilling to speak out against Sarah Palin after the GOP vice presidential nominee gave her a shoutout in her introductory speech because she was ""perhaps flattered by Palin's tribute."" Axelrod makes sure to close on a conciliatory note, writing that Clinton was ""as game, smart, and experienced an opponent as Barack could draw"" and that ""the warm partnership they built would become one of the inspiring subplots of my time in the administration."" But make no mistake--Axelrod has not forgotten what the differences were that motivated him, and millions of other Democrats, to come to Obama's side instead of Clinton's not that long ago. And it would be better for their party's sake if those voters grappled with those memories and realities sooner rather than later."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/obama_and_isis_it_s_not_the_president_s_job_to_interpret_islam.html	"On Sept. 17, 2001, shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks, President George W. Bush declared that ""these acts of violence violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith, and it's important for my fellow Americans to understand that."" According to Bush, ""the face of terror is not the true face of Islam,"" because ""Islam is peace."" To Americans who feared that Muslims would face violent reprisals in the wake of the attacks, Bush's words were welcome. Yet there was something awkward about the fact that the president, by all accounts a devout Christian, had decided not only to say that our Muslim fellow citizens ought to be treated with respect, but also that those who'd commit such a horrific crime had--and here Bush literally quoted from the Quran--""rejected the signs of Allah and held them up to ridicule."" No one should doubt Bush's good intentions in describing Islam as a religion of peace. But by invoking Islamic scripture, and by weighing in on a debate that can only be settled by those who identify as Muslims themselves, he contributed to a confusion that persists today. The real problem with people who kill innocent people in the name of Islam is not that they're incorrectly interpreting their faith. It's that they are killing innocent people. Like Bush, President Obama has weighed in on matters that must ultimately be left up to Muslims. Take his remarks this Wednesday, when he said, quite rightly, that ""we are not at war with Islam."" Not content to stop there, or to simply explain that we are at war with various apocalyptic death cults that have declared war on us, he added that ""we are at war with people who have perverted Islam."" In great detail, Obama explained that ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, and other extremist groups seek religious legitimacy in order to recruit young people to their cause, and that they ""depend upon the misperception around the world that they speak in some fashion for people of the Muslim faith."" According to Obama, these groups base their claims to legitimacy on falsehoods and selective readings of Islamic texts. Obama's position seems to be that the leaders of these groups aren't sincere in their beliefs. He suggests that what ISIS is really after is power, as if its obsessive focus on acting in accordance with practices that were widespread in the days of Muhammad is merely window-dressing for thuggery and theft. But why do the leaders of ISIS have to be insincere in their beliefs in order for us to reject their brutality? Might the president be acting in deference to America's Muslim allies? For decades, the United States has worked closely with Saudi Arabia, a state that has enthusiastically spread a form of Islam widely viewed as puritanical and chauvinistic, to combat Islamist terrorism. You might not like Saudi Arabia and the various Gulf petrostates that have proven such unreliable friends. I certainly don't. But try to imagine waging war on terrorist groups rooted in the Arab world without them. So perhaps Obama, like Bush before him, is engaging in a sophisticated from of diplomacy by telling the world that while we choose to remain silent on the radical Islam practiced by our friends, we will insist at every turn that the radical Islam practiced by our enemies is not Islam at all. What could be wrong with this approach, if its intention is to strengthen our alliances in the Muslim world? A lot, actually. First, the Saudis are our allies not out of any great affection for our heathen ways, but because our interests happen to align. There is no need to condescend to them with talk of Islam as a religion of peace. Second, and more importantly, loose and lazy talk about what is and is not authentic Islam might actually undermine efforts to dissuade Muslims from embracing terrorist violence. When Obama condemns one radical theology that cuts against American national interests while papering over others that don't, he practically invites cynicism and distrust. This week, Graeme Wood published an excellent cover story for the Atlantic on ISIS, which has deservedly drawn a great deal of attention. What he has found is that ISIS is attracting not just psychopaths motivated solely by bloodlust, but also sincere believers who embrace it for its rigorous, uncompromising adherence to the doctrines of early Islam. As Bernard Haykel, one of the experts Wood interviews, puts it, Islam is perhaps best understood as ""what Muslims do, and how they interpret their texts."" Other Muslims can certainly reject the interpretations of ISIS and its followers as perverse, as the vast majority of them do. But it's not as though these Muslims, let alone two Christian presidents of the United States, have some unquestioned monopoly on the right to interpret Islam. You can declare that the leaders of ISIS are in fact apostates. You can also declare that Shiite Muslims or Ahmadiyyas are apostates, as Salafi Muslims do as a matter of course. To do so won't settle anything, as no one owns Islam, just as no one owns Christianity. That's not to say there isn't room for someone to make the theological case against ISIS. Many Muslims are doing just that, and I applaud them for doing so. May their efforts sway Muslims from taking up ISIS's ugly cause. Who knows? There might even be a place for the U.S. government to covertly give a boost to Muslim defenders of pluralism and modernity, just as the Cold War CIA bankrolled intellectuals on the anti-communist left. Our president, however, would be wise to stay out of theological controversies. It's not the place of Bush or Obama to engage in dialogue with Islamic extremists over the finer points of the Quran or the life and times of Muhammad--it's to protect American lives."

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/jeb_bush_s_foreign_policy_speech_the_republican_candidate_sounded_confident.html	"If there were questions about whether Jeb Bush is like his brother, he dispelled some of them on Wednesday at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. In November 1999, candidate George Bush scored only 25 percent when a Boston television political reporter gave him a pop quiz on world leaders. Jeb Bush, on the other hand, displayed a command of the world on topics from Cuba to ISIS to the relationship between energy and American security. He surpassed his brother at a far earlier period in this cycle. He also surpassed his 2016 rivals Govs. Chris Christie and Scott Walker, who have had trouble clearing the foreign policy hurdle easily. Jeb Bush may or may not have wise opinions, but as David Axelrod writes in his recent book about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential race, a candidate can convey strength by passing confidently through the tests on the campaign trail. For some voters that may be enough. Bush showing he knows the name of the president of Egypt, can correct his questioner about events in Tunisia, and can name the precise location of the Iraqi prison that once held the current leader of ISIS will be sufficient. More important for the coming Republican primary, Bush was optimistic. ""We are a country in its ascendancy,"" he said. ""We just need to start acting like it."" If sustained, confidence mixed with optimism is an attractive combination in a candidate. But this is only the start of what hopefully will be a long investigation into what Bush really thinks about foreign policy. What exactly would he have done differently in Syria or in response to Russian intervention in Ukraine? Do those answers represent the bold new way forward he suggests, or are they mere tinkering? Did he mean to criticize members of his brother's administration who came to the same conclusion about Iran retaining levels of enriched uranium when he attacked the Obama administration for holding the same position? He says a lot of things confidently, which makes it look like he's not getting up on roller skates for the first time--but like most ""policy speeches"" it was mainly a chance to criticize the sitting president. His speech and answers on Wednesday, with only a few exceptions, were vague and rich in platitudes. He'd like the economy to be strong and for America to have strong alliances and promote freedom. He said an American president must speak in bright certainties and always do what he says--unlike Obama on Syria, which Bush pointed out, but also unlike Bush on North Korea's nuclear capability, which he didn't. He wants America to lead everywhere and be engaged but also several times counseled ""patience."" He wants to increase defense spending, but didn't specify how he is going to do that while balancing the budget, tackling entitlements, and promoting the 4 percent growth he promises. He promotes a ""Liberty Diplomacy"" (which sounds like his brother's Freedom Agenda), but when asked about Egypt--where an oppressive dictator maintained stability despite the calls for freedom from people in the streets--Bush suggested the United States made the wrong call abandoning Mubarak. He called for ""balance,"" which would have meant putting the promotion of liberty on hold. At another point Bush said that when he looks at the world's complexity and dangers he says to himself, ""Holy Schnikies. This is serious stuff."" Here's the bottom line: In foreign policy positions and posture, Jeb Bush is indistinguishable from his father or brother because he's indistinguishable from the general GOP line. If he is challenging the Republican Party on domestic issues, he's not doing anything to challenge Republicans on foreign policy. His positions are indistinguishable from all but Sen. Rand Paul in the GOP's 2016 field. No doubt Paul will be attacking him shortly, as Bush articulated the mainstream Republican view on surveillance. He said the National Security Agency's metadata collection is ""a hugely important program."" In his speech, Bush made it seem like a media fixation to compare him to his brother or seek to measure the distance between the two. But it's natural to compare a candidate to what has come before, no matter who bears the name. When talking about Republican foreign policy thinking, it's natural to think about the last two Republican presidents, both of whom happened to be named Bush. They define a huge chunk of the Republican foreign policy world. Look at the list of foreign policy advisers Jeb Bush has supporting him, and this is borne out. They have more experience with Bushes than the gardeners at Levens Hall. So when Jeb Bush tries to treat attempts to get him to weigh in on the policies of his brother and father as unfair, he's asking to be exempted from having an opinion about 12 years of Republican decision-making. On Wednesday, Bush only mentioned Iraq by mistake, but in the question-and-answer session he returned to the country. ""There were mistakes made in Iraq, for sure,"" he said, pointing out that the information the intelligence community in multiple countries provided on weapons of mass destruction turned out ""not to be accurate."" He also said that not planning to secure Iraq after Saddam Hussein was removed was a mistake. They were the first remarks he's made about his brother's war in Iraq since he's started seriously running. He also said that George Bush's support for the surge was ""heroic"" and ""hugely successful."" For those scoring at home, this is no different than what his older brother said in his book Decision Points, though Jeb Bush did distance himself from his brother in one way. He went much farther than George Bush did in praising George Bush's performance with the surge."

The legislative sessions of the past couple years were marked by partisan acrimony, but this year, things are calmer and more harmonious--a restoration of the ""Virginia way,"" the state's proud tradition of gentility that suffered such a shock amid last year's tawdry scandal involving former Gov. Bob McDonnell, his acquisitive wife, and a chatty cook. ""I think people just want to get the work done and show all our constituents that we can get out of here actually on time for once,"" Del. Peter F. Farrell, a Republican from the Richmond suburbs, told the Washington Post's Laura Vozzella. Del. Greg Habeeb, a Republican from Roanoke County, told her this year's session had been so quiet ""because the House Republican caucus is so focused on kitchen-table issues that don't drive salacious headlines. ... It's been a very productive session, but it's been an out-of-the-headlines session."" Even the spokesman for the Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe got in on the self-congratulation, saying the session is ""maybe not interesting if you're hosting Crossfire, but it's what Virginians want from their leaders."" What's making this year's session so much more civil than last year's, when a partisan impasse brought the state to the brink of a government shutdown? It's not some collective mood swing toward comity. It's that McAuliffe has, for now, all but given up on pushing for the goal that was at the heart of last year's standoff: the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans in Richmond, led by House Speaker William Howell, have dug in against the expansion, despite the fact that virtually the entire cost would be covered by the federal government, that Virginia, as one of the wealthier states in the country, could easily afford its small share of the cost, and that other more conservative states, such as Arkansas and Indiana, are proceeding with the expansion. That obstruction is bad enough from the standpoint of the 400,000 low-income Virginians who are left uncovered in the struggling coal counties of southwest Virginia, the inner city of Richmond and Newport News, or the immigrant enclaves of the Washington suburbs. What's even more remarkable, though, is how Virginia Republicans have managed to cast the mere mention of the expansion as some kind of incendiary hot-button issue intended only to inflame partisan strife, taking the widespread yearning for our more bipartisan politics of yore and using it to smother debate over a very real and consequential policy fight. When McAuliffe dared to mention the expansion in his State of the State speech last month, Republican legislators chided him for bringing up the ""divisive issues ... that led to last year's impasse."" How uncouth of him! Last year, McAuliffe had pushed the expansion to the point of winning a slender majority of support for a market-based version of it in the then- evenly divided Senate, only to see it run aground in the House. Accepting reality, he has decided to hold off on another showdown in this session, calculating that he'll have better odds of bringing the issue back up next year, once legislators are past this fall's election--and more importantly, past the Republican primaries preceding the election where they might face a challenge if they dared to go along with expansion. ""There's a recognition that right now the votes aren't here for this session,"" Sen. Adam Ebbin, a Northern Virginia Democrat, told me. ""The threat of primaries is looming over any Republican seeking re-election. They're aware that their votes are being watched back home."" Not that there haven't still been some attempts at persuasion. In the House of Delegates, Democrats sent their GOP counterparts letters laying out how many people in each of their districts would be covered by the expansion, a relevant fact considering how many rural districts with large numbers of uninsured are represented by Republicans. ""We've got [legislators] where 6,000, 7,000 people would get health insurance at no cost ... and they're voting no,"" said Del. Scott Surovell, chairman of the Democratic caucus. ""We wanted to make sure everyone understood how many people stood to benefit. And it didn't matter."" What explains an intransigence that exceeds even that in some more conservative states? One theory is that Virginia's proximity to Washington has resulted in the toxicity of the Obamacare debate there overflowing into Richmond politics. Others note the heavy investment of the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity in grass-roots organizing against the expansion, which is targeting Republican lawmakers who might go soft. Regardless, opposition to expansion has assumed a profound, almost doctrinal significance among many Virginia Republicans. When I recently asked Morgan Griffith, a Republican who served as majority leader of the House of Delegates before his 2010 election to Congress representing southwestern Virginia, about Virginia's holding out on the expansion even as some red states accept it, he compared it to the state being the first one to include religious freedom in its Constitution. ""Sometimes being an outlier is not a bad thing,"" he said. ""It's all right to be an outlier. I'm not worried about being an outlier."" The latest official act of obstruction came last week, when the Senate stripped out the expansion from McAuliffe's proposed budget and added language prohibiting him from moving forward with the expansion on his own. Now down by two seats in the Senate, and with two of their members out sick, Democrats were unable to even keep the majority leader, Sen. Tommy Norment, from cutting off debate on the issue before the vote. But three senators managed to get in a few words on the floor at the end of the day. One of them, Northern Virginia's Barbara Favola, noted that the state's taxpayers are sending hundreds of millions of dollars to Washington to cover the cost of Medicaid expansion in other states, even as Virginians get none of that benefit. ""We're not going to move forward to insure these 400,000 individuals who don't have the money to go to the doctor when they're sick. They won't receive Pap smears, they won't receive screenings for high blood pressure, they won't receive screenings for prostate problems."" Then she cut to the political heart of the matter: ""The fear that lawmakers might have [of primary challenges] is nothing compared to the fear that these 400,000 individuals have every day because they now can't go the doctor when they need one."" It was, by the standards of the ""Virginia way,"" an impolitic speech. But Favola told me she doesn't care if she's given offense. ""When lawmakers aren't tackling the real important issues, it's easy to go along and get along,"" she said. ""It's a travesty for the state."""

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/scott_walker_cuts_university_of_wisconsin_funding_the_republican_governor.html	"Of the Republican presidential hopefuls, Scott Walker is not the most compelling, the most articulate, or the most attractive. He's better than milquetoast but less interesting than vanilla. And with few exceptions, he doesn't heat up a crowd as much as he brings it to lukewarm. Despite all of this, however, the Wisconsin governor is the present front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination. A top-tier candidate and serious contender, and not the off-brand Tim Pawlenty he seemed to be before the Iowa Freedom Summit. What Walker has--and what makes him so appealing to Republican primary voters--is the fighting spirit of an ideologue. Not only is he committed to a doctrinaire conservative vision, he also knows who his enemies are and he's willing to shell them into submission. Walker's first siege was in 2011, just after winning the governorship. Despite an election night promise of ""moving the state forward together,"" the newly minted executive entered office and promptly launched an attack on public-sector unions, powerful opponents who formed the backbone of the state's Democratic Party. Walker's proposal ended collective bargaining for pay raises and forbid unions from deducting fees from employee paychecks. It forced state workers to hold annual votes for union representation and required them to pay larger contributions to pensions and health care plans. Unions fought back and mounted a rearguard action, collecting the signatures for a recall election. But the counterattack failed. Walker won his second election in two years, underscoring his anti-union reforms and raising his stature in the national Republican Party. By 2013, Wisconsin public employee unionization had dropped about 13 percent, the sharpest decline in the nation. Today these unions have fewer members, fewer funds, and fewer allies. This year, ahead of a competitive presidential primary, Walker is out to distinguish himself again, this time with an ambitious push against another pillar of liberal Wisconsin. According to the Washington Post, the Republican governor will slash $300 million from the University of Wisconsin system over the next two years, a 13 percent reduction in state funding. Team Walker says it's just bookkeeping, a simple cut that comes with an even exchange: a two-year tuition freeze and new flexibility for administrators who want to set pay scales and campus construction priorities. ""These reforms will give the U.W. System the power to transform higher education in this state for the future by empowering leaders, protecting taxpayers, and promoting long-term stability,"" said a spokeswoman for the administration in an email to the New York Times. Likewise, in a post on Facebook, Gov. Walker treated the move as inconsequential to the university system. ""Our budget changes are only 2.5% of the total UW System operating budget. 2.5%. In return, they get long-term flexibility and savings."" That number is misleading. Sixty percent of U.W's $6.1 billion budget is earmarked for research, athletics, and other purposes. Officials can't move it or use it in place of state aid. When you count Walker's cuts as a fraction of U.W's discretionary budget, they jump from 2.5 percent of the whole to a full 6 percent, a small but substantial reduction. And a cut of this size isn't just bookkeeping. In a speech in London last week, Walker compared this push to his move against public-sector unions. ""It's very much like what we did four years ago,"" he said. And he's right. As policy and politics, this is a huge move. On the former, even a small cut means fewer faculty, larger classes, and fewer resources for the smaller satellites in the university system. And on the latter, Walker can stand as the fearless conservative warrior against a phalanx of liberal students, left-wing professors, and permissive bureaucrats. Every anti-Walker protest in Madison is another minute of b-roll for the governor's primary ads, and every attack on his college record--or lack thereof--is just more anti-elitist fodder for debates and stump speeches. Scott Walker knows his enemies. And he knows that strong targets offer fierce reactions but great rewards. By beating unions in a thickly unionized state, surviving a recall, and winning re-election, Walker captivated conservatives and pulled himself to the national stage. This is just the next step. How do you distinguish yourself from a crowd of culture war competitors like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum? You borrow a page from Spiro Agnew and provoke a culture war. You launch another raid on Wisconsin liberals, in hopes that they'll take the bait and give you fuel for whatever you need to say. Based on their reaction so far--""Walker doesn't value the university,"" said one government worker to the Times, ""He has disdain for anything intellectual. He doesn't care if the populace is educated""--his foils are doing just that. I'll say it again: Scott Walker knows his enemies. And so far, they haven't figured it out."

Even as homicide rates have continued to decline elsewhere in the country, they have surged in St. Louis, which last year saw a 33 percent rise in killing, to 159 in a city of 318,000.

Criminologists point to all the usual reasons for the violence: a thriving drug trade, high unemployment among young men, and so on.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/scott_walker_refuses_to_discuss_evolution_there_is_no_good_reason_to_ask.html	"Someone needs to keep Republican presidential candidates out of London. Last week, during his trip to the city, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie caused a stir with a now-infamous comment in defense of vaccine ""choice."" And on Wednesday, while taking questions after a speech on global trade, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ducked a query about biological science. ""Are you comfortable with the idea of evolution? Do you accept it?"" asked the moderator of the event. ""I'm going to punt on that one,"" replied Walker, ""That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other. So I'm going to leave that up to you."" Stateside, the reaction followed a familiar path. Liberals mocked the dodge, conservatives defended it, and both sides settled in for a nice afternoon of needless acrimony. I say needless because, of all the things to argue about, this is among the least important. Who cares if Scott Walker believes in evolution? Why, exactly, does it matter? The easy answer is that evolution is a public policy issue. The foundation of modern microbiology and pathology, disbelief in evolution could lead to bad policy choices around disease control and other public health concerns. Likewise, evolution helps us understand biodiversity and helps us grasp what happens when we damage the stability of an ecosystem. Which is to say that a stance on evolution could also have consequences for environmental policy. And on the local level, what you think about evolution can matter for education policy: The standards you use, the textbooks you buy, and the school administrators you hire. Then again, there's no need to ask about evolution if what you want to know are a politician's views on disease control. All you have to do is ask about disease control. And that goes for the constellation of science-based issues. Want to know what Walker thinks about climate change? Ask him. Want to know if he thinks the government should do more to protect natural environments? Ask him that, too. The response to this is that ""evolution"" is a proxy issue; what you believe about the origins of life is a signpost for how you view science in the modern world. A politician who affirms the role of evolution in driving life, including humans, is presumably a politician who won't hesitate to act on carbon emissions or fund important research. But there's a problem. Views on evolution don't actually tell you anything about how a politician will act or how he'll approach science-based issues. Neither do they give any insight into public attitudes toward science. Take black Americans. In a recent survey from the Pew Research Center, 42 percent of blacks say humans have existed in their present form since the beginning, while just 55 percent say they evolved. But skepticism about evolution doesn't translate to anti-science positions. To that point, 82 percent of blacks say the Earth is getting warmer, and 56 percent attribute it to human activity. Or take young people. Seventy-three percent of Americans age 18 to 29 accept evolution, but only 39 percent say it's safe to eat genetically modified foods and 61 percent say scientists don't have a clear understanding of genetically modified crops. The best example of this is the anti-vaccine movement, where young, educated, and evolution-believing parents refuse vaccines for their children, despite the direct connection between evolutionary science and the making and development of vaccines. If you want an actual heuristic for whether a given person is going to support science-based policy, your best bet is to ask their party affiliation. If he is a Democrat, then regardless of his views on evolution, he is likely to support action on climate change or want to strengthen environmental protections. And if she is a Republican, the opposite is probably true. Most black people vote for Democrats, and as a consequence they're likely to have a Democratic take on climate change. And on the other side, most white Americans vote for Republicans, and believe accordingly: Only 44 percent blame human activity for global warming, in line with the general GOP position. There are a few scenarios where it makes sense to ask a politician about evolution. For someone who wants to shape school curriculums, those beliefs are vital. But even then, it's difficult to draw a firm conclusion. A creationist school-board member might still want students to use mainstream science textbooks, regardless of her views on the question. Alternatively, there are times in national politics where evolution--as a matter of educational policy--hits the national stage. Then, it makes sense. But at this moment in American life, there's no need for questions about evolution. They simply don't tell you anything you couldn't learn by asking a direct question about a specific issue. With that said, it is true that all of this is good fodder for the culture war. Or put differently, the only reason to ask about evolution is if you want to know something about someone's cultural group. A view on evolution doesn't say much about public policy, but it can mark you as a certain kind of religious believer or give you a chance to affirm your membership in one tribe or another. Which is to say that when a politician answers a question about evolution, they aren't defending or rejecting science as much as they're sending a message: I am one of you, and this is how you know."

The Senate went on record last month that it doesn't think humans are even contributing to climate change. The attitude in the House, meanwhile, is even more hostile to science, as GOP leaders there are hard at work plotting ways to undercut President Obama's climate rules. Given the depressing reality of the present, the climate-conscious are left looking to the future for signs of hope. And there are reasons to be optimistic! As the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication documented last month, there is a pretty big chasm between the climate views of Republican voters and Republican lawmakers. After crunching the numbers on a half-dozen national surveys from the past three years, the Yale researchers found that more than half of self-identified Republicans (56 percent) actually support government regulations on carbon dioxide--a rather staggering conclusion when you consider the anti-Environmental Protection Agency venom that GOP lawmakers and White House hopefuls alike have been spitting for years. Team Green got another dose of promising news earlier this week from the New York Times, which used its recent climate poll--conducted last month with the help of Stanford University and a nonpartisan environmental research group--to highlight another relatively unknown and largely untapped pocket of support for climate action: Hispanics. Despite the common notion that the environment is something that only rich, white liberals care about, the Times survey found that Hispanics are actually more likely than non-Hispanic whites both to view climate change as something that affects them personally and to support government action aimed at curbing it.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/laquan_mcdonald_shooting_a_recently_obtained_autopsy_report_on_the_dead.html	"An autopsy tells a story. The genre is mystery: a narrative set in motion by a corpse. The pathologist-narrator investigates the cause of death in precise, descriptive prose that ultimately allows the dead to testify about what happened to them. In the case of Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old black youth killed by Chicago police on Oct. 20, 2014, the autopsy raises questions not only about how he died, but about how the Chicago Police Department has handled the case since. While it does not provide all the details of what transpired that night, the autopsy makes one thing clear: The account of the incident given by the police cannot be true. Here is what police at the scene told reporters: At around 9:45 p.m., a squad car responded to a call that someone was trying to break into cars in an industrial area on the southwest side of Chicago. The officers found a boy, Laquan McDonald, standing in the street with a knife. They observed him stabbing the tires of a vehicle. When they ordered him to drop the knife, he ignored them and walked away, down the street. Pat Camden, a longtime Chicago Police Department press spokesman who now performs that function for the police union, later described McDonald as having had ""a strange gaze about him ... he's got a 100-yard stare ... he's staring blankly."" The responding officers didn't have a Taser. Waiting for one to arrive, they followed McDonald in their vehicle. A second squad car arrived. McDonald again refused to drop the knife. The police tried to use the two vehicles to box him in against a construction fence on Pulaski Road. He punctured a tire and damaged the front windshield of one of the police cars. Officers got out of their vehicles. McDonald lunged at them with the knife. One of the officers shot him in the chest. At 10:42 p.m., he was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. ""The officers are responding to somebody with a knife in a crazed condition, who stabs out tires on a vehicle and tires on a squad car,"" Camden said at the scene. ""You obviously aren't going to sit down and have a cup of coffee with them. He is a very serious threat to the officers, and he leaves them no choice at that point but to defend themselves."" The Chicago press dutifully reported the police account of the incident. The reporter for the local NBC station called it ""a clear-cut case of self-defense."" It was also reported that the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), the city agency charged with investigating police shootings, would conduct an investigation, as it does in the case of every ""police-involved shooting."" In its broad outlines, this is a familiar Chicago story: A black American is shot by a Chicago police officer. A police source says the shooting was justified. IPRA announces it is investigating. Then silence. After a year or two, IPRA issues a report confirming that the shooting was indeed justified. The statistics are stunning. According to IPRA reports, Chicago police officers shoot, on average, several residents a month. Roughly 75 percent of those shot are black. Civil rights lawyers and investigative journalists I've talked to who have covered the Chicago police for decades cannot remember the last time criminal charges were brought against a Chicago police officer for a shooting while on duty. Sometimes before the story of a police shooting evaporates into silence, we briefly hear the voice of a family member or friend trying to find words to describe who the victim was or questioning the shooting. Not so in the case of Laquan McDonald. A ward of the state, he appears not to have left much of a trace in the world. At any rate, there was no one to speak for him during the brief moment of media attention occasioned by his death. The press coverage did, however, contain a couple of particulars that didn't meld with the police narrative. A witness, Alma Benitez, was quoted as saying that the shooting was unnecessary, because a number of officers were present and they had control of the situation. ""It was super exaggerated,"" she said. ""You didn't need that many cops to begin with. They didn't need to shoot him. They didn't. They basically had him face-to-face. There was no purpose why they had to shoot him."" The other detail at odds with the police narrative--mentioned in passing in a couple of news reports without comment--was that the Cook County Medical Examiner had ruled that McDonald died of ""multiple gunshot wounds,"" not the chest wound that the CPD had described. The question the press didn't ask--how many gunshot wounds are covered by the word ""multiple""?--has now been definitively answered by the recently finalized autopsy report, which I have obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request: Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times. Before mapping each of the 16 gunshot wounds in minute detail, the report describes Laquan McDonald. Six feet tall and 180 pounds, he had been wearing blue jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt. He had dreadlocks, the longest of which was five inches. He was, before his encounter with the police, in good health. A tattoo on his upper right arm read ""Quan."" Another on the back of his right hand read ""Good Son."" And on the back of his left hand were a pair of dice and ""YOLO""--the acronym for ""you only live once."" The description of each of the gunshot wounds is exhaustive, noting where the bullet entered the body, the damage it did to tissue and bone, where it exited the body, and its direction. The numbering of the wounds in the report is arbitrary; it is ""without regard to sequence or severity."" Here is a summary: 1. Gunshot wound of the left scalp. (Directionality cannot be determined.) 2. Gunshot wound of the neck. (The direction is left to right, slightly front to back and slightly downward.) 3. Gunshot wound of the left chest. (The direction is front to back, right to left and downward.) 4. Gunshot wound of the right chest. (The direction is front to back, left to right and slightly downward.) 5. Gunshot wound of the left elbow. (The direction is left to right, back to front and slightly upward.) 6. Gunshot wound of the right upper arm. (The direction is back to front, downward and slightly left to right.) 7. Gunshot wound of the left forearm. (The direction is back to front, slightly right to left and slightly downward.) 8. Gunshot wound of the lateral right upper leg. (The direction is right to left, downward and slightly front to back.) 9. Gunshot wound of the left upper back. (The direction is right to left and downward with no significant forward or backward deviation.) 10. Gunshot wound of the left elbow. (The direction is left to right and downward with no significant forward or backward deviation.) 11. Gunshot wound of the posterior right upper arm. (The direction is right to left, downward and slightly front to back.) 12. Gunshot wound of the right arm. (The direction is back to front and upward with no significant lateral deviation.) 13. Gunshot wound of the right forearm. (The direction is upward and slightly back to front with no significant lateral deviation.) 14. Gunshot wound of the right hand. (The direction is slightly left to right and slightly upward with no significant forward or backward deviation.) 15. Gunshot wound of the right lower back. (The direction is back to front, right to left and upward.) 16. Gunshot wound of the right upper leg. (The direction is left to right and front to back with no significant vertical deviation.) How could an incident that began with the responding officers assessing the situation and deciding they needed a Taser end a few minutes later with 16 bullets ripping through Laquan McDonald's body from different directions? Did more than one officer fire? That might explain the bullets entering from different directions. Or did a single officer empty a full magazine? Perhaps McDonald was rolling around on the ground, in which case bullets fired from a single position might have entered his body from different directions. Whatever happened, it's very difficult to square the police narrative with the facts established by the silent testimony of Laquan McDonald's corpse. And there is more: I recently spoke with a witness, who asked that I not use his name for fear of police reprisals and who has also reported his story to IPRA. He said he came upon the unfolding drama at the moment when McDonald was boxed in by police cars and the construction fence. From this point forward, his version of events diverges sharply from that of the police. From this witness's perspective, McDonald didn't pose an immediate threat to anyone, and he had nowhere to run. Several officers got out of their squad cars, he says. McDonald was shying away from the police rather than moving toward them, according to this witness, when a white male officer shot him. He fell to the ground. There was a pause. Then the officer fired again and again and again. The witness counted, he thought, six more shots, but he was uncertain whether other officers were also firing. Almost immediately, a number of police cars arrived on the scene, blocking the witness's view. The police didn't interview him or take his name. Although the witness is adamant that McDonald was moving away from the police and not lunging toward them, let's assume the officer's assessment of risk was correct. There is a rule of thumb in law enforcement known as the ""21-foot rule""--the distance an attacker with a knife can cover before his intended target, armed with a holstered sidearm, can reasonably be expected to get off an accurate shot. Perhaps that justified the first--or even the first few--shots, but what possible justification could there be for the barrage of bullets that followed? The police department and the city have the means to answer these questions. A source close to the case confirmed to me that the dashboard camera in one of the squad cars on the scene captured the incident. (CPD policy requires officers to activate their dashboard cameras when in pursuit.) And it's clear from both the police narrative and the witness account that at least one of the squad cars on the scene had a clear perspective on the sequence of events. I have reached out to the Chicago Police Department several times for comment on the autopsy, the witness testimony, and the video, but have not heard back. In December, Professor Craig Futterman of the University of Chicago Law School and I publicly called on the city to release all video footage of the incident. It has not done so. Nor has it addressed questions we have raised about the incident. Now the autopsy report has made those questions even more urgent. The reality is that in a police force the size of Chicago's, no matter how well trained and supervised, bad things will sometimes happen. The critical question is how the institution responds when they do. Last November, in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy spoke of the importance of keeping the public informed after high-profile incidents such as police shootings. He said he didn't want the department to ""be defensive"" when such incidents occur. ""Transparency,"" he said, ""is part of our legitimacy."" Hence the importance of releasing the video footage of the Laquan McDonald shooting. Refusing to do so, in view of the questions raised by the autopsy report, can only damage the department's legitimacy. The decision of whether or not to release the video ultimately rests with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who is currently in the midst of a re-election campaign. His administration has taken several significant steps toward establishing a credible regime of police accountability. Among them is the transparency policy it adopted following a 2014 Illinois Appellate Court decision holding that documents relating to closed investigations of police misconduct are public information. It would be a logical extension of that policy to include open as well as closed cases, to the extent timely information can be made public without compromising ongoing investigations. Recently, the mayor touched, in another context, on what is at stake. In connection with the announcement of a pilot program in which officers in one of the city's police districts will be outfitted with body cameras, he spoke of the damage to community-police relations done by the history of police abuses, and expressed the hope that body cameras will help rebuild ""a foundation of trust"" between residents and the police. Sparked by events in Ferguson, Missouri, an extraordinary series of protests and conversations across the nation have brought us to something akin to a truth and reconciliation moment with respect to patterns of police abuse and impunity in minority communities. At the local level, this dynamic is complex and volatile , as the recent events in New York have illustrated. Statesmanship will be required on all sides, if we are to find a path forward that publicly acknowledges longstanding patterns of human rights violations, while building and maintaining the relationships that will be required, incrementally and over time, to effectively address those harms. The McDonald footage will come out, but a great deal turns on how it comes out. Will the city be forced to release it in a way that deepens the crisis of public confidence in law enforcement, or will it be released in a way that helps restore the ""foundation of trust"" between residents and police on which effective law enforcement depends? If the city resists releasing the video until legally compelled to do so, outrage at what it depicts will be compounded by outrage that the city knew its contents (and the autopsy results) in the immediate aftermath of the incident yet withheld that information from the public. The fate of Laquan McDonald--a citizen of Chicago so marginalized he was all but invisible until the moment of his death--has thus become entwined with that of Mayor Emanuel. It presents his administration with a defining moment."	Chicago Police Say They Killed a Black Teen in Self-Defense. Then Why Did They Shoot Him 16 Times?	['Cook', 'McCarthy']	[]

For those still unaware, this debate comes after President Obama's comments at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, where--after condemning Islamic radical group ISIS as a ""death cult""--he offered a moderating thought. ""Lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ ... So this is not unique to one group or one religion. There is a tendency in us, a sinful tendency that can pervert and distort our faith."" It's a straightforward point--""no faith has a particular monopoly on religious arrogance""--that's become a partisan flashpoint, as conservatives harangue the president for ""equating"" crusading Christians to Islamic radicals, accuse him of anti-Christian beliefs, and wonder why he would mention a centuries-old conflict, even if it has some analogies to the present day. What we have missed in the argument over the Crusades, however, is Obama's mention of slavery and Jim Crow. At the Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates puts his focus on religious justifications for American bondage, and it's worth doing the same for its post-bellum successor. And since we're thinking in terms of religious violence, our eyes should turn toward the most brutal spectacle of Jim Crow's reign, the lynching. For most of the century between the two Reconstructions, the bulk of the white South condoned and sanctioned terrorist violence against black Americans. In a new report, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative documents nearly 4,000 lynchings of black people in 12 Southern states--Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia--between 1877 and 1950, which the group notes is ""at least 700 more lynchings in these states than previously reported."" For his victims, ""Judge Lynch""--journalist Ida B. Wells' name for the lynch mob--was capricious, merciless, and barbaric. C.J. Miller, falsely accused of killing two teenaged white sisters in western Kentucky, was ""dragged through the streets to a crude platform of old barrel staves and other kindling,"" writes historian Philip Dray in At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America. His assailants hanged him from a telephone pole, and while ""the first fall broke his neck ... the body was repeatedly raised and lowered while the crowd peppered it with small-arms fire."" For two hours his corpse hung above the street, during which he was photographed and mutilated by onlookers. Finally, he was cut down and burned. More savage was the lynching of Mary Turner and her unborn child, killed for protesting her husband's murder. ""[B]efore a crowd that included women and children,"" writes Dray, ""Mary was stripped, hung upside down by the ankles, soaked with gasoline, and roasted to death. In the midst of this torment, a white man opened her swollen belly with a hunting knife and her infant fell to the ground, gave a cry, and was stomped to death."" These lynchings weren't just vigilante punishments or, as the Equal Justice Initiative notes, ""celebratory acts of racial control and domination."" They were rituals. And specifically, they were rituals of Southern evangelicalism and its then-dogma of purity, literalism, and white supremacy. ""Christianity was the primary lens through which most southerners conceptualized and made sense of suffering and death of any sort,"" writes historian Amy Louise Wood in Lynching and Spectacle: Witnessing Racial Violence in America, 1890-1940. ""It would be inconceivable that they could inflict pain and torment on the bodies of black men without imagining that violence as a religious act, laden with Christian symbolism and significance."" The God of the white South demanded purity--embodied by the white woman. White southerners would build the barrier with segregation. But when it was breached, lynching was the way they would mend the fence and affirm their freedom from the moral contamination, represented by blacks and black men in particular. (Although, not limited to them. Leo Frank, lynched in 1915, was Jewish.) The perceived breach was frequently sexual, defined by the myth of the black rapist, a ""demon"" and ""beast"" who set out to defile the Christian purity of white womanhood. In his narrative of the lynching of Henry Smith--killed for the alleged rape and murder of 3-year-old Myrtle Vance--writer P.L. James recounted how the energy of an entire city and country was turned toward the apprehension of the demon who had devastated a home and polluted an innocent life."" James wasn't alone. Many other defenders of lynching understood their acts as a Christian duty, consecrated as God's will against racial transgression. ""After Smith's lynching,"" Wood notes, ""another defender wrote, 'It was nothing but the vengeance of an outraged God, meted out to him, through the instrumentality of the people that caused the cremation.' "" As UNC-Chapel Hill Professor Emeritus Donald G. Mathews writes in the Journal of Southern Religion, ""Religion permeated communal lynching because the act occurred within the context of a sacred order designed to sustain holiness."" The ""sacred order"" was white supremacy and the ""holiness"" was white virtue. I should emphasize that blacks of the era understood lynching as rooted in the Christian practice of white southerners. ""It is exceedingly doubtful if lynching could possibly exist under any other religion than Christianity,"" wrote NAACP leader Walter White in 1929, ""No person who is familiar with the Bible-beating, acrobatic, fanatical preachers of hell-fire in the South, and who has seen the orgies of emotion created by them, can doubt for a moment that dangerous passions are released which contribute to emotional instability and play a part in lynching."" And while some church leaders condemned the practice as contrary to the Gospel of Christ--""Religion and lynching; Christianity and crushing, burning and blessing, savagery and national sanity cannot go together in this country,"" declared one 1904 editorial--the overwhelming consent of the white South confirmed White's view. The only Southern Christianity united in its opposition to lynching was that of black Americans, who tried to recontextualize the onslaught as a kind of crucifixion and its victims as martyrs, flipping the script and making blacks the true inheritors of Christian salvation and redemption. It's that last point which should highlight how none of this was intrinsic to Christianity: It was a question of power, and of the need of the powerful to sanctify their actions. Still, we can't deny that lynching--in all of its grotesque brutality--was an act of religious significance justified by the Christianity of the day. It was also political: an act of terror and social control, and the province of private citizens, public officials, and powerful lawmakers. Sen. Ben Tillman of South Carolina defended lynching on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and President Woodrow Wilson applauded a film that celebrated Judge Lynch and his disciples. Which is all to say that President Obama was right. The vastly different environments of pre-civil rights America and the modern-day Middle East belies the substantive similarities between the fairly recent religious violence of our white supremacist forebears and that of our contemporary enemies. And the present divide between moderate Muslims and their fanatical opponents has an analogue in our past divide between northern Christianity and its southern counterpart. This isn't relativism as much as it's a clear-eyed view of our common vulnerability, of the truth that the seeds of violence and autocracy can sprout anywhere, and of the fact that our present position on the moral high ground isn't evidence of some intrinsic superiority."

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/chris_christie_legal_troubles_the_new_jersey_governor_can_t_seem_to_escape.html	"It was already a rough week for Gov. Chris Christie. The New York Times ran a front-page story about his penchant for traveling in high luxury on other people's dime, just as the New Jersey governor was enjoying a junket to London. Worse, his comments equivocating on the necessity of vaccines threw him together with the libertarian Sen. Rand Paul as the anti-science duo in the emerging 2016 Republican presidential field and earned him a hard slap even from the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page. But then, late Thursday, came another setback: news that the federal investigation that U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman started a year ago as an inquiry into the politically motivated lane closures at the George Washington Bridge had apparently broadened out yet further, into a matter that could implicate Christie in another episode of apparent political retribution. It's unclear just how seriously the feds are pursuing this new angle. But this latest development reminds us that serious legal clouds still linger over Christie's incipient presidential campaign, notwithstanding the fact that investigators have reportedly found no direct link between him and the lane closures. Because the thing is that it was never just about the bridge. Long before a political appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ordered several local-access lanes to the GW Bridge closed in September 2013, Christie had, both as governor and U.S. attorney, been wielding authority in ways that were bound to bring blowback and scrutiny. That he managed to avoid consequences for so long is a tribute to his ability to portray himself as a righteous crusader against New Jersey's murky political culture, even as he was making his own compromises with some of the state's most notorious political operators. Bridgegate opened a window into all this. Here were Christie's close aides and allies at the Port Authority conspiring to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, for his refusal to endorse Christie and thereby help him burnish the bipartisan credentials he was seeking in a big 2013 re-election victory. Christie disavowed knowledge of the plot, and late last year a legislative panel looking into the scandal found no evidence that he had a hand in the scheme. Christie's boosters hailed this as a sign that he was in the clear for a 2016 run. Far from it. Fishman's investigation is ongoing, because it has broadened into an array of matters other than the actual bridge closures. His office is still looking into the question of whether Christie's team was pressuring local Democratic leaders into endorsing him, judging from a recent subpoena of administration records regarding the cancellation of meetings with Democratic mayors who declined to endorse Christie. But it is also looking hard at a close Christie ally, David Samson, a politically connected lawyer whom Christie hired as his campaign counsel in 2009 and later made chairman of the Port Authority. There, Samson became embroiled not only in Bridgegate but in another bit of alleged political retribution being investigated by Fishman's office: the apparent denial of Hurricane Sandy recovery funds for Hoboken, New Jersey, over a contentious development project that Samson's law firm had a stake in. The Manhattan district attorney is conducting its own criminal investigation into the Port Authority's diversion of $1.8 billion in Port Authority funds, at the behest of Christie's administration, to pay for non-Port Authority roads in New Jersey. And this week came the revelation that Fishman is scrutinizing Samson on yet another front: his dealings with United Airlines, which has considerable business with the Port Authority and which, curiously, introduced a little-used direct flight from Newark to Columbia, South Carolina, near where Samson has a weekend home, but discontinued it as soon as Samson resigned from the Port Authority last year.  (Samson called it ""the chairman's flight,"" according to the Bergen Record.) Some of the matters for which Samson is under scrutiny have only a tenuous connection to Christie himself. Still, so tightly bound is he with Samson and the Port Authority that a federal case against Samson, should there be one, will be at the very least deeply embarrassing and unhelpful for Christie. And now comes the word that Fishman's office is looking into a matter that is very much Christie-related: long-standing allegations by Bennett Barlyn, a former assistant prosecutor in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, that he was fired because he spoke out against the 2010 decision by Christie's then-attorney general, Paula Dow, to dismiss indictments against the Republican county sheriff and two sheriff's deputies, all Christie allies. (The indictments revolved around allegations of abuse of power by the sheriff's office--making employees sign loyalty oaths, threatening critics, and even manufacturing fake police badges for a major Christie campaign donor. The New York Times' Michael Powell did an exhaustive story on the indictments, and Barlyn's allegations of a political conspiracy to quash them, in 2013.) Barlyn has filed a whistleblower lawsuit over his firing and has been trying for several years to have Christie's administration held to account for the episode. And on Wednesday night he was visited at his Pennsylvania home by two members of Fishman's office, who heard him out for more than an hour and took with them a thumb drive of documents relating to the Hunterdon case and Barlyn's dismissal. He told me in an interview Friday that the investigators gave no indication of how seriously they were considering legal action over the Hunterdon case but that he was heartened by their detailed knowledge of the case. ""They were conversant with the facts, which suggested they had prepared for it,"" he said. ""I'm grateful they did respond. It is late in the day, but that just speaks to the culture of New Jersey corruption. ... Given New Jersey's climate of indifference, I'm just glad they interviewed me."" Christie's office declined to comment about this new inquiry, but it has previously ridiculed Barlyn's allegations. ""This is conspiracy theory stuff from someone who is obviously casting a wide net with hopes of coming up with a big fish or something,"" Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in 2012. ""It's nonsense."" Meanwhile, statements from Fishman's office leave open the possibility that it is simply being courteous in meeting with Barlyn--in June, Fishman responded to Barlyn's entreaties with a letter, obtained by the Associated Press, that stated, ""It is not apparent on the face of your submission that there have been potential violations of federal criminal law warranting this Office's review."" And in response to questions about the meeting with Barlyn, a spokesman for Fishman said, ""We talk to a lot of people about a lot of matters but that does not necessarily mean it's a criminal investigation."" (Update, Feb. 8, 2015, 5:45 p.m.: Fishman's office went further over the weekend in downplaying the meeting, telling MSNBC: ""We talk to people all of the time ... Any characterization that we are investigating the governor about this is just not true."") But John Wisniewski, the Democratic state assemblyman who led the initial inquiry into Bridgegate, doubts that the feds met with Barlyn just to be nice. ""I don't think the U.S. attorney engages in meetings and inquiries because they're following a mandate from Emily Post. I think they're following things that have merit and that they must believe there is a reason to look into this,"" he said. ""They clearly have taken the early seeds of the Bridgegate investigation and have expanded it into areas that none of us have could have anticipated at the time."" And meanwhile, of course, the clock is ticking for Christie and his presidential dreams. There have been hints that Fishman would wrap up his investigation by the end of this month, but the fact that he is still branching into new areas suggests that may not be the case, unless he is just dotting the i's and crossing the t's. So the cloud of potential legal repercussions lingers even as Christie is trying to compete with Jeb Bush and others in the early fundraising rush. That cloud, more than the memory of his careless comments about vaccines, is what Christie is going to wish he had a special elixir to ward off in the weeks ahead."	Are Chris Christie's Legal Woes Just Beginning?	['Paul', 'Christie', 'Long']	[]
15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/scott_walker_has_always_played_to_his_political_base_the_wisconsin_governor.html	"Scott Walker is causing an awful lot of waves for a guy whose biggest shortcoming is his supposed milquetoast manner. Last week, the Wisconsin governor repeatedly declined to distance himself from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's declaration that President Obama doesn't love America. On Saturday, in response to a question about whether he thought Obama was a Christian, Walker replied, ""I don't know."" Meanwhile, Walker is stirring things up back in Wisconsin with his plan for cuts to the state university system and with his announcement that, contrary to what he'd said a few weeks earlier, he is open to the legislature passing an anti-union ""right to work"" bill. These flashes of hard edge, combined with Walker's surge in the (very early) polls for the Republican primaries, have startled many in the national media. These episodes have challenged the accepted narrative about Walker--that he is a Republican with unusual crossover appeal, someone who wears his conservatism in such mild-mannered and affable fashion that he has managed to win three times in a state that hasn't gone Republican for president since 1984. ""Establishment-leaning Republicans love that he's shown how to govern and win three elections in four years in a state that usually leans Democratic,"" wrote The Hill last month. Even Walker's showdown with the public employee unions in 2011 was not necessarily taken as evidence against this narrative, perhaps because so many in the national media tacitly agree with Republicans on the need to rein in public employee unions. But in reality, no one should have been surprised by Walker's stormy entry into the early primary season, because the conventional wisdom about him was flawed all along. As I reported last year, Walker rose to power in Wisconsin less by reaching out to Democrats and swing voters than by appealing to the conservative base in a state that is as starkly polarized as any in the country. Wisconsin is not politically purple because it is full of voters who straddle party lines and swing back and forth from election to election. It is purple because it is divided into two strikingly cohesive and fiercely energized camps, as displayed in the eye-popping maps that accompanied the definitive series on the state's political polarization last year by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel's Craig Gilbert. Walker himself admitted to Gilbert that there wasn't much wooing of swing voters going on anymore: ""It was always a divided state but it used to be [that] you'd explain it as '40/40/20,' and 20 percent was the persuadable middle,"" Walker said. ""That percent has shrunk now to 5, 6 percent maybe ... or five or six people."" Democrats run up big numbers in the cities of Milwaukee and Madison (which is home to both the state government and flagship branch of the university). Republicans do well in the state's rural areas, but, more than that, they rely on their total domination in the suburbs of Milwaukee--the ""WOW Counties"" of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington. In other major northern cities, once-heavily white and Republican-leaning suburbs have in recent years grown more racially diverse and politically purple, if not outright blue--think of Montgomery County outside Philadelphia, Cook County outside of Chicago, or Fairfax County outside of Washington. But not metro Milwaukee. There, partly because of a fluke of history, the suburbs have remained monolithically white, in a sort of demographic time warp, and have if anything grown even more reliably Republican. These suburbs are Walker's base. Yes, he's worked hard to win over what swing voters still exist in the state by spending a lot of time in the only real contested area that remains, the Fox River region that includes Green Bay, Oshkosh, and Appleton. But he has won three times (in 2010, the attempted recall in June of 2012, and his re-election last fall) by getting gobsmacking vote tallies in the WOW counties, where some communities break for him at margins above 75 percent and at turnout levels that are among the very highest in the country. (Milwaukee and Madison also turn out at very high numbers for Democrats, relative to cities in other states, but more so in presidential years--a big reason why Walker won three times in his blue-leaning state is that he never had to run on a presidential ballot.) And Walker's base in the WOW counties hasn't just delivered him three election victories. It has encouraged a certain political cast of mind. As a young state legislator representing an inner-suburban district (one that has since grown more Democratic, unlike the WOW counties), Walker occasionally worked across the aisle. But as he rose in the ranks, eventually getting elected executive of Milwaukee County (which includes both the city and its inner suburbs), Walker began playing more and more to the WOW base. Initially, this took the form of his frequent appearances on the local conservative talk-radio shows, which draw loyal audiences in the WOW counties, hold significant sway over Republican politicians in the state, and are characterized by a constant stream of anti-city of Milwaukee rhetoric, some of it racially charged. Even after being elected governor, Walker has kept his close ties to the talk-radio shows, which can be counted on to come to his defense in tough spots or have him on the air whenever he wants to get his message out. Put simply, Walker has risen to power in Wisconsin in something of a conservative bubble, where there is more emphasis on doctrinal consistency and energizing the base than on engaging the opposition. So it should not be surprising that Walker would punt on a question about evolution, as he did recently in England, or that he would see no need to distance himself from Giuliani's comment, unlike other 2016 aspirants from another swing state, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio. In Walker's world, it matters more not to be seen as squishy than to worry about saying something that could ruffle liberal feathers. Heck, ruffling liberal feathers is what wins in the WOW counties and on the shows they listen to. ""If he says something stupid ... he can run to the outlets and they'll take care of it,"" Christopher Terry, a former employee of one of the talk shows told me last year. ""He could eat a child on television and [Milwaukee talk radio] would go on about how it benefits children."" Whereas, Terry added, ""when they get a hold of him and he can't jump in the safety zone, it'll go hard on him."" Which is what is happening now. Walker is no longer just talking to Charlie Sykes on WTMJ or Mark Belling on WISN. He is in the early stages of running for president, and his comments are causing genuine alarm from some of the gatekeepers. The Washington Post editorial page--no friend of public employee unions--devoted its lead editorial last week to admonishing Walker over his ""spineless silence"" at Giuliani's comments last week, and deans of the political press corps, such as Dan Balz and Chuck Todd, have also raised their proverbial eyebrows at Walker. Yes, Walker may have helped himself further with primary voters in Iowa, South Carolina, and elsewhere. But he has also brought renewed focus to the question I raised last year: Is the party that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said needed to broaden its appeal if it wanted to improve on its 2012 performance really going to want to nominate someone whose instincts are attuned above all to the politics of suburban-Milwaukee conservative talk radio? Maybe so--after all, there are those who believe the Republicans could take one more shot at winning the presidency with an overwhelmingly homogenous (i.e., white) base of support and unreformed platform, before doing so becomes simply inconceivable. That is the option that Walker is presenting to his party--something that is becoming clearer for the world to see with every week that he is out there, letting his WOW-county inheritance show."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/marco_rubio_s_foreign_policy_experience_the_florida_senator_can_t_rely_on.html	"A freshman senator says he was right about the foreign policy questions of the day and thinks that makes him qualified to be commander-in-chief. This is the pitch Sen. Barack Obama made in 2008--and Sen. Marco Rubio is making today. Though America has had 44 presidents, those who want to be No. 45 don't define the requirements for the job by the 44 who have come before them; they define the job as one that requires skills that only they have. It's like a Mad Lib:       (best skill)       is what's required for America to thrive in the world. For Rubio, his foreign policy prescience is what makes him fit for the highest office. Like Sen. Obama, Rubio is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He argues that his knowledge about the issues means he won't need on-the-job training. In an interview with Politico, Rubio said that he was right about arming the Syrian rebels, right about being more aggressive in Libya, and right about Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine. When asked about Jeb Bush, who gave a foreign policy speech earlier this week, Rubio said Bush was ""certainly capable"" of learning about foreign policy, placing him squarely in the training-wheels category. Presidents have far more sway over foreign policy than domestic policy, though you'd never know that from the way we talk about it in presidential campaigns. As John Kennedy said, failures in domestic policy can lose you an election. Fail on foreign policy, and it'll get you killed. So it's fortunate for all of us that a candidate as popular and talented as Rubio wants the GOP campaign to turn into a contest to show foreign policy mastery. This focus will inform all of us and smoke out other candidates hoping to loaf by with a lot of vague comments about America's strength and greatness. When it comes to foreign policy decision-making, the debate over the attributes required by the next president is going to be fascinating. Is it values, executive experience, or familiarity with the course material that matters most? Values are a key requirement in the job, but it will be hard to find differences in the value statements of Republican candidates (other than Sen. Rand Paul). It will also be hard to distinguish the GOP calls for strength, peace, human rights, and support for liberty from what Hillary Clinton says. So foreign policy distinctions between candidates will turn on judgment: Who has the stuff to make the right call in the moment? That turns on decision making capability and a knowledge of the terrain. Which is more important? The executive decision-making skill requires being able to sift through alternatives, build coalitions, and make hard judgments where there are stakes in the game. There are no immediate consequences to the stances you take other than political ones when you're a senator. There are a different set of questions you ask as an executive who must put a decision into immediate motion than the questions you ask to shape a piece of legislation. Executives also get practice in the post-decision-making stage where implementation can sometimes flag. Various foreign policy practitioners from Henry Kissinger to Condoleezza Rice to Robert Gates have made the case for governors, arguing that while no one can be prepared for the presidency, the repeated practice a politician gets as governor is the closest approximation to what a president faces. A president can learn about foreign policy (assuming he has the capacity to absorb complex information quickly), but the muscle memory of decision-making is hard to learn while the stakes are so high. This is an attractive idea and is perhaps why in 2008 Hillary Clinton tried so hard to pretend she had executive decision-making experience, when in fact she had none at the time. (Coming to a campaign near you: How much experience has she gained since and in what specific circumstances?) What Rubio would argue is that if you don't understand the underlying issues, you can get trapped by your advisers. If presented with options A and B, a president with experience on the foreign relations and intelligence committees can know that option C isn't being considered or that option C even exists. A decision-making ability between two bad options still leads to disaster. Also, it's one thing to learn something last week; it's another thing to know something in your bones after careful study. Traditionally Republicans have supported executives and candidates with executive experience--Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Mitt Romney. George H.W. Bush and John McCain were knowledge-based candidates, but since they were both veterans and had been on the job for a long time, that knowledge had some experiential ballast. During the Obama years the rhetoric about prior executive experience has increased in Republican ranks. Since Obama first decided to run for the White House as a freshman senator, Republicans have said that his lack of experience disqualified him from the job. They now argue that his foreign policy blunders are proof of that earlier judgment. Rubio has to show voters that he has the authority and command on foreign policy issues that will cause them to project commander-in-chief status on him. It can be done. Obama did it in 2008. But there are two differences. First, Obama made his stand on a more front-and-center issue--the war in Iraq--that made him seem prescient on the types of questions that matter most. Second, he came out against the war when plenty of Democrats--including his top 2008 opponents--had supported it. That allowed Obama to set up a bright contrast with the other candidates that Rubio does not have, even though he is more confident, precise, and knowledgeable about foreign policy than any other GOP candidate. Rubio is also asking voters to make a different bet on him than they did on Barack Obama. In 2008 the country was looking to withdraw from two messy wars. Obama simply needed to clear a low bar of promising not to launch any new adventures. Rubio is promising an engaged and muscular foreign policy. There will be confrontation and moments of tension as he seeks to reassert America's role in the world. That raises the bar he needs to clear."

Kay Hagan. Her loss was due in part to the fact that Hispanic voters made up just about 3 percent of that state's midterm electorate last November. According to some, the fact that so few Hispanics came out for Hagan was due in part to the fact that she, in a seemingly desperate bid to tack to the political center, spoke out against President Obama's plans to take executive action to defer deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants. In Washington, nothing's not about immigration. The activist group Presente Action leveled blistering criticism at four incumbent Democrats in the lead-up to the 2014 midterms, charging that they were insufficiently supportive of policy changes intended to help undocumented immigrants. Arturo Carmona, Presente Action's executive director, announced a month before Election Day in a Real Clear Politics op-ed that his organization was encouraging its members to vote against four Democrats--Hagan, Louisiana's Mary Landrieu, Arkansas' Mark Pryor, and New Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen. Of the four, only Shaheen won her re-election. ""[A]fter a string of broken promises, the Democrats have much work to do to win back the trust of Latino voters before 2016,"" he wrote at the time. ""The Democratic Party is not our friend simply because members of the Republican Party have worked so hard to become our enemy."" On Capitol Hill, immigration issues never say die. And since the Department of Homeland Security will run out of funding on Feb. 27, members of Congress are scrambling to find a way to pay for the organization's budget without alienating their most powerful constituencies. For Republicans, this means looking for a way to use the DHS funding fight to block the implementation of the president's executive action on immigration (the same executive action that proved politically fatal for Hagan last year). ""If the Latino vote had come out strongly for Kay Hagan, she would have won,"" Carmona said. He may be right: Hagan lost her re-election contest by fewer than two percentage points. Republicans' immigration conundrum is painfully obvious. Moderate Republicans allied with business interests and seeking more support from Hispanic voters are in a permanent tug of war with Tea Party-allied members of the House and Senate who adamantly oppose any immigration reform that would give undocumented immigrants a route to U.S. citizenship. Many of these Republicans have also pledged to vote against any legislation that would increase legal immigration levels--which the Hill's Jeb Bush types see as political lunacy. Ultimately, though, moderate Hill Republicans know they'll face dark electoral days if they alienate the immigration-hawk sector of their base. On top of that, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus promised in the lead-up to the midterms that the GOP would ""do everything we can"" to block implementation of the president's executive action. Thus, when Republicans approach the DHS funding immigration issue, there's lots of cringing and word-mincing. But that's not to say the politics of DHS funding are a breeze for Democrats. The political carcasses of Hagan, Pryor, and Landrieu are stark reminders of a new political reality: Progressive activists are using Tea Party-style tactics to keep elected Democrats in line. Carmona told Slate that his organization will keep cracking down on potentially squishy Democrats by any means necessary--even if that means backing primary challengers. ""If Democratic elected officials are opposing or remaining silent or not showing leadership on issues that are important to Latinos, then all options should be open,"" he said, ""including backing primary opposition."" Many outside groups seek to cozy up with one of the two parties, preferring the carrot to the stick as they jockey for influence. Not so with Presente Action. Even in the case of Obama's executive action, Carmona hesitated to give the president too much credit. ""It was an action that Latinos demanded through protests and rallies and years of organizing,"" he said. ""It didn't happen through the good faith of political leaders, but because Latinos demanded it."" Tea Partiers have long used that kind of rhetoric and political strategy to drive moderate Republicans berserk. Any sort of cave from elected Democrats on DHS funding, and they could face their own insurrection boomlets. Clarissa Martinez-De-Castro, deputy vice president at the National Council of La Raza, echoed that sentiment. ""These two programs, the expansion of [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and the new DACA program, are the only lifeline millions of American families have gotten in about two decades,"" she said, referring to programs that defer deportations for some undocumented immigrants. ""People are going to be looking very closely at who's holding the scissors if this lifeline gets cut."""

To Politico's credit, this is a generous summary of Giuliani's remarks, which in reality glowed with aggrievement and disdain. ""I do not believe that the president loves America. He doesn't love you. And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country."" There's no need to litigate this charge; outside of campy political thrillers, no one devotes his or her adult life to national politics--or the presidency, for that matter--without an outsized patriotism and belief in the basic worth of the United States. But if we're feeling generous, we can say that in the course of his rant, Giuliani touched on a real difference between Obama's brand of national exceptionalism and the kind we tend to see from America's presidents. Take his remarks after the initial temper tantrum. ""[W]ith all our flaws we're the most exceptional country in the world. I'm looking for a presidential candidate who can express that, do that, and carry it out,"" said the former New York mayor and onetime presidential candidate. ""What country has left so many young men and women dead abroad to save other countries without taking land? This is not the colonial empire that somehow he has in his hand. I've never felt that from him."" He continued: ""I felt that from [George] W. [Bush]. I felt that from [Bill] Clinton. I felt that from every American president, including ones I disagreed with, including [Jimmy] Carter. I don't feel that from President Obama."" Crude as he is, Giuliani isn't wrong to sense a difference between Obama and his predecessors. Previous presidents have been profuse with their praise of America's perceived exceptionalism. And they've done so without question or reservation. ""More than any other people on Earth,"" declared John F. Kennedy in a 1961 address to the University of Washington, ""we bear burdens and accept risks unprecedented in their size and their duration, not for ourselves alone but for all who wish to be free."" ""Across the world,"" said Ronald Reagan in his 1982 remarks at Kansas State University, ""Americans are bringing light where there was darkness, heat where there was once only cold, and medicines where there was sickness and disease, food where there was hunger, wealth where humanity was living in squalor, and peace where there was only death and bloodshed."" Then, soaring with more outsized rhetoric: ""Yes, we face awesome problems. But we can be proud of the red, white, and blue, and believe in her mission. In a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankind's best hope."" Bill Clinton echoed his predecessors in a 1996 speech defending NATO's intervention in Bosnia. ""The fact is America remains the indispensable nation. There are times when America, and only America, can make a difference between war and peace, between freedom and repression, between hope and fear."" Likewise, throughout his administration, George W. Bush emphasized America's exceptionalism and expressed it in terms of its war against terror and tyranny. ""Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom,"" he said in his second inaugural address. ""In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty."" Barack Obama's view is a little different. Compared with the visions of his predecessors, his is less triumphant and informed by a kind of civic humility. ""I believe in American exceptionalism,"" he told Roger Cohen of the New York Times while still just a candidate, but not one based on ""our military prowess or our economic dominance."" Instead, he said, ""our exceptionalism must be based on our Constitution, our principles, our values, and our ideals. We are at our best when we are speaking in a voice that captures the aspirations of people across the globe."" As president he echoed this during a now-famous (perhaps infamous) 2009 news conference in Strasbourg, France, where he elaborated on his sense of exceptionalism. ""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."" Every nation has a sense of its unique place in the world. Even still, Obama said, there are things especially exceptional to the United States. ""I think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality that, though imperfect, are exceptional."" To be clear, Giuliani wasn't somehow right, and to say he even made a point is to overstate the case. But it is true that Obama stands outside the norm. No, he's not Jeremiah Wright, but he's not Reagan either. The obvious question is, Why? Why is Obama more circumspect than his presidential peers? Why does his praise come with a note of reservation? The best answer, I think, lies in identity. By choice as much as birth, Obama is a black American. And black Americans, more than most, have a complicated relationship with our country. It's our home as much as it's been our oppressor: a place of freedom and opportunity as much as a source of violence and degradation. We're an old American tribe, with deep roots in the land and a strong hand in the labor of the nation. But we're often seen as other--a suspect class that just doesn't fit. As a president from black America, Obama carries this with him, and it comes through in his sometimes less-than-effusive vision of national greatness. He loves this country, but he also tempers his view with a nod toward the uglier parts of our history. This isn't the exceptionalism of the Republican Party or much of the national mainstream, and it can alienate Americans not used to a more critical eye--it's why Mitt Romney chose ""Believe in America"" for his 2012 election slogan. But it is as authentically American as any other. And while Obama is far from a perfect president, I'm at least glad he's here to give it a greater voice."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/department_of_homeland_security_shutdown_why_it_won_t_be_a_threat_to_national.html	"During the October 2013 government shutdown, an American friend of my brother's who works with refugees got an urgent question from a Middle Easterner. ""Is your family safe?"" asked the refugee, who had fled from his home country to Southeast Asia because of violent turmoil. ""I hear your country is being held hostage!"" Any type of government shutdown--even if only of a single agency--has real and significant consequences. But many of the politicians who talk about these consequences use the kind of hysterical rhetoric that suggests a shutdown would result in ISIS setting up a new branch office in El Paso, Texas. We've been hearing a lot of that kind of rhetoric lately, since the Department of Homeland Security will run out of funding on Feb. 27 unless Democrats and Republicans have an unlikely ""Kumbaya"" moment. ""[Republicans] dislike Dreamers more than they dislike ISIS,"" New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer said a few weeks ago, referring, respectively, to the undocumented immigrants who are currently shielded from deportation and the terrorist army beheading Coptic Christians on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. At issue is funding for the president's executive action on immigration, a unilateral move he made last year to defer deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants. Republicans, who are typically divided among themselves on the issue, have come together in opposition to the president's order. They concur that it's an unconstitutional abuse of executive power and that it's a ""poison pill"" for bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Democrats say that kind of legislation wasn't happening anyway (probably a safe guess on their part) and that the president was well within his rights. This fight is incredibly high-stakes for both sides. If Republicans cave and decide to fund the president's executive action, then a substantial portion of their voting base will be irate. Tea Party activists' opposition to pathway-to-citizenship comprehensive immigration reform is comparable to their opposition to the Affordable Care Act, and many of the Republican candidates who won their midterm bids campaigned on opposing the president's then-impending immigration move. If they renege on those promises, things will get very tense very fast back in their home districts. Democrats are in a similar pickle. When the president postponed his immigration move until after the midterm elections (in a largely unsuccessful bid to protect vulnerable Democrats from the political repercussions of his controversial executive action), he won scorching criticism from Hispanic activists and comprehensive immigration reform advocates alike. Hispanic voters are an essential part of the Democratic coalition, and snubbing them in such a public way would be the political equivalent of jumping in front of a cement truck. So here we are: nine days away from a Department of Homeland Security shutdown, with little hope of an easy way out. What does this mean? Does this mean our homeland will no longer be secure? Short answer: The homeland is going to be OK. Specifically, a missed funding deadline means a small fraction of the department's employees would be furloughed. As Alexandra Jaffe notes at CNN, a Congressional Research Service report says that federal employees ""whose work is necessary for the preservation of the safety of human life or the protection of property"" are required to keep working during shutdowns, though in many cases without pay.* So that takes care of a significant chunk of DHS employees: During the October 2013 government shutdown, 85 percent of the department's payroll stayed on the job. That report estimates that a little more than 30,000 employees were furloughed, and Jaffe notes that they were mostly those with managerial and administrative gigs. This potential DHS funding snafu would likely follow a similar course. So your friendly neighborhood TSA agents aren't going anywhere. Neither is the Secret Service (for what that's worth!). Big Brother might take a hit, though. A statement from DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson laying out the effect of the shutdown said that as long as the department is funded by temporary continuing resolutions, it can't issue new grants to help states and municipalities pay for security issues. Current grants pay for a host of projects, including New York City Police Department surveillance cameras and Idaho bomb squads. The department also can't upgrade ""obsolete remote video surveillance systems"" near the Texas-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley. Johnson says his department needs a full-year appropriations bill instead of another short-term fix like last year's CRomnibus (the funding measure that expires at the end of this month and got us into this mess in the first place) so it can keep issuing more of those grants. ""[T]he reality is that a department shutdown would have a very limited impact on national security,"" write Erica Werner and Alicia Caldwell at the AP. It's probably even a bit of a misnomer to call a funding lapse a ""shutdown."" Such a lapse would certainly be tough for the DHS employees who would get furloughed. And that would put substantial pressure on lawmakers to figure out a solution amenable to both parties. But it also wouldn't be the apocalypse. *Correction, Feb. 19, 2015: This article misstated that federal employees ""whose work is necessary for the preservation of the safety of human life or the protection of property"" get their salaries paid outside the appropriations process. These employees aren't necessarily paid by means other than appropriations, and might continue working during a shutdown but see a pay lapse. (Return.)"

And it's this, far more than his resume, that defines his appeal to the top-shelf donors and professionals of the Republican Party. Take away the surname, and Jeb is just another George Pataki or Bob Ehrlich--an out-of-shape politician with the delusional confidence to believe he could be president. But the public seems nervous about a dynastic candidate and a third Bush presidency, and it's to that concern that Jeb is trying to distance himself from the two Georges. If elected president, his Bush administration wouldn't be a sequel, a reboot, or a reimagining of earlier entries. His would be different. He would be his ""own man."" ""I love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make,"" said Bush in a Wednesday speech sponsored by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""But I am my own man--and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences."" Yes, he's a Bush, and yes, he's a Republican, but Jeb Bush wants to assure voters he isn't a Bush Republican. This is impossible. Not because of his name, but because Jeb is a mainstream Republican, and by definition this puts him a stone's throw from his brother's administration. Despite the rancor and division of the last seven years, the truth is that the GOP still sits in the shadow of George W. Bush. Even the Tea Party doesn't escape his influence; its anti-establishment rhetoric and angry denunciations of government obscure the extent to which its supporters--such as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida--promote the basic Bush agenda of broad tax cuts, deficit spending, social conservatism, and an aggressive foreign policy. The largest Tea Party disagreement is around immigration. Conservative anti-immigration anger is a defining fact of the present political environment and it has shoved the Republican mainstream to the right wing of the immigration debate. But beyond this, the difference between the Tea Party and the mainstream is largely affective: Tea Party Republicans drop the ""compassion"" of Bushism for hard-nosed opposition to social spending for the non-elderly and non-poor, and they've elevated intransigence to a high political principle. This isn't insignificant, but it's not the stuff of schisms either. Indeed, the best illustration of the short distance between the then and now of the Republican Party is the Mitt Romney presidential campaign. ""Self-deportation"" aside, little Romney proposed--from tax cuts to greater investment in Iraq and Afghanistan--would have been out-of-sync with the GOP in 2004 or 2006. But this puts Jeb in a bind. If today's mainstream is just a few steps away from the one his brother built, then the fact that he is running for president--and trying to win support from all wings of the Republican Party--means there's no escape from the previous administration. All of this adds a layer of irony to Jeb Bush's Chicago speech, which moves from a statement of identity--""I'm my own man""--to a standard-issue attack on President Obama's foreign policy as timid and unfocused. ""Weakness invites war,"" declared the younger Bush, promising a ""liberty diplomacy"" centered on ""enforcing"" peace and security around the globe. With a little more swagger, it could have come directly from George W. Bush. If this wasn't enough to undermine his claims of independence, there's also the list of Jeb's foreign policy advisers, which doubles as a yearbook for the GOP security establishment. Key officials from both Bush administrations are present, with a heavy roster from the previous decade of Bush policymaking: Michael Hayden (former NSA director), Tom Ridge (former secretary of homeland security), Michael Chertoff (the second secretary of Homeland Security), Porter Goss (former CIA director), Meghan O'Sullivan (former deputy national security adviser on Iraq and Afghanistan), Michael Mukasey (former attorney general), Paul Wolfowitz (former deputy secretary of defense), Stephen Hadley (former national security adviser), and James Baker (chief of staff for Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush). In fairness, you probably shouldn't use this as direct evidence of the next Bush's foreign policy--to the extent they've joined a third Bush campaign (Team Bush III: Bush Hard With a Vengeance), it's because they're the most experienced foreign policy hands in the Republican Party. As the candidate of at least one establishment, it would be shocking if Jeb didn't have support of figures from the last two Republican presidential administrations. Which gets to an important fact of the presidential process. When we say someone is ""running for the nomination,"" what we mean is that he's building consensus for his candidacy. And while it's possible for a powerful, skilled figure to change the terms of that consensus, most candidates simply adapt their platforms and ideas to what the party wants. Anyone who represents the Republican Party in 2016, and thus the Republican mainstream, will end up selling a spin on Bushism. Jeb's unique problem is that he can't elide this with rhetoric. You could say the same of Hillary Clinton vis-a-vis Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. The difference is this: Bill is among the most popular political figures in the country, and--barring disaster--Obama will finish his term more liked than his predecessor. (His approval ratings are on the steady upswing.) At best, this can help Hillary and at worst, it won't mean anything--she'll rise or fall of her own accord. Between his party and his name, Jeb is too tied to his brother. And while some Republicans like the older Bush sibling, the rest of the country isn't too keen."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/inequality_and_american_protest_history_why_are_no_movements_rising_up_against.html	"These days, everyone from Jeb Bush to Barack Obama to Naomi Klein frets about economic inequality. Yet wages continue to stagnate, unions scuffle to survive, the income of CEOs keeps climbing (even for those execs who run their companies into the ground), and anyone who seriously hopes to become president first has to secure the patronage of a billionaire or two. Why do so few Americans seem genuinely outraged? Why is no one taking to the streets? The United States was once home to wave upon wave of organized indignation against corporate ""monopolies"" and their Wall Street enablers. During the heyday of the industrial era, movements that fought to redistribute wealth and power attracted millions of ordinary people. From the late 19th century through the 1940s, they persuaded--or pressured--government officials to regulate big business, establish a minimum wage and unemployment insurance, protect union organizers, and create Social Security. More recently, the black and feminist movements, with help from several presidents and judges, interred the entire corpus of discriminatory laws. But neither did much to challenge an economic order in which those with big money make nearly all the important rules. In a provocative new book, the critic and historian Steve Fraser tries to explain why mass protest on the left has become so scarce in what he aptly calls The Age of Acquiescence.  For Fraser, the main culprits are not such usual suspects as right-wing politicians and the market power of global corporations but public admiration for workaholic entrepreneurs whose self-serving definition of freedom legitimizes their reign. Fraser blames the pervasive image of leading businessmen as ""populist heroes"" for quelling mass outrage about how corporations rule both workplaces and politics. It's difficult to malign a mogul like Steve Jobs, a wonky ""striver from the middling classes"" who invented such lovely, addictive gadgets. And a female CEO like Meg Whitman at eBay or a black American CEO like Stan O'Neal at Merrill Lynch seems to prove that capitalism can be a mighty force for social change. In that same vein, Fraser describes how freedom, which bygone progressive movements and liberal icons like Franklin Roosevelt defined as a collective goal (""freedom from want,"" ""freedom from fear,"" etc.), has now become synonymous with the ""free market"" in which every man and woman supposedly has the same chance to rise or go under. Within this soft tyranny of ideas, billionaires like the brothers Koch can aggressively sponsor candidates who accuse the government of violating their patrons' ""liberty"" to create jobs and cheap energy. In contrast, the old robber barons like J.P. Morgan, Fraser comments, ""worried about being overthrown, not about overthrowing someone else."" This is a perceptive reading of the current zeitgeist, although self-reliance and self-made magnates are hardly new elements of American life. But how working people choose to define themselves is also a major reason why they do not mobilize in great numbers to challenge the economic elite. Spurts of well-publicized activism do occur, of course. Just over three years ago, Occupy Wall Street made headlines with little more than an inventive tactic and a catchy slogan about ""the 99 percent."" Spirited demonstrations by fast-food workers seeking $15 an hour continue, although that meteor may be descending, too. Such protests fade away, in part, because there is no potent image of the aggrieved to sustain them. Young radicals able and eager to camp out for weeks in an urban park were never going to be credible representatives of the American majority. Nor could a mere number like ""the 99 percent"" carry much of an emotional charge. Obama's call for ""middle-class economics,"" a variation on a familiar political theme, aims to restore a certain level of consumption. But the notion of a republic inhabited by happy shoppers cannot inspire a movement with any muscle behind it. Whatever their differences, the agrarian populists and industrial unionists of old were making a moral claim that was impossible to ignore. They considered themselves to be members of the same class of ""producers"" without whose labor the entire society would collapse. They fought to transform an economy run by men who exploited their work into an ethical capitalism that would reward it. During the early years of the Great Depression, labor unions were even weaker than they are now. But they quickly became a power in the land--increasing their membership 500 percent from 1933 to 1945--because they could speak to fellow Americans who loathed the same big businessmen in a shared language of discontent and pride. That helped them defeat the opposition of even an inveterate anti-union employer like Henry Ford, who once had enjoyed a ""populist"" reputation himself. Ford grew up on a farm and, in 1914, doubled the wages earned by most of his male employees. But by the mid-1930s, his refusal to relax his autocratic control over his employees had alienated him from the public at large. Franklin D. Roosevelt and other Democratic leaders echoed the grievances of labor and their fellow ""producers."" In his 1936 acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Roosevelt bashed ""the royalists of the economic order"" who ""denied that the government could do anything to protect the citizen in his right to work and his right to live."" By itself, such rhetoric did not re-elect him by a landslide.  But he spoke to millions of wage-earners of all races and genders in terms they already used and cherished. On occasion, President Obama has tried to repeat the performance. Last Labor Day, he declared, ""If I were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day's pay for an honest day's work, I'd join a union."" Yet hardly anyone outside labor's shrunken ranks paid any attention. Two months later, white workers voted for Republican congressional candidates by a margin of 30 percent. Of course, the old identities were bound to lose their drawing power. Movements led by white heterosexual men had made them popular; new insurgencies led by other kinds of people embraced new identities to topple kinds of injustices that FDR and his allies had mostly ignored and sometimes perpetuated. But we all live in a world where we have to listen when big money talks. To change that into a serious two-way conversation, tens of millions of working Americans will have to find a new way of describing themselves in a nation where every downturn brings fresh evidence that, as Janis Joplin sang, freedom means having nothing left to lose."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/permanent_campaign_the_hunt_for_cash_is_desperate_constant_and_uncouth.html	"A heavy smoker for much of his life, former Kentucky Democratic Sen. Wendell Ford died last month at age 90 after a lengthy battle with lung cancer. Among Ford's many distinctions: He was the longest serving Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman in the organization's history. So it's with some curiosity that on Jan. 29, two days after Ford's funeral, tobacco giant Altria's political action committee donated $15,000 to his beloved but beleaguered DSCC. Nothing suggests the timing of Altria's contribution to the DSCC is anything but coincidental. Altria Group Inc. spokesman David Sutton, who declined to comment on this specific donation, accurately noted that the company's PAC has previously contributed to the DSCC--and a host of other political committees run by Democrats and Republicans alike. The largest seller of tobacco in the United States, Altria has a policy to support politicians who understand the ""legislative and regulatory issues related to Altria's businesses,"" according to its website. Its products include such brands as Marlboro, Parliament, and Black & Mild. Altria's transaction nevertheless stands as an example of how political committees' hunt for financial fuel--and special interests' willingness to provide it--is all but unyielding, even when such activity would have not long ago seemed ill-timed, even uncouth. Today political campaigns no longer wax, then wane: They are effectively permanent and ever-present. Just ask Florida Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch. An outspoken campaign finance reform advocate, Deutch last month challenged his congressional colleagues to join him in abstaining from political fundraising for the month of February. He reasoned that February is the year's shortest month, the next general election is 21 months away, and legislators have better things to do right now than beg for campaign cash--like legislate. Deutch had no takers. ""It shows how deeply ingrained the race for money is in Congress and that there's an ever-increasing focus on money,"" Deutch told the Center for Public Integrity. ""The fundraising is dominating the process."" These days, if political machines don't begin spooling up for the next election immediately after one ends, ""they get in real trouble,"" said Lindsay Mark Lewis, who served as the Democratic National Committee's finance director from 2005 to 2006. ""They're under intense pressure to show in the first few months, ahead of that first [campaign finance] filing of the year, that they're financially viable,"" continued Lewis, now executive director for the Progressive Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington. ""That just didn't happen 20 years ago."" Since 2015 began, the DSCC, which exists to elect Democrats to the U.S. Senate, has indeed been on a fundraising tear, gobbling up dollars from whomever it can in a bid to compete with its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Senatorial Committee. It's very relevancy is at stake: The DSCC ended 2014 having lost a Senate majority and awash in red ink, reporting nearly $21.4 million in debt versus less than $1 million cash on hand, federal records show. The NRSC also ended last year with a deficit, albeit a significantly smaller one, reporting $10 million in debt against $2.7 million cash on hand. As part of its strategy for generating income ahead of the 2016 elections, the DSCC has conducted a series of in-person fundraisers early this year. It includes one co-hosted this month by lobbyist Jake Perry, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Atop his laundry list of lobbying clients is Altria. Lobbyist Heather Podesta co-hosted a big-dollar affair for the DSCC at her Washington office this month as well, according to an invitation obtained by the Sunlight Foundation. Podesta's firm represents more than three-dozen clients, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. They range from upstarts Snapchat and Fitbit to old-line energy companies Marathon Oil and Oxbow Carbon--the latter oil firm being led by William Koch, the lesser-known brother of Charles and David Koch, two of the Republican Party's wealthiest backers. William Koch, both personally and through his companies, primarily contributes to conservative political interests, but has also supported some liberal ones. The DSCC has also blasted supporters with incessant fundraising emails, as has become the norm for most political committees. Vice President Joe Biden attempted to gin up dollars by lamenting how the ""GOP has already gone after Social Security, a woman's right to choose and President Obama's immigration plan."" Montana Sen. Jon Tester, the DSCC's current chairman, sent a sobering appeal evoking the Koch brothers and touting a ""ground-up Democratic electoral movement."" Even Jon Stewart unwittingly factored into a DSCC solicitation after he announced he'd be quitting The Daily Show. ""Are you a huge Jon Stewart fan?"" a message from the DSCC read. ""Then sign our card and thank him for 16 incredible years. Let's get 100,000 fans in the next 24 hours!"" When one ""signs"" the card--an email address and ZIP code is all that's required--a DSCC donation page immediately appears. While the DSCC may crave your money, it isn't much interested in talking about it: Officials did not respond to numerous inquiries requesting comment.

Stand for what we have done, acknowledge what we have done, and be judged on what we have done. ... Some say that would amount to a third term of the president. I call it sticking with what works and what we oughta do."" A third Obama term. The vice president isn't the only one who feels this way. This, of course, is what Republicans have been saying Hillary Clinton's presidency would be for months. Biden didn't introduce this idea, but it's one thing for Republicans to say it, it's another thing for the vice president to bolt it onto the eventual Democratic nominee. When I heard it, I was fresh from having read David Axelrod's book Believer about his life in politics from his first political rally at age 5 to the celebration of Obama's re-election in Chicago on election night in 2012. In the book, he recounts the details of the 2008 campaign, when Obama repeatedly said he didn't want to give ""John McCain the chance to serve out George Bush's third term."" This is a standard attack. Indeed, Democrats are raising money today playing on the idea that Jeb Bush is a third George W. Bush term. The big obvious difference in 2016 is that Obama is much more popular right now than George Bush was at the end of his presidency. Bush's approval rating was 28 percent in the 2008 election night exit poll. Right now Barack Obama's approval rating is 47 percent in the Gallup poll, almost 20 points higher. If the economy continues to improve, that number could climb higher still and you could imagine Hillary Clinton saying, If by third term you mean another 59 months of continuous job growth and falling unemployment, then yes I'll be a third term. But what Axelrod's book highlights is the way in which this kind of attack presents challenges that go well beyond mere association. In the 2008 campaign, the Bush's ""third term"" charge was a way to highlight the contrast between the old and the new. McCain was a part of the Washington system, Obama was from outside that system. The attack created an appetite for the new, the flavor that Obama happened to be selling. Hillary Clinton may be a strong candidate, but she will never be able to pull off new. Axelrod writes about a crucial lesson he learned from working on so many mayoral races. Voters want a ""remedy, not [a] replica"" in the next candidate, even when the incumbent leaving office is well-liked. He says this rule--which he learned most directly in the 1989 race for the mayor of Cleveland where Michael White, the Democrat, followed the popular incumbent Republican George Voinovich--applies to presidential campaigns, too. He wrote to Sen. Obama in 2008: ""When incumbents step down, voters rarely opt for a replica of what they have, even when that outgoing leader is popular. They almost always choose change over the status quo."" This is a different formulation of what President Obama was talking about recently when he said voters wanted ""that new car smell."" Clinton is associated with the status quo even more because she has the Obama years and the Clinton years attached to her. Given this view, simple distinctions between Obama and Clinton on policy or positioning won't be enough to break the third-term lock. It will be very hard for Clinton to offer herself as a remedy because there is nothing that makes her so constitutionally different from Obama that voters will notice. She is probably, for example, a better deal-maker and would work harder at connecting with Republicans, but that's hardly a vast distinction that makes voter sit up. Gender is an obvious distinction, but that's not the basis for a presidential platform. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Clinton is working so hard to come up with a message that is so unique and powerful it looks new. Amy Chozick of the New York Times reports that Clinton has consulted more than 200 experts in her effort to craft an economic message. She's not just trying to come up with a policy that creates distance, but one that achieves escape velocity. Were Clinton actually campaigning right now, she'd probably have had to spend the day answering questions about where she stands relative to President Obama. Is she a third term or not? Perhaps she would ace that test, but this charge is also a trap to make Clinton bungle into the most damaging caricature of her--that she is excessively political. If the public doesn't think there's any big difference between what she's offering and what President Obama would offer in a third term, Clinton's efforts will look like Third Term Monte, a sleight of hand confidence game."

The agency charged with safeguarding the integrity of American democracy has, in recent years, been hit again and again by other branches of the federal government further flooding the political system with money from a small coterie of ultrawealthy donors. There was the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling in 2010, which made it possible for corporations, unions, and nonprofit groups to spend directly on elections. There was the McCutcheon v. FEC ruling last year, which, while keeping in place caps on how much an individual could give directly to a candidate or political committee, eliminated the aggregate limits on how much he could give combined. And just two months ago, Congress slipped into the big must-pass spending bill a further expansion of the sums a wealthy donor could give to party committees. The FEC hasn't exactly helped matters, either. In the final years of George W. Bush's administration, in 2007, it issued a rule that greatly weakened the requirements for nonprofit groups airing political ""issue ads"" to disclose their donors. More recently, the agency, despite the best efforts of Chairwoman Ann Ravel, a Democrat, has been conspicuously weak in enforcing its remaining rules on donor disclosure, laundered campaign contributions, and improper coordination between outside groups and candidates--the result of a worse-than-ever partisan deadlock between its three Democratic appointees and its three Republican ones, who have repeatedly resisted serious enforcement actions. All in all, the agency is looking about as effective at holding the line as a middle-school hall monitor at a Roman bacchanal. Yet it is a government agency, which means there's something it still knows how to do: hold hearings. And on Wednesday, it threw open its doors in downtown Washington for a real doozy, a daylong open-mic session asking the public how it could improve its campaign finance regulations in light of the recent court and congressional actions. There was an almost post-apocalyptic feel to the proceeding: Effectively, the agency was admitting that the village had been all but burned to the ground, and it was looking for any last-ditch tips on how to rebuild. For context, this is what the scorched landscape of campaign finance regulation now looks like, as compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University: Since Citizens United, there has been almost $2 billion in spending on federal elections by so-called super PACs--501(c)(4) nonprofits and other outside groups that can raise unlimited funds. More than a third of that can be traced to a mere 209 individual donors. (In 2014, the top 100 publicly disclosed donors gave almost as much as all 4.7 million people who gave $200 or less.) Roughly another third of the $2 billion total has come from completely dark sources--501(c)(4)s and other groups who do not need to disclose their donors. And the outside spending was funneled heavily toward the most competitive races--last year, for example, nearly 90 percent of outside spending on Senate races flowed toward the 11 hardest-fought races, where it often exceeded both regular candidate and party spending. In Kentucky, for example, a secretive organization called the ""Kentucky Opportunity Coalition"" sprang up to spend more than $7 million--with none of its sources disclosed--in support of Sen. Mitch McConnell, making it the race's biggest spender aside from the two candidates. In North Carolina, total spending topped $110 million, two-thirds of it from outside groups. ""The messaging and ads were so relentless and so similar, that it was impossible to separate one PAC or super PAC from another,"" said Glenn Conway, a North Carolina resident who came to testify at the hearing. ""It would seem that they were all coordinated together, or produced using a common theme. If there was any real independence between any of them, it was impossible to distinguish. The whole thing was sickening."" The campaign finance reform advocates at the hearing largely agreed on what was needed now. The commission, they said, ought to require big-spending outside groups to disclose the source of contributions above a certain threshold. It ought to clamp down on donors who get around limits on donations to individual candidates by ""earmarking,"" funneling money to party committees and outside groups so that it will get to the candidate. Such reforms, the advocates said, would be fully in line with the guidance offered by the Supreme Court majority in Citizens United and McCutcheon, which even as it struck down limits, said that better disclosure and tracking of spending could mitigate the risk of corruption. And the commission ought to crack down on the blatantly illegal coordination between candidates and super PACs raising unlimited funds to back him or her--they're supposed to be completely separate, but these days candidates hold fundraisers for their own super PACs (which are typically run by the candidates' former aides), share the same consulting firms, and personally court or even swan around with their biggest super PAC donors, as happened in 2012 with megadonors like Sheldon Adelson and Foster Friess. ""Unenforced campaign finance rules in our view are, in some respects, worse than no rules at all,"" said Daniel Weiner, of the Brennan Center. ""They breed contempt for the law and foster a system weighted in favor of insiders and special interests who know how to play the game."" Opponents of new regulations scoffed at these suggestions. Greater disclosure, said James Bopp Jr., who initially represented the plaintiffs in Citizens United, would only expose donors to public harassment and intimidation, as occurred with donors to the anti-marriage-equality cause in California. (Indeed, marriage-equality supporters did campaign finance disclosure no favors by hounding Brendan Eich out of his job.) Bopp and several others at the hearing went so far as to compare conservative donors threatened by disclosure to supporters of the NAACP in the Jim Crow South. Opponents also argued that the court had left it to Congress, not the FEC, to come up with reforms to address problems created by its recent rulings. ""Congress has not chosen to put in that limit, and you can't do it,"" said Hans von Spakovsky, a former commission member (and leading supporter of Voter ID laws), in a taunting tone.* Indeed, stalemated Congress has not acted--in 2010, the House passed legislation requiring greater disclosure of outside spending, but Sen. Mitch McConnell led a Senate filibuster to block it. Campaign finance reform supporters fired back that it was ""absurd"" to suggest that the FEC had no authority to address problems amidst congressional inaction. But it was left to Zephyr Teachout, the Fordham law professor and campaign finance reform champion who challenged New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in last year's Democratic primary to state the obvious, which was that even if the FEC did have the institutional prerogative to issue and enforce regulations, it currently lacked the willpower to do so, given its 3-3 deadlock. ""We know that the structure of the FEC is such that it is next to impossible for it to operate as it should,"" she said, ""and we should take the opportunity more publicly to talk about fixing the structure of the FEC itself."" This could be done either by adding a member to the commission so that it was no longer split evenly between parties but controlled by the party in the White House, as is done with, say, the National Labor Relations Board, or by turning it over to a single director, as is done with the FBI. Such structural reforms are nowhere in the offing, and meanwhile, the big-money beat goes on. Late last month, the Koch brothers announced that their network of conservative donors was budgeting about $900 million for the 2016 election cycle--almost none of it disclosed. And on Wednesday night, Jeb Bush is headlining a fundraiser in New York at a whopping entrance price of $100,000 per person--not to raise money for his campaign, which he has yet to officially launch, but for the super PAC created to support him. ""We are to believe with a straight face that this organization is completely independent of Gov. Bush,"" said Stephen Spaulding, of Common Cause. ""No Americans would believe that to be the case."" But Dan Backer of the Conservative Action Fund defended the arrangement. ""Gov. Bush is not a candidate for a federal office at the moment,"" he said. ""Maybe he should be and maybe he should be considered to be, but the law is what the law says that it is. Gov. Bush is not running for anything ... To say there is some sort of shameful activity going on when people comply with the law, I think is part of the problem here."" Or, less charitably, as the founder of this magazine once said, ""The scandal isn't the illegal behavior--the scandal is what's legal."" *Correction, Feb. 12, 2015: This article originally misspelled the last name of former FEC commissioner Hans von Spakovsky.

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/jon_stewart_stepping_down_from_the_daily_show_he_was_bad_for_liberals.html	"Seventeen years ago, The Daily Show was a forgettable late-night lark on a little-watched cable channel. Today, after covering seven elections and countless scandals, controversies, and local quirks, the show Jon Stewart built is an institution of American television and an incubator of comedic talent. In addition to making Stewart an international icon, the show has helped launch careers for a roster of former writers and correspondents, including Steve Carell (now up for an Academy Award for Foxcatcher), Stephen Colbert (soon-to-be host of the Late Show), John Oliver (now on HBO), and Larry Wilmore (who has his own Comedy Central show). All things must end, however, and on Tuesday, Stewart announced his retirement from The Daily Show. To the gaggle of American liberals who watch Stewart and thrive on his comedy, this is a terrible blow, since for them he's a sparkling island of sanity in a polluted ocean of inane shouting and dishonest personalities. I grew up with The Daily Show. It hit its stride during the 2004 election--my last full year in high school--and was critical viewing when Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination and then the presidency, my last full year in college. I attended Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in 2010 and have watched the show on a semi-regular basis for almost a decade. And as a liberal, college-educated millennial--the almost prototypical viewer for The Daily Show--I'm thrilled Stewart is leaving. I'm not saying this because Stewart has given his time or deserves to try something new. I'm saying this because Jon Stewart, with his brand of left-leaning cynicism (sprinkled with occasional earnestness), is a bad example for the liberals who watch and love him. The emblematic Stewart posture isn't a joke or a witticism, it's a sneer--or if we're feeling kind, a gentle barb--coupled with a protest: I'm just a comedian. Sometimes, this is refreshing. Of everything Stewart can be proud of in his professional career, special attention goes to his appearance on an Oct. 15, 2004, episode of CNN's Crossfire, then-hosted by Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson. In his now famous rant, Stewart goes after the two hosts--and cable news writ large--as bad for the country. ""Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America. ... Right now, you're helping the politicians and the corporations. And we're left out there to mow our lawns,"" he said. More often however, Stewart's stance is frustrating. His protests to the contrary, Stewart is a pundit, and like many pundits, he's wed to a kind of anti-politics, where genuine difference doesn't exist (or isn't as relevant as we think) and political problem-solving is mostly a matter of will, knowledge, and technocratic know-how. Take his Crossfire appearance. Lurking in his media criticism was a larger idea about the pointlessness of ideological combat. ""To do a debate would be great,"" he said, responding to protests from the hosts. ""But that's like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition."" In the context of Begala and Carlson, this was a fair point. But in the larger world, it's off. No, you're not going to find sophisticated arguments on cable news, and to the extent that places like CNN are vehicles for nonsense and quasi-dadaist performance art, Stewart is right to mock and ridicule. Cable, however, isn't the only forum for debate, and most political conversations aren't as shallow as the ones you see on TV. On op-ed pages and around dinner tables, Americans have substantive conversations about politics. And while the facts aren't always right, the discussion is often valuable. Stewart gives short shrift to that kind of talk. Instead, in the world of The Daily Show, the only politics is cable politics, where venality rules, serious disputes are obscured, and cynicism is the only response that works. Not only does this discourage people who want to make a difference--like the earnest young viewers of Stewart's audience--but it blurs the picture and makes it hard to see when those arguments really matter. It's how we get the spectacle of Stewart's rally, when tens of thousands of liberals gathered on the National Mall in Washington to hear an ode to civility--with an extended metaphor about the Lincoln Tunnel--as if Washington gridlock were a case of bad manners and not deep-seated ideological differences about government and its place in the world. Again, there are times when this basic perspective is vital, when we need someone to bathe our government in light and mockery and challenge the dishonesty, incompetence, and self-seriousness of our leaders and elites. But this approach, which worked wonders during the Bush administration, isn't always the best one. For liberals in particular, the idea that government is only hypocrisy and dysfunction is self-defeating and nihilistic. The natural response to all of this is a version of Stewart's protest--He's just a comedian--and a refrain from The Dark Knight: Why so serious? The answer is easy: He's influential. And for a generation of young liberals, his chief influence has been to make outrage, cynicism, and condescension the language of the left. As a comedian and talk show host, Jon Stewart has been pretty funny. But as a pundit and player in our politics, he's been a problem. And while I wish him luck in his next move, I'm glad he's stepping from the stage. Read more in Slate about Jon Stewart."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/bob_packwood_and_bill_bradley_testify_on_tax_reform_the_former_senators.html	"It has come to this: to inspire Washington to take on what everyone agrees is one of the most pressing issues of our time--tax reform--Senate Republicans scheduled Bob Packwood for a pep talk. Wait, that Bob Packwood? Yes, that one: the moderate Republican from Oregon who was forced to resign from the Senate in 1995 amid allegations from more than a dozen women, mostly lobbyists and former staffers, that he'd made unwanted advances on them. (""He swooped down out of the blue, usually embracing a woman under the fluorescent lights of an inner office,"" reported the New York Times Magazine. "" 'I have no idea,' one alleged victim says, 'why this man thinks women are going to suddenly rip their clothes off.' "") After leaving the Senate, Packwood settled into life as a health care lobbyist--as of last year, he was still pulling down $240,000 per year from his main client, a Medicaid HMO.* And there he was on Tuesday, quite spry at 82, appearing before the Senate Finance Committee, to talk about the last time that Congress managed a comprehensive tax overhaul, the Tax Reform Act of 1986. His mission: to rally members of the panel he had led at the time to take on the challenge once again. It was a rather surreal reminder that the clubbiness of the Senate apparently knows no bounds. Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican, had many warm words for Packwood, calling him a ""really great former leader"" and a ""great human being."" (It's a bipartisan tendency: Just last September, Vice President Joe Biden, Packwood's former Senate colleague, sang his praises at a women's conference.) At one point in his testimony, Packwood fondly referred to the Senate as a ""small fraternity,"" an all-too-apt comparison given the nature of the allegations that had drummed him out of it. But this jarring coziness was not the only impression left by Packwood's return to the hallowed halls. Far from stirring the Senate's resolve to tackle comprehensive tax reform, the hearing served only as further evidence of why progress on this issue is so unlikely. Over and over, Packwood and the witness called as his counterpart by the Democrats on the committee, former New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Bill Bradley, offered reminders of how utterly different the landscape in Congress is now than it was when they came together on the 1986 overhaul. Yes, some of those changes are welcome--for one thing, it would be far more difficult for someone like Packwood to get away for years with such predatory behavior. But Packwood also points to another, less salutary shift on the Hill: There are precious few Republicans left who share his moderate brand of politics. It was striking to hear him at the hearing speaking in positive terms about the 1986 reform's emphasis on maintaining the progressivity of the tax code, by raising the tax rate on capital gains so that it would be equal with the new top rate for regular income, which was lowered from 34 to 28 percent. ""We wanted to keep the same progressivity,"" Packwood said. And again: ""It was to make sure our progressivity was the same."" He repeatedly cited the leading role played in the negotiations by then-Treasury Secretary Jim Baker's deputy, Richard Darman--who just a few years later would be savaged by conservatives for agreeing to a tax hike as a member of President George H.W. Bush's administration. At several points, Packwood lamented that to pass the final package, he had to make an ""odious deal with the oilies""--senators from oil states--a complaint that one would never hear coming from Republicans today. And he openly acknowledged that many of the tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations that the package eliminated were hard to justify. ""Democrats wanted to get rid of unjustifiable deductions, and Republicans were OK with that as long as you could lower the rates,"" he said. ""You had willingness on both sides to reach the same conclusion."" Nothing remotely close to such symbiosis exists today. Republicans say they will engage only in tax reform that is revenue neutral, if not revenue-reducing; most Democrats are adamant that reform would need to bring in additional revenues to address rising costs like baby-boomer Medicare. Republicans say any reform should include both corporate and individual tax rates; Democrats say the focus should be on corporate tax reform alone. Potential game-changing proposals, such as using a carbon tax or gasoline tax increase to lower the payroll tax, have been shot down--just recently, the new House Ways and Means Chairman, Rep. Paul Ryan, rejected out of hand a gas tax hike. The differences were on stark display once it came time for the senators to question Packwood and Bradley. Hatch opened by noting that tax revenues, as a share of the economy, are now a jot higher than their 50-year average, which, he said, argued against revenue-raising tax reform. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who sat with his eyes closed for much of the testimony, roused himself to make the point about reform needing to include both corporate and individual rates. Virtually all the Republican senators who spoke blamed President Obama for not being as committed to tax reform as President Ronald Reagan had been in 1986--never mind that it was House Speaker John Boehner who scoffed at the detailed and well-received reform plan released last year by his fellow Republican, then-House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp. ""Blah, blah, blah,"" Boehner said when pressed about Camp's proposals. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a longtime tax reform enthusiast, tried to make encouraging noises, but his fellow Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson, of Florida, was doubtful. ""President Reagan was pivotal at tamping down opposition among Republicans in the House,"" Nelson said to Packwood. ""How are you going to get President Obama to tamp down that opposition today, with the knee-jerk reaction among Republicans to just the word 'tax'? It's hard for me to make the transition from your era to today."" Packwood admitted as much. ""In our era, there was much more nonpartisanship in the Senate than today,"" he said. ""If the Republican position is, 'no bill if there are revenue increases' and the Democratic position is 'no bill unless there are revenue increases,' then you might as well spend time on ... something else."" A moment later, Bradley echoed him: ""If you can't bridge that gap, spend your time doing something else."" So why bother? One subset of the committee seemed to have decided as much going into the hearing. It was hard to miss that neither of the women on the panel, Sens. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan or Maria Cantwell of Washington, asked Packwood a single question. Though that may well have been their way of signifying what they made of his return to this ""small fraternity."" *Correction, Feb. 11, 2015: This article originally misstated how much Packwood earned from his main lobbying client last year.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/suboxone_could_help_heroin_addicts.html	"While the media was consumed last week with the debate over childhood vaccinations, the Obama administration, spurred on by a stunning investigation by the Huffington Post, quietly took an important step in another realm where medical science has been doing battle with ingrained superstition: heroin addiction. The public health consequences here are just as big, if not more so. Alas, unlike with vaccines, where holdouts like Sen. Rand Paul are becoming increasingly isolated, the reality-grounded side here has further to go in overcoming the flat-Earthers--and thousands of Americans are paying with their lives. The policy question here has to do with a medication, buprenorphine, that has been shown to be highly effective in treating addiction to heroin and prescription painkillers. The medication, which goes by ""bupe"" for short and is sold under the trade name Suboxone, is similar to methadone in that it eliminates an opiate addict's cravings for heroin or pain pills, giving him or her the opportunity to regain a sense of normalcy and carry on with life without seeking a dangerous high. But Suboxone differs from methadone in that it is more difficult to abuse for its own high, and can therefore be prescribed to be taken at home--it is taken orally in the form of a small hexagonal tab--rather than having to be taken at a clinic like methadone, with all the stigma and inconvenience that comes with doing so. While it of course does not work for everyone, the drug's overall effectiveness and relative safety is why the Food and Drug Administration approved it for use in 2002, and why addiction researchers now regard it as an immensely valuable tool in the fight against opiate addiction. You would think that this would have made the medication as common as Nicorette gum in a country that is facing a debilitating surge in heroin addiction, as more and more Americans hooked on prescription painkillers--including many of middle-class and suburban backgrounds--turn to the drug for a cheaper and more accessible high. In 2012, 265,000 more people reported using heroin in the previous 12 months than had reported doing so a decade earlier. And in a study released last fall, the Centers for Disease Control found that heroin deaths doubled in just two years, between 2010 and 2012, in the 28 states that the study focused on. Between 2012 and 2013, the CDC reports that heroin-related overdoses jumped 39 percent nationwide, to a total of 8,257--not all that far behind the tally of firearms homicides that year, 11,208. Despite this burgeoning crisis, Suboxone treatment is awfully hard to come by. Part of the problem, as I described in an article in 2005, is that federal authorities imposed restrictions on the drug even as they approved it for use, requiring doctors to jump through cumbersome hoops to be allowed to prescribe it and capping the number of patients any one doctor can prescribe it to. Those restrictions have since been loosened somewhat, but as the Washington Post recently reported, they are still limiting access, as are the reluctance of many physicians to accept opiate addicts as patients, the cost of the drug, and restrictions that some state Medicaid programs and private insurers have on covering it. The lingering wariness of Suboxone in some medical and official circles has not been helped by articles in the press that have overstated the medication's risk and overhyped the tendency of it to be sold on the black market--a natural outcome with a drug that makes opiate addicts feel better but is hard to come by through legal channels. (Making official suspicion of Suboxone all the more confounding is that local and state governments have been increasingly eager to propagate another medication to combat the heroin scourge--naloxone, trade name Narcan, which is used to reverse overdoses when they occur.) Late last month, though, came an entirely new explanation for Suboxone's limited reach in many heroin-wracked parts of the country. Following a year-long investigation, Huffington Post released a powerful multimedia package, edited by Ryan Grim and centered on a 20,000-word article by reporter Jason Cherkis that described a whole other source of resistance to the medication: the drug-treatment industry's self-interested bias against a medical approach to treating opiate addiction. Cherkis focuses on Kentucky, where, despite an especially large spike in heroin deaths, the main publicly funded network of treatment programs remains insistently--and infuriatingly--wedded to an abstinence-based, 12-step approach to addiction recovery, despite the programs' high drop-out and failure rates and the heaps of research showing that heroin dependence is so difficult to overcome that many addicts have far better prospects if they taper off the drug for months or years using a ""maintenance"" medication like methadone or Suboxone. Kentucky, reports Cherkis, ""has approached Suboxone in such a shuffling and half-hearted way that in 2013, just 62 or so opiate addicts treated in all of the state's taxpayer-funded facilities were able to obtain the medication that doctors say is the surest way to save their lives. Last year, the number fell to 38, as overdose deaths continued to soar."" Cherkis introduces readers to one after another set of parents mourning children in their 20s who dutifully went through medication-free 12-step programs, only to relapse and fatally overdose soon after their release (a time when addicts are particularly vulnerable to overdosing, because their tolerance has decreased during detox). And he introduces us to one after another anti-science obstructionist in the local treatment industry and judicial system, where judges insist that addicts can only avoid jail time for a stay in treatment if they avoid Suboxone. There is the intake supervisor for one treatment center who, when asked if Suboxone might've saved a former client who fatally relapsed, shrugged and responded: ""Could have. But it's not sobriety. It's being alive. But you're not clean and sober."" There is the state senator in northern Kentucky--which is being hit particularly hard by the heroin wave--who compares using Suboxone to being ""in bondage."" And there is the judge who oversees Kenton County's drug court, who won't allow Suboxone for defendants' treatment plans. When presented with the data that shows how risky it is to detox without medication, he says, ""I'm not an expert on what works and what doesn't work."" A sign was recently posted outside a Kenton County courtroom addressed to all ""Suboxin users,"" warning that ""IF YOU WANT PROBATION OR DIVERSION AND YOUR ON SUBOXIN, YOU MUST BE WEENED OFF BY THE TIME OF YOUR SENTENCING DATE."" (The only thing as glaringly poor as the court's grasp of science, apparently, is its spelling.) You'd think that penny-pinching state and local governments would see the constant cycling of addicts through ineffective programs run partly on public dollars as a classic case of waste and unaccountability. ""It's a service that rewards the failure of the service,"" Dr. Bankole Johnson, the chairman of the University of Maryland School of Medicine's psychiatry department, tells Cherkis. ""If you are going to a program, you don't succeed and you pay X-thousand dollars. When you fail, you go back--another X-thousand dollars. Because it's your fault."" Instead, Cherkis reports that political pressure is pushing the other way--elected judges are worried about being seen as approving opiate maintenance medication for addicts. The picture is not entirely bleak, Cherkis reports. The top drug-addiction officials in Kentucky are speaking up for Suboxone, and a few major treatment centers elsewhere in the country, such as Hazelden in Minnesota and Phoenix House in New York, have incorporated Suboxone, with positive results. And now, Cherkis' piece may force some progress of its own: Last week, the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy announced that it would forbid drug courts that receive federal funding, as some in Kentucky do, from barring defendants from going on Suboxone. The office's interim director, Michael Botticelli, even tweeted a link to Cherkis' article, with the endorsement: There is much more the federal government could do to overcome resistance to a drug that offers to do so much good. It could use the leverage of federal funding for publicly supported treatment programs to get them to accept Suboxone treatment, just as it is now applying its leverage against drug courts. It could work to further loosen the restrictions on prescribing Suboxone, since it won't do addicts any good if drug courts become more open to the medication, but they can't actually find it. It could pressure the dozen or so states that have strict time limits on Suboxone in their Medicaid programs to loosen them so that addicts aren't prematurely cut off from the medication, with fatal results. And of course it must keep cajoling Republican-led states to accept Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and thereby make tens of thousands of opiate addicts newly eligible for coverage for Suboxone treatment. But the pressing need for such steps is now more visible to all because of Cherkis's reporting. In a just world, it will win the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service."

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/saving_ukraine_and_stopping_vladimir_putin_the_west_needs_a_long_term_strategy.html	"In an ordinary year, not all that much happens at the annual Munich security conference. NATO defense ministers murmur earnest platitudes. Experts furrow their brows. But this is not an ordinary year. This year, the normally staid audience laughed out loud at the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who seemed, at one point, to question the legality of German unification. Some of the room also applauded loudly when Angela Merkel, the German chancellor--just back from an apparently fruitless peace mission to Moscow--restated her view that ""there is no military solution"" to the conflict in Ukraine. But when Malcolm Rifkind, the former British foreign secretary, asked her how she would stop Russia without military force, another part of the audience applauded. Even watching online, the conundrum in the room was clear: Everyone agrees that the Russians were lying, and no one believes Russian promises of a cease-fire. But nobody agrees on what to do about it. Clearly, the real debate about Ukraine and Russia has yet to begin, by which I don't just mean the ""should we arm Ukraine?"" debate. This is an appealing discussion, not least because it appears to pit the United States (Mars) against Europe (Venus). But fundamentally, it's a red herring. The armaments debate is an argument about short-term tactics, not long-term strategy--and it ignores the real nature of the Russian game. Before last year, eastern Ukraine had no history of ethnic conflict. Well-armed ""separatists"" emerged on the scene only when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered them there. The ""civil war"" that ensued is an artificial conflict, run by Russian security and enhanced by a sophisticated pan-European disinformation campaign. It will last as long as the Russians want it to last. Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, has told the Wall Street Journal that the Russians have deployed their most modern air defense and electronic warfare systems, weapons ""way above and beyond"" anything a rebel army could deploy. The point of the war is not to achieve a victory. The point is to prevent the emergence of anything resembling a prosperous, European Ukraine, because such a state would pose an ideological threat to Putinism. Following this logic, even a German-brokered cease-fire will not bring ""peace,"" but rather a so-called frozen conflict, following an old KGB design: Transnistria in Moldova, South Ossetia in Georgia, now Novorossiya in Ukraine. Once it is up and running, Russia can set up a new secret police service in Novorossiya, create new bases for the Russian army, perhaps train terrorist squads there. Mysterious bombs have already exploded in Kiev and Kharkiv. In December, six bombs went off in Odessa alone. This can all happen very quickly, within days or weeks, which is why the argument about ""arming Ukraine"" is almost beside the point. Yes, over time, the Ukrainian army could be reinforced: That might keep the borders of the new Russian puppet state from expanding further. But even the United States can't deliver weapons fast enough to push the most sophisticated Russian weaponry out of Ukraine anytime soon. Short of sending the 82nd Airborne division into Donetsk, it's hard to see how even the most high-tech U.S. aid can prevent the establishment of Novorossiya, since in practice it already exists. What the West needs now is not merely a military policy but a comprehensive, long-term strategy designed to reinforce Ukrainian statehood and integrate Ukraine into Europe over many years. We could begin training not only the Ukrainian military but also the security services, which were devastated by the previous Ukrainian president. We could push far more forcefully for economic reform and support it with real financial commitments. We could treat this as a very long-term project, as Merkel suggested on Saturday, build a Berlin Wall around Donetsk in the form of a demilitarized zone and treat the rest of Ukraine like West Germany. We could recognize the real danger Russia poses to Europe, not only as a source of violence but also as a source of political and economic corruption. We could impose much harsher, much deeper sanctions. We could cut Russia out of the international payments system. We could enforce our own laws and stop turning a blind eye to Russian money laundering, most of which takes place in European capitals. The city of London and the gnomes of Zurich might pay a price for the loss of Russian clients. But that price will still be far lower than the potential costs of doing nothing. For what is the alternative? Ukraine collapses, and Putin is emboldened, as he was after his invasion of Georgia in 2008. He begins planning the next ""frozen conflict."" If he does so in a NATO state, perhaps Lithuania or Estonia, a much wider and even more damaging European conflict would follow. We don't want a new Cold War--but even that would be preferable to a new World War. And if we don't come up with a serious strategy to prevent one, that's what we'll get."

But this week our lives intersected in a funny way. On Wednesday, Bush addressed the Detroit Economic Club, in what many saw as a coming-out party for his nascent presidential campaign. In the wind-up to the speech, Dana Bash and Jeremy Diamond of CNN reported that Bush would offer up something called ""reform conservatism,"" which they described as similar to the ""compassionate conservatism"" of his older brother, George W. Bush. For reasons that will soon become clear, the comparison made me wince a bit. I couldn't exactly blame Bash and Diamond for not being fully up to speed on reform conservatism, as the term is used almost exclusively by a handful of nerds. But if Jeb Bush is serious about running as a reform conservative, and if other would-be reformers, like Marco Rubio, also throw their hats into the ring, that will soon change. Bash and Diamond aren't the first journalists to cotton onto the existence of reform conservatism. On Tuesday, Bob Davis of the Wall Street Journal reported on the young ""reformicons""--a term that brings to mind a hitherto unknown faction of Transformers--challenging the GOP establishment. (For the record, most reform conservatives favor ""reformocons"" over ""reformicons,"" so I'll use that spelling from here on out.) According to Davis, the really distinctive thing about the reformocons is that they prefer middle-class tax cuts over the rate cuts for the rich favored by many supply-siders. Last summer, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne offered an extended critique in Democracy Journal. For Dionne, reform conservatism is the anti-Tea Party. Whereas the Tea Party represents (in his view) ""extreme opposition to government,"" reformocons are (also in his view) people that the left can do business with, if only they would acknowledge how much they have in common with Barack Obama. Others have weighed in on reform conservatism, too. Rush Limbaugh, one of America's most influential conservatives, has given it a definitive thumbs down, as have others on the right who see the reformers as RINO moderate squishes. So what do the reformocons believe, exactly? Are they the GOP's answer to the New Democrats, a moderate faction devoted to making their party more electable by dragging it to the center? Or are they clever marketers trying to rebrand Reaganism for the 21st century? The simplest answer is that reform conservatives are garden-variety free-market conservatives who believe that a well-designed safety net and high-quality public services are essential parts of making entrepreneurial capitalism work. This separates them from more emphatically libertarian conservatives for whom the first priority is to eliminate as many government programs as possible. Then again, this anti-government zeal tends to be more rhetorical than real. Most rank-and-file conservatives tenaciously defend old-age social insurance programs like Social Security and Medicare. Meanwhile, most conservative lawmakers who call for, say, shutting down the U.S. Department of Education routinely vote to spend on every major program it oversees. You could say that reform conservatives are just acknowledging the obvious: Government is in the business of protecting people from some of the downside risks of economic life, so we might as well get used to it. Reformocons go further than that, though, in arguing that government can do a lot of good, provided that it sticks to doing a few things well. Instead of defending the welfare state in its current form, reformocons look at the goals of programs like Social Security and Medicare and then try to find better, fairer, more cost-effective ways of achieving them. They believe a few other things as well. To the extent possible, social programs that help those who fall on hard times should be geared toward helping them achieve economic self-sufficiency, rather than letting them become permanently dependent. The tax code should encourage savings and investment. But it should also help low-wage workers out of poverty and do more for families with children. Barriers to upward mobility, like licensing restrictions that bar access to employment opportunities or urban land-use regulations that make housing unaffordable, are suspect. Reform conservatives, like most conservatives, favor greater competition in education and health care. Yet they also insist that government has a big role to play in making sure that everyone, particularly the poor, can reap the benefits of competition. I feel pretty confident in talking about the reformocons because I've been one of them from the beginning. In 2008, I co-authored Grand New Party with Ross Douthat. Oh, you haven't heard of it? Let's just say it never became a publishing phenomenon on the order of Fifty Shades of Grey. What it did do was give us an opportunity to talk about where the GOP had gone wrong, and why we believed the party was in for a massive defeat. While the Republican Party had long derived its electoral strength from working- and middle-class Americans, we argued that it had done a poor job of championing their economic interests, a problem that had grown particularly acute during the George W. Bush years. Douthat and I first bonded when we flipped out over how Bush, who had won re-election in part by winning over stressed-out lower-middle-class moms, pushed private Social Security accounts and comprehensive immigration reform as his top priorities in 2005. We literally thought the president had gone loco, and we became convinced that the Democrats would sweep Congress in 2006. Unfortunately, we were right. On the surface, not much has changed since then. Yes, Republicans have done much better in midterm elections. But when Republicans gather to talk about the chief economic challenges facing the country, they tend to talk, as Jeb Bush did in Detroit, about how excessive regulation and high taxes get in the way of business owners. Though these issues are vitally important, they tend not to resonate with Americans who don't own businesses or for whom federal taxes are a lot less burdensome than, say, their insurance premiums or their student loan debt. Compassionate conservatism, the rallying cry of George W. Bush's 2000 campaign, rested on the premise that while working- and middle-class Americans were in fine shape, inner-city youth, less-skilled immigrants, and other people living on the margins of society needed the help of faith-based initiatives funded by Uncle Sam. During the prosperous late 1990s, when compassionate conservatism first came into being, this vision might have seemed somewhat plausible. Yet even then it should have been clear that there were far bigger problems on the horizon. The basics of a middle-class life (a paycheck that grows a bit from year to year, medical insurance you can rely on, an affordable education for your kids) were already starting to slip away for tens of millions of Americans, not just for the unfortunates deserving of our compassion. Reformocons believe that fixing what's wrong with the American economy will take more than just tinkering around the edges. The good news is that there is a new intellectual ferment on the right, thanks in part to the rise of reform conservatism and the Tea Party, movements that have more in common than you might think. Over the past few years, reform conservatism has grown from a small clique to a broader tendency. You'll find reform conservatives at think tanks, like the American Enterprise Institute, and at magazines like National Review and the Weekly Standard. But you'll also find them among younger conservatives frustrated by today's GOP. We now have a house organ in the policy journal founded by Yuval Levin, National Affairs, and a mainstream outlet for our ideas in the form of Douthat's New York Times column and Ramesh Ponnuru's writing for Bloomberg View. All the while, Tea Party conservatives have been taking on the GOP establishment for its coziness with K Street and Wall Street, to the delight of reformocons who also want to shake up the Republican status quo. It's no coincidence that you'll often hear reformist themes from Sen. Mike Lee, the Tea Party stalwart from Utah. And on Wednesday, we also heard them from Jeb Bush--or some of them, at least. The central theme of Bush's speech, that government often gets in the way of Americans trying to climb the economic ladder, is an important and valuable one that has the potential to resonate not just with conservatives, but with anyone who's had to wrestle with red tape. Bush's emphasis on the importance of committed families was welcome, if not exactly controversial. School choice, one of Bush's preoccupations during his two successful terms as governor of Florida, is very much a cause worth fighting for. I even applaud the sentiment behind Bush's declaration that the U.S. shouldn't settle for anything less than 4 percent growth a year, a target that is wildly unrealistic but not a bad thing to shoot for. My problem with the speech is that Bush was playing it safe. Though Bush spoke movingly about the challenges facing the tens of millions of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck, he never really reckoned with the fact that America's economic woes began long before Barack Obama became president and that the bloated government he rightly criticizes is very much a bipartisan failure. What I really wanted was for Bush to demonstrate that he understood why so many Americans had lost their faith in the Republican Party, and why he deserved their trust. He failed to do that. Instead of offering an agenda worthy of a future president, he offered compassion for those who've missed out on the fruits of America's sluggish economic growth and a series of minor tweaks that are better suited to a governor or a mayor than to the next president. To be the candidate of reform, he'll have to do better. My reformocon homework assignment for would-be GOP presidential candidates is simple. Don't just tell us what you're against. Tell us what you're for, and be specific. You don't like Obamacare? I don't either. Got anything cheaper that will cover at least as many people? Not a fan of stagnant wages? Neither am I. Walk me through how deregulation or corporate tax reform or a bigger tax benefit for low-wage workers might help. Think our immigration system is broken? Me too! On what basis should we choose who does and does not get to become an American? Republicans have been trying to get by on government-bashing swagger and vague, poll-tested generalities for too long. The time has come to put some meat on the bone."	Did Jeb Bush Just Embrace the New Brand of Conservatism That I Helped Invent?	['Rush', 'Obama', 'Ross']	[]
