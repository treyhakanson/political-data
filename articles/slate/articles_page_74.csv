1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/jim_messina_offers_his_tips_on_how_barack_obama_s_campaign_team_beat_mitt.html	"Every morning when Barack Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina turned on his computer, he saw a snapshot of the state of the race. Campaign software engineers had built him a dashboard that showed how many doors volunteers had knocked on the night before, how many phone calls they had made, how much money had been raised, and what was moving on Twitter and other social networks. It also included a feed of traditional news feeds. ""That allowed me to get a good sense in the morning of what was going on in our world."" Messina says it was about 10 days before Election Day when he looked at those numbers and the early-vote tallies that he began to smile. ""That's when I started to feel pretty good. I looked at the numbers and we were crushing it out there."" Mitt Romney referred to himself as a ""numbers guy,"" but in the end, the numbers betrayed him. Messina used the same label to describe himself, and in the end, he earned it. His obsession with measuring and collecting data paid off, but not because he abandoned the human aspect of politics--just the opposite. Messina's obsession with numbers was built on repeated bets about human nature. I talked to Messina as he drove west for some post-election relaxation about what lessons he took away from managing the 2012 enterprise, about team building, managing the information firehose, knowing when to take risks, when to adapt, and when to just keep moving. Throughout, Messina's core message was that he strove to combine the human and the numerical. The Obama campaign's massive network of neighborhood offices is a good example of the human theory behind the numbers. Obama's team often boasted about how many offices it had opened, especially in critical swing states. During the summer when I talked  to a top Republican operative in one of the battleground states about Obama's impressive number of field offices, he scoffed at the waste of time and money; it was only so much real-estate bragging. But behind the numbers was a theory about voter interaction. If a voter met someone who looked like them and shared their experience, he or she might be more receptive to Obama's message. In the months of touring all the battleground states and back again, the Obama offices always seemed to mirror the local setting; the Romney victory centers were more corporate. The number of neighborhood offices was really a demonstration of the commitment behind the push for a human connection. ""These people get all kinds of information but if they have a neighbor that can help them sort through information--that was one of the secret weapons of Barack Obama's campaign,"" says Messina. Empowering each little neighborhood office was part of the Obama campaign's larger theory about teamwork. ""When you're in a big world of a $1 billion campaign, you are in many ways just someone who brings a team together and empowers them,"" he says. This sounds fuzzy, and so does the goopy word ""empowerment,"" but that's where the data comes in. Data means accountability. ""The trick is allowing everyone to feel like they have a piece in building it, but it can't be pie in the sky. You have to have firm metrics that are measurable every day. There's a fine line between allowing people to dream up their campaign and having them be accountable."" How did this work in practice? During the 2011 cycle, volunteers at Organizing for America, Obama's campaign arm that never stopped after the 2008 effort, asked to put their energies into contests like the Wisconsin recall election of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and local congressional and mayoral races. Messina originally had wanted OFA only to focus on the presidential race, but he changed course using the volunteers' enthusiasm for local races to test the systems that would be used in the presidential race. ""We moved resources to Wisconsin and ran some tests in mayors' races and congressional special elections and that became laboratories for what we built in 2012. We never planned to do it that way, but it was one of the best things we did. People worked way harder, were way more involved, and we learned a whole lot that became our tech products."" One of the products that the Obama team discarded was the iPad at the door. When volunteers tried to use the iPad to talk to voters--showing them a video or other material--it didn't work. ""Showing ads at the door didn't make sense. It was about having conversations. We trained our people to have longer conversations. We iterated."" Iteration--a favorite business buzzword--was key, and so was not being afraid to make mistakes. ""In campaigns you have to keep moving. You have to make decisions. Sometimes the wrong decision is the right one if you make it fast enough. Politics is motion. If you put an ad on the air, it might be more beautiful if you took another day or to have [David Axelrod] take one more shot at it but then that would be 24 hours you weren't moving your message."" The pivot in 2011 was just one of the ways the Obama campaign had to be alive to outside voices. One day former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist called to say that the campaign was targeting Puerto Rican voters the wrong way. Messina listened and changed the approach. Messina and the other Obama strategists were listening to the voices of doubt, too. Interviews with a variety of members of the Romney campaign suggest that they never seriously entertained the most pessimistic scenarios about voter turnout. (Senior adviser Kevin Madden discussed this with me at the Aspen Ideas Festival yesterday.) They never thought Democrats would turn out in the numbers that they did. At the Obama headquarters, they took a more skeptical approach. ""There was a lot of pressure on us about whether or not we were too insular. We did get out and go around the country and learn from folks to make sure that we weren't believing our own bullshit. I said to our team, 'Check 'em again, make sure we're right.' There's a tendency to be slave to your own data, even if it's wrong. Garbage in, garbage out. Seven days out I asked our pollsters and analytics folks to scrub the numbers. Recheck everything and recheck assumptions. Let's say their turnout explodes, how many states do we still win?"" At one point during the exercise, the campaign's chief analytics staffer ran a model with Republican turnout 8 percentage points above what the Obama campaign was planning for it to be. The scenario had Obama winning with 271 electoral votes. ""He said, 'Jim we're going to win this,' "" recalls Messina. That doesn't mean they weren't nervous. ""We believed in our data, but I'd be lying if I said that all these wrong polls and nervous supporters didn't make us recheck things."" If some channels of communication were open to the campaign, others were closed. ""The single smartest thing the president did was put the headquarters in Chicago. We could sit in that office and stay focused. During the debt limit crisis I was in the bathroom washing my hands and a software engineer said, 'Hey, is anything going on in D.C.?' They were busy building these cool tools we were going to need in a year and a half. That happened as well after the first debate. People came unglued, but we were worried about early voting starting and what we were doing on the ground."" Strategists for political campaigns will go to school on the Obama 2012 campaign the way they did the Obama 2008 effort. Messina warns against that. ""I studied every campaign for the last 60 years, and the ones that tried to run a re-elect like the first one ended up losing."" His first piece of advice for his campaign was to learn the best lessons of 2008 and then forget 2008. ""If we'd just slapped 'Hope' on a bumper sticker this time, it wouldn't have worked."" Being so free to discard the past is not a common trait in political campaigns, which have a special place for wise old hands. ""I think the days where you sit back in a back room and smoke cigars and say, 'this is how you win Waukesha'--those days are over. I've been doing this 20 years, and a lot of what is in politics is sheer B.S. It's people's opinions giving answers to questions that are actually quantifiable."" It's a not just a theory. He has the numbers to prove it."	How To Run a Killer Presidential Campaign

Standing outside of the 4th precinct in Philadelphia's 14th ward, there was Jerry Jackson, a member of the leather-loving fringe group who'd signed up to be a poll watcher for the Nov. 6 election. Fox News was there, too. In 2008, the network spent hours playing and replaying a video of two Panthers glaring at a conservative poll-watcher as he filmed them. This year the network sent its own reporter, who tried to interview Jackson. ""Have you been around a lot today? What's your purpose of being here?"" He said nothing. The network switched to video of the 35th ward, where people waiting in a school to vote were walking past a mural of the president, even after Republicans sued to get it covered up. ""This remained untouched for hours as people voted!"" said reporter Eric Shawn. Hours later, the network called Pennsylvania for Barack Obama. Days later, the network is still combing for evidence that Philadelphia--and by extension, the whole state--was stolen through Democratic chicanery. It was ""mathematically impossible,"" according to Sean Hannity, that 59 Philadelphia precincts had registered no votes for Mitt Romney. ""There is cheating going on in our elections!"" The story and the sentiment spread beyond Fox. Defeated Alaska U.S. Senate candidate Joe Miller tweeted about the precinct story, and grumbled that it ""sounds like western Alaska, circa 2010."" None of this comes as a surprise to me. Four years ago, when Barack Obama won the largest electoral mandate in a generation, I watched the embryonic ""birther"" movement try to overturn the results in court. It was easy to find Republicans who thought ACORN-led fraud rigged the election for Obama--52 percent of them, according to a Public Policy Polling survey. The 59 Precincts Theory is a natural, paranoid extension of this. In Wisconsin, Mitt Romney's state co-chair asserts that voter ID could have changed the result, stoking fears of ""all sorts of different precincts and all sorts of same-day registrations."" In Ohio, conservative bloggers are raising questions about Cleveland precincts that cast no Romney votes. In Pennsylvania, when Republican House Leader Mike Turzai said voter ID would ""allow Mitt Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania,"" he was implying that fraudulent votes had made up the old Democratic margins. There is a common thread: a total lack of evidence that any fraud occurred. Let's start in Cleveland, where bloggers have been writing about more than 100 precincts where Obama won at least 99 percent of the vote and 16 precincts where Mitt Romney won no votes at all. ""How in the world did this happen?"" asked an anonymous author at YoloHub. ""Third world dictators don't even get 99 percent of the vote."" But black Democrats do, sometimes, get 99 percent or more of the vote in black precincts. In 2008, Obama actually pitched a shutout in 18 Cuyahoga County precincts. And you would expect him to. In 2008, Obama won 97 percent of the black vote in Ohio. In 2012, it was 96 percent. In Pennsylvania this year, he won 93 percent of the black vote and 80 percent of the Hispanic vote. This was why Obama could clean up in precincts that are almost entirely black or Hispanic. There are places where Obama won less than 10 percent of the vote. In King County, Texas, he won exactly five votes to Romney's 135. But nowhere was Obama's loss among white voters as stark as Romney's loss among urban blacks. Why process that information and assume--immediately--that the cause was fraud? Republicans made no serious effort to peel urban black votes away from the Democrats. In Pennsylvania, Romney's final (and only) ad buy was an appeal to voters worried about coal jobs, something literally zero Philadelphia black voters might care about. When the Obama campaign responded to that ad buy, it targeted Philly with a more specific ad: ""537 votes."" In it, a series of grim images replayed the 2000 election and the Florida count. In one frame, a sea of black protesters--some with NAACP gear--held ""Count Every Vote"" signs. I saw this ad in south Florida, too. It was used in places with lots of potential black voters, and lots of anger at voting restrictions that had been passed by Republicans and held up in court. Conservatives have an urban problem, and some in the party have been sweating it for years. They don't take urbanites--especially black urbanites--seriously enough to win their votes. They view those votes as impediments to be overcome by ballots from soccer moms and angry coal miners. In Oshkosh, Wisc., a few months before the vote, I saw a charticle in a Republican campaign office that listed the poorest cities in America and the last time that they'd elected GOP mayors. It was grim, but not as grim as the illustration that accompanied it: Barack Obama waving in front of a burning ""Mad Max"" landscape. When you're this dismissive of a voting bloc, you can't understand why it evades you. You're also going to get targeted or fleeced by bogus fraud stories. In Florida, Rep. Allen West has refused to concede after one county re-counted three days of early votes and found a considerable error on West's behalf. The West campaign immediately cried fraud. ""What originally looked like dangerous incompetence,"" said West's campaign manager, ""is looking more and more like a willful attempt to steal an election."" A conservative watchdog alleged that voter turnout in the county, which broke against West, was 150 percent. Fundraising letters went out, capitalizing on the outrage. Only later did the watchdog admit that the county, sort of stupidly, counted each page of a ballot as a ""vote."" Turnout was only around 75 percent. Yesterday, as I checked into the flimsy ""fraud"" stories, I got an email from TheTeaParty.net. This is one of the more hard-to-classify groups that take the name of the taxpayer movement. I haven't seen it in action in elections or local government, but I've seen it sponsor tables at conferences. Now, it was promising--without really saying how--that it would get to the bottom of the 59 Precinct Theory. ""Stand with us as we work to demand a full recount of ALL votes for the 2012 election,"" read the letter. ""In this fight, we are up against a well funded progressive, far left machine funded by the likes of George Soros. Any amount that you can contribute, whether $5 or $500 or anything above or in between, will assist us in the fight for the integrity of elections in this country!"" For a certain type of donor, giving money to that cause will make more sense than wandering into Cleveland or Philly and asking a few actual black voters why they like Barack Obama."	Is It Mathematically Impossible for Obama To Have Won All Votes in So Many Precincts?
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/david_petraeus_s_affair_with_paula_broadwell_why_did_an_accomplished_and.html	"Among those who have long known Gen. David Petraeus, those who served under his command in wartime, sat with him in the White House Situation Room, or helped him rewrite Army doctrine at Fort Leavenworth, the most gnawing question about the scandalous affair that led to his resignation and doomed his career on Friday is this: How could he--this acclaimed leader and figure of rectitude--allow such a thing to happen? Seen in context, the mystery, while shocking, is not so unfathomable. Paula Broadwell, the woman with whom he had this affair, writes in her fawning biography of Petraeus that they first met when she was in graduate school at Harvard and he came to give a talk about counterinsurgency strategy. She approached him afterward and expressed interest in the subject; they exchanged cards. Soon, she decided to write a Ph.D. dissertation on his leadership style and, when he took command in Afghanistan, asked if she could come observe him in action. He agreed. The key to this initial attraction was probably not sexual but rather biographical. Broadwell had once been a West Point cadet, like Petraeus. She'd had training as a parachutist, as Petraeus had in his youth.* She was obsessed with physical fitness, especially running, as was Petraeus. In short, regardless of gender, Broadwell was exactly the sort of aspiring officer-intellectual that Petraeus was keen to mentor. The impulse was not unique to Petraeus. It grew out of the ethos of West Point's social science department, where Petraeus had taught in the mid-1980s. The department, known as ""Sosh,"" was founded just after World War II by a visionary ex-cadet and Rhodes Scholar named George A. ""Abe"" Lincoln. Toward the end of the war, as the senior planning aide to Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall, Lincoln realized that the Army needed to breed a new type of officer to help the nation meet its new global responsibilities in the postwar era. This new officer, he wrote to a colleague, should have ""at least three heads--one political, one economic, and one military."" He took a demotion, from brigadier general to colonel, so he could return to West Point and create a curriculum ""to improve the so-called Army mind"" in just this way: a social science department, encouraging critical thinking, even occasionally dissent. Lincoln also set up a program allowing cadets with high scores in Sosh classes to go study at a civilian graduate school, with West Point paying the tuition. In exchange, the cadets, after earning their doctorates, would come back and teach for at least three years. Once they fulfilled that obligation, Lincoln would use his still-considerable connections in Washington to get them choice assignments in the Pentagon, the State Department, the White House, a foreign embassy, or a prestigious command post. He would later articulate a philosophy in personnel policy broadly: ""Pick good people, pick them young before other pickers get into the competition, help them to grow, keep in touch, exploit excellence."" Over the decades, a network of Lincoln's acolytes--and the acolytes of those acolytes--emerged and expanded. They called themselves the ""Lincoln Brigade."" When these alumni-officers were appointed to high-level positions, they'd usually call Col. Lincoln--or, later, his successors--and ask for the new crop of top Sosh cadets, or the most promising junior faculty members, to come work as their assistants. In the course of his own career, Petraeus had mined this network assiduously. Many of the colleagues who helped him devise the ""plot to change the American way of war"" (as the subtitle of my forthcoming book about them puts it) came out of the Sosh program and referred to themselves proudly as members of the ""Lincoln Brigade"" or the ""West Point mafia."" When Petraeus met Broadwell, he no doubt saw in her a promising new recruit for the network. Precisely what happened next, when this mentor-protege relationship turned into something else, is not clear. Many of Petraeus' associates in Kabul, Afghanistan, wondered at the time if something was going on. Petraeus got along famously well with writers and journalists; he cultivated their trust, in part because he liked talking with them, in part because he saw press relations as a key ingredient of ""information operations""--a classic military technique to shape the message of a campaign to civilian populations, both in the war zone and on the home front. (I was one of those reporters.) But Broadwell was allowed unusually close access. She was given a room at headquarters. On most early mornings, the two went on 5-mile runs together. Some, including myself, reasoned that this didn't necessarily imply anything hair-raising: Petraeus went on 5-mile runs with lots of reporters and other visitors. Still, at least one of his assistants warned him to be wary of ""appearances."" Two other things about Broadwell that made her different from his usual crop of acolytes: She was very attractive, and, by all accounts, she went a bit ga-ga for the general. Her biography, All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, is essentially a valentine to the man. In the process of courting him while writing it, she may have made herself irresistible. Still, it is likely that, at the outset, Petraeus was drawn more to her C.V. than to her glamour, more to her prospects as a protege than as a mistress. Afghanistan proved to be a case study in the danger of placing too much faith in intellectual ideas--in this case, Petraeus' ideas about counterinsurgency doctrine, which never had much chance of yielding fruit on that country's harsh plains. Paula Broadwell may be, among other things, a case study in the danger of getting too close to the swooning sirens of would-be intellectual proteges. Correction, Nov. 11, 2012: This article originally stated that Paula Broadwell joined the light infantry officers' corps upon graduation from West Point. She did not. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Why Did General Petraeus Risk Everything for an Affair?

I called my parents that night, crying about how devastating this was for the country. The next day, my dear friend and I were driving outside campus, nearly hysterical over the results. She ran a stop sign on the side of a school bus sign neither of us saw through our tears and got a $200 traffic ticket. I had just turned 21. My vote for Kerry was the first I'd ever cast, and boy did losing hurt.  But there was no one to around to rub my face in my own misery. In order to do that, someone would have had to call or email me or come up to my red-rimmed eyes and laugh in my face. Given that my immediate family is liberal, modern social media was in its infancy, and I went to a strongly left-leaning college, nothing like this happened. My friends and I consoled each other and moved on, and I never had the experience of anyone reveling in my despair. Eight years later, how the world has changed. When the TV networks declared that Obama won his second term, I whooped with glee, did a little dance and posted a few social media updates including, ""Proud to be an American tonight. 4 MORE YEARS."" I was so incredibly happy. As the recaps and analyses rolled in, I was not above enjoying articles about Karl Rove's Fox News on-air meltdowns and Donald Trump's over-the-top Twitter feed. But I began to notice, both in media coverage and in social media networks, that Obama supporters were not just thrilled that our guy won--folks were insanely, morbidly happy that all Republicans were miserable. And they weren't just picking on easy and legitimate punching bags like Karl Rove and Donald Trump. Lindy West of Jezebel wrote a blog post entitled ""My Ten Favorite Kinds of Right Wing Temper Tantrums"" in which she proudly declared, ""I am just 99 percent completely fucking delighted by every single weepy right-wing temper tantrum. I can't stop hate-reading. I can't stop."" A blogger for The Daily Kos wrote, ""So please know, my fervid conservative friends, that I am temporarily suspending the empathic sensibility that generally informs most of us on the left. I am not laughing with you, in other words, since you seem capable of neither doubt nor self-deprecation. I am laughing at you. You are welcome to join me."" Someone created a Tumblr called White People Mourning Romney. It isn't particularly interesting or clever, unless you just like photos of your fellow Americans crying or looking disappointed, but people sent in dozens of submissions. Judging by the number of delighted notes on each post, these photos fill many liberal hearts with glee. Mary Elizabeth Williams from Salon concludes it's OK to meanly gloat because we New Yorkers need a reason to be happy after having such a tough time with Sandy. Twitter and Facebook have become cesspools of schadenfreude. I'd like to think that most people wouldn't dare say to a friend, colleague, or relative the mean-spirited gloating hatefulness that has become common in the last few days. A sampling: If there is one thing in this whole country that liberals and conservatives can agree on, it's that we live in a deeply polarized, angry, divided nation. Social media seems to encourage blasting our basest feelings to everyone we know, and it's caused some of us to totally mute our human sense of empathy. If I had logged into 2012-style Facebook and Twitter at the depths of my own political despair in 2004, I can only imagine how painful it would have been to be see strangers and friends alike basking in my pain. Frankly, I think it would have made it even harder for me to let go of my political wounds and move on. It would have just made me that much angrier. There's plenty I disagree with Republicans about, but they are (slightly less than) half the country. Liberals need to pipe down. Ruthlessly delighting in Republican sadness will not help bring anyone together to make the most of Obama's second term.  There's plenty to celebrate, like this, this and this, without putting anyone down."	Liberals, Quit Your Out-of-Control Gloating About Obama's Win.

One of the standouts in Lincoln is a conscience-stricken Democratic congressman named George Yeaman. The Kentucky representative agonizes over whether to rise above partisanship and vote for the 13th Amendment. How Lincoln gets Democrats, and even some fellow Republicans, to do the right thing is the guts of the movie. Our problems today pale in significance to those faced by Abraham Lincoln. Nevertheless, President Obama faces a historic challenge in persuading an opposition party off its partisan ledge to avoid a national calamity; in this case, heading over a ""fiscal cliff,"" meaning a series of dramatic, automatic spending cuts that few people actually want and which would certainly stymie sensible government. Lincoln confronted the challenge in his day by making a moral and patriotic appeal and, when that did not work, by offering jobs--good, old-fashioned patronage. The fracturing of the Republican Party's Reagan coalition offers President Obama a number of opportunities. As a number of GOP analysts have noted since the election--most notably Alex Castellanos--the party has to retool to match the changing demographics of the country. If there was any doubt, today's column by Charles Krauthammer on the need to embrace amnesty for illegal immigrants suggests that that the GOP brand is in flux. In 1940, Franklin Roosevelt took advantage of a similar crisis among his opposition, which was divided between interventionists and isolationists, to restaff his national security team with high-profile Republicans. Henry Stimson, Herbert Hoover's secretary of state, and Frank Knox, the publisher of the Chicago Daily News who had run against Roosevelt on the GOP ticket with Alf Landon in 1936, joined FDR's Cabinet as secretary of war and secretary of the Navy. They then recruited younger men like John McCloy, Robert Lovett, and James Forrestal, none of whom thought much of the New Deal but all of whom were disappointed in their own party's failure to come to grips with the international emergency.  The country benefited as well as these men, especially the young Republicans, who were later known as ""the Wise Men."" The modern-day equivalents of the ""interventionist"" Republicans of the 1940s are members of the GOP who believe that government can be a force for good, but that it ought to be more efficient and effective. These are the Republicans who stood behind President George H.W. Bush and supported the budget compromise of 1990, which together with President Bill Clinton's policies (and the collapse of the Soviet Union) created the economic boom and the budget surpluses of the 1990s. These ""Good Government"" Republicans don't win elections much anymore--because they cannot survive GOP primaries--but they did not disappear from the face of the earth. Since our current emergency is economic, is it not the right moment for President Obama to create a bipartisan domestic war Cabinet? Secretary Timothy Geithner has wanted to leave the Treasury Department for some time. Were Obama to select a high-profile Republican who believes in a balanced approach to deficit reduction and recognizes (as did Mitt Romney in the second debate) that a free market needs some government regulation to work, the public would quickly tire of the bickering of House Republicans. The ""no new taxes"" purists would be marginalized. In addition, President Obama, who believes in lower corporate taxes and domestic job growth, would be helped by adding a Republican secretary of commerce, perhaps a businessperson. Who better to smooth over the restiveness among some small business owners, who will now have to live with Obamacare, than a Republican CEO? Obama has done this before. In 2009, he kept Robert Gates at the Defense Department. The choice was a stroke of political genius. Killing Bin Laden certainly sealed the transformation, but Obama's reappointment of Gates complicated GOP efforts to criticize the president as they had previous Democratic presidents for being weak on defense. In the third debate, the effect of Obama's nonpartisan management of foreign policy was very clear: The GOP challenger generally agreed with the Democratic incumbent on national security issues. Conditions are ripe for recruiting a bipartisan economic Cabinet.  The combination of a hyper-partisan Congress and the Tea Party's grass-roots efforts pushed a number of ""Goo-Goo"" Republicans out of office. Sens. Richard Lugar and Olympia Snowe, for example, are great Americans who would put country above party. Another potential recruit would be former Sen. Alan Simpson of Simpson-Bowles fame. None of these people are spring chickens, but they have gravitas and could be very effective over the course of the year or two it took to solve the immediate crisis. A younger choice, but one who is more conservative, would be the retiring Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana. Democrats are historically better at constructing bipartisan cabinets than Republicans. Besides FDR, Kennedy also gave big jobs to his erstwhile political opponents. He did not offer Richard Nixon a job, but he did give Nixon's running mate, Henry Cabot Lodge II, a key embassy (South Vietnam). He also gave Eisenhower's secretary of state, Christian Herter, the job as U.S. trade representative. His secretary of the treasury was a prominent Republican, C. Douglas Dillon. Remember, presidents are really the deciders, so choosing fallen Republicans does not mean denying the historic nature of Tuesday's results. But there would be no better symbol of a real effort to seek a solution to a national crisis--and the failure of the Grand Bargain last year has set us up for one now--than to bring responsible members of the opposition into the government. Imagine how the politics of the moment would change if Obama declared war on the deficit and unemployment and then created a national, bipartisan team to fix it? Think of how this would complicate any efforts by recalcitrant House Republicans to try to cast the issue, once again, as American patriots vs. ""socialist"" Obama? Yes, in the end, there would be some compromises by the president. But since the American people reaffirmed GOP control of the House, the president could not run the table in any case. (Indeed he could not run it in 2009 when his party controlled both houses of Congress.) The issue now is how to make Washington governable again. In Lincoln, Yeaman's ultimate decision rested on whether he believed the country had changed. In 1940, Stimson and Knox joined FDR's government because they believed their party was out of step with a changing world situation. In 1980, Ronald Reagan's victory symbolized the end of the Democratic Party's ability to count on the New Deal coalition to win them the White House. Tuesday's results confirmed that 2008 marked the end of the Reagan coalition of blue-collar workers, immigrants from European countries, white Southerners, and evangelicals as a pathway to the White House. The moment is right for the president to enlist Republicans who understand that their party must change, that Obama's victories were not flukes, and who share the belief of most Americans that helping the country avoid the ""fiscal cliff"" is this era's definition of patriotism under fire. In winning re-election after boldly embracing health care reform, Barack Obama is on track to achieving the rank of a ""great"" president. This could seal the deal."	What FDR and Lincoln Can Teach Obama About Fighting Gridlock

As it became clear early on that Obama was going to take this thing, my household quickly switched the channel from CNN to Fox, eager to see the network's massive breakdown play out in real time. After all, if the job of Fox News these past four years was to make Obama a one-term president, a goal the network not-incidentally shared with the Republican Party, Fox News super-duper seriously failed. In 2009, White House communications director Anita Dunn called Fox News ""either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party."" I don't know about the ""or"" part. With massive funds and infinite air time, Roger Ailes' little network that could spent the past four years demonizing president Obama (after a year of demonizing candidate Obama), and obsessively churning up non-news to scare the shit out of white guys and feed into the GOP bloodstream: from the Black Panthers' remarkable rise to political power to that thing about the guns and Mexico named after an awesome Vin Diesel movie to the multifront war on Christmas/Christians/Christ to The Great Benghazi Conspiracy of 2012. And what do they have to show for it? Not a Republican president. Not a Republican Senate. Not a repealed health care law. Adding insult to Tuesday's injury, Eric Holder is still a free man. Yes, ratings. Yes, money. I hear you. But if Fox News has any actual interest in helping the Republican Party or the conservative cause--and you can want to do this and make money, just like the GOP!--the network really flubbed it. So what happened, other than the mainstream media oppressors shutting down the truth once again and polling places letting Hispanics in? In 2009, Gawker published a post titled ""What's Bad for the GOP is Good for Fox News,"" arguing that Republicans' worst nightmare--the election of a black, Democratic president who listens to the rap music and gives young, female, and non-white Americans hope--was actually a dream come true for Rupert Murdoch's money-minting, 24-hour news network. Pointing to this illustrative graph, Gawker's John Cook (who, full disclosure, is my husband) wrote that ""the more viewers Fox attracts, the more voters the GOP repels."" But in 2010, the GOP/Fox News Industrial Complex proved Gawker --and many Democrats who assumed Fox had taken things too far--wrong. With the aid of the Fox-bolstered Tea Party revolution, the Fox-created Socialist-in-Chief, the Fox-aired town hall debacles, and the Fox-supported conspiracy theories of Glenn Beck, Republicans won the House and the narrative. We all gave in and started calling it Obamacare. 2012 looked to be a lost cause. But Fox overreached. The midterm results told Sean Hannity and Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly that they were doing something right, and so they kept at it. Donald Trump phoned in from Trump HQ daily to inform Greta Van Susteren's viewers about his heroic quest for the missing birth certificate. Glenn Beck presented his irrefutable evidence that everything is connected and all roads lead to the Jews/Kenya/Cass Sunstein. Beck finally got canned in 2011, but Hannity picked up some of his nut-job slack. The liberals on Hannity's panel got paler and sicklier by design (my theory, at least), and the true-believer conservatives became more insufferably confident and dismissive of any potential Obama revival. So what does all this delusional thinking have to do with actual voters and their actual votes? As Conor Friedersdorf writes in his very smart Atlantic piece about the failure of the conservative media, it's ""easy to close oneself off inside a conservative echo chamber."" As he points out, Fox News and other conservative media are ""far more intellectually closed"" than, say, NPR. Fox News feeds its viewers a line of bull about the way the world is. Viewers buy this line of bull. Misinformed viewers become misinformed voters. And then misinformed voters are shocked when Obama wins. Hey, I thought everyone hated this guy? (The preceding is a very good reason why liberals should limit their MSNBC viewing, by the way.) Friedersdorf argues that Fox not only deludes its viewers, but that it is part of a self-deluded system, in which right-wing talk radio and TV pundits like Dennis Prager and Hugh Hewitt actually also take the bait. They all reinforce each other's divorce from reality, Friedersdorf  suggests, until the whole thing blows up--as it did last night in that crazy MegynCam moment, as the anchor, faced with a raving Karl Rove, walked from the studio to one of the back offices to confront the network's decision desk over its Ohio call. It was, of course, terrific TV. In our house it played as comedy, but I'm sure Fox's loyal viewers, still holding out hope of a Romney turnaround, loved the drama of Kelly stalking the hallways, one of the network's conservative crusaders on the hunt for nebbish number crunchers. So is the talent at Fox News made up of true believers or cynical hacks? Most likely, the network--just like the pundit roundtable on air last night--contains some of each. For the ratings whores, it's likely true that four more years of Obama is exactly what the network needs--but it's clearly not what's best for, say, Chris Christie. Fueled by intensity and hatred, Fox thrives as the opposition. The trouble is that for the GOP to survive, Republican candidates eventually have to get votes. When they fail, Fox gets to keep on printing money. After Karl Rove's on-air freakout and the aforementioned MegynCam challenge, Fox was forced to acknowledge that Obama had won the damn election. And now what are they left with? A whole lot of viewers who are quite surprised to find that they are once again outnumbered by Americans who actually like better access to health care and don't all keep Carrie Mathison-style timelines of the Benghazi cables on their living room walls. Now these disappointed souls wonder: Why isn't the world the way we thought it was Tuesday morning? Just guess where they will turn for the answer."	How Fox News Failed the GOP
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/ohio_republicans_watching_buckeye_state_conservatives_learn_that_mitt_romney.html	"COLUMBUS, Ohio - Right before some of the East Coast polls close, a little before 7 p.m., I park at a reasonable distance from the Renaissance Hotel and find the bar. That's where the TVs are, so it's where we will learn whether Virginia and New Hampshire are as close as Nate Silver says they are. I want to watch it with Ohio's Republicans, and this is where they'll be partying. At 7, the Fox News ALERT came across the screen: Everything was close, especially New Hampshire and Virginia. A distracted crowd of Republicans looked up, pondered the lopsided raw vote numbers coming in from Kentucky, then went back to their conversations. Nothing would really count until Ohio. I took the escalator up to the ballroom. Soon, they hoped, Buckeye Republicans would announce that they'd rescued the rest of America from the death-grip of Euro-socialism.  They bought $4.75 beer tickets and swapped stories from the endless campaign. Mike Robinson, a 33-year-old small-business man who wore blue shorts with white stars, gripped a Bud Light and let me ask him about the final rounds of negative polls. ""I'm optimistic,"" he says. ""The president's not going to get the same percentage of the African-American vote. They're not going to come out again. He did a good job in 2008, but this year, I hear that their numbers are down."" The 48 hours before this party were a flurry of rumors and numbers and buncombe. If you were a reporter jumping on conference calls, you heard each presidential campaign explain why the real early-vote advantage was in their precincts, or their counties. Republicans had great fun pointing out how much smaller Barack Obama's crowds were--down tens of thousands from the ones that came out for John Kerry, and look what happened to that guy. I run into Loren Spivak, a Massachusetts activist who has written two Doctor Seuss-style books about the Obama years under the nom de plume Dr. Truth. He was trying to figure out the numbers that had Obama leading New Hampshire. ""I know a lot of people in New Hampshire and they're all for Romney,"" he says. ""But, you know, a lot of us live in our bubbles."" Shortly after 8 p.m., the evening's ""program"" begins. State GOP Chairman Bob Bennett ambles onstage, joined by state Auditor Dave Yost. ""I expect to join you to celebrate the election of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan as our president and vice president,"" he says, not very convincingly. ""And I expect to cheer with you when we announce a new United States senator from Ohio, Josh Mandel!"" By this time, those of us with smartphones have seen the exit polls for Ohio. If they're only a little wrong, they still have Mandel, the youthful state treasurer, losing narrowly. If they're right, they have Barack Obama winning the state, and the presidency. They might not be wrong. From time to time, the PAs ask the crowd to move from their hallway hangouts back into the ballroom for the ""program."" At 9:15, the Republican leaders return to share more words that sound like good news. ""I heard the networks were thinking about scrapping the map of the United States and calling it Ohio!"" says Douglas Priesse, chairman of the GOP in Columbus' Franklin County. ""This is going to be a historic night. I saw Peggy Noonan on the TV, and she said: This is going to be a historic night in politics. I'm not sure the excitement is going to be as high on the other side!"" By this point the applause was pretty weak. The Republicans respond with the last-ditch move that has worked so well in vaudeville history: a cute kid. One of the young volunteers with Generation Joshua, an evangelical activist team, takes the mic to talk about all the work she was doing. I find a space to stand, next to some college-age Generation Joshua kids who had covered themselves in Concerned Women for America and Romney-Ryan stickers. ""Each of these stickers symbolizes a call that one of our volunteers made today,"" explains Ryan McDonald, an 18-year-old student from Patrick Henry College. One of his partners had plastered the stickers over his eyes and his mouth; photographers couldn't get enough of them. As we talk, I learn that Mandel has lost. ""When the margin's that close, you just know that you fought as hard as you could,"" he says. The screens along the broad side of the ballroom turn into Mandel logos. To kill time, I walk to the back of the party area, a room where party number-crunchers keep loading and reloading local data. I accidentally break the news of the Mandel loss to Kevin Shook, a lawyer who had worked against the Democrats' lawsuit that extended early voting. But then, the party is beckoned back into the ballroom, for another ""victory"" announcement. ""Steve Stivers has won the votes to let him return to Congress!"" says Yost. We listen to a speech by Stivers, a local congressman, and one by a successful candidate for state Supreme Court. It feels like we're being pointed away from the TVs, which keep on showing lousy news for Romney and Democratic wins in Senate races. When I leave the ballroom again, I meet people talking about the ramifications of the Obama win. ""I'm worried about our Constitutional right to bear arms,"" says one Republican, who wears a tiny gold pin of a Glock to make the point. And then, finally, Mandel concedes, talking about the ""peaceful transition of power"" and how it doesn't exist ""in the Middle East, or in some countries in Africa."" He finishes quickly, shakes a few hands, and exits. Priesse retakes the stage. ""We were all here tonight to see Josh Mandel end his first bid for U.S. Senate,"" he says. ""We will be there when he wins."" Priesse keeps talking, and the speech sounds perfectly inspiring, but the timing is horrible. Anyone who can see a TV screen can see Fox News call Ohio for Barack Obama. Small crowds gather around the corners of the room, ignoring Priesse completely. They wipe away tears. They deal with it. ""Because Ohio's economy has turned around so well under our Republican governor, Obama got credit,"" says 22-year-old volunteer Evan Mathini. ""I'm optimistic about the future. If we want optimism, we've got Chris Christie."" The Republican leaders are still here, but they have nothing to say. The lights start to go out. The party moves down to the first-floor bar. I ask a damp-eyed Yost what he thinks of Fox News' on-air debate about whether the state should have been called so early. ""If NBC and CNN call it, I'm confident that they're right,"" he says. He leaves, and I rejoin the group at the bar. Earlier than they expected, they're waiting for an end to the election and a Mitt Romney concession speech. The only spare seat is next to Darrell Poor, a black Democrat who happens to be driving the ""party bus"" from the rally tonight. ""You know what I think?"" he asks. ""I think Bill Clinton was right, and he made sense to people. We were in a mess for eight years. Nobody could've cleaned that up in four years."" Poor explains the election to me without sounding overly enthused by Obama. After a night in the Republican orbit, it's a helpful reminder of how the president actually won this state. Poor looks around the bar, as the Republicans buy each other cocktails and talk over the Fox News feed. ""I should take the bus to the Hilton, where the Democrats are,"" he says. ""That's where the real party is."""	Watching the Slow Death of Ohio Republicans

His magic formula for predictions, much maligned in some corners in recent weeks, appears to have hit the mark in every state--a perfect 50 green M&Ms for accuracy. Now my Twitter feed is blowing up with announcements of his coronation as the Emperor of Math and the ruler of the punditocracy. Wait--it was even more than that, they say: a victory for blogging, and also one for rational thought. He proved the haters wrong! He proved science right! Is this guy getting lucky tonight or what? But all these stats triumphalists have it wrong. Nate Silver didn't nail it; the pollsters did. The vaunted Silver ""picks""--the ones that scored a perfect record on Election Day--were derived from averaged state-wide data. According to the final tallies from FiveThirtyEight, Obama led by 1.3 points in Virginia, 3.6 in Ohio, 3.6 in Nevada, and 1.9 in Colorado. He won all those states, just like he won every other state in which he'd led in averaged, state-wide polls. That doesn't mean that Silver's magic model works. It means that polling works, assuming that its methodology is sound, and that it's done repeatedly. To be fair, the art of averaging isn't simple. You can't just comb through Google News and add up all the numbers that you find; to find a useful sum, Silver judges which polls to put into his analysis and then he weighs them according to his perception of their quality. He may be very good at this, but other stat-head pundits do more or less the same, and their averages match up accordingly. Yes, Silver had Obama in the lead, but so did RealClearPolitics and Talking Points Memo; where he had Romney, so did they. ""Our state-by-state forecasts are extremely similar to those issued by our competitors,"" he wrote in a post two weeks ago, entitled ""State Poll Averages Usually Call Election Right."" Those numbers nailed it on 50 out of 50 states, as they often do. So picking winners state by state was the easy part. Anyone who glossed the numbers would have made the same projections. But Silver's model promised more than that: He offered assessments of his confidence in each state's results. The fact that Obama led in Ohio polls made it obvious that he should be the favorite, but what if those Ohio polls were wrong? How much risk was there in trusting state-wide averages? This was Silver's nifty contribution: He assigned that risk a probability, by looking at some other factors, such as polling trends and local demographics. Take the example of Virginia, where Obama led by 1.3 percentage points. Picking him to win the state was a no-brainer since he was leading in the polls, but Silver used his secret sauce to calculate the chances that those polls were wrong. According to his calculations, the risk was 21 percent, meaning that Obama's odds to win the state were roughly 4-to-1. What do the day's returns tell us about the accuracy of Silver's model? Nothing much. The fact that Obama won Virginia looks good for averaged polling--indeed, his margin appears to be a couple points, not far off from what was predicted--but we'll never know about that other part. Did Obama really have a 79 percent chance of winning? To get a sense of that, we'd need to run yesterday's election like a lab experiment, doing it 10,000 times to see how often Obama wins. Since that can't happen, we're left to scratch our heads. You could even make a case that Silver's estimates were off. His averages had Republican Senate candidate Rick Berg up by 3.9 in North Dakota, enough to give him a 92 percent chance of winning. Now it looks like he could lose to Democrat Heidi Heitkamp. In Nevada, Silver gave Republican Dean Heller an 83 percent chance of winning based on a 4.7-point lead in the averaged polls. As of now, Heller's up by just 12,000 votes. But Montana is the most telling case: According to Silver's polling average, the Democratic candidate, Jon Tester, led by 1.4. But Silver's model, which uses ""state fundamentals"" among other factors, guessed the polls were wrong, and gave his opponent Denny Rehberg a 66 percent chance of winning. So far as I can tell, this was the only contest in which the magic model went against the averaged polls. Guess what? The projections might have been a little off: Tester has a 5-point lead. It's possible that Silver's predictions were weaker than normal in North Dakota and Montana because polling in those states was sparse. Again, the polls are more important than the poll watcher--good polling yields good predictions. In the future, I'll be curious to see how Silver's model does in cases like Montana, where it picks the polling underdog. Does his secret sauce yield some unexpected scores--winners who surprise the pundits and the pollsters--or does it just distract us from the obvious? Silver lovers aren't waiting for these comparisons. They're riding high on victory, and giving credit to the bearer of good news. In doing so, they've made the same mistake that Silver's critics made last week: They've confused his projected odds with hard-and-fast predictions, and underestimated the accuracy of polling. The fact that Obama won doesn't make Nate Silver right, any more than a Romney win would have made him wrong."	Obama's Big Win Does Not Mean Nate Silver Is a Towering Electoral Genius
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/pundit_scorecard_checking_pundits_predictions_against_the_actual_results.html	With the election over and the final results mostly tallied, there's little left to guess about: Barack Obama has won with 332 electoral votes (assuming his lead holds in Florida), 62 beyond the 270 needed to win. The 2012 presidential election has come to a close, and voters can finally, at long last, think about something else. Pundits, however, shouldn't be allowed to go about their business quite yet. Many of them made very public and very specific predictions about the election's outcome. Some were right and some were very wrong. So, before we forget who said what, we put together the electoral vote predictions of some of the country's most popular prognosticators. Look who nailed it. And look who missed big. In the interactive below, each dart represents a pundit's predictions. The closer the dart is to the center, the closer the prediction was to the actual outcome. Darts below the center underestimated Obama's electoral vote share, while darts above overestimated it. Blue darts represent predictions made by liberal pundits, while red darts represent predictions made by conservative pundits. Darts that didn't make the dartboard represent predictions off by 100 electoral votes or more. Mouse over each dart to learn more about the prediction. Correction, Nov. 7, 2012: The infographic previously listed nonpartisan analyst Reid Wilson as a conservative pundit. His name has been removed. Also, Nate Silver's prediction had previously been listed as 313 electoral votes. This number was Silver's average of simulated outcomes, not the most likely outcome.

Six years ago, Wisconsin voted on one of those gay marriage bans that plagued the land in the post-Goodrich era. All but one county approved the ban. Today, they have the nation's first openly gay senator, who now has to figure out what she wants to do with that. I'm amazed at how she came in under the radar. National gay donors realized immediately that Baldwin could be electable statewide. They'd worked with her for more than a decade, and knew her better than the people who rate candidates based on their issue profiles. Republicans underestimated her for a year, assuming that Tommy Thompson's crossover votes would save him. (I don't blame them!) He won his last election in 1998 by 22 points, and you look at a number like that and you figure you have some loyalty. It's just a fantastic night for Democrats in Senate races--Baldwin is far more reliably liberal than Herb Kohl, and Connecticut's Chris Murphy is--do I actually need to say this?--is not as conservative as Lieberman. As I write this, I'm about to watch Josh Mandel concede the Senate race in Ohio. Sherrod Brown told me this weekend that outside grips spent around $40 million to boost Mandel. The Chamber of Commerce spent heavily in races that they're now losing. OK, maybe this is the second biggest story tonight--the incredible pissing-away of this cash on lousy campaigns.

Boy, it sure wasn't an issue with voters there. In 2008, President Obama lost voters over 65 years of age to John McCain, 53 percent to 45 percent. That was in keeping with the traditional fact that Democrats typically lose seniors. But now Obama is doing much worse in Florida. He's down 26 points to Romney according to the exit polls. Fifty-eight percent of seniors voted for Romney and 42 percent voted for Obama. Florida operatives say that two years of attacks on the president's Affordable Care Act were just too hard to beat back.	Election Day Dispatches

He is losing them to Mitt Romney nationally by 17 points: Romney 57 percent to Obama's 40 percent. But in Ohio, Obama is only losing white working-class voters to Romney by 2 points: 50 percent to 48 percent. Is that because of the auto bailout? Or because of the ads that painted Romney as the embodiment of all the economic forces that put white working-class voters in a pinch?	Election Day Dispatches

The exit polls say that just 8 percent of voters claim to have decided whom to support in the last few days. (Remember them from my piece here.) Now we shouldn't forget that the people who finally made their pick may not have actually been undecided. They may have simply embraced the position they always were going to embrace in the last few days. What about the others? Eleven percent claim to have decided in October and 79 percent said they voted before that."	Election Day Dispatches
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/voting_lines_2012_we_need_young_people_working_at_the_polls.html	The line to vote at my polling place in Brooklyn, N.Y. was two and a half hours long. I don't live in a swing state with massive turnout, and there was no hotly contested local election or ballot initiative. While many New Yorkers are suffering the after effects of Hurricane Sandy, fortunately, my polling place was unscathed. The multistep process of checking in, voting, and getting the ballot electronically scanned wasn't what made the line drag. The problem, to put it bluntly, was the sweet old ladies manning the polls. God bless these women for volunteering, but it's clear: If young people really want to protect voters, they should volunteer as poll workers. At my polling place, it took two elderly ladies, in tandem, two to three minutes to find each voter's name in the rolls, write down the pertinent information, and have each voter sign. The actual voting booths were virtually empty because it took each voter so long to get through the bottleneck at check-in. The line management was terrible, and no information being given to the hundreds of people waiting outside in the cold or to organize and streamline the process. Several poll workers were sitting around, starting into space. The voters on either side of me in line both bailed after an hour, saying that they'd try later. I asked if people who didn't want to wait could just cast a provisional ballot, and a poll worker told me she didn't know. Of course, poll volunteers aren't experts in line management, nor are they brought on because they're speedy with a pen. They're brought on because they have the time and inclination to volunteer--and so it shouldn't surprise anyone that so many volunteers are retirees. But couldn't we back them up with some plucky, fast-moving young people? After all, college students and young people with flexible schedules are already out in force volunteering for both campaigns. And with unemployment near 8 percent, surely retirees aren't the only people with their days free! Rather than showing enthusiasm by knocking on doors the day of election, how about ensuring a smooth process for the people who are actually voting? Long lines are a serious barrier for full participation, so idealists can see it as an act of social justice. You even get paid. And while Election Day isn't a holiday for federal or state employees--or for pretty much anyone who isn't an autoworker--there is one group of state employees who might be available. If you're a teacher, why not take your grading day off and run the polls? You already know all about line management and dealing with grumpy, impatient people. Heck, by the time my two-and-a-half hour wait ended this morning, I'd have been happy to let Occupy Wall Street run the voting stations--after witnessing their massively well-organized relief efforts being coordinated for Sandy victims I'd take a bunch of charming anarchist hippies over good-intentioned but tortoise-paced old people any day. When I left the polling place, the line was about five times as long as it was when I got there. For all of you still waiting in line at MS 51 in Park Slope, I recommend you take advantage of Gov. Cuomo's declaring emergency voting at any polling location, and jump the line to ask for a provisional ballot. And before the next election, sign up to volunteer. That's an even better way to effect change.	I waited two and a half hours to vote because of the sweet old ladies at my polling place.
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/republicans_know_voters_support_barack_obama_s_pledge_to_raise_taxes_on.html	"After every presidential election comes the battle of the Mandate. The president claims to have one. (Typically, it's the president's braggy advisers who claim he has one.) The losing party denies it. Yeah, sure, the other guy won, but the other party controls Congress (Democrats, 1984), and the third-party candidate spoiled the vote (Republicans, 1992), and not in a century has somebody been re-elected with so few electoral votes (Democrats, 2004), and anyway, the guy's a secret Muslim who suckered people because he was never vetted by the media (you shouldn't need a clue for this one). The anti-Mandate meme is struggling now. Part of the problem stems from the pre-election ""unskewed polls"" craze, which led to conservatives predicting a big Romney win, which made it harder to minimize what actually happened. The bigger part of the problem: The president promised to raise some tax rates. Voters agreed. Republicans haven't even tried to spin this away. At this week's meeting of the Republican Governors Association, men who had failed to elect Mitt Romney admitted that they'd lost the tax issue. ""Elections have consequences,"" said Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia. ""Clearly, overwhelmingly, people in America believe that raising rates on people that are in the upper income is part of the mix, the president is supporting that."" Last year, at one of their overstuffed debates, the party's 2012 presidential candidates were asked whether they'd accept ""one dollar of tax increases for 10 dollars of cuts."" They said no. Asked a similar question now, the Republicans who didn't lose are shrugging. Gov. Butch Otter of Idaho, safe red territory, said he'd accept tax hikes ""if I got a lot of the things that I wanted."" There's really no disagreement about what hikes we're talking about, or how popular they are. In 2012, as in 2008, Barack Obama pledged to keep most of the 2001 and 2003 income tax cuts, but not the one on incomes above $250,000. It would rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. That would raise, probably, $823 billion over a decade. Obama's tax stance was to the right of Bill Clinton's and Al Gore's, which is sort of the secret of the whole election--centrist tax policy girded by happy class warfare against a man who owned a car elevator. The top rate cut was always the least popular piece of Bush's tax plans. That was why he said ""everyone"" would get a tax cut if it passed; that was also why Romney, in his best presidential debate, said he wasn't going to actually cut taxes on the rich, because he'd nail 'em later by closing loopholes. In the network exit poll, 47 percent of voters wanted to hike the tax rate on incomes over $250,000. Thirteen percent wanted to soak everybody; only 35 percent wanted no tax hikes. ""There was one thing that everybody understood was a big difference between myself and Mr. Romney,"" said President Obama on Wednesday. ""I think every voter out there understood that that was an important debate, and the majority of voters agreed with me. By the way, more voters agreed with me on this issue than voted for me."" Republicans get that, and some of them knew it would happen. The ""one dollar for 10 dollars"" comment, says retiring Ohio Rep. Steve LaTourette, was ""one of the dumbest answers Romney was forced into giving, a stupid answer built out of a right-leaning process. There isn't anybody sitting at home who thinks that. There's a guy sitting on his couch in Ohio watching that, saying: 'Who wouldn't take that deal?' "" Even Romney got it, sort of. At the Boca Raton, Fla., fundraiser that was surreptitiously taped and given to Mother Jones, Romney theorized that ""our message of low taxes doesn't connect"" because ""47 percent of Americans pay no income tax."" He couldn't bring himself to admit that voters wanted to raise taxes on people like him. When he and Paul Ryan were on their game, they'd promise to make corporations (Democrat-friendly General Electric, for example) pay taxes. The admission: OK, it seems like voters really think that the rich are getting off easy. Not since the 1970s have Republicans been so weak on the tax issue. Like Romney said, in his way, they're victims of their own success. They've lowered rates to the extent that voters don't fret about them. So they're no longer talking about the Dec. 31 deadline for the tax rates as a Masada, a full-bore defense of the old rates. They're talking about what they can get if they accede to the Democrats. These same Republicans, of course, have signed the Americans for Tax Reform pledge. As Democrats now delight in reminding them, they have ""sworn an oath to Grover Norquist"" that they won't raise taxes, because the last time they did so--1991--they never got the cuts they were promised. Lucky for us, Norquist takes some time from being caricatured to give actual quotes to people. On Thursday, he appeared at the Atlantic Ideas Forum in Washington, D.C., to defend himself. He quickly corrected his interviewer, Chuck Todd, when the pledge was described as a ban on ""tax increases."" The prohibition, said Norquist, was on ""net tax increases."" When John Boehner talked about raising revenue, well, fine, Republicans were allowed to do that. Did the exit poll say that 60 percent of people wanted higher taxes? Well, sure. ""Same exit poll,"" said Norquist, ""63 percent said don't raise taxes to reduce the deficit. Why those two things? The answer is, if you ask people: 'If the politicians raise taxes on the rich, do you think they'll raise taxes on the middle class,' then 75 percent of Americans say yes."" But that wasn't quite what the electorate said, and Republicans know it. Obama's Democrats have actually cleaved the tax issue in two. If the Bush tax cuts expire, yes, everyone's tax rates will go up. But Obama will blame that on Republicans, and voters are ready to agree with him. If a new bill restores the cuts for lower tax brackets, Republicans can vote for it and fulfill their pledge, technically. They just haven't figured out a new way to defend those high-end tax cuts that doesn't get them shredded at the polls. ""It would have been so much easier,"" says California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, ""if Romney had won."""	Why Republicans Are Getting Soft on Taxes
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/barack_obama_s_first_news_conference_since_his_re_election_made_it_clear.html	"There's a difference between saying you have a mandate and acting like you have one. In his first news conference since his re-election, President Obama took on bullies, scrooges, and unruly reporters. He batted away questions over the scandal that brought down Gen. David Petraeus, stood up for his U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice against attacks from Republican senators, and warned that if House Republicans didn't act on the question of tax cuts, the holidays would be ruined. In the hour-long news conference, Obama took a measured tone, but he clearly feels like he has the upper hand. ""The American people understood what they were getting when they gave me this incredible privilege of being in office for another four years,"" he said. The least substantive but most dramatic moment in the East Room question-and-answer session came when the president took on Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Both men have pledged to block Susan Rice's nomination for secretary of state if Obama taps her to replace Hillary Clinton. Days after the attack in Libya that left four Americans dead, Rice went on the Sunday shows to say it was caused by a spontaneous protest. At the time, parts of the U.S. intelligence community supported this view, while other parts said it was a terrorist attack. (A third hybrid theory is that terrorists reacted to spontaneous protests in Egypt to launch the attack.) The president wasn't having any of it. He said his U.N. representative was clearly operating on the best intelligence at the time and had nothing to do with the underlying situation in Libya. ""If Sen. McCain and Sen. Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. And I'm happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the U.N. ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received and to besmirch her reputation, is outrageous ...  when they go after the U.N. ambassador, apparently because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me."" The president is offended by what he sees as a cheap attack, says one White House official. The president believes that McCain and Graham are making Rice a target because they want to deny the president a nominee. If they have fingers to point, say aides, they should aim them at the intelligence community that gave Rice the initial information. If you were of a mind to read the election results as a signal to Republicans to make the party more inclusive, you might wonder why they are picking a high-profile fight over the potential nomination of an African-American woman to be America's chief diplomat. If you wanted to read the situation as a pure policy fight, then you might wonder why McCain and Graham are going so hard after Susan Rice when they defended Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, whose reliance on intelligence information in the lead up to the Iraq war was far more damaging. If Obama was firm, he also seemed reasonable. When he talked about raising revenue to replace the steep tax increases that are scheduled to kick in at the end of the year, he sounded open to Republican ideas, albeit clearly skeptical. He believes that the election showed the country supports his position that taxes should go up for those making more than $250,000. His newfound confidence made him seem comfortable raising the stakes for Republicans. Because, as he explained, if House Republicans don't agree to his plan, it's ""going to be a pretty rude shock for [the public] and I suspect will have a big impact on the holiday shopping season, which in turn will have an impact on business planning and hiring, and we can go back into a recession."" For months, Republicans used business confidence against the president, arguing that his policies had frightened consumers and businesses into inactivity. Republicans argued that only removing Obama from office could jump-start the economy again. Columnist Paul Krugman has a special expertise in making fun of this theory. On Wednesday, the president was offering his own version. Five different times he argued that consumers and businesses needed ""certainty"" that could only be achieved if Republicans supported his measure for protecting tax rates for those who make under $250,000 while allowing rates for the wealthy to rise. The president says he is open to any solution that would produce the same revenue as a rate increase, but he's skeptical that one can be found simply by closing loopholes and removing deductions for those in the top tax bracket. That's the Republican's preferred position. The president is open to tax reform that would produce some revenue, but the process of enacting such reform will take a long time. Meanwhile, says Obama, let the rates rise. That's a frightening proposition for Republicans: They obviously don't want to see the rates rise for fear that they'll never come back down in the hoped-for tax reform debate next year. When George W. Bush held his first news conference after election, he remarked on the sense of confidence the time on the stump had given him. "" When you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced your point of view,"" Bush said. Obama sounded a similar theme, though he explained the relationship between what he saw and what motivates him more explicitly. ""When you travel around the country, you are inspired by the grit and resilience and hard work and decency of the American people. And it just makes you want to work harder ... When you talk to these folks, you say to yourself, man, they deserve a better government than they've been getting,"" Obama said. At the end of the press conference, a Bloomberg reporter shouted a question about automatic spending cuts. Obama admitted it was a good question, but he didn't want to set a precedent by fielding a question that was yelled out. In ways little and small, it was a day for the newly re-elected president to draw some lines in the sand. "	Does President Obama Finally Have the Upper Hand on the GOP?
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/david_petraeus_and_paula_broadwell_scandal_congress_has_no_idea_how_to_handle.html	"It began with one FBI agent and no shirt. The downfall of CIA Director David Petraeus started in May, in Tampa, when a freelance military party planner named Jill Kelley grew fed up with some harassing emails she'd been getting from Petraeus' alleged mistress, Paula Broadwell. Kelley contacted an FBI agent, a friend so close that he had ""sent shirtless photos to her."" She got results, sort of, as the agent opened a cybercrimes investigation into the emails. And then the story got to Washington. The agent was ""barred from the case"" because, even when clothed, he seemed too obsessed with it. He called Rep. Dave Reichert, a Republican whose district in the Seattle suburbs is three times zones away from Tampa. Reichert routed the agent to Rep. Eric Cantor, the majority leader in the House, to speak to someone about an issue that might have compromised classified information. On Oct. 31, four days after the contact, Cantor took the story to FBI Director Robert Mueller. By that time, both Petraeus and Broadwell had already been interviewed by the bureau. Why did the agent take this story to Republicans? According to the New York Times, the agent had an unspecified ""worldview"" that led him to suspect ""a politically motivated cover-up to protect President Obama."" As of today, he's totally alone in that. Republicans don't want to speculate about the Petraeus scandal. They resent that it's coming up. They want to focus on the Sept. 11 killings in Benghazi--which they fear has been covered up in a politically motivated plot to protect President Obama. On Tuesday, the first post-election day of House and Senate votes, Republicans and Democrats gritted teeth and tried to get past the story. Neither Reichert nor Cantor added anything to the public record when asked. As the Senate held a roll call vote on a ""sportsmen's bill,"" Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein shrugged off new versions of old questions. Would the disgraced Petraeus appear before the Benghazi inquiry? ""If not this week, then another week."" Did the alleged affair endanger national security? ""I don't know."" Feinstein punched the button that could take her out of the scrum. ""Elevator, where are you?"" Before this story broke, the Benghazi investigation had been relatively uncomplicated. On Tuesday, a closed-door briefing would bring the acting CIA director together with Senate Intelligence committee members. On Wednesday, the House Select Committee on Intelligence will get a similar briefing. On Thursday, the administration will reckon with the full House and Senate committees. Those meetings are proceeding as planned, but with the new, paparrazzi-ready trimmings of a sex scandal involving a freelance ""military social liaison"" who ran a fake ""cancer charity"" that blew its money on parties and piled up debts of her own as her sister dated the former governor of Florida. ""You're all asking questions today,"" said Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, the former Republican chair of the Intelligence committee, chiding the media for glomming on to a juicy story. ""You disappeared before."" But ""before"" was during the election. At that time, Republican assertions about Benghazi were twinned with a critique of a president they wanted to defeat. According to Sen. John McCain, campaigning for Mitt Romney, the president effectively ""allowed"" the attack to happen and let four men die when ""they didn't need to."" With the election over, they've tempered the criticism. After today's closed-door briefing, Sen. Marco Rubio said he wanted to hear more from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but went easy on the woman who might replace her, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. ""Obviously she based those comments on information or directives that she had,"" he said, ""and it's important to know what directives those were and who that information came from."" It was a long way from ""what did she know and when did she know it."" As Sen. Jim DeMint exited the briefing, he said ""we're getting to the bottom of it"" and jumped on the Senate subway to be whisked elsewhere. Last month's bluster about Benghazi was mostly gone. This can't be separated from the Petraeus story. The basic details, such as the use of Gmail drafts as a paramour message service, reveal an astounding lack of common sense and security from a man lionized by Republicans. Last month Republicans thought that Barack Obama's feckless team had failed Americans in Benghazi. Now they know that the FBI was on to Petraeus this summer, and that the director was talking to the bureau about an affair during the hottest stretch of the scandal. Those facts are going to prompt more questions. Two House Republicans learned of a scandal that was ensnaring national security figures, and did not run to the press with it. An FBI agent managed to open a ""cybercrimes"" investigation for a woman who was remarkably abusive of other people's time and money. The overzealousness of the investigation paid off, in a way, but what precedent was set here? When I asked Sen. Roberts about the FBI agent's decision, he was as confused as anyone could be. ""It strikes me as ..."" He paused. ""It doesn't add up. It doesn't make any sense. A lot of this doesn't make any sense."""	Why the Petraeus Scandal Isn't the Scandal Republicans Wanted
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/why_romney_was_surprised_to_lose_his_campaign_had_the_wrong_numbers_bad.html	"Mitt Romney says he is a numbers guy, but in the end he got the numbers wrong. His campaign was adamant that public polls in the swing states were mistaken. They claimed the pollsters were over-estimating the number of Democrats who would turn out on Election Day. Romney's campaign was certain that minorities would not show up for Obama in 2012 the way they did in 2008. ""It just defied logic,"" said a top aide of the idea that Obama could match, let alone exceed, his performance with minorities from the last election. When anyone raised the idea that public polls were showing a close race, the campaign's pollster said the poll modeling was flawed and everyone moved on. Internally, the campaign's own polling--tweaked to represent their view of the electorate, with fewer Democrats--showed a steady uptick for Romney since the first debate. Even on the morning of the election, Romney's senior advisers weren't close to hedging. They said he was going to win ""decisively."" It seemed like spin, but the Boston Globe reports that a fireworks display was already ordered for the victory. Romney and Ryan thought they were going to win, say aides. ""We were optimistic. More than just cautiously optimistic,"" says one campaign staffer. When Romney lost, ""it was like a death in the family."" How did the Romney team get it so wrong? According to those involved, it was a mix of believing anecdotes about party enthusiasm and an underestimation of their opponents' talents. The Romney campaign thought Obama's base had lost its affection for its candidate. They believed Obama would win only if he won over independent voters. So Romney focused on independents and the economy, which was their key issue. The Republican ground game was focused on winning those voters. ""We thought the only way to win was doing well with independents and we were kicking ass with independents,"" says a top aide. One senior adviser bet me that if Obama won Ohio, he would donate $1,000 for every point that Romney won independents to my favorite charity. (That would be a $10,000 hit since Romney lost Ohio but won independents by 10 points). In the end, Romney won independents nationally by five points--and it didn't matter one bit. Meanwhile, the Romney campaign was openly dismissive of the Obama ground game. Why are they wasting so much money with neighborhood offices, they asked? (In Ohio, for example, Obama had almost 100 more offices than Romney.) In retrospect, the Romney team is in awe and full of praise of the Obama operation. ""They spent four years working block by block, person by person to build their coalition,"" says a top aide. They now recognize that those offices were created to build personal contacts, the most durable and useful way to gain voters. Romney advisers say it was impossible to compete against Obama's huge war chest. They also envy his ability to leverage the presidency for his campaign. Young voters were told about new provisions for student loans and Obama's support for same-sex marriage, an issue that appeals to young voters. Hispanic voters were wooed by the president's plan to waive the deportation of children of illegal immigrants. One Romney aide also included the much-debated changes to welfare requirements as a policy aimed to win over African-American voters. ""It was like they had a calendar,"" said one Romney aide. With each month, the Obama administration rolled out a new policy for a different segment of their coalition they hoped to attract. Though Romney said he was ""severely conservative,"" it was the Obama team that played its hand conservatively. They, too, planned for fewer Democrats to show up at the polls, but in their case it was so that their campaign organization would work twice as hard. On election night in Ohio, when turnout exceeded their intentionally conservative estimates in some districts, they knew that they'd win the state 45 minutes before the networks called it. It's not that the Romney camp failed to meet its targets. They say they actually met their voter outreach goals in Ohio. During the summer, they targeted more than 2 million voters who had not voted in party primaries. Those were the independents they believed would be the key to the race. Since the strategy seemed to be paying off with internal and external polls showing Romney leading among independents, the Romney team felt like they were working their plan. ""We did everything we set out to do,"" says a top strategist about the Ohio effort. ""We just didn't expect the African-American vote to be so high."" African-American participation in Ohio jumped from 11 percent of the electorate to 15 percent between the 2008 and 2012 elections. ""We could never see that coming. We thought they'd gotten a lot last time."" But that wasn't the only problem. Romney underperformed George Bush's results from 2004 in the vast majority of Ohio's counties, not just the ones with big African-American populations. In the post-election analysis, the Romney ticket's problems with Hispanic voters are well-known. During the primaries, Romney ran so far to the right on immigration he lost a platform to even woo Hispanic votes. But African-Americans are treated as if they are in a category altogether unaffected by the campaign. They were going to vote for Obama no matter what. There's a little John Sununu-like thinking in this. The former New Hampshire governor suggested that Colin Powell was supporting Barack Obama because of his race. (When Condoleezza Rice said that the party sent ""mixed messages,"" that must have been what she was talking about.)  It's worth noting though, that if you were an African-American voter, there were plenty of other reasons to vote against Mitt Romney and the Republican Party. Donald Trump has loudly championed that idea that Barack Obama is illegitimate. It was a goofy charge, but one that has cultural resonance with a segment of society whose members have often been discriminated against through  the types of disqualification-hunts that Donald Trump engaged in so vigorously. Mitt Romney embraced no other fundraiser with as much public gusto as he did Trump. The energetic attempts by Republicans in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida to limit voting in a way that disproportionately penalizes African-American neighborhoods might also have helped turn out the Democratic base. What role these acts played is not entirely clear, but it certainly didn't hurt the Obama team's effort to inspire African-American voters. If you're basing your entire campaign on white people, it leaves you little margin of error. That's where Romney's troubles as a candidate hurt him. An operative in Ohio also admitted that the Obama abortion ads hurt Romney with women in the Columbus area. So too did the ""Romney will raise your taxes on the middle class"" ads and the ads attacking his tenure at Bain Capital. Romney couldn't afford to lose any of the white vote, and he did. Since the attacks came at a time when he was short of cash, he was not able to respond adequately. In the final 10 days of the race, a split started to emerge in the two campaigns. The Obama team would shower you with a flurry of data--specific, measurable, and they'd show you the way they did the math. Any request for written proof was immediately filled. They knew their brief so well you could imagine Romney hiring them to work at Bain. The Romney team, by contrast, was much more gauzy, reluctant to share numbers, and relying on talking points rather than data. This could have been a difference in approach, but it suggested a lack of rigor in the Romney camp. On Election Day, the whole Romney ground-game flopped apart. ORCA, the much touted- computer system for tracking voters on Election Day, collapsed. It was supposed to be a high-tech approach to poll-watching, a system by which campaign workers would be able to track who voted. Those who had not yet voted could therefore be identified and then have volunteers tasked to finding them and getting them to the polls. ORCA was supposed to streamline the process, but it was never stress-tested. Field operatives never saw a beta version. They asked to see it, but were told it would be ready on Election Day. When they rolled it out Tuesday, it was a mess. People couldn't log on and when they did, the fields that were supposed to be full of data were empty. ""I saw a zero and I knew I wasn't supposed to be seeing a zero,"" said one campaign worker. A war room had been set up in the Boston Garden to monitor ORCA's results, but in the end Romney and Ryan had to watch CNN to find out how their campaign was doing.  In the end, the numbers guy was deprived of his numbers in more ways than one. "	Why Romney Never Knew What Hit Him
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/the_tea_party_lost_big_on_election_night_and_must_now_work_with_gop_to_bounce.html	"The day after the election, FreedomWorks and its key state-to-state organizers dialed into a one-of-a-kind conference call. For the first time ever, they would be discussing a crushing defeat. Their ""Take the Senate"" campaign had ended with Democrats in greater control of the upper house. Their turnout game, powered by a new web-based canvassing app, was swatted aside by labor and the Democrats. Richard Mourdock, the Indiana politician who'd been with Tea Partiers since the 2009 Taxpayer March on Washington, had lost one of the party's safest seats. And now John Boehner was selling them out. The speaker of the House had just jimmied open the door to ""new revenue,"" which conservatives hear--correctly, typically--as ""new taxes."" ""People were upset,"" remembers Brendan Steinhauser, FreedomWorks' director of state campaigns. ""Does Boehner cave in to what Obama and Reid want to do, or does he at least stay relatively strong on these issues? He's probably going to a lot of these Republican, Tea Party folks, and say: OK, guys, here's what we need to do to stay in power. That's the fear."" How does the Tea Party stop it? Good question. What else does the Tea Party want to halt? Better, more complicated question. The movement, which starts its second four-year term in February, was built on opposition to the president's stimulus and health care law. There's no real chance of a new stimulus bill, and the health care law is safe until at least 2017. In the foxhole, when the only goal was defeating Obama, there were no real disagreements among Tea Partiers and the rest of the conservative base. That's over, too. Over the last few days, as they've processed data from the election, the right's Obama-era grass-roots groups are divided over what went wrong and what to do next. FreedomWorks' get-out-the-vote app was called Political Gravity. It had been developed by American Majority, a grass-roots group run by Ned Ryun, which had its own offices in swing states and its own literature telling voters to save their children from the rampaging national debt. On Thursday, Ryun was downright dismissive of how the software had been used. Teams of Tea Partiers went to homes and tried to talk to residents about their terrific Senate candidates. If no one was home, they put information at the door. ""When you knock at a door, you've got to talk to people,"" asked Ryun. ""You dropped off 50,000 door-hangers? Great. All you did was waste trees."" After an election where nothing seemed to work, you can hear the case made against almost everything. Ralph Reed's Faith & Freedom coalition made it to the New York Times, because Reed talked a good game about mobilizing the sort of white evangelical voters who'd been pushed back into politics by the Tea Party. But the mobilization didn't outmatch the Democrats. ""Ralph Reed says he made 12 million robocalls?"" asked Ryan. ""Great. Who gives a rip?"" Americans for Prosperity, David Koch's group, spent tens of millions of dollars on a flashy ground game. I observed it in action, twice. Like the Romney campaign, it flopped in every swing state. ""We're looking closely at our own program, and we're analyzing how the left ran their operation, as we often have in the past,"" said Americans for Prosperity spokesman Levi Russell. ""I can tell you that one major goal of the field program was to identify and recruit new activists/volunteers. That was very successful. Our membership grew by around 400,000 members, largely due to the personal contact of our people on the ground."" And that's where the uncertainty comes in. If there are new Tea Party ground troops, how do they differ from Ralph Reed's ground troops? How do they differ from generic Republicans? In 2010, the Tea Party became an interest group inside the GOP. The party blamed them for spoiling some primaries by nominating loser candidates, but even then, they were working inside the party. FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity are going to keep working for a Congress with fewer Democrats and more Republicans. But they disagree with the other elements of the GOP's base about what kinds of Republicans they want. All of the Tea Partiers I talked to this week led with one piece of post-election spin: That Republicans could not win without cracking into the Latino vote. ""We've been working with a group of Spanish-speaking Tea Party people in Florida,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, chairwoman of the coalition group Tea Party Patriots. ""In Wisconsin, people were putting material out in Spanish, reaching the Spanish-speaking community. Our idea of freedom resonates across party lines and across the party divide."" That's one take on the problem. The other take: Republicans will need to resist some elements in their base and pass immigration legislation that wins over Hispanics. ""If the Republicans were smart, in January, maybe they'd come out with that bill and win some of that support in exchange for some of the Tancredo-style support,"" said FreedomWorks's Steinhauser. ""The left saw the future and built a demographic coalition among people who don't maybe necessarily agree. You lose some of your hard-core supporters and you pick up new ones."" For the first time, there's an issue that could pit the GOP's best-organized and best-funded grass-roots against other parts of the party base. Talk radio helped kill immigration legislation in 2007. Some of the Tea Party's leaders wanted that legislation to survive. Dick Armey, the former GOP majority leader who now chairs FreedomWorks, was warning Republicans to ""get off this goofiness,"" stop talking about a border fence, and pass the bill. David and Charles Koch, and other businessmen who've discovered politics in the Tea Party area, are far more simpatico to immigration reform than, say Rush Limbaugh or Mark Levin. In 2007, Iowa Rep. Steve King fought reform so hard that he brought a small model of a border fence to the floor of the House, to show how ready-made it could be. In 2009, King was linking arms with Dick Armey. King will be in D.C. come January. So will FreedomWorks. And for the first time, they completely disagree about how they can win the country."	Why Did the Tea Party Fail?
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/gop_super_pacs_republican_donors_spent_millions_on_tv_ads_and_got_almost.html	"COLUMBUS, Ohio--For the past few weeks, whenever an Ohioan left his TV on for too long, he would see Sen. Sherrod Brown's head on a cartoon body. He would see this more often than he saw Brown himself. The Now or Never PAC, funded by two Missouri millionaires, spent $1.2 million on a commercial in which a googly-eyed Brown stole money from families and coal plants. Another big buy, from Associated Builders and Contractors, portrayed Brown as a demented cartoon, sitting at a desk with an ""I Love Taxes"" coffee mug, rubber-stamping documents with an Obama campaign logo. Democrats didn't know what to make of this stuff. Today, after Brown clinched a 5-point win, his aides were still baffled by the stupid commercials. At a news conference in the Democratic Party headquarters, Brown predicted that ""voters will, in a funny sort of way, welcome beer ads, car ads, and detergent ads."" He derided Karl Rove--whose American Crossroads GPS spent millions on the presidential race in Ohio--as someone who ""doesn't understand Ohio like he thinks he does"" and whose ad strategy was ""pretty discredited"" by the humiliating losses. Brown might have a point. In the grand sweep of American politics, never has so much money been spent for so little gain. Up to $40 million of outside money was poured into Ohio to beat Brown. American Crossroads spent nearly $105 million on its campaigns nationally. Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney super PAC, spent nearly $143 million. Just those two groups, combined, spent more than the 2000 Rove-led presidential campaign of George W. Bush. The difference: These guys lost. Both Restore Our Future and American Crossroads shoveled money into swing states and bluer ""reach"" states, trying to soften them up for Mitt Romney. ""In the month of August,"" said Restore Our Future's Charlie Spies to reporter Andrew Kroll, ""we were one of the key things keeping Mitt Romney afloat."" It spent $21 million that month, in an attempt--don't say ""coordinated""!--to keep Romney competitive while the candidate held back and raised money. It did keep the race close. But Romney lost all but one swing state, North Carolina. There's no electoral vote for ""participation."" Down the ballot, the record was only slightly less atrocious. Look at the U.S. Senate races. American Crossroads spent $4 million in Florida, $2.7 million in Wisconsin, $1.8 million in Montana, more than $728,000 in Virginia, and nearly $500,000 in New Mexico. Only in Nebraska, where the group spent a late $1 million to destroy Bob Kerrey, did it get a return on its investment. Because Republicans did so poorly, every independent group looks like a loser. The Chamber of Commerce bought ads for no-hope Senate races in Pennsylvania, Hawaii, and Florida. David Koch's Americans for Prosperity bought airtime throughout 2012, trying to make voters angry about the Solyndra scandal. Further down the ballot, in House races that can be served by small media markets, the super PACs did a little better. But in the afterglow of 2010, when Republicans won most of their close races, the conservative PACs wildly overestimated what they could do with TV. Here's one theory for the failure: Their ads were stupid. The Democratic super PAC ads were better. I can't mind-meld with every Ohio voter, but in the time I spent here and in other swing states, the ads I saw from conservative PACs were lazy and patronizing, designed to push buttons that may or may not have actually existed. The cartoon ads from smaller PACs were obviously bad, but the cruddiness of Restore and Crossroads commercials was quite subtle. One of the final Crossroads commercials, titled ""Sack It,"" showed an actress in her 40s watching a TV in her expensive-looking kitchen and sighing about Barack Obama. A companion ad called ""Debate"" put the same woman in a different part of her classy home, watching ""Morning Joe"" on an iPad as familiar minor-key piano music conveyed her disappointment. I searched but did not find actual voters swayed by these ads. Their intentions were obvious--convince women that they were not alone and that whatever they thought of Obama before, they should be disappointed with him now. But they were prefab. Restore Our Future's pro-Romney ads used file footage to let voters into an Obama dystopia, something that was extinguished by peals of laughter when Rick Santorum tried it. A super PAC ad can't cast the actual candidate talking to voters, which is a built-in weakness. But the initially weak Democratic super PAC Priorities USA gave Ohioans 30-second clips of real, angry ex-workers who blamed their misfortunes on Bain Capital. These were stone-cold rip-offs of ads that had brought down Romney 18 years ago, when he ran for U.S. Senate. Republicans PACs never found anything so effective in any race. The lameness, coupled with the omnipresence, fed a backlash. One of the best candidate ads all year came from Heidi Heitkamp, the Democrats' winsome underdog for Senate in North Dakota. Her campaign put her in a batting cage, knocking back metaphorical attack ads that were ""all paid for by a few billionaires who want to keep their tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas."" And she won. A lot of people paid good money to make these ads. When I called around Wednesday, sadly, I had no luck reaching the super PAC donors who cut $100,000 or $1 million checks for useless filler. I did get to talk to some very nice maids. But I never learned, for example, how Lee Ainslie could make such solid stock picks and waste so much money on an effort to buy commercials for Romney at higher rates than Romney's own campaign would have to pay. (Stations charge candidates cheaper rates than third-party groups.) But maybe we're making the wrong assumption about big donors. Maybe they have no idea how to spend their money effectively. Consider Sheldon Adelson, the cherubic casino magnate who became a Democratic supervillain this year. He spent $20 million propping up Newt Gingrich's primary campaign, because Gingrich had been a pal to him on labor issues and Israel. Over the rest of 2012, he spent $33 million more on super PACs, which went on to lose everywhere. Adelson gave $1 million to a PAC supporting Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, one of the year's most entertaining candidates, running in a northern New Jersey district that looked hopeless. It was hopeless. Boteach lost by 49 points. When Republicans dig out from under the rubble, there may come a reckoning with super PACs. Why did they whiff so badly? Why did they thrill to announcements of massive late buys, when the Democrats were putting bamboo shoots under Mitt Romney's nails with targeted buys? Until and unless Barack Obama gets to shift the Supreme Court to the left, their money is a valid form of speech. They need to learn how to talk to people."

You feel as though something tremendously important has happened, yet everything around you looks exactly the same. What transpired last night? Your brain is overwhelmed equally by fog and a jittery sense of significance. As the pieces start coming back, you experience shreds of the previous night's nervousness, elation, or dismay--but through a glass, darkly. Shouldn't the view outside your window look brand new? Shouldn't the coffee at least be working by now? It's called election hangover, and we feel your pain. Voting yesterday was so empowering. In many--but not all--cases, you got your ""I voted"" sticker and walked around feeling like part of a beautiful creature named democracy that breathed truth and justice across the land. Maybe later you were elated or depressed, the world coming to an end or gloriously changing. And yet, when all is said, done, counted, and broadcast, the immediate consequences of the election are hard to place. The same parties control the House and Senate. The same embattled guy reports for work today in the Oval Office. What does election hangover feel like? According to my colleagues, it's everything from ""ringing in my ears from all the horrid music on MSNBC"" to ""despair in the pit of my stomach, which has handily replaced my appetite."" Sometimes it's accompanied by a literal hangover, e.g., ""from two beers and three cocktails and staying up until 3:30."" More figuratively, it can look like obsessive-compulsively rehashing the minutiae of the returns last night, like a slew of speculation concerning the blood alcohol levels of various newscasters, like a meta-analysis of media analysts who analyze the guy analyzing all our polls. We can't let it go, even if we want to. Forward? Only if that's the direction that holds the Advil and the Gatorade. Unsurprisingly, the hashtag #electionhangover is all over Twitter. ""I'm not sure how I feel today,"" tweets @RestlessRani. ""Is there a poll I can look at? Data? #electionhangover."" And @BCam252 observes symptoms of the ailment in his co-workers: ""I aint been to work 30 min and every other white person I see is n a bad mood...#electionhangover."" But mostly, the phrase has become a way of conveying that we are very, very tired. ""Cant. Stop. Yawning. #electionhangover."" ""Im definitely slumming it today. #electionhangover."" The hashtag has a rueful tone, signaling as it does that our civic duty resulted in the aftereffects of a fun night out without any of the perks. But take pride in your election hangover! The hungover citizen is engaged and invested. Where's the shame in getting so intoxicated by the country's political intrigues that you can't find your shoes the next morning? I'm embracing my fatigue, my disorientation, my aching, aching head. Could you please turn down the lights?"	Do You Suffer From an Election Hangover? You're Not Alone.
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/how_obama_won_he_had_a_better_team_that_ran_a_first_rate_campaign.html	"In the end, it wasn't close. Barack Obama won re-election handily over Mitt Romney with 303 electoral votes (so far), well more than the 270 electoral votes needed. Of the nine battleground states that were up for grabs, Obama won seven of them, losing only North Carolina (Florida remains to be called). But while Obama won those states, he didn't crush it; he won instead, a string of precise narrow victories. He didn't win because his leadership during Hurricane Sandy blew all those swing votes his way (though it may have helped). The president won because he ran a permanent campaign, keeping his offices open in the battleground states from his 2008 campaign, tending his coalition assiduously, and because he relentlessly defined his opponent. His was the better campaign. The Democratic candidate of ""hope and change"" beat the big business Republican in the trenches, in one state after another. President Obama's tactical victory is clear when you look at the election returns. He has no grand mandate that comes out of Tuesday's numbers. He has been re-elected, but his policies did not win the day. Voters didn't turn their faces up to the vision he painted the way they did in 2008. When voters were asked which candidate had a vision for the future, Romney won that question in exit polls, 55 percent to 43 percent. Asked about Obama's signature achievement, health care, voters did not approve. Forty-nine percent said they wanted it repealed in part or whole. Voters also said the federal government was too large. Voters are deeply divided by race and age. The president can credit strong support from women. He led by 11 percentage points among women, while Romney led by 7 points among men. There was also an Obama advantage among younger voters. He grabbed a majority of those under 45. Older voters broke for Romney. Obama lost the white vote by a larger margin than in 2008 when he got 43 percent of the vote. On Tuesday, he got just 40 percent of the white vote. They represented virtually the same share of the electorate as before. But Obama made up for that deficit by winning handily with minorities, which represented an ever-so-slightly larger share of the vote. The best news the president can find in the exit polls was that he fought the economic question to a tie. Voters who cared about the economy picked Romney by only one point over Obama, 49 percent to 48 percent. Still, Obama simply neutralized his opponent; there's nothing in that number that suggests a mandate. Sixty percent of voters backed Obama's call for tax increases for those with incomes over $250,000. But that's a proposal that will have no life beyond the campaign trail. Polls show that voters have long supported this idea. It doesn't happen because the proposal will never shake loose enough of the partisan opposition to make it real. Now the candidate of ""hope and change"" must bind up his wounds and prepare himself for another round. Half of the country is going to be upset by this outcome, and the president, who once knew how to make the music of reconciliation, will have to whip up some kind of stirring message in the months to come. The White House knew what tone to strike when it released its first post-election photograph, which was a vision not of jubilation but of almost relief. In his remarks, Obama immediately moved to start the reconciliation. ""We rise or fall together as one nation,"" he said. He then praised Romney and his family: ""From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, they give back through public service and that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight."" He promised to sit down with Romney in the coming weeks to ""talk about moving this country forward."" He said the vote was a vote for action to focus on jobs and that in the weeks and months ahead he would work with the other party. ""Whether I earned your vote or not ... you have made me a better president. I return to the White House more determined than ever."" What was ratified on election night was the benefit of a permanent campaign and the talent of the Obama team. The much vaunted Obama ground game appears to have been a real thing. (David Axelrod's candidate won by more than a whisker, and Axelrod got to keep his; he'd pledged to shave off his mustache if Obama lost Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Minnesota.) His campaign team was so formidable that it made up for all the inadequacies, vulnerabilities, and missteps (remember that first debate?) of a weak incumbent president in a sputtering economy. He pulled out every stop possible: Bill Clinton, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, and Katy Perry in a dress that was as tight as Obama's margin in Florida. A few theories of political science were upheld. Debates didn't change the outcome, and late-deciding voters don't break for the challenger. Nine percent of voters said they made up their mind with three days to go, and they broke for the president, 51 percent to Romney's 44 percent. In the end, Romney was right. It was all about the economy. But Americans seemed to want more than someone who cares about fixing the problem; they want someone they think cares about them. It was the empathy, stupid. When voters were asked which candidate cared more about then, Obama won more than 80 percent of those voters. The president won among African-Americans, who were 13 percent of the electorate, by 93 percent to 6 percent. He won among Hispanics, 70 percent to 30 percent. Romney's poor performance with Hispanics, in particular, is likely to start a wave of soul-searching in the party about how to reach out to the country's fastest-growing minority group. That's not the only conversation that's going to take place in the Republican Party. With Romney's loss, Republicans will start positioning for the future by winning the argument about the last campaign. There are three possible reasons for Romney's defeat that will be floated. First, he was a bad candidate. Second, the party is out of step with the demographic changes in the country. Third, the hurricane stopped Romney's momentum. The truth is likely to be some combination of all three. Romney was a flawed candidate, out of step with his party and sometimes himself. His shift in the final weeks to a more moderate tone seemed to be a late-in-the-game reversion to a truer self. Did the storm matter? It's hard to imagine that it did, but 64 percent said the president's response to the hurricane was a factor in their decision. Forty-two percent said it was important to their vote for president. Political scientists will help us determine whether those responses have anything to do with the 9 percent who say they decided in the last three days to vote for Obama. The president's team always said he had multiple paths to the presidency. That's because he started with 237 electoral votes from safely Democratic states that are a part of what seems like a permanent Democratic wall. This campaign affirmed that New Mexico is a Democratic presidential stronghold and probably did the same for Nevada and Wisconsin. Obama won with a combination of those paths his aides had outlined. He won Nevada and Virginia and Colorado with a mix of minorities and white working-class voters, as well as upscale white suburban voters. In Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa, Obama won in states that didn't have big minority populations but he got enough of the white vote to survive. The Obama campaign's Midwest firewall held, though the exit polls were a little hard to read. In Iowa, Obama won among white women, with 58 percent of the vote, but in Ohio he lost among white women, 52 percent to 47 percent. In some states, the president fared even worse. In Virginia, Obama lost white women 58 percent to 41 percent. (This is what was so amazing about the strength of his ""new coalition"" in states like Virginia, where he could make up for that deficit with other kinds of voters.) It will take some time to pull through the exit polls, but in Ohio, the state that was the focus of so much attention and that put Obama over the top, he prevailed for two reasons. First, he was able to run on the auto bailout, a tangible economic result voters could feel. (More than half of Ohio voters approved of the bailout.) Second, Obama also won in Ohio because he turned Romney into a symbol of the economy that had put them in an economic fix. In Ohio, on the question of ""who cares about you,"" Obama won the support of 84 percent of the state's voters. What did voters ultimately decide about Mitt Romney? They didn't think that he was enough of an economic fix-it man, and his favorable rating was just 47 percent. Fifty percent viewed him unfavorably. The verdict on the Paul Ryan pick seems to be that he neither helped nor hurt. Obama won Ryan's congressional district in Wisconsin (based on a preliminary count of the votes, which could change), so his place on the Republican ticket not only didn't help Romney carry the state, it didn't seem to have helped him carry the portion he represents. Then again, Paul Ryan's Medicare plan was supposed to cost Romney the state of Florida. Those fears were wildly misplaced. Romney-Ryan actually clobbered the president with Florida's seniors. On the specific question of which candidate would better handle the issue of Medicare, Obama lost by a lot. Fifty-four percent of the state's seniors said they trusted Romney on Medicare over Obama, who only earned 40 percent of the vote. Regardless of what happens in the second term, the president won an enormous victory by protecting his first term's achievements, particularly the Affordable Care Act, which Romney had promised to repeal. Although he won by slimmer margins, he held on to all but two states he won in 2008. That's an incredible accomplishment when you consider the economy he has governed over for the past four years. (And the two states he gave back--North Carolina and Indiana--were always expected to fall back into the GOP column.) Politically, there is no reason to believe his second term will be easier than his first. Republicans will call it a tactical victory and look at the close national vote tally to convince themselves that there's nothing in this election that should cause them to concede ground during the coming budget fight. Barack Obama won in 2008 as a man who floated above the vast great nation. In 2012, he remade himself into a determined, street-level fighter for the middle-class. During his first campaign, Obama quoted Martin Luther King Jr., who said, ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."" He was the first African-American president in the nation's history. Now he is the first African-American president to be re-elected. Now that he is freed of the constraints that come from having to get re-elected, the president who put his grand visions on hold to survive, can get back to working on that bend."	How Obama Won Four More Years
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_big_idea/2012/11/why_romney_lost_he_couldn_t_separate_himself_from_the_republican_party_s.html	"What ought to pain Republicans most about Barack Obama's victory is that 2012 was entirely winnable for them. In European elections over the past few years, voters have thrown out leaders who were in charge during the worst of the financial crisis, whether those leaders deserved the blame or not. Economic indicators in the United States, where an unemployment rate of 8 percent is highly correlated with defeat for the incumbent party, pointed in the same direction. Obama himself had proven a disappointment to many of his former supporters, going from a beloved symbol of generational and social change in 2008 to a detached and remote figure, with limited ability to touch an emotional chord in the electorate. That Mitt Romney lost nonetheless is in part a tribute to his own weaknesses as a candidate. The Obama campaign put Romney on the defensive early about his work at Bain Capital, and left him there. The Republican nominee made any number of horrendous gaffes. He ran a disastrous GOP convention. He never found a way to talk about himself or his agenda in a way that middle class voters could relate to. But even a clumsy candidate might have beaten Obama if not for a simple factor that could not be overcome: the GOP's growing extremism. The Republican strategy of making the election a referendum on the president's handling of the economy was perfectly sound. The problem was that the Republican Party couldn't pass the credibility test itself. For many voters disenchanted with Obama, it still was not safe to vote for his opponent. This failure began with the spectacle of the extended primary season, which was dominated by candidates with views far outside the political mainstream. Rick Santorum rejected the separation of church and state. Newt Gingrich challenged the notion of judicial supremacy. Michele Bachmann claimed the government had been infiltrated by radical Muslims. Donald Trump refused to recognize the validity of Obama's birth certificate. Rick Perry wanted to take down more parts of the federal government than he could successfully name. In the debates, the country saw the GOP talking to itself and sounding like a bizarre fringe party, not a responsible governing one. Romney is not a right-wing extremist. To win the nomination, though, he had to feign being one, recasting himself as ""severely conservative"" and eschewing the reasonableness that made him a successful, moderate governor of the country's most liberal state. He had to pass muster with his party's right-wing base on taxes, immigration, climate change, abortion, and gay rights. Many of his statements on these issues were patently insincere, but that was hardly reassuring. Romney's very insincerity and flexibility made it improbable that he would stand up to the GOP's hyper-partisan congressional wing once elected any more than he had during the primaries. Romney's pandering to the base made it possible for the Obama campaign to portray him as a right-wing radical from the start of the campaign. Fear that he didn't have the base locked down kept Romney from moving smoothly to the center once he had secured the nomination. It further encouraged his choice of Paul Ryan, a popular figure with the Tea Party. And when Romney tried, much too late, to move closer to the center, Republican Senate candidates, like Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, kept popping up with disgusting reminders of the GOP's retrograde views on gender issues. For women, Latinos, and young voters tempted to abandon Obama, the old Romney might have been a plausible alternative. The new Romney, fettered by a feverish GOP, was too risky a choice.  According to exit poll results, Romney won men as expected, but lost among women by 11 points--too large a gender gap to be overcome. Demographic change and better economic circumstances stand to make the Republican road back to the White House an even steeper climb in future years. Simply put, the party has to present a more conciliatory and reasonable face to sell itself to swing voters. To do that, it must elevate its own moderate voices, cut loose its theocrats, and liberate itself from the domination of Tea Party know-nothings. So let the season of Republican recriminations begin. The GOP now faces the challenge of self-examination and internal reform that Democrats began to undertake after losing twice to Ronald Reagan. It desperately needs the kind of centrist reform movement that was led on the other side by the Democratic Leadership Council, which paved the way for the election of a centrist Democrat named Bill Clinton. Without that sort of renewal movement, the 2012 election may come to be seen less as a fluke than a harbinger. A version of this piece appears in the Financial Times."	Mitt Romney Lost Because of the GOP's Growing Extremism
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/gay_marriage_in_maryland_and_maine_the_inside_strategy.html	"Four years ago, LGBT advocates were devastated by the voter approval of Proposition 8 in California, which reversed a state court ruling allowing same-sex marriage. In that fight, the political consultant Frank Schubert, who led the anti-gay forces there and in the four states that voted on marriage this week, created a deadly ad campaign that played on lingering fears that gay equality threatens kids. In his advertisement, a schoolgirl returns home and cheerfully announces what she learned in school--that a prince can marry a prince, and she can marry a princess! In 2009, Schubert used the identical playbook to win a ballot measure in Maine invalidating the legislature's decision to let gays wed. Just three years later, the people of Maine did an about face, and along with Maryland voted Tuesday to let gay couples marry. (Update: voters also approved marriage equality in Washington state and rejected a constitutional amendment banning it in Minnesota.) Until this election, every state that had held a popular vote on the question--32 in a row--had rejected same-sex marriage. Maine and Maryland not only ended the losing streak but may have turned the war, depriving defenders of straight-only marriage of their latest talking point: that the people don't want gays to marry. (And let's not forget that Wisconsin elected Tammy Baldwin, the nation's first openly gay senator!) How same-sex marriage ballot initiatives turned around is all about the long game. The gay rights movement succeeded using one of the most sophisticated issue campaign operations ever deployed--and by making it stick with old-fashioned commitment, hard work, and face-to-face conversations. After the losses in Maine in 2009 and California a year earlier, LGBT advocates knew they needed to craft an effective response to Schubert's false message that gay equality harms kids. Enter Freedom To Marry. The umbrella group was founded in 2003 by the civil rights lawyer Evan Wolfson, who has consistently preached about winning hearts and minds in between elections rather than in the frenzied lead-up to them. While gay groups had spent millions of dollars on public opinion research before and after the Prop 8 loss in California, no one had ever stopped to pull it all together. Within weeks of the Maine loss, Freedom To Marry helped assemble a coalition of state-based gay groups, polling experts and academic researchers to centralize and share information so that each campaign didn't have to start from scratch for each new battle. What came out of this tightly coordinated effort was the key to dismantling the anti-gay myths of the last 40 years. For decades, gay advocates had framed their arguments in terms of equal rights and government benefits, often using rhetoric that was confrontational (""We're here, we're queer, get used to it"") and demanding (""We deserve equal rights now!""). Third Way, a centrist think tank working in the coalition with Freedom To Marry, began to unpack exactly how straight people reacted to such tactics. The group found that when straight people were asked what marriage meant to them, they spoke of love, commitment and responsibility. But when asked why they thought gay people wanted to marry, they cited rights and benefits. Tapping into anti-gay stereotypes, they suggested gay people wanted marriage for selfish reasons while they themselves wanted to express love and commitment. The gay rights coalition's response was the ""Why Marriage Matters"" campaign. Its message was ""love, commitment, family,"" with no mention of rights or benefits. On the surface, it looks like any garden-variety public education campaign, a little vague, a little sappy. But this message was the result of several years and millions of dollars of research. It signaled a sea change in the way gay advocates pled their case. This was a way to invite straight people to empathize with gay people, to reassure the majority that gay people wanted the same things that they did, and to shift focus from minority rights to points of commonality. The year Why Marriage Matters rolled out, 2011, was also the year that a slew of polls first showed majority national support for same-sex marriage. Thalia Zepatos* of Freedom To Marry, who oversees the coalition's messaging research, describes another revelation from the data. Schubert's misleading ""princess"" ads implied that schools could usurp the role of parents in teaching pro-gay values, but that was wrong. As Zepatos and her team pored over the research, they watched conversations in which voters spoke among themselves and kept circling back to the same insight: Parents are the parents, and they teach their kids values at home. The challenge, Zepatos and her colleagues determined, was to reassure voters about this conclusion. Parents knew they had the control, but the Schubert ads--which in the past have killed a pro-gay lead in the polls at the last minute--made them anxious about losing it. The first step to combatting that fear were ads that showed (among other story lines) a mom who was also a teacher speaking at home with her husband. ""What we do in a school is no substitute for what happens at home,"" she says. Her husband chimes in: ""No law is going to change the core values we teach our kids here at home.""  The takeaway: No one would force parents into uncomfortable conversations when their own child returned home from school. But advertising is a one-way conversation. Zepatos began to find that once voters became engaged (either by pro- or anti-forces), new concerns arose. The next step was to turn the messaging into a conversation. Working with Analyst Institute, a liberal group of social scientists who conduct randomized testing of voter contact efforts, the same-sex marriage campaigns field tested different approaches to these conversations with voters. The research, which even included a control group, showed which approaches worked with which groups. Older people might respond better to older messengers; pet owners might respond better to in-person conversations than to mailings. Armed with this kind of granular information, campaigners could work most effectively to shore up support among persuadable voters. In the end, the Maine campaign spoke to 250,000 people, nearly a fifth of the state's population--and that was likely the fifth that mattered most. This sort of effort is ongoing in more states beyond this week's election, such as Oregon, which may be next up for an initiative. Skeptics contend these tactics are a waste. Some think the gay rights issue is now a self-propelling snowball, and that demographics (the dying off of old homophobes) accounts more for progress than all the targeted activism. But we know these conversations work--and not only because of the election results Tuesday. Research shows that knowing a gay person makes you 65 percent more likely to support same-sex marriage--and having a conversation with that gay person about marriage raises the figure to 80 percent. Third Way recently released a report showing that 75 percent of positive change in support for same-sex marriage is due to people of every age group changing their minds. It's about having the right message and imparting it with patience and labor. ""People used to say winning the freedom to marry was impossible,"" Wolfson says. ""Now they say it's inevitable. What both have in common is that neither requires work."" Neither is true, either. Marriage equality will prevail--because of all the effort its supporters have poured into making that happen.

During the early voting period, Republicans were worried about the size of the early vote in Belmont, which is traditionally Democratic turf. Obama won it. Kerry won it. Romney should have been getting the vote there among coal country voters who were angry at the president's policies. So Republicans called voters in the county to see what was going on. They said they were voting for Romney. It turns out they were right. Obama beat McCain in the county by less than a percentage point. Romney is winning it 55 percent to 43 percent right now, with half of the vote in. So the GOP targeting in the state was correct, but their overall plan for Ohio does not appear to be. Obama seems to be moving toward a win. CBS has put Ohio into the lean Obama column.	Election Day Dispatches

 shift my interests from battleground tactics to palace intrigue. Since most Election Day leaks are almost always designed to make
 one side's prospects look stronger, the report earlier this evening 
from CNN's Peter Hamby that Romney's final internal tracking polls showed 
him behind 5 points in Ohio is being treated as news. We'll know soon how those numbers accord with the voting 
reality, but I wonder if that poll leak was the first move in the
 inevitable post-election blame game. Politico's Maggie Haberman and Emily Schultheis appropriately located pollster Neil Newhouse at the center of a looming storm about Romney's strategy. It 
is apparently his surveys that have undergirded the Romney campaign's 
optimism about its prospects in recent weeks, and more importantly the 
timid strategy that has carried Romney through the past two years.
 Leaking polls that showed Romney behind in Ohio, even while voters
 could still cast votes there, serves one interest above all: It puts 
down a marker that the pollster wasn't at fault. If Romney loses, much of the inside-baseball conversation will be: Did 
Newhouse give Romney bad numbers, or did his strategists read them 
wrong?"	Election Day Dispatches

The Democrat who managed NOT to speak up for the divinity of rape-induced pregnancy is clearly going to win Indiana's U.S. Senate seat, pushing aside Richard Mourdock and making it exceedingly difficult for Republicans to take the upper house. I know this because Donnelly is taking Vigo County (Terra Haute) by 20 points. That's better than the margin for Barack Obama in 2008, when he won the state. I'm not going to make too many sweeping projections based on votes like this, but Vigo counts fast. We've got almost 80 percent of that vote in. Obama didn't really contest Indiana this year, and he's narrowly losing Vigo County, by less than 100 votes. That puts him ahead of the Kerry vote here in 2004. Also--I'm using exit polls, and I shouldn't--he's running 12 points behind Mitt Romney. Kerry ran 20 points behind George W. Bush. Obviously, falling back to the usual crushing defeat in Indiana is lousy for the president. But if he's running 8 points ahead of Kerry in a blank canvas state, we have our first hint that the polls were not skewed.	Election Day Dispatches

It is the new normal, and on Election Day it is hard to assess how accurate the stories are. Already I've heard stories of voters in Ohio improperly being asked for ID, of votes flipping on electronic voting machines from Obama to Romney or vice versa, of Navy SEALs going to meet the Black Panthers at Philadelphia polling places, and of very long lines in parts of Miami and elsewhere. It will be a while before we can track down the truth of all of these rumors. We do know that a judge in Pennsylvania ordered an Obama mural in a polling place to be covered up, and another judge said that GOP election monitors could not be blocked from Philadelphia polling stations. And officials in Pinellas County, Fla.,  mistakenly sent out robocalls saying that voting will continue through tomorrow night. There's Florida, doing all it can to keep its crown as the worst place in the country when it comes to voting. Will any of these Election Day issues matter to the outcome of the race for the White House? Unless the presidential election is razor-thin in one of these states, the answer is no. Certainly it is hard to see an Obama mural causing someone to change his or her vote or be too intimidated to cast a ballot. And even bigger problems won't be decisive. Unless we have a very close election, the fact that hundreds of people may have been so discouraged by the long lines that they gave up to vote won't matter for the final result. So if Florida goes comfortably for Romney and Pennsylvania for Obama, the media will quickly lose interest in the story of what's wrong with our elections. That's true even if these problems may affect the outcome of other races on the ballot today. And that's too bad. The country has a short attention span, and when the media and public don't demand that we fix the election system in the offseason, it can never get done in time to avoid the next potential meltdown.

If we use the nine battleground states most people agree are in play, Barack Obama has 431 routes to the presidency, and Mitt Romney has 79. There are five possibilities for a 269 to 269 tie, which would throw the election to the House of Representatives and most likely lead to a Romney victory because the GOP will control the House. But let's not go down that road just yet. First, a viewer's guide to how the day will unfold and what you should look for as the votes come rolling in. 12 a.m.:
That's right. Election Day voting actually began at the stroke of midnight. That's when residents of Dixville Notch, N.H., cast their ballots. (The results are in! It was a tie, with five votes for Barack Obama and five votes for Mitt Romney.) This is also approximately the start time for rumors to begin about exit polls, fraud, intimidation, and landslide victories. Actual voting started in East Coast cities around 6 a.m., where polls opened in Virginia. Polls opened in Florida an hour later. There will be lots of stories today about turnout and what long or short lines mean for each campaign. (And we'll be peddling these stories and shooting them down on our Election Dispatches roundtable). The Obama team has done a better job than the Romney team in turning out the early vote, which they're telling reporters means their areas will have shorter lines. The Romney campaign promises to swamp their opponent on Election Day, making up for any deficit in the early vote. So look for heavy turnout in Republican areas--Duval County in Florida, Chesterfield County in Virginia, Butler county in Ohio--to see if the Republicans are matching their boast. Democrats may hardly line up in Nevada at all, where roughly 66 percent of the voting has already taken place. But if the lines are short in Virginia or New Hampshire, where most ballots are not cast early, then it might be a bad omen for Democrats. 5:30 p.m.:
Exit-poll rumors will start or already be underway. Ignore them. People will publish numbers and call them exit-poll numbers, but they will almost certainly be wrong or incomplete. Ignore analysis based on what people are calling exit polls until later in the night. 7 p.m.: Virginia (13) polls close, look for Indiana Senate race returns
If Barack Obama wins Virginia, Mitt Romney will have just 18 paths to 270 electoral votes. If Romney wins, Obama will have just 197. When Barack Obama won the commonwealth by 6.3 percentage points in 2008, it was a part of his new coalition. Before his victory, a Democrat had not won Virginia since LBJ in 1964. Obama beat McCain 52.6 percent to 46.3 percent, which almost matched his national percentage of 52.9. (Virginia is one of five states in 2008 in which Obama's percentage of the vote was below his national percentage. The others were Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida.) Watch Fairfax County to see if Obama is running up a big lead there. We'll get some idea about how well those messages about Romney's extreme views on abortion paid off with married, white, college-educated women. (If it did play well with these kinds of voters in Virginia, the question then becomes will it also play with the same demographic in Colorado?) Obama got 60 percent of Fairfax County in 2008 and needs to do very well here to combat Romney's likely advantage in rural counties and GOP strongholds like Chesterfield, Hanover, and Augusta. This pattern of Romney's strength in the rural areas against Obama's big margins in cities will be a constant theme throughout the night. Virginia is one state where the GOP ground game rivals Obama's. Prince William County in Northern Virginia is a swing county. George W. Bush won it twice, but Obama carried it in 2008 with 57 percent. The same is true in Henrico County, which sits like a hat on top of Richmond. This county has an African-American population at its core with conservative white suburbs. If Democrats are doing well in Henrico, then Obama will do well. Watch here also for the Tim Kaine-George Allen Senate race. Kaine was mayor of Richmond. He might win Henrico, even if the president loses it. In the southeastern portion of the state, the Hampton Roads area, Obama will have to do well with African-American voters in Newport News, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. This area--along with Northern Virginia--relies heavily on military spending, and Romney has tried to win over voters by criticizing the proposed cuts to the defense budget. In 1996, military spending accounted for 26 percent of Hampton Roads' local economy. Today, it's about 45 percent. We'll also get an inkling about whether Romney's attempt to go after voters unhappy with Obama's coal policies paid off in counties like Martinsville, Va. Obama visited Martinsville in 2008 and promised he wouldn't forget them. Danville, Bristol, and Abingdon are also areas where the GOP has held events under the title ""Rally for Appalachian Coal."" Indiana polls close at this time, too, and we'll soon learn the fate of Tea Party favorite Richard Mourdock, who retired longtime Sen. Dick Lugar in the Republican primary. Lugar would have held the seat easily, helping the Republicans gain control of the Senate. Now the state is a toss-up after Mourdock's comments about a child conceived of rape being a gift from God. 7:30 p.m.: Polls close in Ohio (18) and North Carolina (15)
Say it with me now: No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio. If Romney loses the Buckeye State, his 76 chances for reaching 270 will shrink to 11. The president needs to run up his vote in Cuyahoga County (68 percent or more) to offset Republican strength in Butler, Warren, and Clermont* counties, areas surrounding the swing county of Hamilton (which includes Cincinnati), where Obama won in 2008. (Obama was the first Democrat to win Hamilton County in four decades.) He'll need to win there again or hold Romney to a small victory. Obama needs to do well in Franklin County (Columbus), which has become friendlier for Democrats in recent years. If you want to fixate on a bellwether county, look at Lake County, which is east of Cuyahoga. It usually matches the statewide vote. Also look to Wood and Ottawa, northern counties between Toledo and Cleveland that have gone to the state's winner in every presidential election since 1992. See my piece from yesterday about the questions I'm asking about what the Ohio outcome might tell us. Incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown is fighting off a challenge from Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel in what became a nasty fight. Expectations are that this will not be a Republican pickup. North Carolina: Before Obama won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes in 2008, a Democrat had not won the state since Carter won in 1976. Obama beat McCain by 14,000 votes. His 49.9 percent of the vote was below his national percentage of 52.9 percent. (North Carolina is one of five red zone states--also, Indiana, Virginia, Ohio, and Florida--in which Obama's 2008 percentage was below his national percentage.) North Carolina is Romney's most likely victory from the Obama 2008 map, and the state, like Virginia, that will test the durability of Obama's coalition of young voters, urban professionals, minorities. The theory of the ""new south"" is that explosive population growth, particularly from out-of-state college-educated voters, could push states like North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida into the Democratic column. This election may prove whether this theory has real merit or whether Obama winning those states last time was an anomaly. For the president to win in North Carolina, he'll need to have fantastic numbers with African-Americans--21 percent of the population--and young voters. Obama will need to run up his margins in the cities. His strong counties are Wake (Raleigh), Mecklenburg (Charlotte), and Durham.* If Obama doesn't get 60 percent in those counties, he's in trouble. Republicans have to do well in Union and Gaston, where if Obama can get 34 percent or more of the vote, he'll have eaten into Romney's chance to run up his margin. Buncombe, Forsyth, and Wake counties all went for Obama after twice going for President Bush. 8 p.m.: Polls close in Florida (29), New Hampshire (4), and Pennsylvania(20)
Polls start to close in Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern time, but a portion of the state is in the Central time zone, so they close at 8 EST. If Florida goes for the president, it could be an early night. If Obama wins Florida, Romney has only one path to the presidency: winning every other battleground state. One Florida political strategist described Florida as three states and two countries. In the north, they vote for Republicans. Duval County (Jacksonville) and all the way through the panhandle is a Republican stronghold, along with Brevard County on the eastern coast. In the southeast, they vote for Democrats (Miami-Dade County and Broward County). The middle, along the I-4 corridor, both parties fight for swing voters. (Forty-three percent of all registered voters live in the Tampa Bay media market or the Orlando media market, the two ends of the I-4 corridor.) The two countries the strategist talked about are made up of Cubans, who tend to vote for Republicans, and the non-Cuban Hispanics who vote for Democrats. There are now more non-Cuban Hispanics in Florida than Cubans. Just over 42 percent of the state's citizens are minorities, a key part of Obama's coalition. To win, a candidate must run up the margins in their strong counties (Obama won by 140,000 in Miami-Dade in 2008; McCain won by 30,000 votes in Brevard) and try to hold their opponents to small margins in their strong areas (Obama held McCain to a 7,000 vote victory in Duval through a big turnout of African-American voters). Then, they have to win enough of the I-4 swing counties. How close is the state? Since 1992, there have been five presidential elections. In Florida, the GOP won 2, Democrats won 2, and there is one everyone will always fight over. In total over those races, 32.5 million people have voted--and the overall difference in votes is 60,000, or 0.017 percent. Things to look for in the 8 p.m. exit polls: Did Romney do well among women, because the older voters Republicans traditionally capture tend to be disproportionately female? What percentage of voters say they were contacted by the campaign? Florida is a ground-game-intensive state. New Hampshire is important mostly because Romney shouldn't lose it. He was governor of a neighboring state, he's got a home near lake Winnipesaukee, and he won the primary there after a concerted campaign. The key area is Hillsborough County around Manchester and Rockingham County around Brentwood. Obama won them both in 2008 after George Bush won them in 2000 and 2004. Also, at this hour we'll start to get returns from Pennsylvania, and we will see if Romney's last-minute gambit in the Keystone State paid off. We should also begin to hear noises about Maine's odd electoral-vote split at this point. Two votes go to the statewide winner and one goes to the top vote-getter inside each congressional district. And of course it's a big hour for the Senate: Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, and Missouri all close at this hour. In Maine, if Angus King wins, he'll be elected as an independent. Depending on how the other Senate races go, which party he decides to caucus with will determine control of the Senate. Missouri is the second state of the year where a conservative--in this case Todd Akin--may lose the race because of comments about rape. If Elizabeth Warren defeats incumbent Scott Brown, she will slow the GOP march to control of the Senate by stealing a vote from their column. Former wrestling executive Linda McMahon would flip the Connecticut seat to the Republican column from independent, but she has been losing in the polls. 9 p.m.: Polls close in Wisconsin (10) and Colorado (9)
By this hour the map on your television screens will be filled with lots of states clearly likely to go to each of the candidates--New York, Texas, and Georgia. Wisconsin is a key part of the Obama Midwestern firewall. Minorities aren't as important here. Labor support is. The president's two big counties are Milwaukee, where he won with 68 percent of the vote in 2008, and Dane County, home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He's had monster rallies at Madison, including after the first debate when he fell asleep onstage. Look to see if there is a lot of same-day registration in Dane County on Election Day. Ten percent of Wisconsin voters registered on Election Day in 2008, according to the Obama campaign. They're banking on that again. (Iowa and New Hampshire are two other battleground states with same-day registration.) The strong Republican counties follow a familiar pattern we've seen in other states. They ring the big Democratic areas. So watch Waukesha and Washington. (Say that three times fast!) Romney needs to get 70 percent of the vote there. Also look at Marathon County, in the northwestern part of the state. Romney should get 55 percent there to win. Your Wisconsin swing county is Brown, home of Green Bay. Colorado is another state that tests the Obama theory about the new electorate. Hispanic voters make up 14 percent of the population. The question is will they turn out? A Pew Hispanic survey from early October showed Latino voters supported Obama by a 3-to-1 ratio but are less certain about voting--77 percent of Latino registered voters say they're ""absolutely certain"" to vote, compared with 89 percent of all registered voters. The Colorado electorate is packed with prosperous young professionals--more than half of the electorate is college-educated, one of the highest levels among battleground states--and that's a group Obama does well with. But the key group to watch is suburban college-educated women. They helped Sen. Michael Bennet beat back the GOP tide in 2010 by convincing those women that his Republican opponent was an extremist on social issues. That was harder for Obama to do with Romney. Look for the results from Denver suburbs and Larimer County to see if Obama is doing well with this demographic again. Romney has to do well in the rural counties and run up votes in the GOP strongholds of El Paso (Colorado Springs), Douglas (south of Denver), Weld, and Mesa counties. In Wisconsin's Senate race, Tammy Baldwin is trying to hold a Democratic seat against popular former Gov. Tommy Thompson. If Thompson loses, it will be another piece of evidence in the case against the Tea Party. He spent a lot of money and time fighting off a primary challenge that might have hurt his general election chances. 10 p.m: Polls close in Iowa (6) and Nevada (6)
By now some battleground states will probably have been called. Routes to the presidency will have narrowed. The Obama campaign went into Election Day thinking it had these two states locked. Iowa is the spiritual birthplace of the Obama campaign, where his caucus victory in 2008 propelled him to the White House. At his last rally there Monday night, the president was emotional. Iowa has the lowest unemployment rate of the battleground states. The competition in the state is so close that both sides even use the same language to talk about it. ""It started here and it ends here,"" says Sue Dvorsky, the chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party, explaining why Obama will win. Iowa's Republican Gov. Terry Branstad said, ""We're the state that launched Obama, but I think in this election we're the state that's going to sink him."" There are more registered independents in Iowa than registered Republicans or Democrats. In all states, the candidates will both try to maximize turnout of their base and win over swing voters, but the question in different states will be: which is the priority? Veteran Iowa pollster Ann Selzer argues that Iowa is different than states like Pennsylvania or North Carolina, where the emphasis is more on base turnout than converting swing voters. In Iowa, there are more voters sloshing around in the middle. The key area for Obama is Polk County (Des Moines), smack in the middle of the state. Republicans need to do well in Dallas, just outside Des Moines, and the western counties like Sioux and Woodbury, as well as the rural counties. Democrats must do well in the eastern counties. Nevada: This battleground state may be the easiest to understand. Clark County (Las Vegas) is the largest county, and Democrats traditionally win there. It is perhaps the best county to look at to test a larger theme of this election: economics vs. demographics. Sixty-seven percent of the houses in Clark have mortgages that are bigger than the home's value. But the county is nearly 30 percent Hispanic. In Colorado, Republicans win the rural counties, so Romney will have to win places like Douglas County by 64 percent. The bellwether county is Washoe (Reno). If Obama wins Washoe, he will win the state. Montana Senate race: Incumbent Democrat Jon Tester faces a challenge from Rep. Denny Rehberg. If you want to know what happens to the Senate, you might need to stay up for this race. It could be the crucial seat to determine whether the GOP can take control of the Senate. 11 p.m.:
Voting has ended in all states but Alaska, which will not determine the election. Based on the way these things have gone in the past, a call might be made between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.. But if you've reached this portion of the program and there doesn't seem to be a clear trend in Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin for President Obama, then you might want to consider going to bed. It's likely to be a long night. If Romney pulls it out in early states, the result will likely be close, which means lots of caution and probably some disputes in battleground states. Oh, and if you're thinking about the popular vote, don't stay up. That won't be finalized for a few days. Correction, Nov. 6, 2012: This article originally misspelled Clermont County. It also said Charletson, instead of Charlotte, was in Mecklenburg County."	Slate's Election Day Viewer's Guide: What To Watch as the Votes Come Rolling In.
