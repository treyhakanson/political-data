But there may be a silver lining: Beau Biden is not running for Senate in Delaware. Biden was a Democratic favorite but by no means a shoo-in. Polls showed him trailing Republican Rep. Mike Castle consistently since April. And Castle is a good campaigner. Over four decades in state politics, he's never lost a race. Biden, meanwhile, won his only election in 2006 by a mere five points. Still, Democrats rallied behind Biden because he was the best they had. Or maybe not. In a year when Democrats are preparing to get clobbered, Biden would have played into many of the narratives that swept Scott Brown into office in Massachusetts last week. In that context, Biden has several glaring weaknesses: He's the Man. Scott Brown ran against the Democratic establishment and won. You don't get more Democratic or more establishment than Biden. It would be a little rich for a septuagenarian Republican to run on a platform on change. But anti-establishment sentiment would likely overcome any cognitive dissonance. Now, whomever the Democrats choose instead will likely be an unknown who can run more credibly as an outsider. He's the son of the Man. The appearance of nepotism would have hurt. Biden's election as attorney general in 2006 was his first foray into political office. Since then, he's had a heavy work load, plus a high-profile new case against a pedophile pediatrician. But against a Republican with 40 years of experience, Biden's four years would look rather paltry. Castle would also question whether Biden's fast rise was due to talent or his last name. Massachusetts Democrats may have loved Ted Kennedy, but they chafed at the notion that the seat belonged to Kennedy, or any Kennedy, or any Democrat. Delaware Democrats might think along the same lines. The race would reflect on Joe. However much the White House tries to distance itself from the campaign, Beau's ups and downs would likely become the administration's--and vice versa. The White House would have to answer questions about the young Biden's inevitable flubs, while Biden would be forced to answer for administration policies, even if he has nothing to do with them. In a year when Democrats will try to distance themselves from the White House's unpopular policies--health care reform, the bailout, the stimulus--Beau would be especially tarred. Joe would reflect on the race. Not only would the White House be asked to answer for Beau's mistakes--it would probably respond. Joe Biden's apparent inability to keep his thoughts to himself was a catalyst for Beau's announcement that he wouldn't run. (He reportedly asked a journalist to talk his son into it, because Beau didn't want to run. Biden's office has a different account.) It's hardly speculation to assume that Joe would have continued to weigh in, for the worse. Castle might get Scozzafava'd. Any moderate Republican who's been around as long as Castle has cast votes that aren't going to sit well in the current climate. Among them is his vote for cap and trade. During last year's infamous town halls, Castle drew heat from conservatives for being ""one of the eight Republican traitors."" (He was also booed for asserting that Barack Obama is a U.S. citizen.) Now a tea party activist is considering challenging Castle from the right. If that happens, Democrats could be better off than expected--no matter who they run. That's not to say Democrats are in much better shape without Biden than with him. But his decision not to run seems like an unmitigated blow only if you ignore the alternative."	Beau Biden's decision not to run for Senate spares Democrats a headache.
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/boston_massacre.html	"BOSTON--When Martha Coakley conceded the election to Scott Brown Tuesday night, a cheer went up at Brown's rally at the Park Plaza Hotel. ""Seat him now! Seat him now!"" It was a scene previously relegated to Democratic nightmares. It couldn't possibly get worse. Then it did: ""John Kerry's next! John Kerry's next!"" Brown's victory speech probably didn't cheer them up. He promised to honor the memory of Sen. Edward Kennedy. But he also said that ""in health care, we need to start fresh, work together, and do the job right."" He spoke of ""coming together"" but also characterized the Democrats' agenda as ""raising taxes, taking over our health care, and giving new rights to terrorists."" He thanked Democrat Paul Kirk for filling the Senate seat--but also suggested his work there is done. And, finally, a warning: ""What happened in this election can happen all over America."" Everyone has his or her own interpretation of why Brown won and Coakley lost. Which is why the aftermath of this election is likely to be as acrimonious as the election itself: No one can prove or disprove anything. Even more than usual, the pundits and analysts don't really know what they're talking about. There's only so much we can learn from this election, largely because there were no exit polls. Normally, a consortium of news organizations pays a company to conduct surveys outside polling locations--but only when there's enough interest in the race to justify it. By the time national media started paying attention to the race, it was too late. As a result, we don't know to what extent independents swung to Brown. We don't know how many women voted for Brown instead of Coakley. We don't know whether Obama's appearance drew more African-Americans to the polls than usual. We don't know why voters favored Brown, or when they made up their minds. Perhaps they liked his ideas on health care, his plan to keep Guantanamo open, or his smile. For all we know, his truck sealed the deal. This lack of information has not resulted in a lack of commentary. Some think Coakley botched the race by not campaigning hard enough and by twice insulting a beloved sports franchise. Others say national Democrats fell down on the job. Some say a better politician, like Rep. Michael Capuano, would have destroyed Brown. Others say any Democrat would have lost--that it was baked into the proverbial cake. Of course, it was a convergence of factors. The political climate may have been primed against Democrats, but it took a complacent state party and a formidable Republican whose skills didn't become apparent until it was too late to take advantage of the environment. It was a perfect failure. That won't stop national Republicans from saying it was an across-the-board repudiation of Obama's agenda. (As Democrats pointed out, Brown himself rejected this notion.) Nor will it stop Massachusetts Republicans from claiming it's the beginning of a new era for the state. Others will say Scott Brown is simply the greatest Republican candidate of his generation. (Calls for a presidential run were already being voiced on Tuesday.) On the Democratic side, recriminations began flying even before the polls closed. First, David Axelrod said the White House would have done more to help if only the Coakley campaign had asked. Team Coakley in turn leaked a memo arguing that the DNC ""failed"" them. National Democrats responded by pointing the finger at the Coakley camp for failing to define Brown before he defined himself. Coakley campaign officials blamed Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. Robert Gibbs reported that the president is ""not pleased."" Meanwhile, Republicans rushed to take credit. Michael Steele blasted out a memo pointing out that the RNC was ""working very diligently behind the scenes."" The NRSC announced that it had quietly sunk a half-million dollars into the race. At the Brown rally, an aspiring congressional Republican sidled up to the press table: ""I just want to say, I've been supporting Brown since the beginning."" Unclear is what comes next. ""It's bad for Obama"" doesn't quite sum it up. Possible scenarios for Democrats still range from ""1994"" to ""actually pretty OK."" Worst case scenario--and probably least likely--Brown's 41st vote in the Senate destroys health care reform and gridlocks the rest of Obama's agenda, from regulatory reform to cap-and-trade. Brown's vote might not even be necessary: Moderate Democrats, seeing the vote in Massachusetts as a referendum on health care reform, could bail even without Republicans filibustering. (Sen. Evan Bayh has already signaled his concern.) Some Democrats might even retire to avoid humiliation in 2010, while Democrats who stay and fight go down under a populist wave. More likely, Democrats make health care work. They still have options: Pass the Senate bill in the House and send it directly to the president's desk. Or scrap all the changes to the Senate bill except for funding provisions, and pass those using the reconciliation process, which requires a bare majority rather than 60 votes. They might not even need to delay seating Brown. Democrats may still have trouble passing other legislation. But Brown probably wouldn't be the be-all-end-all obstructionist his fans think. He could well be in the Olympia Snowe mold rather than the Mitch McConnell mold. Not cooperative, exactly, but persuadable. Meanwhile, passing health reform could help pull Democrats out of their Bay State depression and give them a major talking point on the campaign trail in 2010. (This assumes that current opposition to the bill will diminish once people actually start benefiting from it, as when Congress first passed Medicare.) Expecting anything more seems overly optimistic for Dems. But as Brown's victory showed, a lot can change in two weeks. Even more can change in the next 10 months."	What Scott Brown's victory in Massachusetts does and doesn't mean.
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/state_of_shock.html	"BOSTON--President Obama flew in Sunday for a last-minute campaign stop for beleaguered senatorial candidate Martha Coakley. In his speech, besides the usual exhortations to the party faithful, he managed to work in several snide references to her opponent's truck as a symbol of false populism. Coakley's opponent, Republican Scott Brown, was flabbergasted. ""Unbelievable,"" he said. ""The leader of the free world is talking about my truck."" The last 24 hours before polls opened in Massachusetts had a similar, is-this-really-happening, holy-crap-it's-really-happening kind of feel. As Brown cruised around the state--not always in his truck, but certainly alongside it--he encountered crowds that were undeniably more energetic, emotional, and populous than those that greeted Coakley, the one-time Democratic front-runner. Yes, some were bused in. Others drove on their own from out of state. But most were Massachusetts conservatives who felt like their votes mattered for the first time. The signs people waved echoed those of the tea parties--""I'm Not Obama's ATM,"" ""The Scott Heard Round the World."" But this time, they were looking for more than airtime on Fox. ""I can't sleep,"" said Paul Tusini of Boxford, who showed up at a rally for Brown in North Andover, a suburb north of Boston. ""It's all I can think about."" ""The world is watching, not just the country,"" said Stephen F. Jackman, a bearded man wearing a red plaid jacket and waving a huge ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag.  Hundreds of people lined the town's Main Street Monday afternoon. Dozens more gathered that morning in front of TD Banknorth Garden in Boston, where Brown greeted Bruins fans as they passed. (The rallies were infectious even to people who don't follow politics. ""Woo hoo! Go Brown!"" cheered Chris Pires, a Brockton native who was selling Bruins hats. He later said he did not know Brown was a Republican.) Several hundred more showed up to his final pre-Election Day rally in his hometown of Wrentham. These numbers could mean nothing. Or they could mean everything. For days, Massachusetts has been flying blind. Reliable polling is hard to come by, and the data we do have are ever-changing. (Although the smart money is on Brown.) Turnout is impossible to predict. And zeal is impossible to quantify. But the lack of information only heightens the excitement. It's like a basketball game in which the hoop is obscured and the score is hidden; you don't know until the end how many shots actually went in. Which leaves the candidates no choice but to plug away. Brown is remarkably good at this, repeating his message like a mantra. He's Scott Brown. He drives a truck. It has 200,000 miles on it. (Actually, 201,084 at last glance.) He wants to change things in Washington. And he is shocked and disturbed, quite frankly, by the negative campaigning by Martha Coakley. Her suggestion that he supports denying emergency abortions to rape victims isn't just wrong, he says, it's borderline criminal. ""There's negative campaigning,"" he told the Andover crowd. ""Then there's being malicious. Then there's illegal."" In a radio interview, he suggested he might consider legal action after the campaign was over. ""All I have to say is, 'Shame on Martha!' "" Brown said in Andover, prompting a chant. Brown's supporters take their politics personally. In person, Coakley seems perfectly warm and down-to-earth. On the stump, she's slightly distant but still calm and reasonable. In the eyes of Brown supporters, she's hellspawn. ""Vindictive,"" ""cold,"" and ""uninformed"" were three of the kinder words Brown supporters had for her. Or, worse: ""She has no star power,"" said Regina Schwarzenberg, who drove to Wrentham from Newport, R.I. ""I've never seen a race like this, so malicious,"" said Michael Niederer, a student at Emerson College who supports Brown. Aside from umbrage, Brown's second strongest weapon has been Coakley's gaffes, of which he makes sure supporters keep a running list. There's the time she thought Curt Schilling, the hero of the Red Sox's 2004 defeat of the Yankees in the American League Championship Series, was a Yankees fan. (Admittedly devastating.) Then there was that time she went to Washington to raise money from lobbyists. (Again, bad move.) Also, she doesn't think there are any terrorists left in Afghanistan. (OK, so she has a problem.) But to be fair, the mudslinging on both sides has been fairly tame, by national standards. If the worst thing Coakley did was distort Brown's stance on abortion, he got off pretty easy. If Brown's worst sin was his failure to pay his staffers' health insurance, well, it could have been worse. If the worst gaffe either candidate made was a sports mix-up, not bad. Likewise, heads remained relatively cool: The closest thing to an act of violence I saw from either side was a burnt Coakley sign in Hyannis and a poster in Boston that read ""If it's Brown, Flush it Down."" Still, exaggeration prevailed. Coakley isn't just the 60th vote on health care. She's a symbol of ""tyranny."" The Democrats don't just want to reform health care. They want government-run health care. Brown, meanwhile, enjoys parallel deification. One sign referred to him as ""Hottie McAwesome."" ""He crosses all ethnic and socioeconomic boundaries,"" said Suzanne Shroba, of North Attleboro. ""I'm a physician, and my janitor is voting for Brown, too."" ""If he becomes senator, he's going to be president,"" a woman commented in Wrentham. Other Bay State Republicans expect to benefit from his victory, too. Republican Marty Lamb, a Brown supporter who plans to run for the House this year against Rep. Jim McGovern, hopes to get a boost from Brown's momentum. Even out-of-state GOPers expect to ride the wave. ""Right now, we're fourth and long,"" said Don Murphy, a staffer for a Republican who's running for Congress in true-blue Maryland. ""If Brown wins, we're third and long, but our odds greatly improve."" Democrats may still be unable to conceive of a Republican victory in Massachusetts. But Republicans on the ground are having no trouble conceiving it. To many of them, it's already a reality."	Why Massachusetts will (probably) elect Republican Scott Brown to replace Ted Kennedy.
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/yootube.html	"How did he do it? It's a question John Yoo has been getting a lot lately. How did he manage to outwit Jon Stewart? (""He slipped through my fingers,"" Stewart recalled after Yoo's recent appearance on The Daily Show. ""It was like interviewing sand."") Easy, says Yoo. ""I've spent my whole career learning to settle down unruly college students who have not done the reading."" Yoo reflected on his Daily Show experience Friday during a luncheon in Washington hosted by the Federalist Society--as friendly an audience as Stewart's was unfriendly--pegged to the release of his new book,  Crisis and Command, about executive power throughout American history. He came to talk about presidential power and how the best presidents have been the ones willing to make bold decisions without congressional approval. But all anyone wants to know about is what it's like to be on the Daily Show. He said: ""Despite three books and I don't know how many journal articles, it's the only thing I've done that's ever gotten the notice of my students."" Opponents of the Bush administration's use of torture had high expectations for Monday's interview. Finally, Stewart would take the same razor to Yoo that had so memorably eviscerated the likes of Tucker Carlson, Chris Matthews, Jim Cramer, and Betsy McCaughey. The Orwellian logic that undergirded the ""torture memos"" would collapse once and for all. The punishment would be so cruel, so unusual, Yoo would beg for water-boarding. Not quite. The interview was an exercise in frustration. Stewart didn't come at Yoo with gotcha questions, as Yoo's critics might have liked. Instead, he asked open-ended ones--""Are you a good lawyer?""--presumably intended to give Yoo enough rope to hang himself. Instead, Yoo was swinging from it. Yoo didn't dodge questions so much as reframe them, answer them in an extremely friendly and civil way, and--insult to injury--tack on a joke at the end to show he's a good sport. Stewart actually took a commercial break for relief. Oh, also: ""I didn't prepare at all,"" Yoo told me on Friday. Stewart's performance was widely deemed a failure. He was too conciliatory. He didn't ask about whether torture works or not. He didn't correct Yoo on his factual fudging, such as his claim that Abu Zubayda was a No. 3 leader of al-Qaeda, nor did he challenge him on whether interrogators had crossed the line between harsh interrogation and torture. Stewart himself later apologized for not ""nailing"" Yoo. But was ""nailing"" him ever a possibility? Yoo has slipped the grasp of many critics through the years. Part of the reason is his demeanor: calm, good-humored, endlessly patient. It throws people, especially those expecting a younger, Korean Dick Cheney. But it's also Yoo's rhetorical skill. Stewart failed to ""nail"" Yoo not because he wasn't prepared. (Although perhaps Stewart could have quoted some of the harsher memos.) He failed because Yoo is a lawyer. The chief criticism against Yoo is that, as deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel after 9/11, he gave the Bush administration legal cover to torture suspected terrorists. In a time of war, he wrote in what became known as the ""torture memos,"" the president has expanded power to make decisions without congressional approval. When it comes to what's torture and what's not, he wrote, only treatment that inflicts suffering equivalent to organ failure ""or even death"" constitutes torture. In later interviews, he suggested that nothing--no law and no treaty--could stop the president from ordering torture if the circumstances required it. Yoo wasn't advocating these techniques, he can say. He was simply answering the question of whether the Constitution allows the president to make these decisions in a time of war. Even if his interpretation of the law led to the use of these techniques, that was the decision of the person ordering them--not the person who interpreted the law as allowing them. It's the difference between law and policy, he said. In a brief interview before his speech, I asked him if he thought some of the methods interrogators used after 9/11 crossed the line between harsh interrogation and torture. ""I really don't know,"" he said. ""It all depends on the circumstances."" Lawyers are not hired to say what to do in this or that situation, he said. ""That's up to the people who know all the facts."" And that's why Stewart was set up to fail. No matter what the question, Yoo was able to fall back on vagaries about constitutional interpretation, war and peace, and presidential power. Your beef isn't with me, he seemed to say. It's with the Founding Fathers. They left the powers of the presidency deliberately vague in order to give the president wiggle room, which the greatest presidents--Lincoln, FDR--have seized. Plenty of scholars dispute this view of the presidency. And Yoo's view of history may well be oversimplified, as Jeffrey Rosen argued on a panel with Yoo on Thursday: Lincoln didn't consult Congress before declaring war against the South, for example, but he did afterward. Stewart could have raised similar points. But those aren't damning witticisms. They're nuanced arguments, to which the most likely reaction would be ""Hmm, that sounds sensible."" Stewart is effective when his opponent is making a foolish point, not when he has an unorthodox constitutional interpretation. Which is why Stewart wasn't going to pin Yoo down--even if he had done all the reading."	Why Jon Stewart failed to make John Yoo squirm.

But in Massachusetts, Republicans are by definition RINOs. If you're not a RINO, you don't get elected. Maybe that's why conservative Republican Scott Brown's candidacy for Ted Kennedy's U.S. Senate seat got so little attention for so long. He trailed his Democratic counterpart, Attorney General Martha Coakley, in the polls and in fundraising. Local media dismissed him. The national party ignored him. But in the last few weeks, polls have shown Brown closing the gap. (Although that gap ranges anywhere from 17 points to 1 point). Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty blasted out fundraising e-mails for him. A Ron Paul-style ""moneybomb"" this week reaped more than $1 million in a day. And the Democrats are getting skittish: The DNC sent a top aide to Boston to help out, Bill Clinton will campaign for Coakley on Friday, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is dropping $600,000 on TV ads in the region. Brown may still be a long shot, but the stakes outweigh the odds. Losing Kennedy's seat--""the people's seat,"" Brown corrects--wouldn't be just symbolically humiliating for Democrats. It would lose them their 60th vote in the Senate. Without a filibuster-proof majority, passing health care reform would be complicated at best. At worst, it could derail the whole effort, along with much of President Obama's 2010 agenda. What's so bizarre about Brown's sudden threat is that Republicans like him simply don't win in Massachusetts. Sure, they get elected to the state senate representing conservative districts, as Brown did. But they don't win statewide or national office. For decades, Massachusetts Republicans have had a formula for victory: fiscally conservative, socially liberal. Gov. Bill Weld famously supported gay marriage and abortion rights. Mitt Romney also supported gay rights as governor--a stance that came back to haunt him when he ran for president in 2008--and Gov. Paul Cellucci affirmed Roe v. Wade. Bay State voters like having a tightwad governor to serve as a check against the spendthrift Democratic state legislature, the thinking goes, but not one who will interfere on social issues. (Senators are a slightly different story: Republicans haven't occupied a seat since 1979.) Brown outflanks them all. He doesn't just talk up his anti-tax credentials. (He took an anti-tax pledge to kick off his campaign.) He supports water-boarding. He endorses using military tribunals, instead of civilian courts, to try terrorists. He questions whether climate change is man-made. And he criticized Coakley for opposing the latest troop increase in Afghanistan. He even leans right on the untouchables, gay marriage and abortion--at least, by Massachusetts standards. He thinks marriage is between a man and a woman and voted in favor of a failed ban on gay marriage. (Brown points out his stance is the same as Obama's.) He's fudgy when it comes to abortion. On the one hand, he sounds like Obama: ""While this decision should ultimately be made by the woman in consultation with her doctor, I believe we need to reduce the number of abortions in America,'' he said, essentially taking a pro-choice stance. Then again, he has the endorsement of the pro-life group Massachusetts Citizens for Life, supports parental-notification requirements, and opposes partial-birth abortion. Can he win? It's been years since Massachusetts has elected a conservative Republican. Why would it start now? The answer is a two-parter: He needs to win independents, and independents are getting more conservative. Republicans account for a mere 11 percent of registered voters in Massachusetts. Independents make up 51 percent. And polls show that independent voters are nervous about national issues like health care reform, Guantanamo, and terrorist trials, according to Tufts University political science professor Kent Portney. If the issues in the election were gay marriage and abortion, Brown's stances might be liabilities. Brown's strategy also has to do with a changing ideological landscape. Rockefeller Republicans are a dying breed, says Marion Just, a political science professor at Wellesley College: ""Brown represents the newer, younger version that does not embrace those values."" Running to the right also sets Brown up for victory down the road--no matter what the election's outcome. ""My guess is that he believed he wasn't going to win this race,"" says Jeffrey Berry, a professor of political science at Tufts University. ""So instead, he's trying to embellish his career and rise above the obscurity of being a state senator in a state senate that ignores Republicans."" (There are five Republicans in the 40-seat Senate.) Brown also avoids the Romney problem: If he does eventually seek another national office, he won't have to moderate his positions. The most frustrating part for Democrats is that Republicans win either way. The party wins if Brown wins--sidelining health care, quashing cap-and-trade, and kicking off the 2010 comeback. And it wins if he loses--if the results are close in Massachusetts, imagine how close they'll be in, say, Nevada. Or Colorado. Or New York. Democratic morale will plummet. GOP donations will flood in. The renaissance will have begun. And Massachusetts will finally have an actual Republican."	Can a conservative Republican get elected senator in Massachusetts?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/watch_what_they_say_not_who_they_do.html	"Sex has long reigned supreme in the pantheon of Washington political scandals. But these days, the ""word scandal"" is giving it a run for its money. From the evidence of the last few days, the conclusion is nearly inescapable: Washington now finds words more interesting than sex. The current focus is the frenzy and titillation over Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's comment about President Obama's use (or lack thereof) of a ""Negro dialect,"" which appears in a new book about the 2008 campaign. The frenzy itself isn't surprising: A single word was enough to tip the scales against Virginia Sen. George Allen in his 2006 defeat. Vice President Joe Biden will probably never outlive calling Obama ""clean"" and ""nice-looking""--a quote I maintain was missing a crucial comma--while Obama himself spent days apologizing for his observation that bitter Pennsylvanians ""cling to guns or religion."" What's surprising is that this detail has received far more attention than all the other juicy scooplets in the book--particularly the ones about sex. The authors say Clinton campaign had a special war room just to handle Bill's infidelities and detail how blatant John Edwards was about his own affair during the campaign. There isn't room for a complete taxonomy of political gaffes. But let's distinguish fodder for word scandals from more pedestrian gaffes--mispronounced words, calling people by the wrong name (the kind that Slate dined out on for eight years of the Bush presidency). A word scandal essentially meets Michael Kinsley's definition of a political gaffe: When a politician tells the truth. The Wilson corollary is when a politician says what he really thinks. The reason these little flubs are so fascinating--or at least newsworthy--is that they are seen as a window into the politician's ""true"" thoughts or personality, the one aides and friends are familiar with but rarely talk about.  As anyone who works on Capitol Hill can attest, most politicians are at least as crude and vulgar as the rest of us and, many cases, considerably more so. The immediate impulse with a word scandal is to extrapolate from that little glimpse a complete persona, and it's rarely a flattering one. It was easy, for those so inclined, to imagine that Obama always privately spoke of the disaffected working class with the same condescension. When Trent Lott bemoaned the failure of Strom Thurmond's 1948 president bid, on a pro-segregation ticket, it wasn't difficult to imagine that he said much worse things in privacy among the like-minded. Jumping to conclusions like this is unfair, of course. But with so little information available about what a politician is really like, what else are we supposed to do? In the Reid word scandal, a vast Democratic machinery has more or less quelled any impression that the majority leader frequently refers to blacks as Negros or harbors any latent racist feelings. But others have not been so lucky. Lott had to resign as the Senate Majority leader, for example, and resigned altogether five years later. Meanwhile, senators who admit to extramarital affairs or dalliances with prostitutes are commonplace--and both of those guys are still around. American politics has reached the point where it's easier to survive a sex scandal than a word scandal. Demanding that the talkers be punished, as RNC Chairman Michael Steele did this weekend, only encourages politicians to say less and return fewer calls. At this rate, the best insights into a politician's mind will come from the likes of Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who has a habit of forgetting that his microphone is on. (It has happened at least twice. Once he called protestors at a hearing ""assholes""; another time he told Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., to ""stick it up his ass."") Rather than have a feeding frenzy every time a politician slips up and says something interesting, we ought to applaud their honesty. So what if Trent Lott wishes Strom Thurmond had become president? If voters find a politician's opinions distasteful, there is a mechanism for them to voice their irritation. It's called an election. AP Video: Harry Reid apologizes"	Words have replaced sex as the cause of the classic Washington scandal.

Some take the staid, no-photo approach: President Obama's 2009 card includes only a presidential seal surrounded by a wreath, and a brief message. For others, it's an opportunity to show off the attractiveness (the Bidens), size (the Huntsmans), or theatricality (the Vitters) of their family. Others get creative: Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, wrote a hymn. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., followed up previous years' cards--featuring her cat wearing sunglasses or her cat riding a motorcycle--with an image of herself ballroom dancing while her cat looks on. Delegate Madeleine Bordallo of Guam goes for the  Murder She Wrote look, while the card of Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., features his two daughters posing in a field of daisies. Some, like Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, go for a personal touch with a handwritten note. Others have a whiff of last-minute planning: Sen. Roland Burris, D-Ill., sent out a lovely card that happens to be available at the Senate gift shop. The tradition doesn't come cheap. Since 2003, congressional candidates have spent more than $5.3 million on holiday presents, decorations, and events. Sanchez's cards alone totaled more than $914,000 over the last seven years. (Hence the PDF versions she sent out this year.) The good news is, the taxpayer isn't on the hook. All holiday cards are paid for by a member's campaign committee or out of pocket.Click here to see a slide show of some of 2009's best political holiday cards.

This important question presented itself Thursday during the debate over health care. Speaking on the floor of the Senate, Joe Lieberman asked to extend his remarks beyond the 10 minutes he'd been allotted. In a body known for speechmaking, this is like requesting air. It's the kind of request normally acceded to ""without objection."" But Al Franken, the freshman senator from Minnesota, sitting in as presiding officer of the Senate, told the four-term senator from Connecticut that he could not. ""In my capacity as senator from Minnesota, I object,"" said Franken. Despite his background as a former cast member of Saturday Night Live, Franken was being serious. He did, however, give the universal palms-up gesture, suggesting the matter was out of his hands. This became a thing. John McCain, who built a reputation on breaking ranks, was outraged at the breach. ""I've been around here 20-some years. First time I've ever seen a member denied an extra minute or two to finish his remarks,"" he said. ""I just haven't seen it before myself. And I don't like it. And I think it harms the comity of the Senate not to allow one of our members at least a minute."" (McCain, it turns out was forgetting his own effort, in 2002, to do exactly what Franken was doing.) For liberals, this little episode was wonderful. Many have wanted to do themselves--perhaps with a sock--what Franken did to Lieberman. ""Wielding Gavel, Franken Shuts Lieberman Up,"" read the headline on the Huffington Post. And in fact one of the particulars in the liberal case against Lieberman was a breach of comity. During the presidential campaign he said that his colleague, Sen. Barack Obama, had not always put his country first. This was not exactly a breach of comity, because he didn't say it on the Senate floor. But it surely was against the spirit of the place. Pundits also loved the episode, which was quickly elevated to an ""altercation."" Some heralded Franken for his bold move. Others were more sympathetic to Lieberman. Comity is the special sauce of the Senate. It's what makes everyone so darn nice to one another in public. Even when they're cursing each other privately, senators show excessive deference in on the Senate floor, referring to all their colleagues as  ""gentlemen"" or ""gentlewomen"" and constantly asking one another to yield rather than just interrupting. Even off the floor, if speaking publicly, a senator is likely to refer to a colleague as ""a friend."" I once asked a senator once what he really meant when he called a colleague a ""good friend."" He answered: ""Not a thing."" There have, of course been famous exceptions. Dick Cheney, who as vice president was also president of the Senate, told Patrick Leahy to f--k himself, which qualifies as a breach of comity, to say nothing of biology. In 1902, Benjamin Tillman physically attacked John McClaurin in a dispute over a treaty to annex the Philippines. This caused the Senate to define comity: ""No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator,"" and ""No Senator in debate shall refer offensively to any State of the Union."" That Franken (a proud liberal) and Lieberman (a proud vexer of liberals) would have this moment was irresistible fodder for bloggers and cable shows. But it was really just a chance occurrence. Franken wasn't acting on his own--he was just following orders. Majority Leader Harry Reid had requested strict time-keeping by all freshmen presiding in the Senate president's chair (a chore all newcomers must perform). Franken was not the only one who denied a senator a chance to extend his remarks Thursday, as Michigan's Carl Levin pointed out. Still, that doesn't mean that Franken's old colleagues at Saturday Night Live won't use the episode to have some fun at his--and Lieberman's--expense. Failing to do so would be a breach of comedy.

Joe Lieberman, after threatening to filibuster health reform over the public option and later over the Medicare buy-in, has been bought off. On Dec. 15, after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid removed the Medicare buy-in and the public option from the bill, Lieberman told reporters, ""I'm going to be in a position where I can say what I've wanted to say all along: that I'm ready to vote for health care reform."" He reportedly said the same thing at a White House meeting that day. Lieberman's statements shifted attention to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., now widely believed to be the last holdout in the Democrats' 60-person caucus. (Lieberman of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, though both independents, caucus with the Democrats.) ""Nelson,""writes Janet Hook in the Los Angeles Times, ""is the only Democrat that leaders are really worried they could lose."" If Nelson really is the caucus's last holdout--the only remaining obstacle to a filibuster-proof majority--then hallelujah. But I harbor lingering doubts that Lieberman will remain in the ""yes"" column. Here's why. 1. No CLASS. On Dec. 13, Lieberman appeared on CBS News' Face the Nation. Let's go to the transcript."

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/does_congress_email_the_president.html	"Senate Democrats have tussled over the details of the health care reform bill this week, in an effort to get a version passed before Christmas Day. President Obama has said he's hoping the legislation will be finalized by the end of the year. In an ""Explainer"" column first published in 2008 and reprinted below, Jacob Leibenluft looked at how Congress gets a physical copy of a finished bill to the president's desk. Congress voted Thursday on a farm bill it had already passed after realizing the version that had been sent to--and then vetoed by--the president was missing 34 pages. How do bills get sent to the president? They are delivered by hand on ""parchment."" Once a bill has been approved by both houses of Congress, the clerk of the House or the secretary of the Senate --depending on where the bill originated--is tasked with preparing the legislation to go to the White House. An enrolling clerk is responsible for ensuring that he or she has the final language of the bill in hand (or more accurately, in an XML document) and then printing it onto a special kind of paper called parchment as prescribed by federal law. (For really long appropriations bills, the parchment requirement has been waived before.) Unlike traditional parchment, the paper (PDF) is not made from animal hides, but it does have a finish meant to resemble goatskin or lambskin. According to news reports, the missing pages from the farm bill were left out during the parchment-printing process, and the president vetoed the bill based on a conference report that reflected the complete legislation. After the bill has been printed, a certificate is attached to the last page to be signed by the clerk of the House or the secretary of the Senate, the speaker of the House, and the presiding officer of the Senate. Once the congressional officers have signed the bill, it is then hand-delivered to the executive clerk of the White House for the president's OK. The bill is also sent via FTP to the Government Printing Office to be posted online and printed for broader distribution. What happens if the bill contains an error? If it is a simple typo that doesn't change the meaning of the bill--like a missing shall in this legislation authorizing an expansion of Vicksburg National Military Park--the president might issue a signing statement saying the executive branch will just act as though the mistake was never made. Corrections discovered before the bill reaches the president's desk are supposed to be made through a concurrent resolution of both houses of Congress (PDF). In two recent cases, however, changes made by enrolling clerks without new votes have raised controversy--one involving revisions to the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act and another related to a last-minute change in a highway bill allegedly requested by Alaska Rep. Don Young. Ever since an 1892 Supreme Court case concerning a tariff act that went to the president with a paragraph on tobacco taxes missing, the courts have generally ruled that the version of a bill signed by the officers of both houses of Congress and the president stands, even if the language differs from what Congress voted on. So, if the mistake changes the substance of the legislation, then the erroneous language is usually law unless Congress decides to do something about it. In that case, Congress can pass ""technical corrections"" in separate legislation to remedy the mistake. According to the Library of Congress' Thomas database, more than 20 technical-corrections bills have been introduced since the current Congress began last January. Got a question about today's news?

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/the_enthusiasm_gap.html	"President Obama recently told Oprah Winfrey that he doesn't get very good Christmas presents. This is great training for a budding politician, because faking enthusiasm for a bad gift is one of the few times you can practice insincerity. Oh, tube socks! I really needed tube socks! This could be another bummer year for the president. He's going to get a present--health care reform will pass the Senate--but it's not likely to be exactly the kind he wanted. In one sense, health care reform, like any gift, is welcome. And it's certainly better than the alternative. ""If it doesn't pass, it will look like Democrats can't get anything done,"" Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says. A strategist working for Democrats on several 2010 campaigns says it would be ""a political catastrophe if nothing passes."" The president would look weak, which would depress Democratic voters and keep them from going to the polls in 2010. House members, who have already had to vote on health care reform, would be doubly unlucky: They would be vulnerable to being painted as profligate spenders who wanted to put government in charge of health care, yet they would be unable to brag that at least they helped insure 30 million people. Perhaps this is why the White House spokesman today suggested that former Gov. Howard Dean was daffy. Dean has suggested killing the Senate bill. Spokesman Robert Gibbs responded, ""I don't think any rational person would say killing a bill makes any sense at this point."" (Gibbs has a point. Starting over isn't going to rearrange the makeup of the Senate, which is driving the compromises that Dean doesn't like. There's also no evidence that forcing people to watch legislators truss the haggis one more time will improve their view of health care reform.) The political question then becomes: If we accept that passage is better than failure, how much better is it? If voters are thrilled when health care reform passes, it will of course help the president: He will be in a better position to push through his agenda next year, and to help Democrats keep their sizeable majorities in Congress. Right now, however, the picture looks grim. First, the president's opponents are much more energized than his supporters. According to the just-released Battleground poll, more than three-quarters of Republicans and independents say they are extremely likely to vote, with fewer than two-thirds of Democrats extremely likely to vote, including 58 percent of African-American voters. ""Looking at the enthusiasm numbers makes your blood run cold,"" said the Democratic strategist. Enthusiasm for health care reform specifically, and among Democrats in general, is low. Day by day, public opinion about health care reform seems to get worse. In a recent NBC poll, just 32 percent of respondents said they believe the president's health care plan is a ""good idea""; 47 percent said it's a ""bad idea,"" the highest that number has been. According to a recent ABC News poll, majorities now for the first time disapprove of Obama's work on health care (53 percent) and oppose the health care reform package making its way through Congress (51 percent). Those numbers suggest that people won't be greeting the Senate bill like a free Wii. ""The problem with health care reform is that whatever passes will be met with mixed results,"" says Lake. Part of this results from the fact that people don't think there's anything in the bill for them. In the Battleground poll conducted by Lake and Republican pollster Ed Goeas, when people were asked their priorities for health care reform and the president's priorities, the two were wildly divergent: 28 percent said their priorities matched the president's, while 64 percent said they did not. In the ABC/Washington Post poll, more than half of those polled, 53 percent, see higher costs for themselves if the proposed changes go into effect than if the current system remains intact. Even among the president's base, people are ambivalent. More people will be happy if something passes, even without a public option, than if nothing passes. But for 2010, the president needs his base to be more than happy. He needs them to be ecstatic. In the NBC poll, most of the increase in those who thought reform was a ""bad idea"" comes from some of the president's core support groups, folks upset about the lost public option. Lately, this has taken a public form. In addition to Dean, there are liberals like Rep. Anthony Weiner and Sen. Russ Feingold, who say the president has not been assertive enough. (If the president isn't enthusiastic in pushing the bill, voters are also likely to be less enthusiastic.) Plus, people want the president to work on the economy. Every poll out this week continues the long-term trend: The economy is their No. 1 concern, and people want to see results in their wallets not just on the graphs. If health care reform passes, that might be nice. But for those voters who won't get coverage because of it, the direct benefit will be hard to grasp. That's why the White House and Democratic strategists are gearing up for a concerted effort to sell the benefits of health care reform after it passes. This will include arguments for what's in the bill--and the argument that improvements will be made between the bill's passage and implementation in 2014. The question is whether the president can be more successful in making the case for health care after it passes than beforehand. So far, the more he has talked about it, the worse reform has fared in the public mind and the worse the public has felt about his handling of the issue. Afterward, of course, the president wouldn't have to contend with the distracting sideshow of Congress. And angry progressives may lose their momentary ire, focus on the Republicans they don't like, and get back in the mood to go to the polls. The hope is that public opinion about health care reform might flip as quickly as it has since the president announced his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. In the NBC poll, 55 percent say they support increasing the U.S. troop levels, an 8-point jump since October. Obama's approval ratings as commander in chief have gone up (7 points in the ABC poll), his strongest showing in seven categories tested. There are other alternatives to shrink the enthusiasm gap. The president and Congress could pass other measures that progressives would like, from immigration reform to legislation that makes it easier for unions to organize. It's tough to bank on legislative accomplishment, though. The alternative, say Democrats involved in races, will be to attack Republicans more directly and thoroughly for their obstructionism. If the enthusiasm gap remains big, then the president may have to engage in that fight directly. That will carry risks since voters like to see the president in the bipartisan spirit he campaigned on (even if that spirit is unrequited). It will be hard to both attack and extol the opposition--almost as hard as pretending you're thrilled to get a gift when you're really not. Become a fan of John Dickerson on  Facebook.

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/strange_brew.html	"It's a testament to the persistence of the tea partiers--the group of mad-as-hell, not-gonna-take-it-anymore protesters who want nothing more than for government to get out of their lives and for Glenn Beck to fill the hole--that the sight of them toting signs and chanting in front of the Capitol building has become so familiar. When a couple thousand of them showed up at Upper Senate Park in Washington, D.C., Tuesday afternoon, they practically blended into the landscape. The protest, dubbed ""Code Red"" due to the urgency of stopping health-reform legislation, may not have been their biggest. But if you looked closely, there were signs that the group--or, in this case, a motley collection of groups called High Noon For Healthcare --is gaining steam. For one thing, Republicans are increasingly trying to associate themselves with the movement. For another, more Democrats seem willing to hear them out. The most prominent politician to speak at the first official D.C. tea party on April 15 was Alan Keyes. Glenn Beck's 9/12 protest featured a smattering of conservative Republicans, including Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., and Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind.  The tea party protest helmed by Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., in November featured an entire delegation of congressional Republicans, including House Minority Whip Eric Cantor *. Today's event drew many of the usual suspects, but also included Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Richard Burr of North Carolina, and Jim DeMint of South Carolina. (DeMint was at the 9/12 protest, too.) None of these senators is especially moderate. But they are part of a body that prides itself on its collegiality. The tea partiers, needless to say, are not. (Whatever its shortcomings, you will never hear the Senate break into a chant of ""Liar! Liar!"") Some Republicans, such as Chris Christie in New Jersey during his campaign for governor, have therefore distanced themselves from the tea partiers. But their qualms seem to be dwindling. One obvious reason is fundraising. Small donations underwrote the campaign of third-party challenger Doug Hoffman in New York's 23rd District in November. They're also the force behind much of conservative Florida senatorial candidate Marco Rubio's fundraising. They could fund any number of candidates in 2010. Meanwhile, tea partiers are discovering their ability to drive policy. They have no qualms about taking credit for derailing health care reform. Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, noted that Obama initially wanted a bill by August. ""August slipped to October, October slipped to Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving slipped to now,"" he said--thanks to their agitations. The goal now is to push reform over the precipice into 2010. And that's just the beginning, say tea party leaders. In California, tea party groups are pushing a ballot initiative that would make it illegal to subtract union dues from a worker's paycheck automatically. Getting the 700,000 signatures required for a ballot item usually costs groups about $1.7 million, says Mark Meckler, a buttoned-up California lawyer who is also national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots. But for the tea party network, which he says boasts a membership in the hundreds of thousands in California, the cost is nothing. ""If each of my active members gets 10 people, that's enough,"" he says. Democrats, too, are taking notice. In some cases, they have no choice. On Tuesday morning, Meckler and two other tea partiers from California walked into Sen. Barbara Boxer's office in the Hart Senate Office Building. The goal was to ask to see the senator and, when the expected denial came, simply to wait--thereby simulating a hospital waiting room under government-run health care. After about 20 minutes, Boxer's communications director came out and asked what he could do for them. Meckler asked to see the senator. ""We don't expect her in this morning,"" the press officer said. ""When do you expect her?"" Meckler said. ""Do not know. She may come in for votes."" "" 'Do not know.' Well, I know that's not true. I know you know her schedule. Maybe you're not able to tell us. You can be honest."" ""I have not talked to her today."" ""Would you mind checking with her scheduler and letting us know?"" ""We do not know when she's coming in."" ""OK, so we know that's not true."" ""We do not know when she's coming in."" ""We know that's not true. We know that you know when she's coming in. We understand that they keep a schedule and that you know the schedule."" ""There's been no alert from the Senate today so we don't know when she's coming in."" Then, after a pause, Meckler: ""We'll wait, then."" Later that morning, Meckler and co. headed over to the office of Sen. Joe Lieberman, who has become as much a pariah on the right for supporting health care reform overall as he has on the left for opposing a public option. When they asked to speak with the man himself, a staffer said he wasn't there, that the office had a ""no loitering policy,"" and that they would have to leave. If they did not, he would call the police. They did not. He called the police. A policeman arrived. He asked whether they understood they were being asked to leave. They said yes. They then asked whether he--the policeman--was asking them to leave. He said he was not. However, the policeman said, if a staffer had asked them to leave and they refused, they could be arrested. More police soon arrived. As they were conferring outside, Meckler got up and left. ""We'd made our point,"" he said. (Lieberman's office confirms the account. See video here.) Some Democratic Senate offices were more receptive. One group of tea partiers got a 15- minute meeting with Harry Reid's Nevada press secretary Tuesday morning--an energetic but civil conversation about the potential consequences of health care reform. Staffers for Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania also met with the group. Tea partiers expecting to accost Democrats in the afternoon were out of luck, as Senate Dems had been summoned to the White House for a meeting with the president. But the protesters had advice for Republicans, too. In meetings with staffers for Sens. DeMint, Jonny Isaacson, and Saxby Chambliss, the message was the same: delay, delay, delay. Liberals might accuse the GOP of stonewalling. But from the tea partiers' perspective, the GOP hasn't been doing nearly enough to stall the bill. ""This could be three weeks behind where it is now,"" says Meckler. The Senate has all kinds of procedural rules Republicans could be exploiting. For example, the quorum rule. The Senate technically requires that a quorum of 51 senators be present to conduct business. Minority parties typically consent to dispensing with the quorum call, just to speed things along. But if there's only a handful of senators on the floor at any given moment, Republicans could start objecting. That's just one of many possible stalling tactics. (See a good overview here.) All of this said, there is still a contingent of tea partiers who are doing their part to ensure the movement is not taken seriously. Before the rally, a group of singers was belting out a health care themed rendition of ""The 12 Days of Christmas."" The last verse went: ""On the 10th day of Christmas, Obama gave to me:/ High unemployment,/ No end to earmarks,/ Mandating health care,/ Czars with power,/ Bankruptcy looming,/ No Transpaaaaareeeencyyyy,/ Fed printing dollars,/ Big bailouts,/ Welfare for all,/ And the loss of liberty."" ""This is gonna be on Glenn Beck!"" the organizer, Steve Haimbaugh, promised. The usual silly posters were there, too, including one that labeled the Democratic plan ""Gulag Care."" And FreedomWorks founder Dick Armey did little to diminish the movement's reputation by referring to cable-TV host Rachel ""Maddox."" The movement must also contend with a lack of focus. Tea partiers are generally for small government, against taxes, and pro-""freedom."" But they have nothing resembling a platform, and their popular image has been more about opposing Obama than advocating realistic alternatives. (Abolishing the Fed does not count.) Indeed, their organizational structure practically forbids it. As Meckler explained, the grassroots group Tea Party Patriots has no real leaders. If its constituents want to endorse a candidate, they'll endorse a candidate. If they want to form a PAC, they'll form a PAC. But the notion that this can be done without creating a hierarchy has yet to be tested. Meckler told me to read this book and it will all make sense. I hope he's right. Correction,  Dec. 16, 2009: This article mistakenly identified Eric Cantor as House minority leader. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/the_fallacy_of_false_choices.html	"President Obama's Nobel Prize acceptance speech in Oslo on Thursday featured one of his favorite rhetorical devices: the false choice. ""Within America, there has long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists--a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world,"" he said. ""I reject these choices."" Instead, he went on, it is in America's interests to encourage human rights and democracy in other countries. Helping them helps us. While the idea itself may be Bushian, its framing is vintage Obama. He made a similar comparison in his inaugural address: ""As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."" In fact, they are compatible--codependent even: ""Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake."" Just as bogus is the seeming tension between deficits and stimulus. Earlier this week, Obama rejected the notion that we must ""choose between paying down our deficits on the one hand, and investing in job creation and economic growth on the other. This is a false choice."" You may have thought that national security requires spending lots of money to pay contractors overseas. Nope: ""I reject the false choice between securing this nation and wasting billions of taxpayer dollars,"" Obama said in March. That old trope about free markets vs. socialism? Gone: ""[W]e need not choose between a chaotic and unforgiving capitalism and an oppressive government-run economy,"" he wrote in the Chicago Tribune. He also tossed out the notion that stem cell research poses a dilemma for people of faith: ""Our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between sound science and moral values,"" he said. ""In this case, I believe the two are not inconsistent. As a person of faith, I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering. I believe we have been given the capacity and will to pursue this research--and the humanity and conscience to do so responsibly."" Environmental debates are fraught with fallacy as well, he says: ""There's been a tension between those who have sought to conserve our natural resources for the benefit of future generations, and those who have sought to profit from these resources. But I'm here to tell you this is a false choice."" All of which is a fancy way of saying: It's more complicated than you think. The world is not black and white. Grow up. The device works well for Obama because he revels in nuance. Rejecting false choices allows him to toss out the paradigm--the ""old battles,"" as he likes to call them--and show people a new, third way. That tic is also an explicit rejection of his predecessor's rhetoric. It's hard to find a starker--and falser--choice than ""You're with us or against us."" Those surrounding Obama seem to have picked up the habit. In his testimony to the House Armed Services Committee, the Pentagon's Joint Staff Director James Winnefeld said that Russia and the United States ""have chosen to reject the false choice between cooperation on security and ceding a nation or region to the other's sphere of influence."" Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin has used the device at least twice. ""We reject the false choice between consumer protection and innovation,"" he told the American Bankers Association in July. ""We should have a financial system that both fosters innovation and provides strong consumer protections."" (As if to confirm the Obama homage, Wolin started the next sentence with: ""Let me be clear. ..."") But pointing to false choices can lead to a different logical fallacy: the straw man. Take the false dichotomy of ""securing this nation and wasting billions of taxpayer dollars."" To be sure, no one is suggesting that securing this nation requires ""wasting"" billions of dollars. They think of it as investing in a worthy cause. Whatever you think ofBush's team, no one set out to waste money in Iraq. Quite the opposite: They thought the war would be quick and cheap. Hemorrhaging money may have been the tragic outcome. But no one made that explicit choice. Critics also argue that Obama cries ""false choice"" simply to avoid confronting a choice that is actually very real. Mark Steyn argues in the National Review that ""an oppressive government-run economy"" is a real possibility in Obama's America. Ben Shapiro at Human Events calls the president's worldview ""childish"": ""All choices are 'false choices' if we just think deeply enough,"" he writes. ""Or rather, if Obama thinks deeply enough."" But that misses the point. Obama doesn't use ""false choice"" rhetoric to avoid making decisions. He also uses it when he's making a choice. There may not be a necessary tradeoff between national security and spending billions of dollars. But we're spending billions more in Afghanistan. We may not need to choose between safety and our ideals. But we have not released the Guantanamo interrogation photos. Stem cell research may not need to offend our moral values. But until we're able to conduct it without relying on discarded human embryos, the choice is there. In a way, Obama's incessant talk about rejecting the ""false choices"" allows him to weigh both sides of an argument while obscuring the fact that he's actually choosing one of them. The choice in question may indeed be false. But often, so is the device itself.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/what_in_the_hell_do_they_think_is_causing_it.html	"If Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth raised awareness about global warming by frightening people, he hopes his latest book, Our Choice, will help people find solutions to the problem. He talked about those solutions with President Obama yesterday in advance of Obama's trip to the world climate-change meeting in Copenhagen. He was coy about their conversation but did talk about his book, the nature of the climate change debate, and the controversy surrounding those e-mails disclosed from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. Question: Can something as complicated as climate change be tackled in the current calcified political system? Answer: Sclerotic may be more accurate than calcified but either would do. The role of campaign contributions in our political system and the role of lobbyists have now reached levels that are quite unhealthy for the operations of our democracy. But the antidote, as in past eras of lobbyist excess, is for more involvement by citizens to build pressure on members of the House and Senate to serve the public interest. The House of Representatives has risen impressively to this challenge. The Senate's rules and traditions have made it a tougher case. And yet the public pressure is building and I am optimistic that this climate-change legislation will pass the Senate. Sponsors say they have 60 votes, but we'll see when the roll is called. Q: Given the state of the economy, if people hear their energy bills are going up, isn't that going to make them oppose any change? A: If you want your energy bills to go up, you should support an ever greater dependence on foreign oil, because the rate of new discoveries is declining as demand in China and India is growing, and the price of oil and thus the price of coal will go sky high. That is the formula for increasing energy bills. Secondly, the sooner we switch away from carbon-based fuel and start relying on renewable energy sources available in the United States, the sooner we will grow our economy by creating the millions of new jobs that will come from retrofitting homes and businesses, building smart grids, renewable energy systems and planting trees and all the rest. We need to create a lot of jobs that can't be outsourced. Q: How damaging to your argument was the  disclosure of e-mails from the Climate Research Unit at East Anglia University? A: To paraphrase Shakespeare, it's sound and fury signifying nothing. I haven't read all the e-mails, but the most recent one is more than 10 years old. * These private exchanges between these scientists do not in any way cause any question about the scientific consensus. But the noise machine built by the climate deniers often seizes on what they can blow out of proportion, so they've thought this is a bigger deal than it is. Q: There is a sense in these e-mails, though, that data was  hidden and hoarded, which is the opposite of the case you make [in your book] about having an open and fair debate. A: I think it's been taken wildly out of context. The discussion you're referring to was about two papers that two of these scientists felt shouldn't be accepted as part of the IPCC report. Both of them, in fact, were included, referenced, and discussed. So an e-mail exchange more than 10 years ago * including somebody's opinion that a particular study isn't any good is one thing, but the fact that the study ended up being included and discussed anyway is a more powerful comment on what the result of the scientific process really is. These people are examining what they can or should do to deal with the P.R. dimensions of this, but where the scientific consensus is concerned, it's completely unchanged. What we're seeing is a set of changes worldwide that just make this discussion over 10-year-old e-mails kind of silly. * The entire North Polar ice cap is disappearing before our very eyes. It's been the size of the continental United States for the last 3 million years and now 40 percent is gone and the rest of it is going. The mountain glaciers are going. We've had record storms, droughts, fires, and floods. There is an air of unreality in debating these arcane points when the world is changing in such dramatic ways right in front of our eyes because of global warming. Q: What's your view on the medieval warm period and the charge that the East Anglia e-mails suggest data was manipulated to "" contain"" that anomaly? A: I haven't read those e-mails in detail, but the larger point is that there are cyclical changes in the climate and they are fairly well-understood, and all of them are included in the scientific consensus. When you look at what has happened over the last few decades the natural fluctuations point in the opposite direction of what has actually occurred. When they run the models and plug in the man-made pollution, the correspondence is exact. Beyond that, the scale of natural fluctuations has now been far exceeded by the impact of man-made global warming. And again, we're putting 90 million tons of it into the air today and we'll put a little more of that up there tomorrow. The physical relationship between CO2 molecules and the atmosphere and the trapping of heat is as well-established as gravity, for God's sakes. It's not some mystery. One hundred and fifty years ago this year, John Tyndall discovered CO2 traps heat, and that was the same year the first oil well was drilled in Pennsylvania. The oil industry has outpaced the building of a public consensus of the implications of climate science. But the basic facts are incontrovertible. What do they think happens when we put 90 million tons up there every day? Is there some magic wand they can wave on it and presto!--physics is overturned and carbon dioxide doesn't trap heat anymore? And when we see all these things happening on the Earth itself, what in the hell do they think is causing it? The scientists have long held that the evidence in their considered word is ""unequivocal,"" which has been endorsed by every national academy of science in every major country in the entire world. If the people that believed the moon landing was staged on a movie lot had access to unlimited money from large carbon polluters or some other special interest who wanted to confuse people into thinking that the moon landing didn't take place, I'm sure we'd have a robust debate about it right now. Q: Is that where the poles in this debate are? Is there a skeptic or critic about whom you would say, I can have an open and honest debate with this person about the facts of the case? A: There are skeptics who do not come to their view because they have a source of income from carbon polluters. I don't mean to imply that they're all in that category at all. There are also those who are also not motivated by ideological resistance for any role of government. But I don't know of any arguments or any presenters of arguments that overturn the consensus that I think have gained any legitimacy. I'm not a scientist, so I'm not the best witness, but I have followed the debate for 40 years. It was a somewhat harder case to make 30-40 years ago, but it was still clear. So many of the details have been filled in now, it's very hard to find a respectable argument contrary to the consensus on the main points about global warming. Some people don't want to hear that, but it's a fact. Q: Why does the Copenhagen meeting matter? A: We face the gravest threat that civilization has ever confronted. It's global in nature and requires a global solution. Increased CO2 emissions anywhere, whether from China or the United States or from one of the countries that is burning its forests like Brazil or Indonesia--from wherever the emissions come, they have the same effect: They trap much more heat from the sun, melt the ice, raise the sea level, cause stronger storms, floods, drought, bigger fires, generate millions of climate refugees, destabilize political systems, threaten the growing of food crops and cause a number of other catastrophic consequences which, taken together, threaten the basis for the future of human civilization on the Earth. Because these consequences are distributed globally, the problem masquerades as a distraction. Because the length of time between causes and consequences stretches out longer than we're used to dealing with, it gives us the illusion that we have the luxury of time. Neither of those things is true. The crisis is a concrete threatening reality today. It stands to get catastrophically worse unless we take action before the accumulation [of] this global warming pollution reaches such toxic levels that the problem becomes bigger than we can solve. We're already at the point where it's stretching our capacity to reach an agreement that will solve the problem, but it's still within our capacity. There are abundant reasons for hope that we will act in time. If you look at the difference between today and 10 years ago, there is a global consensus. More than 70 leaders from nations are gathering at Copenhagen. Many nations have taken action and the world is waiting for the natural leader, the United States to move on this. Q: Must climate change go through the Senate? Is there another route through the EPA, the courts and the states? A: Yes, but it's an imperfect alternative. Local and state governments have outrun the federal government. The EPA has served notice that it will enact a rule requiring CO2 reductions by major emitters in the absence of major legislation. But it's a blunt instrument that is a little more difficult to use than a legislative remedy. But the existence of the EPA regulation will require large carbon polluters to look at their hole cards, and some of them have decided that they much prefer legislation. Q: Do you think there will ever be a CO2 tax? A: I think eventually we'll use a CO2 tax offset by a reduction in taxes elsewhere alongside a cap-and-trade plan, but the degree of difficulty associated with a CO2 tax far exceeds that with a cap-and-trade plan. We're seeing it's hard to get a cap-and-trade plan and it's much easier to use as a basis for a global agreement than a CO2 tax. There's such a wide variation in tax systems around the world, it's difficult to imagine a harmonized CO2 tax that every country agrees to. That's not in the cards in the near term. But the countries that are doing the best job, like Sweden, are already doing both of these. I think that eventually we'll use both of them but we need to get started right away and the cap-and-trade is a proven and effective tool. Q: Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn has  said that if you don't like wars in the Middle East and you're driving an SUV, you're not walking the walk. He said driving an SUV is a national security statement. What's your view? A: I think it's true, but even though it's important for all of us to change our light bulbs and the vehicles we drive, it's much more important to change our laws and policies. I drive a hybrid and we've changed our light bulbs and windows and installed solar panels and geothermal ground source heat pumps and most everything else. But putting the burden on individuals to solve this global crisis is ultimately not going to be the most effective way to solve it. It's an important point, and every little bit helps not least because those who make those kinds of changes are more likely to make their voices heard as citizens. But the ultimate solutions are going to come through policies. We need to put a price on carbon, and that's what cap-and-trade does and that's also what a CO2 tax does. As long as our current valuation in the marketplace tells us every minute of every day that it's perfectly all right to dump 90 million tons of global warming into the thin atmosphere surrounding the planet every 24 hours as if that atmosphere is an open sewer, then the individual actions are not going to solve the problem. Q: Your critics say that you have a lot of investments in green technology and say, ""Isn't he sounding the alarm here to make himself rich?"" A: That's not my principal business. I've been fortunate over the last eight years to be successful in business. But most of my success has been in Internet and media companies, and yet my wife and I have made some investments in renewable energy ideas that I think are good ideas. If I didn't [invest], I'd be accused by the same people of being a hypocrite and not being willing to put my money where my mouth was. Q: What did you tell the president?A: We talked about Copenhagen and the Senate legislation and we talked about the options available to the executive branch. The green stimulus bill made a big difference. The EPA action is alongside another EPA regulation which requires all large emitters of CO2 to account for their emissions and report them. The last time that was used as a tool, there was a scramble by companies to get off the list when it was published. He's also brought about change in fuel efficiency. Q: Did you give the president any advice on accepting the Nobel award?A: I want to keep my conversation with him private. Become a fan of John Dickerson on  Facebook. Update:  In the interview, Al Gore said that the e-mails printed from researchers at the University of East Anglia were 10 years old. They are more recent than that, including many from 2009. In response, Gore has issued a statement: ""The e-mail exchanges that I focused on are approximately 10 years old. Some of the e-mail exchanges cited by others are more recent. None of them change the scientific consensus in any way."""	Al Gore talks about global warming, those e-mails, and his new book.
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/the_poll_heard_round_the_world.html	"One key to the success of the Tea Party movement is that no one has bothered to measure it. Democrats pump up Tea Partiers--or, in their preferred nomenclature, tea baggers--as a fringe coalition of nativists and neo-Nazis taking over the Republican Party. Moderate Republicans dismiss them as a small but vocal band of gripers. Conservative Republicans claim they're a vibrant cross-section of concerned Americans like you and me. The argument, and the publicity, is endless, because no one knows how many Tea Partiers there are. Until now. Rasmussen Reports took the first crack last week at measuring the strength of a third-party ""Tea Party"" candidate on a generic ballot, and the results are in. ""Suppose the Tea Party Movement organized itself as a political party,"" the survey asked. ""When thinking about the next election for Congress, would you vote for the Republican candidate from your district, the Democratic candidate from your district, or the Tea Party candidate from your district?"" Democrats led the way with 36 percent. Republicans pulled in 18 percent. And the Tea Party candidate got 23 percent. The Democratic National Committee would like to point out that 23 is more than 18. Many poll watchers, especially liberal ones, view Rasmussen with some skepticism and say its results tend to favor conservative politicians and positions. (See Pollster.com's Mark Blumenthal for possible explanations.) While the survey interviews ""likely voters,"" it doesn't define exactly what that means. It doesn't release party-identification cross-tabs, so we don't know how many of those interviewed are Republicans or Democrats. Many of the questions seem worded to elicit a conservative response. (""Whose judgment do you trust more--the American people or America's political leaders?"") And they often do: Compare the Rasmussen results in recent congressional polls with all the other surveys. Furthermore, the fact that the phone poll is automated, rather than conducted by human beings, raises eyebrows. But none of those concerns should provide much comfort to Republicans. For one thing, the poll jibes with other recent Rasmussen surveys. In the three most recent Rasmussen national congressional ballots, Democrats poll at 37 or 38 percent. Republicans, meanwhile, hover at 44 percent. In the Tea Party survey, the Democrats' number doesn't move--it remains at 36--whereas the Republican number plunges. This suggests that respondents aren't professing allegiance to some generic independent third party. Rather, they know what they're talking about when they say they support the Tea Parties. Ideally, the question would have listed a generic independent third party, as a control. As Blumenthal puts it: ""How much of this is the Glenn Beck-, Fox News-inspired movement that those of us who cover politics know so well, and how much is third party identification?"" But the fact that nearly all of the support came from the Republican side suggests it's the former. That's not to say that, if an independent Tea Party were founded tomorrow, it would beat the Republican Party in an election. Scott Rasmussen admits as much in his write-up of the survey: ""In practical terms, it is unlikely that a true third-party option would perform as well as the polling data indicates."" But it's the closest number we have, so far, to identifying how large a segment of the population identifies with the protesters we see on TV (or, for members of Congress, outside their windows). Rasmussen cautions against attaching a number to the movement itself. ""You can get a sense of it,"" he says, ""but you can't pretend to have real precision."" It's like measuring the size of the ""investor class."" Ask people, and they'll probably say they're not part of it. Ask them what they own in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and you may get different results. Likewise, the number of people who self-identify as Tea Partiers is going to be different from the number of people who want lower taxes, deficit reduction, and smaller government. If anything, the uncertainty about their actual numbers benefits the Tea Partiers. As John M. O'Hara, author of the upcoming book A New American Tea Party, puts it: ""In a way, the inability to pin down an exactly number speaks to the broad appeal of this movement."" On the other hand, it may also reflect a vagueness of mission. Some oppose cap and trade. Others care about the deficit. A third group really, really liked John Adams. But the poll's real significance is that it upends the spoiler equation. Until now, a conservative running on a third-party ticket, as Doug Hoffman did in New York's 23rd Congressional District, was considered a spoiler for dividing the GOP coalition. If Tea Party supporters outnumber Republicans, who's the spoiler then?"	Is it possible to determine how big the Tea Party movement is?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/brown_and_blue.html	"Even before all the votes were tallied and Scott Brown's victory was official, Democratic members of Congress were starting to panic on Tuesday. ""There's going to be a tendency on the part of our people to be in denial about all this,"" Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana told ABC News. But ""if you lose Massachusetts and that's not a wake-up call, there's no hope of waking up."" (Bayh's office emphasizes that he wasn't talking about health care.) Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, too, told Democrats to snap out of it: ""In many ways the campaign in Massachusetts became a referendum not only on health care reform but also on the openness and integrity of our government process."" And Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York said health care reform ""might be dead"" if Brown won. Even Barney Frank, the famously liberal member of the House from Massachusetts, initially voiced serious concern about moving forward with health care. The House isn't going to pass the Senate's bill, he told constituents at first. Instead, he hoped that Republicans would cooperate in drafting ""a revised version of health care reform."" Frank has since walked back his initial statement, signaling that he would vote for the Senate bill if he had reassurances it would change down the line. President Obama and the Democratic leadership have done their best to push back against the notion that This Changes Everything. David Axelrod took to the airwaves Wednesday morning to argue that Brown's election was not a referendum on health care reform. In an interview with George Stephanopoulos, Obama said the election was largely about voter anger and suggested that Congress ""try to move quickly to coalesce around those elements of the package that people agree on."" What that means is anyone's guess. There's very little everyone can agree on when it comes to health care reform. If it were as simple as prohibiting denial of care for pre-existing conditions, there'd be a bill already. The underlying question neither group seems to want to answer is this: What's better for Democrats--passing an ugly health reform package using potentially controversial parliamentary moves or passing no bill at all? Passing health care reform, either by shoving the Senate version through the House as-is or making small tweaks via the reconciliation process, would tick people off no matter what. Under the take-it-or-leave-it option, liberal House Democrats would have to hold their noses to support the Senate version's tax on ""Cadillac"" health plans. Meanwhile, Republicans and moderate Democrats would bridle at using reconciliation--in which some pieces of reform could pass with a bare majority--on a piece of policy that's not strictly budgetary. On the other hand, not passing reform could be just as damaging, or more so. Democrats would have to campaign in 2010 without a powerful legislative accomplishment. They'd also have to explain their failure. It would be one thing if moderate Democrats hadn't already voted for the bill--they could claim they were never going to support it in the first place. But they did. Democrats in both chambers are on the record supporting it. No matter what, they'll have to explain their votes. They might as well get a legislative accomplishment out of it, too. Only Frank answered the question head on. (And even he changed his mind.) He argued that the best option is to pass a revised version of health care reform, but if that's not possible, that it's better to pass no bill at all than to pass the Senate version as is. His rationale at the time: Even if Democrats go on to pass all sorts of popular regulatory reform and jobs-creation bills, voters will remember the mess of a health care bill and punish Democrats for passing it. Most Democrats, however, deflect the question by saying Congress needs to ""focus on jobs."" It's a refrain that seems calculated to assuage the average Brown voter. But it's unclear how Democrats propose to do this. Some have couched job creation in the context of a climate bill: For example, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said earlier this month that Democrats will work to create ""new jobs, good-paying, clean-energy jobs that can never be outsourced."" Others suggest that a second stimulus package will be necessary. What these approaches forget is that a climate bill looks increasingly unlikely and that the first stimulus--which many economists say wasn't big enough--is still unpopular. In fact, none other than Scott Brown explicitly campaigned against it. ""[I]t's time to admit that while the $787 billion stimulus had the best of intentions, it failed to create one new job,"" he wrote in a recent Boston Globe op-ed. ""We shouldn't pass yet another stimulus that adds to the debt without adding jobs."" Democrats may be correct that the lesson of Brown's victory is that Americans want more jobs. But they're wrong if they think Brown voters want a second stimulus. As a result, Democrats are stuck. They're desperately trying to appeal to the ""angry"" jobs-oriented voters who are supposedly responsible for voting Brown into office. But they haven't offered any solutions that will make those voters happy. Part of the reason is bad marketing. The stimulus package did create jobs, according to the administration. The bailout did prevent the economy from sinking into a second depression, according to most economists. Health care reform would reduce the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But Republicans such as Brown have won elections by campaigning against these policies. Democrats may believe in their own policies, but their defenses of them haven't worked. Democrats want to show they ""got the message,"" in Weiner's words. The hard part is figuring out how to respond to the message."	Democrats try to appease a new constituency: the Scott Brown voter.
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/the_great_brown_hope.html	"Republicans around the nation, not just in Massachusetts, are toasting Scott Brown's victory over Martha Coakley tonight, and rightfully so. The ""people's seat,"" as Brown famously described it, had been in Democratic hands since JFK beat Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. in 1952. A month ago, Brown was considered a long shot, and as recently as Sunday, FiveThirtyEight.com called the race a tossup. And yet, by the end, his margin of victory was both comfortable and unsurprising. But it's important not to read too much into tonight's results. The personalities and idiosyncrasies of the candidates shape every election, of course. Yet even if Brown weren't blessed with unusual political talent and an unusually incompetent opponent, his victory shouldn't be cause for Republicans to get overly excited. Still, let's dwell on the specifics of the Massachusetts race for a moment. First and foremost, Martha Coakley was an awful candidate. Her gaffes have been widely recounted. But just for kicks, let's recap: Forgetting to campaign in the first place. Dissing Fenway Park. Dissing Curt Schilling. Claiming there are no terrorists in Afghanistan. Attending fundraisers with lobbyists (with bonus video of an aide shoving a reporter!). It may well be the case that Coakley lost the race more than Brown won it. Brown, meanwhile, was the right candidate at the right time. He has charisma enough to pull off opposing the congressional health care bills, even though he voted for Massachusetts' health care reform bill in 2006, and to appeal to both mainstream Republicans and the Tea Party crowd that almost carried Doug Hoffman to Congress last year in New York. He worked hard, holding 66 actual campaign events and using the virtual space of the Internet for a savvy social media campaign and a 24-hour, $1.3 million ""money bomb."" He also had the advantage of running in a special election, giving him a national spotlight at a time when Americans are increasingly uneasy about health care reform and government spending. It's hard to say whether the Republicans will be able to replicate Brown's success nationally. In 1994, when the Republicans took control of the House and the Senate in the first midterm after Bill Clinton's election, they were guided by Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America. Now, instead of offering contracts to the public, Republicans are holding their own candidates to ""purity pledges."" We have an RNC chairman who's known better for his gaffes and his speechmaking fees than anything else and who is on record saying the party won't take back the House in 2010. (Can you blame him, when a new poll shows that 25 percent of the public has a positive view of Republicans?) The most visible--though hardly the most likely--contender for the 2012 GOP nomination is Sarah Palin, who quit her job as governor of Alaska to write a book, take a Fox News gig, and appear on the cover of InTouch magazine. The party's great hope for the future, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, earned comparisons to Kenneth from 30 Rock for his disastrous response to Obama's congressional address last February and hasn't been heard from since. Perhaps most telling--and most troubling--is the London Telegraph's recently published list of top conservatives: Dick Cheney, unlikely ever to run for office again, is No. 1, followed by Rush Limbaugh, Matt Drudge, Palin, Robert Gates (oh, breath of fresh air), and Glenn Beck. Don't get me wrong: Brown's win is still important--and satisfying. It will provide the party with a needed morale boost going into this fall's campaign, and it will be entertaining to watch Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid try to get anything done without a supermajority that has slipped in and out of his fingers in the past year. So pass the Sam Adams. But let's not party like it's 1994."	Why Republicans should try to contain their excitement about Scott Brown's victory.
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/the_inversion.html	"BOSTON--At a rally here on Sunday, President Obama told Massachusetts voters that Democratic senatorial candidate Martha Coakley would move the country forward, while her opponent, Republican Scott Brown, would move it backward. But Obama's goal, too, was to turn back time--just not as far. He wanted to go back to, say, November 2008, when Democrats were the ""change"" candidates, populist anger was directed at Republicans, and voters blamed another president not on the ballot for their problems. That's one reason the Massachusetts special election is making Democrats nauseated: It's turning their world upside down. With the special election 48 hours away, the race between Coakley and Brown has in many ways become an inversion of the election that won Obama the White House. In 2008, the Democratic candidate had recently been a no-name state senator with a thin record but good stage presence. In 2010, Scott Brown holds that mantle. The presidential election featured an ""establishment"" Republican against a ""change"" Democrat. In this senatorial election, Martha Coakley wears the ""establishment"" label while Brown gets to claim he'd upend the state's Democratic dominance. John McCain made himself sound out of touch by admitting he didn't use e-mail. Coakley did the same by seemingly scoffing at the notion of shaking hands outside Fenway Park, then by suggesting Red Sox legend Curt Schilling was a Yankees fan. (It was a joke, she now says.) Obama in 2008 raised untold funds from grass-roots giving. This year, Brown was the first to use the online ""money bomb"" technique and last week raised a reported $1 million a day. In '08, the Democrat was a marvel on the stump, while the Republican was hard to watch. The opposite is true in 2010. This narrative isn't especially fair--just as it wasn't in 2008. But only now are the Democrats realizing the box they've been squeezed into. So Democrats tried Sunday to reverse the reversal. Step No. 1 was reminding voters of who is responsible for the mess we're in. ""We have had one year to make up for eight,"" Obama told the crowd of 1,500 at Northeastern University. (A couple thousand more watched from a separate room.) ""It hasn't been quick, it hasn't been easy. But we've begun to deliver on the change you voted for."" Coakley drove home the theme at a rally earlier that day in Hyannis--yes, that Hyannis--where she warned against the ""the Bush/Cheney failed policies"" that would return if Brown were elected. Step No. 2 was to get angry, if only to prove that Republicans don't have a monopoly on rage. This doesn't appear easy for Coakley, but her supporters were up to the task. ""Guess what: I'm pretty damn angry myself,"" said Rep. Michael Capuano, who lost the primary to Coakley. ""I'm angry because we don't have health care for all. I'm angry because we're stuck in wars all around this world. I'm angry because every child doesn't have an equal opportunity in education."" John Kerry, too, was feeling unusually emotional: ""Yes, we feel angry. All of us!"" Step No. 3 was to poke holes in the image Brown has created for himself: the independent, hard-working, middle-class, truck-driving guy who also happens to be dashing and well-spoken. Coakley reminded voters that she supports the proposed tax on banks to help repay taxpayers' bailout money, while Brown opposes it. Her campaign pounded the message that Brown doesn't give his campaign workers health care. In his speech, Obama kept coming back to Brown's truck. ""You better check under the hood,"" was one refrain. ""Forget the truck,"" he said. ""Anybody can buy a truck."" ""He decided to park his truck on Wall Street,"" he later quipped. ""I'd think long and hard about getting in that truck of Martha Coakley's opponent,"" he said. ""It might not be going where you want to go."" Whatever the accuracy of Brown's self-portrait--his mother was once on welfare, yet he owns five properties--Democrats are late in countering it. But more important, they're late in realizing that populist anger would be targeted not at Republicans but at them. Now they know. ""Voters want to send a message,"" said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who might have been a strong candidate to succeed his father in the Senate but for the inconvenient fact that he already represents Rhode Island in the House. ""They want to show their anger in some way. The best way to do that is a protest vote."" Democrats need to remind people that they're not the bad guys: ""People have forgotten we were on the Titanic a year ago, and we were sinking, and everyone was gonna die."" Coupled with that amnesia is shortsightedness about what a vote for Brown means, said state Sen. Robert O'Leary, who represents Cape Cod. If people knew electing Brown would create more gridlock--for health care and the rest of Obama's agenda--they might vote differently. ""I don't think people are fully conscious of the implications,"" he said.  U.S. Rep. Bill Delahunt said Democrats have done a poor job of helping voters ""connect the dots"" between Bush and Brown and the poor economy. Now Coakley, the attorney general from Massachusetts, is somehow seen as representing the nation's sorry state. ""We failed, Congress failed, the president failed, I failed, we failed,"" he said. That's very honest, I said. ""Why not be honest?"" he said. ""It might get us somewhere."" It's the loser's refrain on election night: If only voters knew what they were doing, we woulda won. That Massachusetts Democrats are already using this line, a full two days before the election, means either that recriminations have already begun--or that they've realized their own shortcomings just in time to correct them."	"How did Scott Brown become the ""change"" candidate in Massachusetts?"
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/bank_shot.html	"When defending the Wall Street bailouts, President Obama typically asked Americans to tolerate a certain amount of unfairness. Now, in proposing a tax on the largest financial institutions, he's asking bankers to do the same. The bank tax--or, if that's too easy to say, the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee--would impose a 0.15 percent tax on financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets (excluding capital reserves and deposits). The tax would fall on about 50 firms and would reap an estimated $90 billion to $117 billion over 10 years--roughly the amount of TARP money that hasn't yet been recouped. So it's efficient. But is it fair? In a word: no. Almost all the banks targeted by the tax have paid back the money they owed. Some of them paid back even more. Goldman Sachs, for example, repaid its money with a 23 percent return to taxpayers. Indeed, the part of TARP that went to banks is not the part that has lost money. That would be the billions in loans to the auto industry, AIG, and smaller banks across the country, as well as to mortgage foreclosure mitigation efforts. The big banks, by contrast, have been responsible debtors. (After the crisis started, that is.) Why target them? For starters, because they helped cause the crisis in the first place--an original sin that somewhat devalues the collective cry of Wall Street. Second, because the bailout is a lot more than just TARP. If the bailout consisted of merely the $700 billion lent to financial institutions, the banks might have a stronger case. But the bailout was more than that: It was the FDIC guaranteeing bank debt. It was the government rescue of money-market funds. It was the Federal Reserve restarting the securitization market. It was the backstop of the commercial paper program. Taxpayers assumed a huge amount of risk through these programs, and the banks profited. Third, because this is how TARP was supposed to work: The legislation that created it, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, stipulates that the financial industry has to pay back all the money it owes. It just didn't specify how. And that's where the unfairness comes in. Nowhere does the legislation say that the 50 biggest firms have to pay back the loans. That responsibility could have fallen to any number of financial institutions. It was the Obama administration's idea to focus on the big guys--a decision that's hard to explain entirely in nonpolitical terms. Sure, there is a policy explanation. Taxing the biggest banks discourages them from becoming ""too big to fail."" How much it discourages them is up for debate. Is a 0.15 percent tax going to dissuade two $25 billion investment firms from merging? Who knows. Another benefit: taxing nondepository assets encourages large banks to do more traditional lending--i.e., lending that is actually based on the amount of insured deposits they have--which they've been hesitant to do after getting bailed out. But that doesn't explain why smaller institutions aren't at least asked to help. What explains that decision is politics. ""People tend to think of smaller banks like Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life,"" says Doug Elliot, a former investment banker at JPMorgan who now works at the Brookings Institution. ""They have a much better political standing."" They're also in every congressional district, as opposed to the big banks, which are headquartered mainly in New York. Bankers also say that any tax on them will get passed onto the consumer. But that doesn't really bother supporters of the tax. ""If Bank of America wants to pass its cost on to consumers, that's fine,"" says David Min of the Center for American Progress. ""I'll just go over to my regional bank."" Another objection from the financial industry is that the tax will reduce the amount they can lend. Again, says Min, no worries. If banks do lend less, they will be less likely to become ""too big to fail."" Plus, they can always start doing less securitization and more depository lending, which is considered safer and isn't affected by the tax. Going after the big banks and leaving the little guys alone may be a crass populist move. Obama's poll numbers are lower than they've ever been. Anger over the executive bonuses still rages. And banking executives are defending their practices before Congress this week with no signs of penitence. But it's also a course correction. Last time, big banks profited from their own failures on the backs of taxpayers. This time, taxpayers will recoup the money they lost on the backs of the big banks. Two wrongs don't make a right. But they do make it even."	Barack Obama's proposed bank tax is unfair. But then again, so was the bailout.

But subtract the poor choice of words-- Negro sounds more fuddy-duddy than racist--and the statement, reported in the book  Game Change, is fairly uncontroversial. Not only is it undeniable that Obama's skin tone and way of speaking had something to do with his election. Reid was praising Obama for one of the oldest political skills there is: the ability to adjust one's speech, and one's mannerisms, to different audiences. Obama's knack for tweaking how he talks--or code-switching, in linguistics terminology--was on display during the campaign and after. At fundraisers in New York, he'd put on his professorial lilt. In front of mostly black audiences in South Carolina, he'd warn them against believing rumors that he was a Muslim. ""They try to bamboozle you, hoodwink you,"" he said, in a deliberate homage to Malcolm X. On the Ellen show, he won the week by doing a harmless dance that drove the mostly white audience crazy. After a particularly rough debate in North Carolina, he referenced Jay-Z by brushing dirt off his shoulders and got a standing ovation. In an interview with Steve Kroft, he talked about college football and getting a dog. In an interview with MTV's Sway, he complimented his interviewer--""You look tight""--and emphasized his policy position that ""brothers should pull up their pants."" Obama's code-switching isn't limited to style. The substance of what he says changes, too. In front of a Wall Street audience in September 2009, he politely but firmly cautioned against dangerous credit-default swaps. On 60 Minutes three months later, he excoriated ""fat cat bankers""--something he probably wouldn't have said to their faces. The practice famously got him into trouble during the campaign when he told an audience at a San Francisco fundraiser that in small-town Pennsylvania, some people ""get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them."" No doubt he would have phrased the sentiment differently in small-town Pennsylvania. Code-switching--or code-mixing, or style-shifting--is as universally derided as it is universal. In day-to-day life, it's seen as somehow deceitful--a betrayal of one's true self. In politics, it's considered the worst kind of pandering. Hillary Clinton was mocked when she affected a drawl for black audiences. John Edwards got smacked by William F. Buckley for putting on ""a carefully maintained Southern accent."" ""Poor-mouthing,"" as one Edwards fan put it to me on the campaign trail. But these kinds of adjustments are as endemic to politics as campaign slogans--and a lot more telling. ""The gut reaction is it's a form of dishonesty, but a lot of people would say it's being a good politician,"" says Carol Swain, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who studies race relations. Code-switching occurs anytime a politician is trying to represent more than one group of people. In other words: pretty much always. As a senator, LBJ brought out the full drawl when he went home to Texas, versus his speeches on the national stage. Huey Long mastered the switch between his Louisiana dialect and a Washington patois. Anyone who wants to represent a state or a country composed of different ethnic groups needs to find ways to relate to each of them. In New Mexico, that might mean learning some rudimentary Spanish. In South Carolina, it's droppin' your G's. In Wisconsin, it's knowing your cheddar varietals. Some call it pandering. Others call it campaigning. Not only is code-switching standard in U.S. politics, it's necessary. The last president who spoke in a flat, patrician, newscaster style was George H.W. Bush. Every president since then has spoken a mixture. Bill Clinton could turn on the Southern twang. George W. Bush could, too, with an evangelical flavor. Those who can't, suffer. John McCain, says John McWhorter, a linguist at the Manhattan Institute, lost in part because of the way he talks--stiff, nasal, unfolksy. Future candidates will learn the hard way. ""Mitt Romney will not go anywhere because he cannot be verbally warm,"" McWhorter says. ""If Republicans have a great white hope--of any race--they have to be able to not sound like a Republican."" Within reason, of course. Change your accent too much, and you sound like a fake. When Barack Obama tells a cashier at Ben's Chili Bowl, ""Nah, we straight,"" it doesn't sound put on--even thought it may be. When Michael Steele says he's going to ""come to table with things that will surprise everyone--off the hook,"" he sounds nearly as out-of-touch as Harry Reid. And Reid, when he made his controversial comments, was engaging in his own kind of code-switching. It's hard to imagine him saying the same things in front of Obama himself--or any African-American--rather than two middle-aged white reporters. As much as American politicians code-switch, however, they don't do it nearly as much as politicians in other countries. What in the United States is implicit--oh, Hillary's doing her cowgirl thang again--is explicit in countries like Canada, where politicians literally have to speak two different languages. Two of Canada's greatest politicians, Brian Mulroney and Pierre Trudeau, were able to speak English as native English speakers and French as native French speakers--huge assets in a country where speakers of one language judge outsider politicians harshly. Likewise, politicians in Taiwan often employ the country's various languages--Mandarin, Taiwanese, Japanese--to make a political point. In a crowd with many different ethnicities, for example, a politician might switch among languages in order to symbolically smooth tensions. American code-switching is relatively subtle. And Obama, ironically, is one of its more subtle practitioners. As Zadie Smith pointed out in her essay on Obama and language, his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention demonstrated his ability to pivot nimbly between cultures, sometimes in a single sentence: "" 'We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states.' Awesome God comes to you straight from the pews of a Georgia church; poking around feels more at home at a kitchen table in South Bend, Indiana."" If Harry Reid noticed it then, he held his tongue. AP Video: Harry Reid apologizes"	Of course Barack Obama talks differently to different groups. So do most politicians.
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/01/taming_the_mouse.html	"In the cat-and-mouse game that is intelligence gathering, President Obama promised Thursday to make the cat stronger, faster, and smarter. But ultimately, he suggested, the only real solution is to tame the mouse. In a 13-minute speech delivered in the White House State Dining Room, Obama declined to assign blame for the failure to stop the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day. He instead called it a ""systemic failure"" and outlined a series measures to keep it from happening again: improve airport screening technology, assign responsibility for particular intelligence cases to particular officers, and lower the bar for who gets put on terrorist watch lists like the no-fly list. Obama emphasized that the ""underwear bomb"" wasn't another 9/11, intelligence-wise. The problemwasn't that American intelligence officials didn't have enough information about Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab before he boarded a plane in Amsterdam and tried to detonate a bomb in his pants in the air above Detroit. Nor was it their failure to share the information they had. Rather, it was ""a failure to connect and understand"" that intelligence. The agencies had enough dots--they just failed to connect them. Three dots loomed especially large. The first was a visit to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria in November by Abdulmutallab's father, who warned that his son had become an Islamic extremist and was possibly hiding in Yemen. The second was a vague report of a possible attack from Yemen involving a Nigerian. And the third was a general warning that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was planning to attack not just American interests in Yemen, but also America itself. (One of the more embarrassing dots is the State Department's failure to realize Abdulmutallab had a valid U.S. visa--because of  a misspelling of his name.) As for who failed to connect these dots, fingers had been pointing to Michael Leiter, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. And with some reason: The NCTC is the organization charged with integrating and analyzing intelligence data collected by the 16 national intelligence agencies, including the CIA, FBI, and NSA. Adding to the fire was the New York Daily News report that Leiter had refused to come home from his ski vacation after news of the attempted bombing. Obama did his best to snuff out the blame. Leiter was in contact with the administration and other agencies, Obama's advisers said, and was given permission to take his annual leave only after consulting with the White House. Nor was the NCTC to blame. In a briefing after the president's speech, counterterrorism and homeland security adviser John Brennan tried to jump on the grenade. ""I let him down,"" he said. But Obama had preempted him: ""Ultimately, the buck stops with me,"" Obama said. ""When the system fails, it is my responsibility."" At the same time, Obama deflected criticism that he isn't taking national security seriously. 9/11 Commission chief Lee Hamilton expressed concern that the president is being complacent. Hence the multi-agency review, a presidential speech, a joint follow-up briefing by two top advisers, and a Facebook chat with Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough. Dick Cheney has slammed the president for not calling the struggle against terrorism a ""war."" This time, Obama said it twice for good measure: ""We are at war. We are at war against al-Qaida."" What Obama didn't say, but becomes clear in the White House review (PDF), is that connecting the dots is really, really hard. Out of millions of tiny pieces of information being collected by 16 different agencies, one agency wasn't able to connect three or four seemingly random ones, flag them, and conclude that they warranted action. Easier said than done. As it turns out, several components of the system did work. (Although not to the extent that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano at first suggested.) Abdulmutallab was on the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, watch list. Border control was reportedly aware that he was heading for the United States and was planning to interrogate him when he landed in Detroit. But the warning signs--the embassy visit from his father, plus reports of an attack involving a Nigerian--didn't trip the alarms necessary to move him from the TIDE list to the more exclusive no-fly list. The alarm system simply wasn't sensitive enough. As the Washington Independent's Spencer Ackerman put it, this wasn't an intelligence failure. It was a policy failure. That's going to change, Obama said. Data analysis will be deeper. Individual intelligence officers will oversee individual cases. The no-fly list has already been expanded. Agencies will be held accountable (well, starting now). But, Obama added, ""there is, of course, no foolproof solution."" There's no way to catch every terrorist who tries to enter the United States. There's no way to ""thoroughly and exhaustively"" pursue every lead the CIA stumbles upon, as the president's new directive calls for, no matter how many resources it has. There's no magic bullet--or, in this case, magic airport scanner. Which is why Obama has long insisted that counterterrorism means more than catching bad guys at airports. It means preventing them from becoming terrorists in the first place. ""That's why we must communicate clearly to Muslims around the world that al-Qaida offers nothing except a bankrupt vision of misery and death--including the murder of fellow Muslims--while the United States stands with those who seek justice and progress,"" Obama said. It's the same message he delivered in his speech on America and the Muslim world. ""If you asked him what are the most important things he's done to fight terrorism in his first year,"" Rahm Emanuel told the New York Times Magazine, ""he would put Cairo in the top three."" No doubt the eyerolls in the Cheney household were visible from space. But after an attack that showed that even a well-trained, well-informed, well-funded cat can make mistakes, the case for mouse-taming starts to sound rather convincing."	Obama promised to improve our intelligence system. But how good can it get?
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/barack_obamas_holiday_card.html	"The Obama Family The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Friends and Family, Happy Holidays! This time last year, the Obama family was getting ready for the big move. Now we're here! And what a year it has been. As you know, Barack has had a lot on his plate. But what are the holidays if not a chance to shove all that stuff aside and think about what's really important? So forget all the politics--here's an update on what's been happening with us. First, the year's big news: We got a dog! That's right, Bo Obama joined the family in April, and he's still all anyone talks about. The kids love him, but--listen to this--Bo turns out to be pretty selfish. Always barking for attention (especially when there are cameras around). Always wondering what's in it for him (belly rubs from Barack, usually). He'll lick your face one minute and then go pee on the rug when you're not looking. This makes the kids sad because they thought dogs were supposed to be loyal and care about other people. We tell them Bo will come around, he just needs to learn that some things are more important than getting re-elected senator in Connecticut. Also, he humped John McCain's leg. As for Michelle and Barack, we're doing great! Just great. We don't always agree on things, but unlike some people, we always reach a compromise. Like last week, we had a special date night planned in the White House screening room. Michelle wanted to see Sicko. Without thinking, Barack said ""no!"" Michelle explained to him that you can't just say ""no."" (That had been his response to Wall Street, Detroit Rock City, and An Inconvenient Truth, too.) If you want to be taken seriously, you have to offer an alternative. So Barack suggested The Road. Michelle vetoed that--too depressing. But since Barack likes action and Michelle likes John Cusack, we decided on 2012. And it was really good! Who'd have thought good-faith negotiation was so easy and so productive and so satisfying, Mitch McConnell? Malia, meanwhile, was just voted valedictorian of her high school graduating class! We are so proud of her! There was some controversy about the achievement, since Malia is in the sixth grade. But the students and faculty at her school felt it wasn't an award she earned so much as an aspirational symbol of what might be possible once she really starts doing stuff. Malia, while slightly embarrassed, nonetheless accepted the honor and gave a rousing speech defending her history of flunking World Civ and getting in fights with classmates, especially the Afghan one. In related news, Sasha has become quite the soccer star--she made team captain! Barack goes to every game, and as he tells Sasha, it's important to know everything you possibly can before the game starts: the opposing team's win-loss record, its weaknesses, its strengths, the pitch and terrain of the playing field, the weather forecast, the prejudices of the referee and of course the rules of the game. (How do you define victory, anyway?) Figuring all this stuff out sometimes takes longer than expected. And sometimes you get hamstrung by a head coach who you respect but can't quite trust. It's worth it in the end, though, because you go in knowing you made the right decision to send more troops. I know what you're thinking: What about health care? What about Afghanistan? Why hasn't this letter mentioned those things? We figured it was better to use this once-a-year opportunity to focus on the real stuff: family. And loyalty. And cooperation. And passing climate-change legislation and regulatory reform before we lose the House in 2010 and are left sitting on our hands like a bunch of chumps. With love and prayers, Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha P.S. This being the most transparent administration of all time, go to Whitehouse.gov to see all the earlier versions of this letter. Or check out Flickr for photos of Michelle and Barack hard at work on this holiday message. For a full tick-tock of the letter's drafting, see tomorrow's Washington Post. And the New York Times. And the Los Angeles Times. In keeping with our commitment to green jobs, this card was printed on granola.Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	The Obama family's holiday card.
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/peace_on_earth_in_our_time.html	"While President Obama has decided to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he has overseen a precipitous de-escalation on another front: the war on Christmas. The debates that have raged in years past--""Merry Christmas"" or ""Happy Holidays""? ""Christmas tree"" or ""holiday tree""?--have largely quieted down in 2009. While it's impossible to quantify, there are plenty of pseudoscientific indicators to suggest that, yes, the war on Christmas, with or without quotation marks, is over. Or at least in cease-fire. Because the furor was media-driven in the first place, media mentions seem as good a metric as any. After 2005, Google Trends shows a continuous decline in searches for and mentions of the ""war on Christmas."" Media mentions of a ""war on Christmas"" have fallen steadily as well, according to Nexis: There were 431 articles mentioning it as of Dec. 17, 2006; 187 by that time in 2007; 155 in 2008; and 97 in 2009. Even Fox News, the network that pushed the story in the winter of 2005, has essentially stopped talking about it: At this time in 2005, Fox had aired 80 episodes explicitly referring to the ""war on Christmas""; in 2006, there were 24; in 2007, 11; in 2008, five; and three so far this year. The departure in 2008 of Fox News host John Gibson, who penned The War on Christmas: How the Liberal Plot To Ban the Sacred Christian Holiday Is Worse Than You Thought, may have had something to do with it. As a result, some groups dedicated to secularism and the separation of church and state--the anti-Christmas warriors--have gotten fewer invitations to debate the issue on radio and TV. ""I usually get called on once or twice every season to talk on Fox News or talk radio,"" says David Silverman, national communications director of American Atheists. ""I haven't been called once this season."" There's also been a sharp decline in demand for the group's president, Ed Buckner. Rob Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church and State echoed Silverman: ""There hasn't been the same amount of interest,"" he said. Perhaps one reason for the decline is that several recent ""War on Christmas"" horror stories turn out to be less than compelling. For example, Rep. Henry Brown, R-S.C., introduced a resolution calling for an effort to protect the sanctity of Christmas. The reason: The Obamas' holiday card doesn't mention Christmas. ""I believe that sending a Christmas card without referencing a holiday and its purpose limits the Christmas celebration in favor of a more 'politically correct' holiday,"" Brown explained. What he doesn't mention is that President Bush's card in 2008 didn't mention Christmas, either (although it did include a Biblical passage). Needless to say, Brown did not introduce a resolution then. Another recent story alleged that a school in Taunton, Mass., suspended a second-grader and required him to undergo psychological evaluation because when the teacher asked the class to draw something that reminded them of Christmas, the boy drew a picture of Jesus on the cross. The child's father cried religious bias. As it turns out, the boy was not suspended and the teacher had referred the child to psychological services because he had identified the person on the cross as himself. The teacher feared it might be a cry for help. Defenders of Christmas also cried foul when Obama's announcement of new troops to Afghanistan bumped A Charlie Brown Christmas. As Glenn Beck noted, that show includes ""one of the most politically incorrect scenes on TV,"" in which Linus recounts the story of the nativity. ""Maybe we should put everything back in its rightful place and listen to messages that actually mean something,"" Beck suggested. That doesn't mean some groups aren't still doing their darndest to protect the holiday from ecumenical creep. Both the American Family Association and Focus on the Family have started rating national retailers based on their Christmas-friendliness. For example, according to AFA's ""Naughty or Nice"" list, Costco is ""for"" Christmas, the Gap and Best Buy ""marginalize"" the holiday, and CVS and Victoria's Secret are ""against"" Christmas. (I just bought candy canes at CVS, so I don't quite get it.) Focus on the Family's Stand for Christmas site allows customers to rate the stores themselves. One customer calls Wal-mart ""Christmas-friendly"" because the company ""pointedly says Merry Christmas in all of their television ads."" Another called it ""Christmas-offensive"" because one of its stores didn't sell nativity scenes. Conservative Christian groups also took offense at a recent Gap ad that made a point of giving equal time to various holidays. ""As a Christian, I don't put Christmas on the same plane as winter solstice,"" said Carrie Gordon Earll, a spokeswoman for Focus on the Family. ""It kind of felt like a poke in the eye."" There's a distinction, of course, between the ""war on Christmas""--essentially a media story pitting aggressive Christmas celebrators against people of other faiths, agnostic Christians, and the occasional atheist--and disputes about the separation of church and state. The latter are going strong. A creche was recently removed from public property in a suburb of Cincinnati after it caused a stir. Both a nativity scene and a menorah were taken off a courthouse lawn in Luzerne County, Pa., after a warning from the American Civil Liberties Union. A federal judge in Arkansas, meanwhile, allowed a display of secular ""freethinkers"" to appear alongside various religious symbols at the State Capitol. Those kinds of disputes persist, says Sean Faircloth of the Secular Coalition for America, but they get eclipsed by the ""war on Christmas"" hype. ""Once the novelty of its inherent silliness wears off, people might return to Constitution,"" he says. He may get his wish. Just as the ""war on Christmas"" has obscured legitimate debate over church and state, other national issues seem to be overwhelming the ""war on Christmas."" Health care reform, climate change talks, and tax breaks for bankers provide plenty of fuel for conservative anger--and eat up plenty of air time. And perhaps Obama is diffusing some of the fear that his election would usher in an era of secular humanism. A devout Christian, he has continued many of the religious traditions of his predecessor, including the National Day of Prayer. Then there's the rise of third-way groups like the Advent Conspiracy, which embraces the religious aspects of Christmas but rejects the consumerism surrounding it. (Watch their promo video here.) Rather than a war on Christmas, they're fighting a war for Christmas. Because even the holiday's biggest supporters agree that it could be a lot merrier. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/just_skim_it.html	"As part of their effort to delay or prevent passage of a health care reform bill, Senate Republicans plan to ask the Senate clerk to  read aloudthe 2,000-plus page bill. (Until Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., withdrew it, the clerk spent three hours yesterday reading Sanders' 767-page long-shot, single-payer amendment.) In an article first published in September and reprinted below, Slate's John Dickerson made the case against legislators reading the legislation they're voting on. Just when you thought the debate about health care reform couldn't get more obscure--is a co-op a public option? Will the CBO rescore the chairman's mark?--the Senate finance committee turned Wednesday morning to an even more arcane subject. It spent more than an hour arguing about whether to use ""conceptual"" or ""legislative"" language in the bill they will, one day, perhaps even in the year 2009, vote on. This may sound unimportant. Or, like discussions about fonts, it might seem deeply important to a fevered few. It's not. The debate touches on a familiar complaint that members of Congress don't read the legislation they vote on. Just because it's familiar, however, doesn't mean the complaint has merit. By custom, the finance committee uses ""conceptual language""--also known as plain English--for a couple of reasons. One, at least in this case, the legislative language doesn't yet exist: There are 500-plus amendments to the bill, and they aren't yet in final form. Two, it uses plain English because the issues it is talking about are complicated and technical. (See an example here.) So using ""conceptual language"" (found here) actually makes it more likely that members (and the public) can understand what's being debated. After everyone agrees, the concepts are sent to the Legislative Counsel's office and put into legislative language, which is debated and voted on. This process has been followed regardless of whether Republicans or Democrats are in the majority. But on the health care bill, Republicans on the committee wanted the final bill to be written in legislative language before they voted. Democrats called this demand a delaying tactic that would stall the bill for three weeks. The longer a bill sits dormant, the greater chance it will die (which is the whole reason the White House has been hurrying along health care legislation as much as it can). The concepts being discussed, they point out, have been under debate for more than a year, in great specificity. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, has been in intense discussion--more than 60 meetings lasting more than 100 hours. Nothing will be further illuminated by putting the bill into more complicated language. Republicans claimed it was a matter of simple common sense. ""I truly do not understand the skepticism about this request, the reluctance and the reticence. This is about doing our job,"" said Snowe. ""If it takes two more weeks, it takes two more weeks. We're talking about trillions of dollars in the final analysis. What is the rush? Is there's something happening in two weeks?"" Republicans argue the delay is necessary because there can be a slip between the agreement and the way it gets interpreted by the lawyers. After you've met with the architect, you still want to make sure the builder is faithful to your exciting idea for a pool table in the Jacuzzi. Politically, having Snowe make the go-slow case is a problem for Democrats. Until now, she's been portrayed as the reasonable Republican, and she may be the only Republican to sign onto health care reform in the end. Why is she suddenly so unreasonable? Partisans would prefer the idea be associated with Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky. He's eccentric and occasionally offensive. (They can also make cracks about him wanting more time so he can get in more shut-eye.) Republicans have been bringing up the reading problem outside the committee room, too, when talking about the broader push for health care reform. ""The era of the 1,000-page bill is over,"" said Lamar Alexander of Tennessee recently. ""We've proven we don't do comprehensive legislation well in these 1,000-page bills that nobody reads."" The remedial-reader charge is a winner as a political tool because it has both highbrow and lowbrow appeal. The working man wonders why the lazy senator can't meet his minimum job requirements. The elite woman with a graduate degree not only thinks it's lazy--after all, everyone in her grad-school seminar was expected to do the reading--but it also confirms her dim view about congressional curiosity. To independent voters, being unable to read the legislation suggests an unnecessary rush that leads to sloppy work. To everyone, it's as galling as the blowhard uncle at Thanksgiving who talks and talks without knowing what he's talking about. It's a bipartisan complaint usually made by the party in the minority. Sen. Obama complained about it during the Bush presidency. It works doubly well for Republicans, though. The lengthy bills are all the proof they need that government has grown too large. (The adherence to careful consideration does not apply when issuing press releases, however. When Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., put out the 200-plus pages of his chairman's ""mark"" last week, Republicans were denouncing it within minutes.) Though the politics of the complaint are irresistible, it doesn't make much sense. Just because lawmakers read legislation doesn't mean they understand it. The reverse is also true: Just because they understand it doesn't mean they've read it. Drafting and reading legislative language is an art form. Staffers who know how to read it and write it are hired to translate the language. They get down in the weeds so the legislators can stay focused on the big principles. Plus, members of Congress have a hard enough time knowing where they stand on the big things. That's why they're always accusing one another of flip-flopping. Let's not confuse them by making them puzzle over something like this: ""For purposes of extension of an agreement with a qualifying ACO under subsection (g)(2), the Secretary shall treat receipt of an incentive payment for a year by an organization under the physician group practice demonstration pursuant to section 1866A as a year for which an incentive payment is made under such subsection, as long as such practice group practice organization meets the criteria under subsection (b)(2)."" Think of it like buying a house: I want to buy this house at this price. I make an agreement with the seller. A month later I sit down in a lawyer's office and go through page after page of legal jargon with someone I trust--not just to have the expertise to explain it to me but to protect me from anything I don't want in there. I could study real estate law, read the contract, and make my own determination--but I have a job and a family. If there's a problem with the final language of the contract, my lawyer alerts me and modifications are made (or I back out). That's what finance committee Democrats say Republicans will be able to do when the health care language is crafted into final language that will come up for a vote on the Senate floor. Whether members of Congress are able to read the legislation is a separate issue from whether they are given enough time to consider it. When Obama aides crafted the stimulus bill, it was being pasted together so quickly even members who were on the committees authorized to write the legislation didn't know what was in it. That kind of rush to completion is likely to happen this time with health care. That should embarrass President Obama, who talked about transparency so much during the campaign, but every indication suggests the White House will be untroubled by this inconsistency. I am also not making an argument for stupidity or laziness. Just because a member of Congress hasn't read a bill doesn't mean he is excused from knowing what's in the bill. A good senator follows the principles of good management, learning how to delegate and then demanding results from those he's tasked with sifting through the legislative language. Walking out of a meeting with a senator last night, I encountered half a dozen policy aides headed in to brief him. I had no doubt from the previous off-the-record conversation that the senator knew the details of policy proposals, not because he'd read all the legislative language but because he quizzed his staff. His questions were informed by other kinds of reading--expert testimony, academic journals, and even news articles, which, one hopes, dear reader, are worth sticking with all the way to the end.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/haley_barbours_bizarre_pardon_record.html	"Mike Huckabee took a beating from his conservative brethren last month after Maurice Clemmons, a man whose sentence the former Arkansas governor commuted in 2000, shot and killed four police officers in Lakewood, Wash. The scuttlebutt on the right suggested that Clemmons' release may doom Huckabee's chances of winning the Republican nomination for president in 2012. I happen to think Huckabee's getting a raw deal on the Clemmons case; instead, we should be talking about the truly bizarre pardon record of one of Huckabee's possible competitors for the nomination, Haley Barbour. The governor of Mississippi has simultaneously ignored increasing evidence that there may be a disturbingly high number of innocent people in prison in Mississippi and handed out pardons to the convicted murderers who just happen to do work on his house. Until 2008, Barbour had been stingy with the pardon. In 2006, I wrote a story for Reason magazine about Cory Maye, a black man in Jefferson Davis County, Miss., convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for shooting and killing a white cop during a botched drug raid. My reporting spawned an outpouring of support for Maye, including from gun rights and home defense advocates on the right, who were outraged over a death sentence for a man who by all appearances thought he was defending his home from apparent intruders. In researching the story, I asked an aide to Barbour whether the governor would ever consider a pardon or clemency for Maye, given that gun rights advocates might support a show of mercy. The aide responded that last he'd heard, Barbour didn't even read pardon petitions. A pardon in a case like Maye's--the cop he killed was the son of the town police chief--was a nonstarter. Barbour took some heat in 2006 when he refused to issue a posthumous pardon to Clyde Kennard, a civil rights worker framed for stealing chicken feed in 1960--a false accusation that prevented him from integrating Mississippi Southern College. The school, now the University of Southern Mississippi, has a building named for Kennard, and Barbour had acknowledged his innocence. But there was no precedent for a posthumous pardon in Mississippi, even though there are plenty of examples elsewhere. A Barbour spokesman put it bluntly and broadly, ""The governor hasn't pardoned anyone, be it alive or deceased. The governor isn't going to issue a pardon here."" And then he started to. Over the last two years, as reported by the Jackson Free Press, Barbour has pardoned, granted clemency to, or suspended the sentences of at least five convicted murderers, four of whom killed their wives or girlfriends. Those four are: Bobby Hays Clark, who in 1996 shot his ex-girlfriend in the neck and beat her boyfriend with a broom handle. Clark, who had a previous aggravated assault conviction, was sentenced to 38 years. Barbour pardoned him last year without notifying the family of Clark's victim.Michael David Graham, who in 1989 shot his ex-wife point-blank with a shotgun while she waited at a traffic light. Barbour suspended Graham's life sentence, and he was released.Clarence Jones, who stabbed his ex-girlfriend 22 times in 1992. She had previously filed multiple assault and trespassing charges against him. He was sentenced to life in prison. Barbour pardoned him last year. Paul Joseph Warnock, who in 1989 shot his girlfriend in the back of the head as she slept. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1993. Barbour pardoned him last year. Barbour also pardoned William James Kimble, convicted and sentenced to life for robbing and murdering an elderly man in 1991. None of these men were pardoned because of concerns that they didn't receive a fair trial or could be innocent. Instead, all five were enrolled in a prison trusty program that had them doing odd jobs around the Mississippi governor's mansion. Responding to backlash when Barbour suspended Graham's sentence, a spokesman for Barbour told the Free Press, ""Historically, Governors have reviewed cases like that of Michael Graham, whose conduct as a prisoner earned him the right to work as a trusty at the Governor's Mansion, where he has performed well and proven to be a diligent workman. The Governor is giving him a chance through an indefinite suspension of his sentence to start a new life away from Pascagoula and Jackson County, pending his future good behavior."" Whether a man who shot his ex-wife point-blank with a shotgun deserves a chance to start a new life, and whether giving him that chance is a proper use of the clemency power is, I suppose, something GOP primary voters will mull over should Barbour decide to run for president in 2012. What's perverse is that while Barbour's been generously dispensing mercy to convicted murderers fortunate enough to get face time with him in Jackson, he's been utterly uninterested in a crisis unfolding in his state's criminal justice system, and the very real possibility that there are a number of innocent people at Mississippi's Parchman Penitentiary, including on death row. In January 2008, two men convicted of rape and murder in the early 1990s--Levon Brooks and Kennedy Brewer--were released from Parchman after they were exonerated by DNA evidence. (I wrote about their cases for Slate last year.) The two were convicted based almost exclusively on the testimony of medical examiner Steven Hayne and self-proclaimed bite mark expert Michael West. West has testified in dozens of other cases in Mississippi. Hayne, whom I've been reporting on for three years now, has testified in thousands. Both men have been condemned by their colleagues for giving testimony wholly unsupported by science. There are at least three people on death row in Mississippi who were convicted thanks largely to Hayne's testimony (one is another bite mark case also involving West), and in all three cases more reputable forensic experts have come forward to express grave concern about what Hayne's said on the stand. The Mississippi Innocence Project and the Innocence Project in New York are looking at hundreds of other noncapital cases involving Hayne and West. Last May, I reported on yet another death penalty case in Louisiana that also featured Hayne, West, and bite marks, and was able to obtain video of West's ""examination"" of the victim, a young girl. Forensic specialists to whom I've shown the video say that it may actually depict criminal evidence tampering--West appears to be actually creating bite marks on the child using a plaster mold of the suspect's teeth. The stories about Hayne and West have been all over Mississippi's newspapers and TV and radio stations, and on a few occasions have made national news. Yet Barbour hasn't uttered a word about them. He hasn't expressed sympathy or apologized to Kennedy Brewer or Levon Brooks for their wrongful incarceration (and in Brewer's case, his near execution). Nor, for that matter, has Barbour said anything about Cedric Willis, another Mississippi man recently exonerated for a murder he didn't commit. ""It's disappointing that the governor's mercy largesse hasn't reached the people whom Dr. Hayne and West affected--many of whom, unlike the people the governor pardons, are unquestionably innocent,"" says Tucker Carrington, who heads up the Mississippi Innocence Project. Barbour's odd record can only prompt questions about the proper use of the pardon. There's some indication that the Founders intended this power as a last check against injustice, not only in cases of wrongful conviction, but where the law was misapplied or where a conviction otherwise wouldn't be in the interest of justice or fairness, even when the defendant is actually guilty. Yet that isn't how governors generally use the pardon. Instead, they bestow redemption on guilty people who claim that they're rehabilitated. This converts the pardon from a check on an imperfect system to an almost religious capacity for conferring forgiveness, for reasons often more personal than related to public policy. There's room to debate whether the criminal justice system is too punitive and if it should focus more on rehabilitation than it does. But the pardon and clemency power isn't the place for it. That power is correctly used to draw attention to injustice, not grant mercy to a few lucky (and guilty) souls. Barbour is handing out mercy to killers while paying no heed to the staggeringly flawed system operating right under his nose. Become a fan of Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/what_if_it_fails.html	"The White House is so determined to pass anything--and I mean anything--it can call health reform that I'm not yet prepared to believe that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's sweat-drenched labors will fail. But the bill as currently configured is in sufficient peril that President Obama called a meeting of the entire 60-person Democratic caucus (including two independents, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the much-loathed Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut). The public option is dead, and so is its understudy, the Medicare buy-in. The abortion issue remains unresolved. A self-imposed Christmas deadline almost certainly won't be met. Public support for health reform is dropping in the polls. Though still unlikely, failure is becoming easier to imagine. What would it look like? Politically, it would be an obvious setback for Democrats and a triumph for Republicans, for whom stonewalling is now official policy. The antecedent weighing on everybody's mind is the death of Hillarycare, which in 1994 helped the GOP recapture the House of Representative for the first time in 42 years. Gary C. Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California San Diego, argued in a 1996 paper that the GOP's 52-seat House gain (it also picked up eight votes in the Senate, winning a majority there, too) owed much to a sense of frustration on voters' part with ""the kind of partisan posturing, haggling, delay, and confusion"" characteristic of government when one party lacks sufficient votes to get legislation passed. Sound familiar? Democrats controlled 56 votes in the Senate, leaving them four votes shy of a filibuster-proof majority; then, as now, there was also some resistance to health reform among Democrats (most notably New York Sen. Pat Moynihan, who, inconveniently, happened to be chairman of the finance committee). Democratic control of the House, Senate, and White House created an ""illusion of unified government"" but not its reality. That illusion, Jacobson wrote, ""put the onus of failure on the Democrats."" The irony is that in venting their rage against what they failed to recognize as de facto divided government, voters ended up with the real thing, diluting the Democrats' power to such an extent that at one press conference President Clinton felt obliged to bleat, ""The president is still relevant here."" Clinton went on to win re-election in 1996, but much of the rest of his presidency was spent furiously ""triangulating"" to find some patch of common ground with Republicans, with sometimes-ghastly results. (The homophobic Defense of Marriage Act is the most vivid example.) If health reform were to fail today, it's very easy to imagine a comparable shift rightward for Obama and the Democrats in 2010. Granted, there are significant differences between 1994 and 2009. Clinton had raised taxes, something Obama hasn't yet done. (Restoration of the top marginal tax rate to the Clinton-era 36 percent from the Bush-era 33 percent is unlikely to occur before November.) Violent crime and teenage birth rates, two problems conservatives often blame on ""permissive"" liberal social policies favored by Democrats, were significantly higher in 1994 than they are today, and the Christian right was a much greater force in electoral politics. The president's party typically loses ground in midterm congressional elections, and House Democrats are reportedly a bit jumpythat already four Democrats representing swing districts have announced their intention not to run in 2010. That's well short of the 28 Democrats who created open seats in 1994. But in some respects, the peril of potential failure is greater today for members of Congress than it was in 1994. The House has already voted on health reform, leaving legislators more vulnerable to identification with a stillborn policy than their counterparts were fifteen years ago, when Hillarycare never got out of committee. Today, as in 1994, the economy is experiencing a very weak recovery from recession. But unemployment is much higher now than it was then, and it easily could remain so through the 2010 midterms. After the Democrats' electoral debacle in 1994, more than a decade passed before Washington was willing to take up any ambitious reform effort. Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist who was principal author of the public option, says that if health reform goes down now, ""I don't think there's going to be any stomach for going back to fight this battle. ...The administration is not going to want to come back to this."" What would a failure to pass health reform mean for ordinary people? If, like me, you're one of the 59 percentof Americans who get health care through your employer, it wouldn't mean much, because almost nothing in the bill would affect this market. The main exception is a 40 percent tax in the Senate bill on ""Cadillac"" health plans valued at $23,000 or more for families. According tothe Congressional Budget Office, about 19 percent of employer-covered workers have these high-end health plans. The tax is sufficiently high that it's assumed insurers would avoid it by lowering the value of these plans, lowering premiums by 9 to 12 percent. Should health reform not pass, participants in Cadillac plans wouldn't enjoy this premium reduction. But neither would they suffer the corresponding drop in the value of their health plans. CBO estimates that, apart from the Cadillac tax, the Senate bill's impact on premiums in the employer-based market would be essentially nonexistent. That means, health reform or no health reform, premiums for employer-based plans will continue to rise faster than inflation or wages. Since 1999, premiums for employer-sponsored family health plans have risen 131 percent, compared to a 28 percent increase in inflation and a 38 percent increase in wages. If, on the other hand, you don't get health insurance through your job, but instead are buying your own insurance on the nongroup market, then a failure on Congress' part to pass health reform could cost you dearly--not because health reform would drive the cost of nongroup policies down (in fact, CBO says the Senate bill would drive the average per-person cost of nongroup premiums up by 10 to 13 percent), but because the majority of those purchasing such policies in the newly-established exchanges would receive government subsidies sufficient to drive out-of-pocket costs 56 percent to 59 percent below current levels. People who didn't qualify for the subsidies would have to pay more for these nongroup policies than they do now, but they'd also get better coverage. If they wanted to pay less, they could instead purchase a cheapo policy comparable to cheapo policies available on the market now and save 14 to 20 percent. Failure to pass health insurance would also mean that insurers could continue to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and charge people in certain demographic groups astronomical premiums, and cancel the policies of very sick people over trivial fine-print flaws in their paperwork. Such abuses, outlawed under health reform, are largely confined to the nongroup market. Failure to pass health insurance would be good news for many Medicare recipients who get their coverage through the private Medicare Advantage program. Currently they receive more benefits than other Medicare recipients. This isn't particularly fair. Health reform would put their benefits back in line with those of the others. The House-passed bill would eliminate a gap in drug coverage above $2,700 and below $6,154, popularly known as the ""donut hole."" Reid is now promising  to accept this change in House-Senate conference. If health reform doesn't pass, senior citizens will continue to run up huge drug bills. A reasonable summary would be: health reform would make life easier for just about every person who needs to buy his or her own health insurance. It would also reassure those of us in the lucky 59 percent who didn't have this problem but could easily imagine acquiring it, especially amid the current economic turmoil. That's just about everybody. Health reform lends, says Hacker, the ""security of knowing there's somewhere to get insurance outside of employment."" Should it fail to pass, you would not have that security. Most important, the Senate bill would allow 31 million of the 45 million people in the U.S. who can't afford health insurance now to acquire some, either through subsidies on the exchange or through the expansion of Medicaid. Without health reform, these folks would not acquire health insurance. Their ""uncompensated care"" would continue to cost the rest of us $56 billionto $73 billionannually, through higher taxes, higher premiums, and charitable contributions. Their lack of financial means (or Medicaid eligibility) would make it sufficiently difficult to receive medical treatment outside a hospital emergency room that an estimated 22,000to 45,000of them would continue to die every year. The threat of electoral defeat in 2010 probably weighs more heavily on the minds of legislators than the prospect of further lives lost. The good news is that fear of such defeat will likely be enough to get the bill passed. E-mail Timothy Noah at chatterbox@slate.com."	A glimpse into the abyss of health reform's (unlikely) defeat.
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/big_whigs.html	"Third parties are in right now. A recent WSJ/NBC poll found that ""nearly one-third of Americans are strongly in favor of the creation of a new, independent political party that could run a presidential candidate in 2012."" What better time for the resurgence of an obscure, long-forgotten, anti-Jacksonian 19th-century political party? The Modern Whig Party held its first-ever national council meeting this weekend in a small conference room at the Arlington Courtyard Marriott. The party is small but, they insist, growing: It now boasts a national headquarters in Washington, D.C., 20,000 ""members"" (more on that later), and 28 official state chapters, including one in Florida, where the party is a registered political organization with ballot access. Among the attendees was Conor Boland, 14, who rode the Amtrak from Delaware with his father, Kevin. ""I'm here with a future Whig voter,"" said Kevin, a former Marine who has not yet taken the plunge into the party himself but wanted to encourage his son's civic interest. Other attendees were serial third partiers. ""I've seen my fair share of third-party flops,"" said William Cerf, 63, a New York restaurateur who, previous to the Whigs, was a member of the Libertarian Party and the Peace and Freedom Party. But that didn't stop him from jumping on the bus from New York to Washington for the conference. ""I hope this will be the first new mainstream political party,"" he said. ""It could be a historical occasion."" The Whigs have fallen in and out of politics for the last four centuries. The term Whig originally dates back to a 17th-century anti-Royalist party that opposed James II's hereditary ascension to the English throne. In 1834, opponents of President Andrew Jackson recycled the name to protest ""King Andrew's"" attempts to expand presidential power. These Whigs eventually coalesced into a national party that supported the Second Bank of the United States, congressional checks on the presidency, and a protective tariff. The party had a brief Golden Age in the 1840s and early '50s, putting four Whigs in the White House--William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Millard Fillmore. But by 1856, the party split over the issue of slavery, and Whigs such as Abraham Lincoln abandoned it for the newly formed Republican Party. The Whigs limped along until 1884, the year of their last national convention in Baltimore. The Modern Whig Party is like its namesake, only with fewer frock coats. The party was conceived in 2007 by active-duty service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, who then started recruiting nonmilitary members when they came back home. They resurrected the old Whigs' symbol, the owl, and chiseled out a platform centered on fiscal responsibility, energy independence, education, states' rights, separation of church and state, and support for veterans. In other words, a Republican head with a Democratic heart. By the time the meeting started on Saturday morning, only 13 people had taken their seats. National Whig Party Chairwoman Elaine Stevens pointed out the historical significance of the 13 attendees--one for each original colony. But the symbolism ended a minute later, when No. 14 walked in late. Stevens kicked off the proceedings, calling the meeting a ""pivotal"" and ""historic"" moment for the party. Stevens then introduced Gene Baldassari, the only Whig in the room who'd run for office. In 2009, Gene ran as a Modern Whig candidate in New Jersey's 14th Assembly. He lost badly, picking up only about 1.5 percent of the vote. But other Whigs have fared better--well, one of them has. Ken Belcher, a Whig, won a local election for constable in Alabama in November 2008, although it's unclear whether he actually ran as a Modern Whig or Democrat. But most members put their hopes in ""Big Whigs"" like Clayton Schock, John Annarumma, and Paul McKain, all of whom are running for Congress on the 2010 Whig ticket in Florida. Next up for discussion was the party's official color. One of state leaders said he had been using buff, a kind of off-yellow. Turns out buff and blue were the Whig Party's original colors. The color went unchallenged and--with that--the party made the only real decision I witnessed in four hours. Stevens then delved into the Modern Whigs' online marketing efforts, a must for any upstart third party these days. The party boasts 20,000 members. Then again, entering contact info on the Web site qualifies you as a ""member."" Furthermore, Stevens admitted that many of those 20,000 had probably been ""lost"" due to the party's failure to engage them. The party should be more proactive, she said, particularly by using Twitter, Facebook, and virtual meetings. Hence the video camera in the middle of the room, streaming the meeting live on the Modern Whig Web site. The afternoon planning session was for Whig members only, so I went home to watch it online. (Apparently, the meeting was closed to press but open to everyone with Internet access.) Fortunately, any sensitive information that might have been disclosed was kept safe by the webcast's spotty sound. Needless to say, the Modern Whig Party has a long way to go. They've ironed out some of the state-level details but currently lack the vision, leadership, and video streaming capability necessary to sustain a competitive national party. Past attempts to repackage the Whigs' name haven't turned out so well:  John Watts ran for governor of Alabama in 1970 and lieutenant governor in 1974 as a Whig candidate. He didn't win. But that doesn't mean it can't happen.  After Whig candidate Zachary Taylor's presidential victory in 1848 *, one Whig announced a prophecy of sorts: ""The Whig Party has safely passed through ... a transition state and will be as enduring as the union itself. ... Its perpetuity as a great national party is placed beyond doubt."" Great may be a stretch, but the Whig party certainly is enduring. Correction, Dec. 15, 2009: This article originally gave the wrong date for Zachary Taylor's presidential victory. ( Return to the corrected sentence.)"	America says it wants a third party. Why not the Modern Whigs?
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/the_nobel_war_prize.html	"President Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize by making the case for war. He didn't just nod to the two wars he presides over. He owned them. He spent more than half of his speech making the case for wars fought in the service of peace. If his speech last week on sending more troops to Afghanistan seemed reluctant, today's was assertive. Perhaps Obama is better when he has something to push against. When he is actively promoting a specific administration policy--in Afghanistan, say, or on health care--the results can be workmanlike or uninspired. Present him with something unexpected, though--whether at Fort Hood, about the racist remarks of his former minister, or from the Nobel Committee--and Obama can deliver a brilliant speech. The Nobel Peace Prize was an honor dropped in his lap, maybe an embarrassment and certainly a distraction. How would he address the fact that he was accepting a peace prize while commanding armies in two wars? How would he address the fact that he was given the award before he actually, you know, did anything? As Obama himself said, in the opening of the speech, his accomplishments are ""slight."" With this speech, Obama achieved something that people also expect of his presidency: He made something out of arriving too early. If Obama was given the award because of someone else's agenda, in the speech he made it about his doctrine. (I bet the two didn't match.) There were a lot of lines in this speech that George Bush could have given--which is ironic, given that, as so many observed (including many within the White House), Obama was given the award for not being George Bush. ""All responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace,"" he said. He made the point repeatedly, which is probably why it was more than halfway though the speech before he got his first applause. ""The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it. Peace requires responsibility. Peace entails sacrifice."" He defined soldiers as ""wagers of peace."" (That kind of wordplay is sure to make some of his supporters deeply uncomfortable, but, then again, the peace prize was founded by the inventor of dynamite.) As much as Obama talked about war, however, it was not a speech just about that. It was a speech about complexity and hard choices between the need for wars and the desire for peace. ""Part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly irreconcilable truths,"" he said, framing the complexity in personal terms between his role as a head of state (who sometimes must wage war) and his personal desire for peace (which matches the aspirations of nonviolent heroes like Martin Luther King). ""As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King's life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of nonviolence. I know there's nothing weak--nothing passive--nothing naive--in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King."" His critics have claimed that this obsession with complexity equals weakness. After this speech, that's a harder case to make. Just as you can recognize complexity yet appreciate the need for action, so can you debate for weeks about Afghanistan and still send 30,000 troops. The president also deprived his critics of the argument that he stoops to European liberals. This was the clubhouse of European liberals. According to the caricature of Obama, he would use the opportunity to apologize for America. And yet this is what he said: ""Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms."" But if the United States has done the hard business of fighting and dying, then it must also do other hard and nonviolent things. Just as he was sounding like a neoconservative, Obama made the case conservatives won't like at all: We must engage with our enemies. ""I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation,"" he said, then proceeded to cite three skillful practitioners of engagement: Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Pope John Paul--conservative icons all. The speech also had tidy turns of phrase. ""The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible, as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God."" In his penultimate paragraph he sketched a picture of the outgunned soldier, the anti-government protestor, and the poor mother in the same mural. It was a tiny mural, but reflected the larger aspirations of the speech. We've come to expect high talk from Obama since his star turn on the stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. What was different in Oslo, Norway, was his voice. ""I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage,"" he said. Obama's critics--and his supporters as well--might have expected a different speech from the person who gave the anti-war speech Obama did in 2002, when he was a mere state senator. He's a different person now--not so much because he is a Nobel laureate but because he is, as he mentioned twice in the speech, a head of state. As his circumstances have changed, so, too, perhaps, have his views. He is a palimpsest president who's writing and speaking change as circumstances warrant. Now that's complex. Become a fan of John Dickerson on Facebook."	With his Nobel speech, Obama shows an idealistic tough-mindedness.
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/metatransparency.html	"On his first full day in office, President Obama promised a ""new era of transparency"" for government. But that promise has gone largely unfulfilled, as the executive branch launched a gajillion clunky Web sites and a nifty Flickr photo stream. Today, the administration finally pinned down its transparency policy: The White House is not just making things public. It's making public the process of making things public. This is not just transparency; it's metatransparency. That's the theory behind the administration's new Open Government Directive (pdf). The initiative, unveiled Tuesday by the Office of Management and Budget, requires every federal agency to come up with three ""high value data sets"" and release them in the next 45 days. Agencies then have to set up their own open government Web sites--http://www.[agency].gov/open--to showcase their transparency efforts. OMB will then regularly check in about new ways the agencies are improving in the areas of ""transparency, participation, and collaboration."" How do we know the agencies will play ball? The White House is setting up what it's calling an ""Open Government Dashboard"" to monitor how the different agencies are doing. Think of it as a combination of data.gov and a high-school hall monitor. On the dashboard will be the best data sets and evaluations of each agency's progress at meeting the new transparency standards. If your agency is doing well, everyone will know. If you're not doing well, everyone will know. Meanwhile, on each agency's Open Government site, readers will be able to browse the newly disclosed data sets, discuss them, manipulate them, rearrange them, and request new ones. The executive branch already has a bunch of data sites and several blogs. But none of them is particularly revolutionary. For one thing, the changes weren't governmentwide. For another, they were fairly superficial. It's fun to see Obama shooting hoops. But it doesn't change the public's relationship with government. Tuesday's directive does--or it will, if the White House follows through. ""It is going to take work for this to be significant and have an impact,"" says John Wonderlich of the Sunlight Foundation. The White House has already signaled to agencies that it's serious about getting good data out of them. Now it has to prove it. The first problem is figuring out what kind of data the public cares about. For example, what exactly is a ""high-quality data set""? As any researcher knows, there are good data and there are bad data. Good data means accurate, timely, well-formatted (spreadsheets) digital information that can be stored, sorted, reorganized, graphed, and combined with other good data. Bad data means old, poorly organized, crappily formatted (paper or PDF) information that takes hundreds of man-hours to organize properly, let alone analyze. Here's one example of ""good data"" just announced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. (Every Cabinet department had to announce a new data set as part of the launch; see an appendix here.) Inspectors across the country examine public housing projects and give them a rating based on how they comply with building standards and housing codes. You can then rank the buildings and cross reference that list with owners of the buildings. ""That would answer, 'Who are worst slum lords in the United States?' "" says Bill Allison, also from the Sunlight Foundation. You could then cross-reference that list with campaign donations and see whether big contributors are getting HUD contracts. Then there's the risk of oversharing. In 2007, the private site FedSpending.org published old records from the United States Department of Agriculture that included Social Security numbers and names. When the USDA found out, it removed the data from the Web. Similar snafus are possible under the new initiative. But despite the rhetoric about changing the culture of governance, chances are agencies will err on the side of nondisclosure rather than overdisclosure. Some skeptics argue that transparency and efficiency are inversely related--that the time an agency spends prepping data could be better spent actually administrating. (Lawrence Lessig, meanwhile, argues that it makes us see skeeziness where skeeziness doesn't exist.) The Obama administration rejects that framework. Quite the opposite, it says: Transparency and efficiency go hand in hand. The data are already there. They just need to be better organized. Making them public makes better organization possible--both by the agency and by academics, businesses, and activists. And better information means greater ability to figure out what works and what doesn't. The tricky part will be getting agencies to comply. At least we'll all have the chance to watch."	The Obama administration finally announces its brave new transparency policy.
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/12/the_twitter_holdouts.html	"Rep. Barney Frank is an outspoken guy with a knack for word craft--in other words, a born tweeter. Frank, though, has decided not to use the microblogging service. His rationale is less about fear of technology than distaste for the format. ""A hundred forty characters is too restrictive,"" he says, ""and anyway I don't think people really want to know what I had for lunch."" Frank isn't on the fringe on this issue. More than two years after Twitter's founding, and a year after microblogging really took off in Washington, only 185 members of Congress--about a third--have signed up. (That said, most Republicans tweet, and the GOP outnumbers Democrats on the site 2-to-1.) It's easy to dismiss the Twitter holdouts as luddites destined for the trash heap of history, but members of Congress have their reasons for holding out. The most common rationale for the Twitter holdouts: It's not the best way to communicate with their constituents. Frank instead uses Facebook, which allows for longer posts and provides a better interface to engage supporters. Rep. Louie Gohmert doesn't use the tool simply because people in his East Texas district don't use it. They use Facebook--see a pattern?--where Gohmert currently boasts 2,451 fans. If his district starts tweeting, so will he. Same with New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler. ""We have nothing against Twitter,"" says his press secretary, Ilan Kayatsky. ""But we haven't yet found a compelling reason to use it."" Many are taking a wait-and-see approach. Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and thus oversees the 2010 House races, doesn't use the service because in his opinion, the jury's still out. ""I'm not sure it has a huge future,"" he said back in April. ""My kids don't Twitter."" Others simply haven't gotten around to it. ""Stay tuned,"" says Joe Lieberman's office. Nancy Pelosi's office has a feed with 450 followers but hasn't started posting yet. One major problem, congressional staffers say, is resources. Reps barely have time for interviews--how can they (or, in most cases, their staff) find time to tweet? Twitter advocates reject this excuse. Nick Schaper, who handles new media for House Minority Leader John Boehner, says that ""as far as resources allocated, it's just about nil."" A more fundamental problem is that, so far at least, members of Congress just aren't that good at it. A report released by the Congressional Research Service in September found that nearly half of congressional tweets simply link to press releases or news articles. (The report doesn't distinguish between the two, but an informal survey of congressional feeds suggests the former are more common.) The next most common type of tweet describes an official congressional action, like a roll call vote or a trip abroad. ""Personal"" tweets and those related to business in their district--the two types of messages most likely to interest constituents--were the least common types. Sure, linking to press releases isn't a terrible thing. But people don't sign up for Twitter to get updates on their representative's obscure pet project. That's what Web sites are for. Twitter is about glimpsing how a person thinks. Who are the best congressional tweeters? The site Klout.com  measures a Twitter user's influence by accounting for more than 25 factors, including reach (number of followers), engagement (how many @ replies you receive), and ""velocity"" (how often your messages get re-tweeted). The site then gives you a score between 0 and 100. The average score for users in general is about 15. The average score for members of Congress is 20--pretty weak, considering they're public figures with built-in fan bases. Topping the Klout roster these days is Sen. John McCain, whose 1.6 million followers earn him a hardy 74 points. Trailing close behind is Sen. Claire McCaskill, who scored 71 in October, but whose score has since fallen to 54. McCaskill's tweets are famously personal, albeit anticlimactic: ""Sat by David Axelrod last night ...,"" she revealed last Wednesday. Exciting! What's the juice? ""Talked about family ... and healthcare."" Oh. McCaskill joined Twitter to combat the perception during her Senate campaign that she was cold and aloof. Apparently it worked. Texas Rep. John Culberson rates a score of 35 but is one of Congress' most vocal Twitter evangelists. He's also a paragon of engagement: As of this writing, 60 of his last 80 tweets were @ replies. For these members, Twitter makes sense. But others feel that the service hasn't proven itself in the political realm. To what extent does all this tweeting actually help a politician? The evidence isn't especially scientific. The DCCC points to boosted fundraising as proof that tweeting pays, but they don't distinguish between donations resulting from Twitter and those resulting from an e-mail blast. It's also unclear that having more followers is always better. Just because you have 800,000 followers doesn't mean you're more effective than someone who has 20,000. ""The critical issue is how active are their followers?"" says Micah Sifry of Personal Democracy Forum. ""And that's a lot harder to measure."" There's also a perceived risk of embarrassment--and for some of the more knuckleheaded members, a genuine one. Twitter has hosted many an unforced error. In February, Michigan Rep. Pete Hoekstra broke a press embargo on a secret congressional trip when he revealed on Twitter that he had ""Just landed in Baghdad."" Newt Gingrich chose Twitter as the venue for his famous denigration of Sonia Sotomayor as ""racist."" It also seems to bring out the third grader in every member. ""It was very heart warming to see the miliyary and especially the wounded warrios honored at the tiger woods tournament in Washington,"" Gingrich tweeted in July. Sen. Chuck Grassley, meanwhile, seems to have invented his own language for the sole purpose of tweeting. One recent gem: ""Did Bfast Wloo Gates Optimist Pancakes. Helps w education at Cunningham school. Rest of Sat at finals HS Voleyball in CRapids."" (For Grassley's more contentious tweets, see here.) Of course, there's no more risk in posting a tweet than in opening one's mouth. If anything, there's less, since Twitter gives you the chance to review your message before posting. Handled correctly, Twitter can do as much damage control as damage. It gives you a chance to correct and respond to misperceptions before they take root. If Lieberman used Twitter, he could defend himself against those who deploy the hashtag #dumpJoe, or at least defuse some of the rancor. Twitter is by no means done growing in Congress. With every member of the House and a third of the Senate up for re-election in 2010, chances are we will see more tweeting as incumbents exploit every possible means of communication. But even then, there are going to be obstacles. Ethics, for one. Right now, representatives aren't allowed to conduct campaign business using time, equipment, or resources paid for by taxpayers. This extends to BlackBerrys. If your Berry is paid for using Senate funds, you're technically not allowed to tweet about your campaign. Some candidates, like Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is running for governor, have carefully created separate campaign feeds. What happens if a member slips up? One word: Twittergate."	Why is more than half of Congress still not on Twitter?
