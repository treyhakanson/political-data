While you wait for the Donald to appear--and even during his off-kilter and meandering talk--you can buy snacks. On Monday evening, American Airlines Center wasn't just a venue for Trump's next speech: It was open for business, and attendees could grab popcorn, peanuts, nachos, and plenty of beer. This was a spectacle, and the assembled embraced it. People dressed in Trump memorabilia--including one woman in a Trump-branded dress--took selfies in front of Trump signs, and cheered in anticipation of the billionaire's arrival. ""This is actually my first rally I've ever been to, period,"" said George Lanier, a well-built personal trainer from nearby Carrollton, Texas. ""I was like--what better way to start it off than by seeing Donald Trump, you know? He's very exciting, it'll be very entertaining."" Lanier liked Trump's ideas, but he was much more drawn to the candidate's affect and style. ""I love that he's talking in everybody else's language. He's not trying to be politically correct--he's just speaking to us like how we're talking here, or how you talk to your friends."" We associate Trump with the Republican right wing, but this wasn't a Tea Party rally. The crowd was diverse, or at least more diverse than you might assume. Chris Nieves was a transplant from New York City who studied at Texas Christian University and came as an undecided voter, interested in Trump as a businessman who could bring jobs and opportunity to minority communities. ""He's not a politician, and I think that's huge for us minorities, because a lot of politicians like to exploit us,"" said Nieves. ""I think that he's an independent voice, and I think that would be especially good for minorities who are in need of that, because of the establishment that has failed us."" ""I wanted to see what this was all about,"" explained Lawrence Badih, a real estate agent who lives in Fort Worth but was born in Sierra Leone and immigrated to the United States. ""I've been registered Republican for a long time, and we need a change. I see Trump is rising in the polls--he's No. 1. He's saying things that no one else wants to say--they're being politically correct."" For all the Trump-curious voters, however, there were just as many Trump supporters, who were clear-eyed and enthusiastic about their candidate. ""We absolutely love Donald Trump, and we are supporting him 1,000 percent,"" said Marilu Rumfolo, a retired investment banker who came all the way from Spring, near Houston. Rumfolo thinks Trump will be a strong conservative on immigration. ""He hit a home run with immigration,"" she said. ""People who just walk in and take our country by force, they really don't have the same values. We want immigrants, but we have to make sure the law is followed."" She also thinks Trump will be a less divisive leader than President Obama. ""I don't feel like he's going to create that kind of animosity that we see with Black Lives Matter,"" she explained. ""Because honest to God, all lives matter, and it's really an insult to see a person working 40 to 60 hours a week and be told, even if they've struggled their whole life, that if they're white, 'Your struggle doesn't count because your skin color isn't a certain way.' "" At 30 minutes after its scheduled time, the event began. An estimated 16,000 people were packed in the center waving American flags and signs for Trump. First onstage: A megachurch pastor who thanked God for Trump's ""selfless public service."" Then, a local Tea Party activist who railed against Republican leaders--citing the Mississippi Senate primary where incumbent Thad Cochran worked with Democrats to beat his challenger, Chris McDaniel--and declared her belief that, with Trump on the ballot, ""2016 may be more historic than the election of Barack Obama."" (At that, the crowd went wild.) Finally, Trump sauntered on stage to whoops, hollers, and cheers. Trump gave the usual. He gestured toward policies and issues (the Iran Deal, China, Mexico); attacked his opponents (""Jeb Bush,"" he said to boos, before mentioning Hillary Clinton to even louder ones); praised himself (he was leading the polls, unlike everyone else, he didn't need the ""blood money"" of rich people, and if elected president, he was going to win so much ""your head will spin""); and leaned in to his anti-immigrant rhetoric. ""Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants,"" he said to huge cheers. ""They're rough dudes."" He complained about trade with Japan--""They send us millions of cars. Millions. We send them beef. They don't even want it.""--and promised to make a deal that will force Mexico to ""build that wall."" After more than an hour of speaking, he concluded with his slogan: ""You're going to say to your children, and you're going to say to anybody else, that we were part of a movement to take back our country. ... And we will make America great again."" At this point, the speakers blared with ""We're Not Gonna Take It,"" and the crowd filed outside in the glow of Trump's unabashed nationalism. There, in the plaza outside the center, they were met by demonstrators from the League of United Latin American Citizens. Carrying Mexican and American flags, they protested Trump's presence and his message. ""No more Trump,"" chanted a group of activists wearing shirts that said ""Latinos Stand Up"" on the front and ""Fuck Donald Trump"" on the back. ""We want them to know we're united,"" said Maira Medina, a manager at a local restaurant who was holding an anti-Trump sign. ""If this state is going to be united, we have to unite with everybody and put the hatred and derogatory terms aside."" Most of the Trump rally's attendees walked by without incident. But some couldn't resist a confrontation. ""Deport illegals! No more illegals!"" yelled one older woman who got into a shouting match with a group of protesters. A bald, bearded young man--wearing a T-shirt with the words ""Commies aren't cool""--almost got into a fight with one of the demonstrators before police officers separated the two. And another young man--this one wearing a navy blazer, a pink patterned bow tie, and a pair of gray dress pants--was surrounded by media and bystanders as he argued with a young Mexican American man about ""illegals."" Trump is a sideshow, and in the presence of his personality, it's easy to overlook the ugliness behind his campaign. But it's there, a debased successor to the nationalist white resentment of Pat Buchanan and George Wallace. And although spectators may miss it, it's more than clear for the targets of his xenophobia, and the people who hate them. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Spectacle of Donald Trump Shouldn't Hide a Very Ugly Message

As if that's the problem. A familiar faction of conservatives, led by presidential aspirant Sen. Ted Cruz and 40-plus co-conspirators in the House, have pledged not to advance any spending measure that funds Planned Parenthood. Government funding expires at the end of the month, so what we have is another iteration of the legislative brinksmanship that's defined the Obama-Tea Party era. McConnell has this funny notion that the past can be used to inform the present. Kentucky's senior senator seems to believe he can explain to conservatives the simple mechanics of the problem--congressional Democrats will not agree to defund Planned Parenthood, President Obama would veto any such bill if they did, and Republicans would be blamed for the shutdown--and they'll think to themselves, Huh, hadn't though about it like that; nevermind. ""Shutting down the government,"" McConnell tells Politico, ""it doesn't defund Planned Parenthood any more than shutting down the government two years ago would have defunded Obamacare."" He lists a few small-bore items that he hopes this 114th Congress has a chance of passing, though he concedes that ""none of them by themselves fundamentally change the country."" As far as those sexier, more ideological goals that might ""fundamentally change the country,"" like eliminating federal grant money to a family-planning federation? Those will have to wait until 2017 and the would-be incoming Republican president. McConnell at least tries to put this dispiriting call for patience into a rousing right-wing frame. ""This is a critical election,"" he explains, ""... about whether we want to continue to go down this European path, or whether we want to recapture the growth rates and the greatness we've had most of our history."" Conservatives don't like being told to wait. House Republicans offered conservative voters the store in 2010--no more debt ceiling increases ever!--but, once in power, soon had to explain that they could not transform the republic into an abortion-free, deregulated utopia from one house of Congress. Senate Republicans more or less promised the end of liberalism should voters entrust them with a majority in 2014, and now they're pleading with conservatives to acknowledge the continuing existence of the filibuster and Obama administration. (Something for McConnell to consider now as he begins overpromising the many splendors that await conservatives in 2017: The filibuster will exist then, too. Probably.) McConnell is correct that the Republicans will not be able to win a shutdown battle over Planned Parenthood. The problem isn't in his conference, anyway; Sen. Cruz appears to be flying solo in the Senate on this particular stunt. McConnell is playing the blunt bearer of bad news on this one because Speaker John Boehner (whose job is supposedly on the line) has to pretend for at least the next two weeks that House conservatives have a valid strategic argument that's worth ""hearing out."" McConnell's message of reason won't work on House conservatives, though, because they already understand it. It just doesn't suit their political circumstances. Each member, including McConnell, is acting according to his or her incentives, which is why this folly repeats itself year after year. An inability to grasp logic has nothing to do with it. Logic, instead, is what fuels it. Let's start with McConnell. For whatever strange reasons, he enjoys being Senate majority leader, and he hopes to maintain his majority in the next Congress. A government shutdown over Planned Parenthood--funding for which is still, on the whole, a popular policy--would do little to aid Republican senators up for reelection in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, or Illinois. Sure, Republicans were blamed for the 2013 government shutdown and were able to quickly dispatch its legacy, winning landslide victories in 2014. But that doesn't mean that the shutdown helped the GOP; the 2016 electorate and battleground map will be far less favorable to Republicans than 2014's was. Cruz, meanwhile, is positioning himself as McConnell's chief foil in this fight. Indeed, he's positioning himself as McConnell's chief foil for everything, because that's the central message of his presidential campaign: the anti-establishment gadfly with enough ""spine"" to constantly annoy his colleagues with hopeless procedural stunts. His Planned Parenthood crusade might also improve his chances with evangelical voters in Iowa. The House Republicans with whom Cruz is collaborating, and who hold the real power to block legislation here, are not the dunces incapable of understanding vote counts that they're typically accused of being. These members largely represent districts where the only threat they could potentially face is a primary challenger from their right flank. After the well-organized outrage over the Planned Parenthood sting videos, it will be politically difficult for them to vote for any measure that appropriates funds to that organization. Even that might not even get to the core of it: It's politically difficult for them to vote for anything that Boehner and McConnell ask of them that doesn't slaughter at least one high-profile Democratic sacred cow. And then there are the Democrats, who would love for the Republicans to shut down the government for a couple of weeks. They won't admit this in any official capacity, but of course they long for the GOP-orchestrated chaos for the exact same reasons that Republican leaders lay awake at night trying to devise a strategy to avoid a shutdown. Throw all of these highly logical actors together, and sometime around Sept. 30 we'll see the likely Grand Compromise. McConnell puts forth a separate, abortion-related protest vote that gets filibustered but gives enough Senate Republicans cover to vote for a continuing resolution that funds Planned Parenthood along with everything else. Cruz votes against it and gives a long, pompous speech about why he ""cannot in good conscience"" vote for this or any other bill; excerpts from this oration are quickly inserted into his fundraising solicitations and stump speeches. House conservatives either extract some meaningful concession from Boehner beyond a protest vote or, more likely, they simply don't vote to fund the government. Boehner passes a ""clean"" continuing resolution with many Democratic votes after Rep. Nancy Pelosi extracts some pledge out of him that he really hopes doesn't leak. The public learns about it when it immediately leaks. Republican leaders get to keep the government open, conservative presidential candidates get to grandstand on the trail, House conservatives get to holler to constituents back home about the ""spinelessness"" of the Republican establishment, Democrats keep Planned Parenthood funded, and Planned Parenthood keeps Democrats funded. Reason prevails, in its own politically refracted way."	McConnell Seems to Think Reason Will Persuade Republicans to Avoid a Government Shutdown. (How Silly!)

A month ago Democrats were working to stop a GOP-penned resolution of disapproval against President Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran. No, the resolution wouldn't preclude the president's authority to enter the deal, nor would it keep him from enforcing the agreement and its terms. But it would restrict his ability to lift sanctions on Iran, and potentially threaten the deal itself, as allies questioned U.S. commitment to the agreement. To succeed, Democrats would need to sustain a presidential veto. And by the end of last week, they had reached their goal: President Obama had 34 ""no"" votes against the Republican resolution, protecting a White House veto. Still, Republicans would pass the law--with a few Democratic votes--and Obama would take the political blow, even as he won the substance. On Thursday, however, that changed. When the resolution came for a vote, 42 senators voted to filibuster and keep it from the Senate floor. Democrats didn't just save the deal; they blocked the GOP altogether. It was a huge win, and the administration wasn't shy about its success. ""This vote is a victory for diplomacy, for American national security, and for the safety and security of the world,"" said Obama. ""I am heartened that so many senators judged this deal on the merits, and am gratified by the strong support of lawmakers and citizens alike."" But for as much as the White House can justly gloat over its strategy for securing Senate support, we shouldn't ignore the extent to which it had a huge ally in persuading Democrats to stand with the deal. Namely, the Republican Party. When the administration announced the deal in mid-July, it was an open question whether Democrats would sign on. First, there was public opinion. No, Americans might not want another war, but that's not the same as supporting an agreement with Iran, especially one that lifts sanctions. What's more, Americans had concerns about Israel--would this open an important ally to danger from an economically emboldened Iran? Sensitive to both concerns, many elected Democrats were wary of the deal, and some--like New York Sen. Chuck Schumer--eventually came out against it. Republicans could have capitalized on the division, running against the deal while offering an alternative and showing--in word and deed--that this was about the policy, not the president. Schumer is a Democrat, but his final statement on the deal is instructive as a model for how to thread this needle. ""Advocates on both sides have strong cases for their point of view that cannot simply be dismissed. ... I have decided I must oppose the agreement and will vote yes on a motion of disapproval,"" he said. ""While we have come to different conclusions, I give tremendous credit to President Obama for his work on this issue."" No, it's not red meat. But this kind of considered opposition could have peeled away enough Democrats from the administration to win the legislative battle and jeopardize the deal. Instead, Republicans jumped to hyperbole. When the deal was still just a negotiation, Republican senators led by Tom Cotton of Arkansas sent an ""open letter"" to Iran's leaders urging them to dismiss talks. Shortly afterward, Republican leaders joined with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to slam the negotiation as a deadly threat to Israel. In the following months, Republicans would say the deal was ""akin to declaring war on Israel""; that Obama was ""march[ing]"" Israelis to the ""door of the oven""; and that the president was siding with ""the oppressors."" The apex of this criticism came Tuesday, when former Vice President Cheney slammed the agreement in the fiercest words possible. ""I know of no nation in history that has agreed to guarantee that the means of its own destruction will be in the hands of another nation, particularly one that is hostile,"" he said. None of this scared Democrats into voting against the deal. Instead, it was evidence that this fight was irreducibly partisan, with no chance of a compromise or detente. Cautious Democrats--like Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon or Cory Booker of New Jersey--had two options: They could sign on with Cheney and the GOP, or they could bolster the president. They chose the latter, and handed Obama a victory that wasn't guaranteed. All of this should sound familiar. Change a few details, and you have the dynamic of early 2010, when a desperate Democratic Party wanted bipartisan support for a health care bill, and would take any compromise to pass a law. In that moment Republicans were primed to win the substance; they could deny the Democratic goal of universal health insurance and show their concern for the least fortunate with a piecemeal and limited health reform law. Instead, they wouldn't budge, which forced Democrats into a choice: They could save the Affordable Care Act and pass it as written, or they could end the fight with nothing. They chose the former, and gave Obama the law that may define his legacy. Likewise, if House Republicans could just compromise and accept the presidential ""grand bargain,"" the party would have won cuts to major retirement programs, entrenching a new, conservative status quo. Now, four years later, it stands against an emerging liberal consensus for expanding Social Security and the welfare state. Again and again, the GOP's great obstacle--and Democrats' great ally--is itself. Its intransigence might win elections--Obamacare helped the GOP win the 2010 midterms, and Republicans hope that Iran will do the same for 2016--but it comes at a cost: policy that's more liberal than the alternative. And while there's still time to turn the tide, it's running out. If Democrats win another four years in the White House, they can turn Obama's changes into a new and durable status quo."	Obama's Best Ally on the Iran Deal Was the Republican Party
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/martin_o_malley_thinks_there_should_be_more_debates_and_hillary_clinton.html	"Late last month, at the summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee, Martin O'Malley demanded more debates. ""Four debates and only four debates--we are told, not asked--before voters in our earliest states make their decisions,"" said the presidential candidate and former Maryland governor. ""This sort of rigged process has never been attempted before,"" he added. ""One debate in Iowa. That's it. One debate in New Hampshire. That's all we can afford."" It's no surprise O'Malley wants more debates; despite solid credentials and a competitive record, he's virtually invisible in the Democratic primary, far behind Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and even one possible candidate who hasn't declared yet in Vice President Biden. (He's ahead of Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Lincoln Chafee, though.) More debates would give him a platform and a chance to appeal beyond the narrow slice of Democratic voters who reject Hillary but don't want Sanders. Clinton says she's open to more debates--""I debated a lot in 2008, and I would certainly be there with lots of enthusiasm and energy if they decide to add more debates""--and Sanders, like O'Malley, is thrilled at the possibility of a larger set of debate stages. ""I think this country benefits, all people benefit, democracy benefits, when we have debates, and I want to see more of them,"" he told CNN. ""I think that debates are a good thing."" But additional debates can do more than help candidates and broaden the audience for the party's message; they can finally give the media something to talk about other than Hillary's ongoing woes. Far from a distraction or risk, more debates might be the only thing Democrats can do to shift attention from Clinton and her assorted problems, from email to falling poll numbers. It's worth asking why we don't have more debates, if every candidate wants them. The answer is straightforward: DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is fully opposed to more debates, perhaps in an effort--as O'Malley suggests--to shield Clinton from further criticism. ""We're not changing the process. We're having six debates,"" she said on Thursday, before issuing a threat to anyone who tries to circumvent the party. ""The candidates will be uninvited from subsequent debates if they accept an invitation to anything outside of the six sanctioned debates."" Not all DNC leaders agree. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, vice chairs Tulsi Gabbard and R.T. Rybak argued the case for more debates. ""We believe that the DNC's decision to limit Presidential candidates to six debates, with a threat of exclusion for any candidate who participates in any non-DNC sanctioned debate, is a mistake,"" they wrote. ""It limits the ability of the American people to benefit from a strong, transparent, vigorous debate between our Presidential candidates, as they make the important decision of who will be our Democratic Presidential nominee."" There's no sign Wasserman Schultz will budge. But if Wasserman Schultz is seriously interested in improving the party and boosting its candidates, including Hillary Clinton, she might want to reconsider. Right now Clinton coverage is consumed by the email scandal. Everything from her policy proposals to her overall lead in the Democratic primary is overshadowed by the drip of news around her email use as secretary of state. Even though there's no evidence of criminal behavior--specifically, no indication Clinton passed classified documents or deliberately sent classified information through her private email system--the story won't go away because it feeds into her pre-existing image as being scandal-prone. Also, never mind that Hillary's offense has more to do with the action than the venue; sending classified materials via official state.gov email is just as illegal as sending it through an unofficial channel, and just as vulnerable to outside interference. (See the massive Russian hack of the State Department's email system). There are legitimate criticisms of Clinton's decision and important questions about her commitment to official transparency. Those aside, however, it's not clear that there's an actual ""scandal"" in this email controversy. Still, the scrutiny is real, has had a negative effect on Clinton's standing, and will continue to until she and the party can change the subject. Debates won't make Clinton popular; they may even harm her in the primary and elevate her opponents. But by enhancing the horserace, they'll change the subject from Clinton's problems, giving the press a different topic of conversation. More broadly, they'll highlight the substance of the Democratic primary; if the GOP is consumed with Donald Trump and his dominance of the Republican field, the Democratic Party is genuinely considering an array of policy questions, from the expansion of the welfare state to criminal justice reform, immigration, and voting rights. If anything, more debates give Democrats a greater chance to contrast themselves with the GOP and its chaotic primary process. Even if it comes with risks, it's a win for everyone.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/stop_the_iran_deal_rally_s_unexpected_target_conservatives_are_now_blaming.html	"No one expected many of the attendees at Wednesday's Stop the Iran Deal Rally on Capitol Hill to have warm feelings toward the Democratic presidential administration that just negotiated a nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran. But less expected was that the antipathy spread even more profoundly to members of the Republican leadership. ""Obama is a black, Jew-hating, jihadist putting America and Israel and the rest of the planet in grave danger,"" said Bob Kunst of Miami. Kunst--pairing a Hillary Clinton rubber mask with a blue T-shirt reading ""INFIDEL""--was holding one sign that accused Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry of ""Fulfilling Hitler's Dreams"" and another that queried, ""DIDN'T WE LEARN ANYTHING FROM 1938?"" His only reassurance was that, when Iran launches its attack on the mainland, it'll be stopped quickly by America's heavily armed citizenry. Not every attendee or speaker at the rally, organized by the Tea Party Patriots, was as colorful as Kunst. As with many right-wing rallies during the Obama era--though this is the rare occasion that dealt with a foreign policy agreement--normally dressed citizens concerned about policy consequences were intermixed with howling conservative activists carrying bombastic, crude signs. One of most common placards came in several versions with different legislators' names--Sen. Ed Markey, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and so on--inscribed on a drawing of a first-generation atomic bomb under which read, ""Will your name be on Iran's bomb?"" But both Markey and Klobuchar have already signaled their support for the Joint Plan of Action, along with 40 other Democratic and independent senators. Under the Corker-Cardin framework for debating the nuclear agreement, that's enough to successfully filibuster any attempt to prevent President Obama from waiving nuclear sanctions on Iran. The deal will go through. So shouldn't a rally of this nature have been held, say, in late July, before Obama had the votes he needed? ""That would have been preferable,"" said Bill from Damascus, Maryland. Heading into Wednesday afternoon, the Stop the Iran Deal Rally felt more like a coda for a failed summer campaign to scuttle the deal than a useful means of accomplishing anything. The deal's grassroots opponents originally seemed to believe that members would be so overwhelmed with protests against the accord when they were home for their August recess that nary a one would dare return to Washington and allow the administration's deal to skirt through. But even though the deal polls abysmally, the administration was able to successfully whip nearly all Senate Democrats in its favor. It will be implemented now--that is, until at least January 2017, when President Marco Rubio or Scott Walker tears it up on Day 1, or President Trump begins the process of ""renegotiating"" it in a way that Makes America Great Again. But try telling that to these folks. And especially try telling them that Congress, specifically the Republican leaders in Sen. Mitch McConnell and Speaker John Boehner, have no tools at their disposal to stop it. That's how Tea Party Patriots and other affiliated groups conveniently shifted the focus of their rally once Senate supporters crossed the threshold of 34 votes last week: The deal will only go through if the Republican establishment allows it to pass. President Obama may ""make Neville Chamberlain look like George Patton,"" in the words of right-wing talk radio personality Mark Levin, but the Republican leaders would be even worse by allowing him to get away with it. Freshman Rep. Dave Brat, aka the Cantor Slayer, elicited stronger boos by mentioning the names ""McConnell and Boehner"" than any mention of the name ""Obama"" did all day. ""Leadership got us into this mess, and they're the only ones who can get us out,"" he said to cheers, as music began to play signaling that his brief speaking window had closed. ""The situation we're in is a product of weak leadership."" Frank Gaffney, the former Reagan administration Defense Department official who has since built a career trafficking in entertainingly grim paranoia, declared that ""if Republican leaders in the Senate and House do not stop the deal--which they can--their names will be on the bombs."" Right there with Sens. Markey, Klobuchar, and the rest. The plan they're alluding to is a fast-moving one that, within the past 48 hours, has sent congressional Republicans into chaos. ""All that has to happen,"" Sen. Ted Cruz said to the crowd, ""is for Mitch McConnell and John Boehner to say the review period hasn't started."" This alludes to a push by Rep. Peter Roskam and other conservatives wherein Republican leaders would argue that Obama has not presented the ""full"" nuclear agreement before Congress; it doesn't include, as Politico reports, ""so-called 'side deals' that were hashed out between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency."" Until those presumably nefarious ""side deals"" are sent, the logic goes, the 60-day review period hasn't begun, and deal opponents will have more time to sway legislators to their side. House Republican leaders were discussing shifting strategy with the rank-and-file Wednesday afternoon as the rally was going on. As Politico adds, though, ""Whatever course House Republicans choose will have almost no practical impact."" McConnell and Corker have been cool to the idea, as it might lead to Congress never registering its disapproval of the deal at all. The 60-day period will expire on Sept. 17, and the White House will begin implementing the deal. What the Roskam plan does effectively do, though, is paper over the fact that Congress never could do much to stop this deal with the potent anti-establishment politics that blossomed during the Summer of Trump. Lawmakers who railed against this deal, and now recognize that it's going through anyway, will transfer the rage of activists like those at Wednesday's rally toward those familiar spineless, all-talk-no-action, cowardly punching bags, Boehner and McConnell. And it will work. Not because Boehner and McConnell (and Corker) didn't make an effort, as they'll be accused of. The Corker-Cardin framework gave opponents a chance to kill the deal through Congress--a long shot, sure, but better than the alternative, which would have been the deal going through with zero congressional input. But they're the highest-ranking GOP officials in government right now, and GOP voters unfamiliar with nitpicky federal government procedures will be perfectly willing to blame them for ""allowing"" this to happen. ""What a lame Congress,"" Pat Webb, who traveled from Miami to attend the rally, said about McConnell and Boehner's inability to put the brakes on this. ""It's got to be stopped."""	Look Who Conservatives Are Blaming for the Iran Deal Now

That's a shame. There's much to be mined by comparing the two billionaires. Like Trump, Perot built his campaign on opposition to bad trade deals. He also harnessed public anger at the political ruling class and the special-interest money that fueled their campaigns. Like Trump, Perot boasted that he took no outside money and pointed to his pledge to self-finance as proof that he couldn't be bought. Perot was the first talk-show candidate, effectively announcing on Larry King Live in February 1992. He took advantage of the venue, where he could speak with less of a filter. He also bought infomercials to speak directly to voters. Trump, the first reality-show candidate, has taken advantage of a similar media environment that allows him to speak freely to voters. When Perot spoke of the problems in Washington, he offered Trump-like certainty about how easily they could be solved by someone who had come from the real world of business. ""I can solve the problem of the national debt without working up a sweat,"" he said. ""It's just that simple."" One of the great moments of his outsider campaign came in the first debate with Bill Clinton and President George H.W. Bush when both men suggested Perot lacked the political experience necessary to make progress. Perot responded by saying it's true he didn't have any experience. ""I don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes any responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done. ... I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem."" If Trump doesn't steal this line of argument for the next debate, he should dock his own pay. Despite the similarities, it's the differences between Perot and Trump that are the most illuminating. Perot enjoyed a healthy ego like Trump, but unlike the real estate magnate, he ran on a platform of something more than his skill. As an answer to the public dissatisfaction with Washington politicians, Perot offered a specific reform agenda that included term limits for members of Congress, a balanced budget amendment, and national referenda in which voters would be allowed a direct say in making laws by putting them on a national ballot. Perot was selling a specific set of guardrails that would ensure a stronger relationship between lawmakers and the people. Trump is offering a one-time personality sale. Voters just have to hope that he gets it right and that Congress snaps into shape. Perot was selling a system that was in keeping with the founding principles of the country (and concerns of the founders), and it would guard against the megalomania of politicians. Trump's candidacy encourages the cult of personality by putting the whole bundle in one candidate. Both Perot's and Trump's plans for government mirrored their personalities and their business careers. Trump is founded on Trump, who credits bravado as a key tool in selling his prowess. ""The final key to the way I promote is bravado,"" Trump wrote in The Art of the Deal. ""I play to people's fantasies. That's why a little hyperbole never hurts."" His presidential campaign operates on a similar principle. Perot, on the other hand, was a just-the-facts businessman who made his fortune by selling his information technology equipment and services company to General Motors. In keeping with that vision and his Eagle Scout and U.S. Naval Academy training, Perot was addicted to facts. His chart-laden infomercials sought to inform voters on every particular, from the size of the U.S. trade deficit to the imbalance in CEO pay. Perot believed in making a painstaking argument to the American people. Trump, on the other hand, doesn't think facts are so important. It must be said that he has offered the most specific immigration plan of any of the candidates since they made their campaign declarations, but his general principle about the relationship between what he must tell voters and what they expect he'll do is pretty loose. ""I think the press is more eager to see it than the voters, to be honest,"" Trump said last month in Iowa when asked when he might release a detailed immigration plan. ""I think the voters like me, they understand me, they know I'm going to do the job. ... I think they trust me. I think they know I'm going to make good deals for them."" In 2000 Trump flirted with running for president as a candidate of the Reform Party that Perot founded in 1995. That a third party could live on beyond the Perot candidacy was a testament to the fact that there were ideas that could live on past the man promoting them. That's another way in which the two campaigns are different. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Donald Trump Isn't Another Ross Perot
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/ted_cruz_will_push_for_a_government_shutdown_over_funding_planned_parenthood.html	"The 114th Congress returned from its summer recess Tuesday to work on the most pressing business facing the nation. Now that President Obama has the votes he needs for the Iran deal, Congress--after some scheduled histrionics about the treachery inherent in that diplomatic accord--will give way to the ho-hum issue of funding the federal government for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Except there will be nothing fun or easy for House and Senate leaders in this process. The Planned Parenthood ""sting"" videos that trickled out over the summer prompted congressional conservatives to insist that the federal government no longer provide Title X funding to the family-planning organization. The long truce between pro-choice and pro-life factions, wherein federal grant money that goes to groups like Planned Parenthood is sequestered from money the organization uses to provide abortion services, would appear to be threatened. Of course, it's not really in danger. We've seen funding games of this nature repeatedly since House Republicans returned to power in 2011. They've all played out in more or less the same fashion. Conservatives insist on an ideological demand--repealing Obamacare, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, defunding Planned Parenthood--that neither Senate Democrats nor the White House consider negotiable. The stalemate goes to the brink, or sometimes several weeks past the brink. Once it's clear that conservative holdouts are inflicting damage on the Republican brand with no apparent exit strategy, House Speaker John Boehner smokes approximately 47 packs of cigarettes in a single sitting, takes a long sigh, and agrees to move a ""clean"" funding bill across the finish line with Democratic votes. Democrats celebrate, movement conservatives question the spinal strength of GOP leaders, the sun sets in the west, and the Republic carries on. This time there's a new variable in the mix: A presidential contest is underway, and a handful of senators happen to be participants. That makes Sen. Mitch McConnell's Senate less of a legislative body than a proving ground for the candidates' talking points and fundraising appeals. Sen. Ted Cruz was too busy Tuesday rallying outside a Kentucky detention center to spend a full day at the office in Washington. But when he makes it back, he'll lead the charge against Planned Parenthood. ""I intend to lead the fight in the United States Senate to defund Planned Parenthood, even while investigations continue,"" Cruz wrote in an opinion piece late last month. ""The time for show votes is over. Funding the federal government does not require funding Planned Parenthood."" Some, like the whole institution that is the Democratic Party, disagree; others, like Republican leaders, might agree but certainly don't think it's worth the risk--as in, an inevitable conclusion--of a government shutdown. McConnell has pledged multiple times that there will be no shutdowns under his watch, and one should expect him and Boehner to follow through on that promise. The House conservatives who insist on defunding Planned Parenthood find in Cruz their muse, their inspiration, and their conspiratorial dining companion. The aptly nicknamed ""Speaker Cruz"" has been egging them on to continue these high-profile losing fights since the day he stepped into freshman orientation. And when Republican leaders ""cave,"" Cruz hits the fundraising and speaking circuits to denounce the cowardice of the Washington establishment. This time, however, Cruz won't just be channeling that rage to his fundraising emails. He'll be bringing it to a presidential contest. In doing so he'll be fanning, and prolonging, the raging sentiment that's dominated the early sorting stages of the 2016 presidential election. Cruz is an intelligent person. He's known all summer that this Planned Parenthood fight he's chosen to wage will end with the federal government continuing to fund Planned Parenthood. And being at the losing end of yet another battle serves as a win for Cruz in the context of his standing in the Republican nomination field. He can, and will, take to the trail to castigate McConnell and the establishment for locking arms with cackling Democrats to promulgate Evil, to allow the senseless murder and mutilation of human beings to continue, and so forth. It will work well, to the extent that any Republican candidates who disagree--or even sound like they disagree--risk the ruination of their campaigns. (Except for Donald Trump, who at any given juncture can select option A, B, or C and skyrocket in the polls regardless.) Cruz will have the opportunity to force this question on the field next week at the second Republican presidential debate. Let's make a wild guess here: Cruz will mention his crusade against Planned Parenthood. If the moderators are worth their salt, they'll address the field: Raise your hand if you think it's worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood. Any candidate (except Trump) who fails to raise his or her hand in this situation will be in extraordinary trouble in the nomination fight; any candidate who does raise his or her hand will have made themselves vulnerable to a potent general election attack ad. The hope within the Republican establishment, now that Labor Day's in the rearview, is that the feverish sentiment that's propped up the likes of Trump and kept Jeb Bush down will run its course. Likely voters and caucus-goers will start looking for a president instead of a humorous manifestation of blind rage. If this government funding fight plays out the way it typically does, though--and over an organization as despised on the right as Planned Parenthood--then the fire won't die down anytime soon.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/republican_presidential_candidates_and_kim_davis_the_gop_field_isn_t_sure.html	"Kim Davis, the Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk incarcerated for contempt of court, has brought post-Obergefell social conservative frustrations to a head. She and the right-wing legal organizations prodding her have engineered this masterfully. Regardless of how one feels about same-sex marriage or Davis personally, it's uncomfortable to see a human locked up for a political protest, even one this unsustainably stubborn. Davis successfully navigated her path to martyrdom. At each juncture she has bypassed off-ramps to reasonable resolution and pressed forth to her ultimate destination: a prison cell. Ignoring one court ruling after another, Davis even rejected federal Judge David Bunning's offer to keep her out of jail by allowing her subordinates to issue same-sex marriage licenses. Her deputies would implement the rise of Sodom by themselves, while she would fiddle around in the back office doing whatever other vital paperwork awaits the clerk of Rowan County. But she refused that compromise, and now the licenses are being issued anyway, without her permission. She refused to resign, and she's cooling her heels in the slammer. But even prisoners can have visitors. Mike Huckabee, a losing presidential candidate, wasted precious few moments Thursday before slotting a penitentiary visit into his schedule. The former Arkansas governor will visit Davis next Tuesday to express displeasure at what he terms ""the criminalization of Christianity in our country."" Huckabee applied more loosey-goosey legal analysis, too: ""What a world, where Hillary Clinton isn't in jail but Kim Davis is."" Other candidates haven't gone so far as to commit to a visit but have been perfectly willing to ""stand with"" Davis in the more metaphorical sense. Sen. Ted Cruz declared, ""Today, judicial lawlessness crossed into judicial tyranny."" (Hadn't judicial lawlessness crossed that Rubicon earlier this summer? Never mind.) ""Those who are persecuting Kim Davis believe that Christians should not serve in public office,"" Cruz's statement went on. ""I call upon every Believer, every Constitutionalist, every lover of liberty to stand with Kim Davis."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who's losing badly enough to merit a Huckabeean jaunt to Kentucky but probably can't afford the airfare, stated, ""I think you should be able to keep your job and follow your conscience. ... I absolutely do believe people have a First Amendment right, a constitutional right. I don't think the court can take that away."" Rick Santorum has called Davis ""heroic."" Sen. Rand Paul has described being in contempt of court ""the American way,"" and so on. None of these candidates can express concretely what it means to ""stand with"" Davis. Santorum mentioned something about passing a federal shield law to protect workers from having to violate their religious beliefs. That's not applicable in this situation. Davis is an elected public official whose approval is needed to issue marriage licenses, and she's not doing that, so her religious beliefs are quite obviously doing injury to others since she's forbidding her deputies from processing the licenses, too. There is no simple policy tweak available to make what Davis is doing legal. Most of the viable Republican candidates recognize that there's no real way to defend Davis without backing themselves into an illogical corner. Donald Trump, who's been pretending not to be a New York City social liberal, must think this woman is a loon who needs to get on with it. ""The decision came down from the Supreme Court,"" he said, advising her to let her deputies do the dirty licensing. Jeb Bush effectively said the same, emphasizing the importance of her oath, as did Sen. Marco Rubio. Gov. Scott Walker, who can't give a clear explanation of anything beyond what he eats for lunch, spit out something about how ""as president, he would enforce the law""--intended, strangely enough, as a defense of Davis. However delicately worded, these acknowledgements that Davis' office has no real defense for what she's doing still don't sound right to many socially conservative ears--and leave the candidates vulnerable to opportunistic attacks. Jindal, for example, went after Trump on Twitter for not declaring strongly enough that Davis is perfect and everything she's doing is perfect. ""Hey @realDonaldTrump you can't make America great again by throwing the Christians in jail,"" he tweeted, adding that ""even really rich New Yorkers should oppose jailing Christians for their religious beliefs."" There's an ample amount of polling evidence out there to confirm that no one cares what Jindal says about anything. He won't be on the main stage at the Sept. 16 debate in California. But Huckabee will. Cruz will. And Paul, who's railed on about the violation of Davis' liberty, will. What if Davis is still in jail by then--or at least the story is still fresh enough in the news for it to be a topic? You will see these candidates throwing it in the faces of Trump, Bush, Rubio, and Walker. And their ""on the one hand"" responses won't play well during a television melee as grand as a Grand Old Party Presidential Debate. Davis' well-plotted martyrdom has thrust into the Republican presidential race its first difficult, post-Obergefell test of how to negotiate the new law of the land with protection of religious liberties. Questions about the rights of wedding vendors to refuse servicing same-sex ceremonies were softballs in the context of a Republican presidential primary: These are private businesses that can do whatever they want. Here we have a government official, though, with no legal justification for what she's doing, but all the right feelings that the candidates hope to tap into. Who wants to be the one to tell her to get over it?"	Republican Candidates Aren't Sure What They Are Supposed to Say About Kim Davis
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/the_gop_s_loyalty_pledge_was_a_huge_mistake_reince_priebus_just_made_the.html	"Another day brings another poll with Donald Trump in the lead. According to a new Monmouth University poll of Republicans nationwide released Thursday, the real estate mogul leads the pack with 30 percent of the vote. His next closest competitor, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, takes 18 percent. By contrast, the most mainstream and viable candidates--Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Govs. Scott Walker, John Kasich, and Chris Christie--take 8 percent, 5 percent, 3 percent, 2 percent, and 2 percent respectively, for a combined total of 20 percent support among the five of them. In other words, the age of Trump is here, it shows no sign of retreat, and Republican leaders are nervous. If Trump becomes the nominee--still unlikely, for the same reasons it's difficult for Sen. Bernie Sanders to pull a win in the Democratic primary--he'd be an easy target for Democrats, who could blast him for everything from inexperience and temperament, to his nativist rhetoric and unsubtle racism. But a Trump nomination is so unlikely that it's not the actual nightmare for the Republican Party. The nightmare is a third-party run, where Trump gets himself on the ballot in all 50 states, and siphons white voters from a GOP that needs white turnout to win national elections. That nightmare is why, on Wednesday, the Republican National Committee privately circulated a ""loyalty pledge"" to the party's presidential candidates. ""I [name] affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,"" reads the pledge. ""I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party."" The obvious hope was that Trump would agree, rule out an independent run, and let Republican leaders breathe easy (or at least, more easily). On Thursday, Trump obliged. He signed the pledge and held a press conference, where he made a verbal commitment to the Republican Party. ""I see no circumstances under which I'd tear up that pledge,"" he said, adding later that he's been ""treated well"" by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and the RNC. He'll commit to conservative principles, and if he loses, he loses. On the surface, this is an important victory for Republican leaders. But look carefully, and it's somewhere between a disaster and a catastrophe. Trump hasn't just bound himself to the RNC, the RNC has bound itself to Trump and put pressure on other candidates to do the same. Let's say Rubio wins the primary and becomes the Republican nominee. Thanks to the pledge, he's linked to Trump, and Democrats can run wild with guilt-by-association. By the end of the campaign, Trump might be the face of the Rubio campaign, as much as the Florida senator himself. That's the disaster. The catastrophe is that there's nothing to hold Trump to the pledge. As soon as it becomes inconvenient, he can break it. And because he's untethered from the institutions of the Republican Party, Trump has nothing to lose from breaking the pledge. Indeed, anything he gains from signing--the imprimatur of the GOP and commitments from other candidates--is almost irrelevant to his appeal as the ""outsider"" who understands the world of the ""insiders."" The only thing that ties Trump to his word, on this score, is the promise of official ""respect."" For a man of Trump's ego, that's weak binding. Consider Ross Perot, whose 1992 run was a challenge to George H.W. Bush, although it didn't cost him the election. Initially, Perot denied a plan to run. But, on a February episode of Larry King Live, he hedged his refusal. ""If voters in all 50 states put me on the ballot--not 48 or 49 states, but all 50--I will agree to run,"" he said. Voters came out, and he ran. But by the summer, his campaign was pockmarked by controversy and on the decline. Appearing with Larry King again, he announced his political departure. ""I have not gone away,"" Perot told King. ""But I have concluded that I should not be the candidate."" This lasted for a few short months, at which point, Perot jumped into the race for good. ""The volunteers in all 50 states have asked me to run as a candidate for President of the United States,"" Perot said in an October speech. ""Jim Stockdale, our vice-presidential candidate, and I are honored to accept their request."" No, Perot didn't sign a pledge or run in either primary. But that doesn't make him a different case; the point is that Perot made a promise, and broke it. And why wouldn't he? He had nothing to lose. On the same score, it's not hard to imagine a world where Trump loses the primary, but ""the voters"" still want him to run. What stops Trump from citing imagined ""disrespect"" and starting a third-party campaign? Nothing. The Republican Party can't stop him, and it can't sanction him. The party thinks it has power over him, but it doesn't. If anything, the loyalty pledge enhances his platform. He can run his campaign--touting Social Security and condemning illegal immigration--and when he loses the nomination, he'll have the audience and support he needs to make an independent run. Whether Priebus knows it or not, he's been played, and it's going to hurt."	Why the GOP's Loyalty Pledge Was a Huge Mistake
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/bernie_sanders_presidential_campaign_what_would_it_take_for_the_vermont.html	"More and more, to his fans and supporters, it looks like Bernie Sanders can win. It's not just crowd size, although that shows the depth of enthusiasm for the Vermont senator's campaign. It's that in the two most critical states--Iowa and New Hampshire--he's either on the rise, or winning outright. The Des Moines Register and its well-regarded pollster puts Sanders at 30 percent of the vote among Iowa Democrats. Clinton is at 37 percent. Other polls show a less even race--with Clinton well ahead--but the trend is clear: Sanders is improving and Clinton is fading. To that point, he has his best support among first-time caucus-goers, independents, and voters under 45--the same groups that brought Barack Obama to a surprise win in 2008. The same is true in New Hampshire, where Sanders is ahead, full stop. He leads by an average of 43.6 percent to Clinton's 39.8 percent, a major shift from the beginning of the summer, when Clinton held a large lead over her chief competitor. Some of this is homefield advantage, but we shouldn't underestimate the degree to which Clinton is weaker than she was, and Sanders is more popular than we (and possibly even he) imagined. It helps too that Sanders holds his own in head-to-head polls with Republicans. In a hypothetical match-up from the latest Quinnipiac survey, Sanders beats Jeb Bush, 43 percent to 39 percent; Donald Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent; and comes just behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, 40 percent to 41 percent. The self-described ""socialist""--a cranky, left-wing fixture in American politics--is a viable presidential candidate. But a viable candidate isn't the same as a possible nominee. And while the raw material is there, it would take skill, discipline, and incredible good fortune for Sanders to bridge the gap from phenomenon to the Democratic Party's choice for the White House. First, he would have to get used to scrutiny. Blacks Lives Matter aside, Sanders hasn't been criticized like a serious presidential candidate. Clinton has stayed away--perhaps worried of alienating his supporters--and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has focused his fire on the GOP and the Democratic National Committee. If Sanders is a real contender, however, that will change. Clinton and her team--to say nothing of the press, and of Republicans--will dive into his past, and exploit any weakness he has. Sanders might survive the process, but you shouldn't count on it. Obama survived the furor over Jeremiah Wright, but it was close; if not for his rhetorical gifts, the then-candidate might have crashed his campaign on the rocks of controversy. If Sanders can get past the scrutiny, he'll have to grow his appeal. Most Democrats aren't liberals and many Democrats aren't white, but so far, Sanders is the candidate of white liberals and just a handful of blacks and Latinos. Without a large share from either group, Sanders can't compete in vital states like South Carolina and Nevada, where they dominate voting. But going beyond his base is more difficult than it looks. For as much as black Americans might like his policy positions--which fit their enthusiasm for a stronger safety net--they're also strategic voters, not ideological stalwarts. Electability is key, and as a consequence, they tend to back the establishment choice: Al Gore over Bill Bradley; John Kerry over John Edwards. On occasion, blacks will back a factional candidate, like Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988. But Jackson had the reverse problem--he couldn't win enough whites. In other words, to win as a challenger in the Democratic Party, you have to bridge the gap between two different parts of the party. And this is hard. So hard, in fact, that it's only been done twice in the modern era: Jimmy Carter in 1976, and Obama in 2008, who won over black voters with his surprise win in the Iowa caucuses. If Sanders wants to repeat the feat, he'll have to do two things simultaneously: Beef up his operation in Iowa and New Hampshire, and invest in South Carolina with time and resources. He needs to cultivate visible allies in the black political community and build a dedicated presence with black civic institutions. He may not win the black vote, but with effort, he can deny Clinton the advantage of unified black support. This is vital, but it's still not enough. Even if he wins the early contests and builds momentum for the next round, he'll have to survive Super Tuesday, which rewards organization, strategy, and institutional support more than popularity or enthusiasm. Obama had all of this--plus an inept effort from the Clinton campaign--and finished with a tie. If Sanders can raise the money and hire the staff to build a credible national campaign for Super Tuesday, then he'll still face a seasoned Clinton with a fresh memory of her past mistakes. He'll have to match Obama's flawless performance against an opponent who knows the moves, and is ready to meet them. And in that, she'll be backed by the bulk of the Democratic Party. Not only does Clinton have the most major endorsements of anyone in the race, by far, but Sanders can't catch up; even with every remaining governor, senator, and representative, Sanders would still be behind in the all-important endorsement primary. There's no doubt that Sanders is a viable presidential candidate, but his barriers to winning are almost insurmountable. And not all of that is Clinton. If Clinton were to leave the race--imagine an indictment for purposefully sharing classified information over unsecured email--Sanders wouldn't benefit. He's just too out of the mainstream, and the Democratic Party--seeking a consensus candidate--would just find someone else from the center of the coalition, whether that's Martin O'Malley or Vice President Joe Biden or a figure who isn't even on the radar. To repeat a point, the presidential primary isn't a popularity contest, and winning takes more than money or enthusiasm or party support or a smart campaign. It takes all of it, plus all the luck you'll ever have in your life. Bernie Sanders is a good candidate. But good isn't great enough to win. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	What Would It Take for Bernie to Win?

One reason why we don't make progress on these issues is that we get locked into roles. Some of us feel mistreated or ignored. Others feel silenced or unjustly accused. Sometimes it's hard to see anything from the other person's point of view. One way to break out of this stalemate is to switch the colors. Every now and then, a situation comes up in which the usual suspects are the victims, or vice versa. That's what's now happening to President Obama. The nation's first black president stands accused of animus against Jews. The accusation stems largely from Obama's nuclear deal with Iran and his perpetual friction with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As a member of the ostensibly targeted class, I find the charge ludicrous. It's one of the few things that has wounded Obama personally, and it's painful to watch him agonize over it. But it's also instructive. How does a black president defend his disagreements with the Jewish state--not just on West Bank settlements and discrimination against Israeli Arabs, but also on the genocidal threat posed by Iran--while assuring Jews that he has nothing against them? How do you take on people who claim to speak for a racial, ethnic, or religious group without coming across as a bigot? In many ways, anti-Semitism differs from racism and sexism. Still, it's awkward to watch Obama suck up to Jews the way defensive white politicians fawn over blacks or Latinos. His White House has posted twice as many items about Jewish concerns as George W. Bush's did. Obama talks endlessly about his ""sympathy and identification with the Jewish experience,"" his ""passions for Israel's survival,"" his ""closeness to the Jewish American community,"" and ""the deep affinities that I feel for the Israeli people and for the Jewish people."" Some of his best aides are Jewish: ""I've got a chief of staff named Rahm Israel Emanuel,"" he once said. ""My top political adviser is somebody who is a descendent of Holocaust survivors."" He says he has ""hosted seven White House Seders."" He jokes about his daughters hiding the afikomen and attending bat mitzvahs. But now comes the hard part: standing up to Israel. How does Obama handle it? Here are some principles that have guided him. 1. Don't whitewash prejudice. Last Friday, in a webcast with Jewish organizations, Obama said Israelis have good reason to fear Iran: ""When you have a regime that denies the Holocaust, that's going to make you worried. You got to take that seriously."" Three months ago, in an interview with the Atlantic, he told Jeffrey Goldberg that ""the environment worldwide is scary for a lot of Jewish families"":"	10 Principles That Have Guided Obama's Most Difficult Conversations With Jews

It is neither Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who lorded over the Iowa caucus polls for most of the year, nor Sen. Ted Cruz, the steady conservative heartthrob. Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, the previous two winners of the caucuses, are nowhere. Instead it's ""Commentator and Doctor Ben Carson,"" as Monmouth University describes him in its latest polling questionnaire, who's enjoying a modest surge in the heartland. Carson, the soft-spoken retired neurosurgeon who has spent the past couple of years enjoying the lucrative lifestyle of a conservative circuit speaker, is now tied with Trump at 23 percent. And in a Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll released this past weekend, Carson placed second with 18 percent to Trump's 23 percent. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who broke out at the ""kids' table"" debate in early August, has also vaulted past Walker in the Monmouth poll, reaching third place at 10 percent. Iowa Republicans have spent the summer watching 17 presidential candidates sport blue jeans and eat fried sugar-lard in order to secure their support. After all of it, the overriding feeling right now appears to be: If you've held political office before, then these are lean times. ""Regardless of who you support,"" the new Monmouth survey asks, ""what do you think the country needs more in the next president: someone with government experience who knows how to get things done OR someone outside of government who can bring a new approach to Washington?"" Twenty-three percent of Iowans preferred the former, 66 percent the latter--and Trump, Carson, and Fiorina, naturally, are soaking up those votes. No past or present officeholders--whether they are perceived as establishment or anti-establishment candidates--are catching fire in Iowa. We can all agree that Cruz or Huckabee play up their anti-establishment credentials, but they're not faring much better in Iowa than the likes of Jeb Bush or Sen. Marco Rubio. That isn't the rift that matters right now. It's between politicians and nonpoliticians. For this, as with most things, we can thank Trump. His well-publicized rhetoric against ""all talk, no action"" politicians who are ""stupid"" and so on opened a great wide lane down which he, Carson, and Fiorina have been speeding. Anger-prone voters who once directed their rage at the GOP establishment still do that, but the Summer of Trump has now conditioned them to widen that circle to include all politicians. This is what makes a strategic rethink like the one Walker is attempting so irrelevant. Walker's precipitous collapse in Iowa, where he had been leading just long enough to solidify expectations that he needed to win it, set off some bells on his team. It was time to retire ""Fortress Walker,"" the overprotected, monotonous black hole of charisma who'd been coasting off the inertia of a single, rousing speech in January. Trump had applied the necessary friction to slow Walker's Iowa coronation, and Walker's response would be to adopt a more ""Trump-like"" tone ""in which he would take on the Republican establishment."" But Trumpism, when harnessed by non-Trump actors, can badly misfire. It is a dark magic that takes control over its practitioner and leads him to a place where he's describing the construction of a 5,000-plus-mile-long wall with Canada as a ""legitimate"" idea. And so on. Adopting a tone more ""fiery,"" ""anti-establishment,"" ""confrontational,"" or whatever other inexact term we use to describe a politician who's made the decision to irrationally please base voters misdiagnoses the moment. Walker has been running for office since he was 22 years old and serving since he was 25. He is a career politician whether he likes it or not. It's not a good look right now. You can understand the temptation for Walker, Bush, or any other viable candidate to start smashing lamps or burning Chinese flags. But the best bet is still just to hold steady, not overreact, and wait for the nonpoliticians to crash. Heightened scrutiny and the compression of time typically serve as a career politician's best friend. Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes and Herman Cain had their moments, maybe even won a state, but in the end a majority of voters would not entrust them with the nuclear codes, the American military, and oversight of the vast federal bureaucracy. Let the nonpoliticians have the summer to themselves. Let them have Iowa, even! But definitely don't try to become them. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

Mitt Romney was the most plausible nominee in a wide field of contenders, but he couldn't catch fire with the GOP base. Instead, he watched a parade of outsiders and conservative alternatives take their turns in the sun, from Rick Perry and Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. But behind this chaos was a certain order. For as much as Romney struggled against conservative enthusiasm for vanity candidates, he also held a steady place in the polls, with strong fundraising and a solid, professional organization. Romney wasn't the first choice for the majority of Republican primary voters, but he was the first alternate for when everyone's various infatuations died down. ""Romney was viewed positively by likely Republican primary voters regardless of whether they were conservatives or moderates, pro-life or pro-choice, relatively wealthy or not, Tea Party members or not,"" write political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck in The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election. What's more, Romney had high ratings among voters who backed candidates like Cain and Gingrich: ""About 74 percent of conservative Republican primary voters had a favorable view of him,"" they write. When it was time to choose, Romney was the strongest contender, and Republicans were ready to pick him. This year, with Donald Trump leading the fray, there's something of a consolidated conservative movement--the real estate magnate draws from the same voters who gave Cain and Gingrich their time in the light. And in that space, he's joined by Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon-turned public speaker-turned presidential candidate, who hits second place in most national polls of the GOP primary field. But votes are just one part of this game; you need party support too, and that's just not in the cards for either Trump or Carson. Both will eventually fade from view--or at least the Republican nominating process--as voters start the more serious search for a nominee. The problem, this time, is that there isn't a Romney--an obvious choice for consolidation who is on the steady march to inevitability. Instead, there's a collection of ""plausible"" candidates who all seem too flawed to succeed. Take John Kasich. The Ohio governor has a great resume: a former congressman and chairman of the House Budget Committee who had a lucrative stint in investment banking before winning a tight race in a swing state. And he's poised to excel in a general election; an advocate for the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, he's a genuine ""compassionate conservative"" with a strong message on mental health and drug treatment services. But that's also his problem. The Republican Party is still committed to the destruction of Obamacare, and Kasich doesn't just support one of its largest components--he also shames Republicans who don't. ""Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he's probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small,"" Kasich said at the presidential debate. ""But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer."" Which is to say that if a ""plausible"" nominee needs to be acceptable to conservatives, Kasich is at a serious disadvantage. They might tolerate the Medicaid expansion, but they won't stand for that kind of attack. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie--a relative moderate--is in the same boat, with the added anchor of scandal. He's trying, though; on Saturday, in an awkward pitch to conservative voters, he promised to ""track"" unauthorized immigrants like FedEx packages, if elected president. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has the conservative bona fides and the resume. But his credentials can't compensate for his poor performance. Walker is too slow to respond to criticism, and too flat-footed against Trump, who has boxed him out of his political space. Which brings us to Jeb Bush, who looks Romney-esque with his deep pockets and strong ties to the Republican establishment. With backing from prominent parts of the GOP, he has the key advantage in a presidential primary--party support. That, and money, can keep him buoyed if he stumbles in the early primaries, and eventually bring him to victory. But that assumes a strong campaign, which, in part, assumes a strong candidate. That's not the Jeb we have. Like Walker, Bush has stumbled over Trump and his attacks, with ineffectual pushback that leads to more mistakes. Last week, addressing immigration, Bush blamed ""anchor babies"" on Asian immigrants, spreading offense to new demographics. And over the weekend, reports Politico, Bush lost three top fundraisers, amid reports of ""internal personality conflicts and questions about the strength of his candidacy."" Winning campaigns don't tend to have this problem; Romney didn't. The only ""plausible"" candidate left--someone to bridge the gaps among all party factions--is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. What he lacks in Bush's money or Walker's electoral success he has in raw talent: Rubio is the most gifted communicator of the field, with enough savvy to avoid Trump's traps. He doesn't engage Trump on immigration or try to swat him away. Instead, he talks policy, tries to distinguish himself with substance, and marches toward his goal. Rubio, in other words, has the simple combination of discipline and message--movement conservatism, shorn of its roughest edges--that leads to victory. He, put differently, is the closet candidate in the field to the last election's Romney. If I were a Republican donor or activist trying to make a decision, I'd give the young senator another look."	Why Donald Trump Isn't the GOP's Biggest Problem
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/hillary_clinton_is_still_a_huge_favorite_to_win_the_democratic_primary.html	"When it comes to Hillary Clinton and her place in the presidential primary, the political media needs to start being able to hold two ideas in mind at once. The first, and most familiar to anyone who has followed this campaign, is that Clinton is vulnerable. Her email--and use of a private server--has grown from a scandal to a fiasco. The FBI has stepped in with an investigation to see if Clinton's system was compromised by foreign hackers, and to see if she knowingly passed classified information--including ""top secret"" intelligence--through her server. Clinton is also due to face a House select committee for a public hearing on the 2012 attack on an American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Maybe she'll perform well and avoid missteps. But she might stumble, exposing herself and her campaign to more attacks and scrutiny. There have also been challenges on key policy questions. To the most vocal progressive activists, Clinton still needs to account for her role in the Bill Clinton White House on issues like mass incarceration, police militarization, and the drug war. As first lady, for example, she pushed the ""three strikes"" provision of the 1994 crime bill and supported greater prison time for offenders. ""There is something wrong when a crime bill takes six years to work its way through Congress and the average criminal serves only four,"" she said at the time. The same is true for her positions in the Senate, where she voted in favor of federal police funding that flowed to SWAT teams and other vectors for militarization. There's also her economic record: As a senator from New York, she backed a 2001 bill that would become the much loathed (among liberals) 2005 bankruptcy law. And she still hasn't acknowledged or apologized for the racially tinged rhetoric used by her campaign in the most heated moments of her 2008 race against Barack Obama. But, again, this isn't the whole story. There's still that other idea about Clinton to keep in mind, even as we consider her problems and weaknesses: Clinton is winning the Democratic presidential primary, and it's not even close. Despite the reporting around it--which has treated her as a losing candidate--the latest Quinnipiac poll shows Clinton with a wide lead over her opponents. She wins 45 percent of the Democratic Party, to 22 percent for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and 18 percent for Vice President Joe Biden. Aggregate polls show a similar picture; in the Huffington Post Pollster average, Clinton holds 48.9 percent of the primary vote, compared with 22.5 percent for Sanders and 12.5 percent for Biden. There's no contest. There's an easy and obvious rejoinder: What about 2008? Wasn't Clinton winning at this point in that primary; wasn't she ""inevitable""? And look what happened: She lost to a popular upstart with the public behind him. This sounds persuasive, but it doesn't fit the facts. As writer Harry Enten notes for FiveThirtyEight, Clinton was much weaker in the previous primary than she is now. ""Back in 2008,"" he writes, ""she was trailing in early Iowa polls. She earned only a third of the vote in early New Hampshire polls and was below 40 percent nationally."" Now, by contrast, she's well ahead in national polls, well ahead in Iowa, and only somewhat behind in New Hampshire. Moreover, because primaries aren't popularity contests, the most important measure of success is party support. Barack Obama wasn't an upstart; behind his run was the party machinery, or at least the part that didn't want Clinton. Today, where do Democratic fundraisers stand? What do Democratic interests groups think? How will Democratic lawmakers act? On each score, Clinton isn't just winning--she dominates. Most fundraisers are in her corner; it's why Biden will have a hard time raising money if he decides to run. Interest groups are still quiet, but Democratic lawmakers are overwhelmingly pro-Hillary. Clinton has more than 100 endorsements from sitting Democrats, including seven governors and 29 senators. Biden, who doesn't appear to have decided whether to run yet, has two. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has one. Bernie Sanders has none. This is unprecedented. Not only is Clinton ahead of her previous endorsement total, according to analysis by FiveThirtyEight, but she's racked up more endorsements of significance at this stage of the race than any nonincumbent Democratic presidential candidate, ever. At this point in 1999, for instance, Al Gore had two-thirds as many endorsement points (a measure that weights senators and governors more than House representatives) as Clinton does now; at this point in 2003, John Kerry had less than one-tenth Clinton's current support; at this point in 2007, Obama had less than one-sixth. The closest analogue to Clinton isn't anyone in the Democratic Party--it's George W. Bush, who had much greater endorsement support than Clinton at this stage of the 2000 Republican presidential primary and ultimately won easily, despite an early challenge from John McCain. Of course, life is arbitrary, and Hillary's campaign could still fall apart. It's not hard to imagine how it might happen: The FBI investigation could lead to indictments, ending Clinton's campaign with a court appearance. Or, she could refuse to answer any questions on her previous positions and open space for a challenger. Then again, neither email nor crime is an impossible albatross; other candidates have had worse. George H.W. Bush had to deal with fallout from Iran-Contra, while Al Gore had Bill Clinton's impeachment in the background. Both won their respective nominations with little difficulty. Sure, Clinton could lose. But it's hardly a live possibility. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why the Hillary Doubters Are Wrong

To make that time slightly less grueling, you could just skip the whole thing and watch Avatar twice. But if you're intent on enjoying the marathon performance of Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Donald Trump (and the rest), the best way to do that is with some company. And there are no better viewing companions than the political spinsters who will be taking apart every single moment the instant it happens in real time on Twitter. Above are live tweets from top pundits and politicos that make the perfect accompaniment to the debate (or way to keep up with the highlights while watching James Cameron movies). On the left-hand side of the screen you'll see the liberal tweets. On the right-hand side you'll get the conservative ones. Enjoy the instant spin! Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary.	Here's What Twitter's Smartest Liberals and Conservatives Are Saying About CNN's GOP Debates
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/donald_trump_and_ben_carson_argue_over_the_presidency_the_fight_between.html	"Ben Carson doesn't want to get into a close punch and shove with Donald Trump. The two bumped into each other last week, when Carson seemed to question Trump's faith. But before it could get out of hand, Carson apologized. That's probably a good strategy. Every candidate who has attacked Trump--with the exception of fellow nonpolitician Carly Fiorina--has fallen in the polls. Carson, for his part, is gaining on Trump, pulling even with him in Iowa and in national polls. In the latest CBS/New York Times poll, Trump is at 27 percent and Carson is at 23 percent, up from 6 percent in August. Carson prides himself on running a campaign that is not ""bombastic or pretentious,"" as he wrote in Newsmax last week. Trump, on the other hand, responded to Carson's comments about his faith with the counterpunch that is his trademark: He went for the jugular and questioned Carson's medical skills and faith. These two contrasting approaches are about more than just campaign strategy. They define how each man thinks about the presidency. On Saturday in Iowa, Trump offered a verdict on the quiet doctor: He is too nice for the presidency. ""I don't think Ben has the energy,"" said Trump, who then launched into an argument in favor of being argumentative. ""My tone!"" Trump said in mock surprise when repeating the criticism his overheated rhetoric has garnered from rivals Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. ""They said, 'His tone.' T-O-N-E. And I said, you know, we need that tone today. We need energy, we need strength, and we can't be low-key and nice and beautiful. ... I don't think it matters this time. I think we're looking for real super competence. We're tired with this nice stuff. We need people that are really, really smart and competent and can get things done. We need people with an aggressive tone, and we need people with tremendous energy, and I'm your candidate."" Carson makes the case that the presidency requires having a better bedside manner. In the essay in Newsmax (written before Trump labeled him soporific), the doctor defended his reserved manner. He explained that he learned from his mother's example that ""one should never mistake soft-spokenness for weakness."" He wrote that his low-key humility came from his faith. It's a topic he has written about and discussed before. As a young man, Carson had a volcanic temper that he cured by becoming more religious. One of his favorite Bible passages, he writes in his book Think Big, was from Proverbs 29:23: ""A man's pride brings him low, but a man of lowly spirit gains honor."" Presumably Christian voters can recognize in Carson's views a common faith, and they may be able to identify with the way he uses Scripture as the user's manual for his life. But Carson's point goes beyond personal behavior. He's making an argument about the presidency. I asked Carson on Face the Nation why it was important for a president to have humility. ""Because you need to be able to listen,"" he said. ""One of the things that I have discovered throughout the many things that I have been involved in is that we have some incredibly talented people in this country. ... And you have to be humble enough to be able to listen to other people and recognize that, sometimes, they might actually know more than you do and be able to integrate that. There's nobody who knows everything. But we have an incredibly talent-filled nation ... everybody seems to think that whatever they do is the greatest thing. If you're a politician, only politicians can solve the problems. If you're a businessman, only businessmen can solve the problems, a lawyer, doctor. That's ridiculous. What we need to do is put our talents together, understand what our goals are, and then utilize all of our talents to accomplish them."" Carson has also said that he is a ""firm believer that one can wield power through kindness and intellect."" Carson sounds a lot like Obama did in 2008, except that while Obama had no executive decision-making experience when he ran for office, Carson has perhaps the ultimate executive experience: to cut or not to cut (and where to put the knife). Lives were literally in his hands. His patients voted on his competency with every surgery he performed. Both Trump and Carson are nonpoliticians who have championed the power of listening. Each has argued that he will be able to make up any gap in experience by consulting experts and listening to them. Carson's argument is that his low-key approach is the only way that can happen. In his view, Trump's boasts and sense of himself will make him impervious to counsel. It's a plausible argument. History has provided us with plenty of proud characters who didn't listen. But Trump seems to have a pretty good ear for the public mood. He is running as the antidote to politicians who have stopped listening. Voters seem to be telling pollsters that he hears them. Of all the spats between Trump and his opponents--and the new ones we'll see on display Wednesday night in the second debate--the one with Carson is perhaps the most interesting because it is about the office as much as it is about the men competing for it. It's a utilitarian debate over whether humility is an impediment to action in office or a necessary requirement for a job that requires acute hearing. Or, put another way, will bravado whip government back into shape, or is it only useful in whipping up the campaign crowds? It's a version of the age-old debate between whether nice guys finish last or whether the last will be first."	Why the Spat Between Trump and Carson Actually Matters
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/scott_walker_s_new_labor_plan_the_wisconsin_governor_wants_to_destroy_what.html	"As of 2014, 11 percent of all American workers--or 14.6 million people--were in a union. By sector, that's 6.6 percent unionization for workers in private firms and 35.7 percent unionization for those in government and other public services. Just nine states have unionization rates of 15 percent or greater, down from 28 (and the District of Columbia) in 1984. In whole regions of the country, and the South in particular, unions have nearly vanished. And while as institutions they aren't powerless--unions still carry clout in the national Democratic Party and have influence in heavily unionized states like New York and New Jersey--they're also not strong; unions are weaker now than they've been in almost a century. For Scott Walker, that's not weak enough. On Monday, the Wisconsin governor released his plan to strangle unions, titled ""My Plan to Give Power to the People, Not the Union Bosses."" The official rollout, which begins with a speech in Las Vegas, is part of a reboot for Walker's flagging presidential campaign. After a month of low poll numbers in key states--he's at less than 4 percent in Iowa and New Hampshire)--Walker is running with a newly aggressive message and aiming for the kinds of voters that support Donald Trump and other ""outsiders."" ""We need a leader who can wreak havoc on Washington and put the American people back in charge of our government,"" he said in a speech last week. ""To wreak havoc on Washington, America also needs a leader who has been tested. I have been tested like no one else in this race."" Walker's labor plan is a national version of the strategy he used to break unions in Wisconsin, although it's far more forthright than the supposedly reluctant steps he took at the beginning of this year. He would end collective bargaining for federal employees, as per his move in 2011; he would require complete disclosure for union expenditures and total compensation of union officers; he would sign a national ""right to work law"" that blocks unions from making contracts that require all workers to pay dues to the union for negotating with management, whether they belong to the union or not; he would repeal wage controls for federal infrastructure projects; and he would eliminate the National Labor Relations Board, which conducts elections for labor union representation and investigates unfair labor practices. Under President Obama, the NLRB has been more aggressive for labor than the business-friendly boards of previous administrations. In August, for example, it made it easier for unions to negotiate on behalf of workers at companies that rely on contractors and franchisees. If fast-food workers at McDonald's or software testers at Microsoft want to unionize, employers have to come to the table to negotiate. For Walker, this decision is evidence that the NLRB is now ""a one-sided advocate for big labor special interests."" As such, it needs to go, with power transferred to federal courts and the National Mediation Board, which has about 50 full-time employees, compared with more than 1,600 for the NLRB. Perhaps aware of his anti-labor reputation, Walker's plan is filled with pro-worker rhetoric. Unions are ""union bosses"" or ""big-government union bosses"" while anti-union regulations are called ""pro-freedom"" and pro-""employee's rights."" But taken together, this is an incredible change to American labor law--a transformation that would greatly alter the relationship between employers and employees. One law professor told Al Jazeera that Walker's plan would ""go a long way toward reversing a large chunk of the New Deal,"" citing language around ""freedom of contract"" that was used to strike labor laws and disadvantage workers. ""Any economic plan that does not bring our federal labor laws into the 21st Century is incomplete,"" says Walker in an excerpt released by his campaign. ""To grow the economy at a higher rate requires a comprehensive approach and reform of the labor unions is a key part of the plan."" This hasn't been true in Wisconsin; income growth in the state lags behind the median, private-sector job growth of its neighbors, and the state has had a revenue shortfall, following his tax cuts. Moreover, Walker's underlying idea--that unions are deleterious to American well-being--is unfounded. Yes, there are union abuses and union corruption. On the whole, however, the opposite is true: Unions have been an important ally for middle-class workers, and the fall of labor has widened the gap between productivity and pay, and increased income inequality. According to a 2011 study published in the American Sociological Review, titled ""Unions, Norms, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality,"" sociologists Bruce Western and Jake Rosenfeld found that the decline in union power and density since the 1970s explained a third of the increase in wage inequality among men. And a study from the pro-labor Economic Policy Institute finds that wage stagnation has been worst among groups that were unionized in previous decades but have seen the greatest decline in union membership: men and non-college-educated workers. If the past is any indication, Walker's plan would accelerate the trend. Walker's plan has one clear message: He  is a conservative soldier. Walker is open in his disdain for unions and frank with his commitment to conservative economic ideology, going beyond his competitors with a sweeping attack on the political and institutional foundations of American labor unions that tilts government against them and toward the interests of employers and large corporations. And whether or not Walker wins the nomination, he's done something important: He's put his agenda on paper and into the race, for the eventual nominee to read, consider, and possibly co-opt."	Scott Walker Wants to Destroy What's Left of America's Unions
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/stephen_colbert_s_emotional_interview_with_joe_biden_the_vice_president.html	"As the father of a son, I found it hard to watch Vice President Joe Biden talk about his son with Stephen Colbert. Biden talked about whether he's emotionally ready to commit to a campaign after losing his son Beau in May. He told the story of the unexpected grief that ambushed him recently while in Denver: ""I landed at a military base and I met a whole group of military families. ... And I was talking about them being the backbone and sinew of this country. And all of a sudden--it's going great--and a guy in the back yells, 'Maj. Beau Biden, bronze star, sir, served with him in Iraq.' And all of a sudden I lost it."" I understand why. This summer we've been talking about authenticity in American politics. According to polls, Donald Trump has it. Sen. Bernie Sanders has it. Hillary Clinton's advisers tell the New York Times she is going to try to show it. Political authenticity isn't real authenticity; it's the synthetic public version that approximates the real thing. We know this because when candidates like Mitt Romney and Al Gore are authentically bad at engaging in the showmanship of politics, they are penalized for it. Politicians sometimes show us actual authenticity--anger, fear, uncertainty, weakness--and it is usually a political liability. But this other authenticity offers the power of personal example--people can actually use what they see in another person to sustain them in their own lives. Biden is operating in both fields right now, offering an ongoing emotional reaction to the loss of his son while publicly thinking about whether he'll launch a presidential race. Whether the example of grace and endurance and faith that Biden shows contributes to his viability as a candidate is up to voters to decide. But as an example of how to live a life--both before and after the moments of acute grief--it's powerful. As George W. Bush's former speechwriter Michael Gerson wrote, Biden may be the last human being in politics. His avocation as a politician has often been to tell military families who have lost loved ones in battle that it's possible to emerge from the other side of grief. Biden was a witness to this after he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident. Now Biden is back with those grieving families again. This time he isn't a prophet from the other side, but walking with them in fresh mourning. After the rallying point of a funeral, there's a period when the neighbors stop bringing the dishes of lasagna and you're left alone with the loss. You pick up the phone to make a call to a person who isn't there anymore. It's bleak. You don't even have the busywork of the to-do list of mourning to distract you. That's the stage we're all watching with Biden and his family, and he's inviting us in to watch because that's the messy way of Joe Biden. Politicians sometimes say, ""Let me show you what's in my heart."" The fact that they must preface the remark means they're not really going to. Biden is putting his heart in our laps. Biden could turn it all off and say he's not running, but when your life and your son's life have been so dedicated to public service and that service has sustained you through brutal loss, what holds you back is also what compels you. When I talk to people who know the vice president well, they describe how Beau's request that his father run for president also eggs him on. ""You know your success when you turn and look at your child and realize they turned out better than you,"" Joe Biden said, quoting his father. ""I was a hell of a success: My son was better than me in almost every way."" The feedback loop of parenting is powerful. You want to be worthy of a person you think is so great. After he's gone I can imagine you wouldn't want to let him down. Our children remind us parents of our best selves. We sustain them and lift them up and they do the same for us. Biden has an acute form of this. As he discussed with Colbert, Beau helped raise Biden after he lost his wife and daughter, and he was doing that until the end. "" 'Dad, I know how much you love me,' "" Biden recounted Beau telling him near the end of his life. "" 'You've got to promise me something. Promise me you're going to be alright.' He said, 'No matter what happens dad, I'm going to be all right. Promise me.' "" At times the interview felt like it was just Colbert and Biden, and this was one of those moments. Colbert talked about playing that role for his mother after his father and two of his brothers died in a plane crash. And yet, of course, Beau was also sustained by his father. Beau Biden's friends talk about him and his brother Hunter as products of what happens when you put a child in proximity of the values that people admire in Joe Biden. Colbert didn't start his interview by asking the vice president if he was going to run. He didn't get there for a while. He asked about faith, example, parenting, loss, and making something beautiful out of suffering. (This tells us something about the deep currents of Stephen Colbert, too.) All of that will exist whether Biden runs for president or not, and it exists for all the parents who still have a chance to create something as powerful as Biden had with his son Beau and that he still has with his family. That doesn't have anything to do with politics. Perhaps that's why it feels so real."	Why We Connect to Joe Biden
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/ben_carson_and_donald_trump_heat_up_their_gop_primary_rivalry.html	"This week saw the start of the fight that political death-match junkies have been awaiting much of the summer: Donald Trump and Ben Carson, Nos. 1 and 2 in most Republican primary polls, duking it out in the political-entertainment octagon for the title of Top Outsider Candidate. In typical GOP presidential election cycles, such a designation is worth little beyond a convention speaking slot. Whoever manages to capture the outsider vote--Pat Robertson, Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan--may go on to win a state or two, but otherwise serves as a kitschy roadside tourist trap en route to the establishment candidate's coronation. Maybe it will still play out that way, but the summer of Trump has lasted long enough for the political press to stop presuming that the old rules will eventually assert themselves. Consider what Trump and Carson have amassed under their respective outsider banners by mid-September. Thursday's CNN/ORC national poll finds Trump and Carson at 32 and 19 percent, respectively, giving the two novice politicians a majority between them. Trump and Carson also top the field in terms of voters' second choices. Maybe all that support will transfer elsewhere as voting time nears, per the laws of presidential primary physics. Or maybe we now officially live in a country that's rejected physics, once and for all, as a sacrilegious tool of the elites. Trump and Carson charted their paths to the top in starkly different ways. Trump goes on television several times per day and says that he is the greatest, most successful human being in history, better than Jesus Christ--a third-rate builder who'd be clueless trying to play the Manhattan permit game. He feasts off celebrity, trash talk, and the round-the-clock media attention that comes with both. He lures one rival after another into a competition of alpha male bona fides, a competition he will always win. It is all swagger, a trait that lends itself well to his platform of jingoistic nativism. Carson, on the other end of the spectrum, does not insult other candidates. He does not raise his voice. He does not appear on television too often, and when he does, he looks ready for a nap. But as someone who's had a side career in inspirational speaking for decades, he knows how to connect with Republican audiences with a combination of humor and biblical messaging you might find in a church sermon. The thread that connects these two unlikely outsiders sitting atop the Republican field is a feeling of total self-confidence, expressed through polar opposite styles. Naturally, Trump's been looking to pound this guy--to emasculate him the same way he's done to Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham, Rick Perry, Rand Paul, and whoever else has leapt onto his radar. (We'll see if he even bothers with the ever-so-desperate Bobby Jindal.) Trump has claimed, humorously, that he never punches--he simply counter-punches. In an interview last Friday, he couldn't contain his desire to counter-punch Carson. After conceding that Carson is a ""nice guy,"" Trump added, ""I'm hoping for Ben to really hit me at some point because I love to counter-punch."" At an event in Anaheim, California, on Wednesday night, Carson gave Trump all he needed. As the Washington Post reported, Carson was asked to name a difference between him and Trump. ""The biggest thing is that I realize where my success has come from,"" he said, ""and I don't any way deny my faith in God."" Finally, an opportunity for Trump to let loose all of the ace Ben Carson material he's been workshopping. In a CNN appearance Thursday morning, Trump described Carson, a world-renowned neurosurgeon, as ""perhaps an OK doctor"" who, ""if you look at his past, which I've done ... was not a big man of faith."" By contrast, Trump described himself as ""a believer, big league, in God."" He continued: ""All of a sudden [Carson]'s becoming this man of faith and he was heavy into the world of abortion,"" an accusation that's not entirely fabricated. Lastly, Trump said that Carson makes the infamously ""low-energy"" Bush ""look like the Energizer Bunny."" This is usually the part where the subject of Trump's taunts responds with a tepid So's yer old man jab before wishing he had never gotten involved at all. (Ask Graham, if you can track down his new cellphone number.) When reached by a Washington Post reporter Thursday morning, though, Carson did something truly spectacular: He apologized to Trump for any misunderstanding. ""I would like to say to him that the intention was not to talk to him but about what motivates me,"" he told the Post. ""If he took that as a personal attack on him, I apologize, it was certainly not the intent."" Carson added that he does not want to get into a ""gladiator fight with Trump."" That's smart. He, like everyone else who's tried, would lose such a bout. What Carson has that the other candidates don't is an alternative to engaging Trump on Trump's terms. A candidate like Graham, or Perry, or Jindal--or even Bush at this point--needs to try anything to get a boost. The most obvious way to do that is to poke a stick at the figure through whom all media coverage runs, even if it's going to get him poked back. Carson needs no such jolt. He's been doing perfectly well for himself running a campaign that's an extension of his own popular persona: laconic, polite, and media-cautious. Jabbing the monster, then backing off a step and saying, ""Who, me?"" works for him in a way that would signal defeat for anyone else. If the back-and-forth continues like this, Trump is not going to know what to do next. He runs a serious risk of driving away outsider-curious voters if he continues insulting Carson, the most favorably viewed candidate in the race. It would also be in Trump's interest to be nice to the man who sits beneath him in the polls and hope for him to collapse on his own, much as the other 15 candidates are hoping happens to both Trump and Carson. It's not in Trump's nature to be nice. Perhaps he could take some cues from Carson. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Ben Carson May Have Figured Out How to Beat Donald Trump at His Own Game

Her great challenge as a candidate--and nominee, should she win the Democratic primary--is to show continuity with the Obama administration without losing her distinctive voice. Even if she shares policies with the current president, her White House can't be a third term for Barack Obama; the public wants a new vision. That's especially true on foreign policy: Americans are consistently down on the administration's approach to issues abroad--from ISIS to chaos in Syria--and support a more active strategy for facing foreign threats. Polls bear this out. On average, since the beginning of last year, 50 percent of Americans have disagreed with Obama's handling of foreign policy, while only 38 percent have approved of it. Fifty-four percent of Americans don't think Obama is tough enough on foreign affairs and national security, and 48 percent say the United States is less important and powerful than it was a decade ago. On the Iran deal, 49 percent disapprove of the plan to monitor Iran's nuclear facilities and lift international sanctions, while only 21 percent approve. Thirty percent don't know enough to say either way. Enter Republicans. Despite the advantage in public opinion, they've had a hard time offering a sharp foreign policy critique, in part because they refuse to budge from the worst ideas and strategies of the last GOP administration. Iran is instructive. At every step of the argument over the nuclear agreement, Republicans have pushed maximum confrontation at the expense of diplomacy, rejecting the deal without offering an alternative. If elected president, for example, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would renege on the deal and reimpose sanctions, as would Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton thinks we should reject the deal in favor of a ""credible threat of military force,"" and Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk compared the Iran deal to Nazi appeasement. ""This is the greatest appeasement since Chamberlain gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler,"" he said. The most flamboyant assault on the Iran deal came Wednesday, when Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz gathered with hundreds of supporters to blast the administration. If the deal goes through, Cruz argued, Obama would ""quite literally be the world's largest financier of radical Islamic terrorism."" Yes, the public wants a more active foreign policy. But it isn't interested in reckless confrontation. People remember the last war, and aren't thrilled with the chance for another one. To that point, 59 percent of Americans still think the Iraq war was a mistake, and 55 percent oppose putting ground troops back in the country. What's more, about half of Americans are wary of too much foreign involvement. Put differently, the public wants an alternative, and it isn't the GOP. Which brings us back to Clinton. If Republicans represent the right wing of the mainstream debate on foreign policy, and if Obama represents the left, then Clinton is well-placed to stand in the center as a tough but diplomatic leader. And on Wednesday she staked that ground with a speech in support of the Iran deal. Speaking to a small audience at the Brookings Institution, Clinton--who helped pave the way for the initial negotiations--gave her vision for implementing the deal and containing Iran in the future. ""We've got to start looking ahead to what comes next: enforcing it, deterring Iran and its proxies, and strengthening our allies,"" she said. Clinton promised to continue and expand military aid to Israel; to build a ""coalition to counter Iran's proxies"" like Hamas and Hezbollah; and to ""not hesitate to take military action"" if Iran pursues a nuclear weapon in violation of the deal. ""We need to be clear-eyed about what we can expect from Iran,"" she said. ""This isn't the start of some broader diplomatic opening. And we shouldn't expect that this deal will lead to a broader change in their behavior."" This is more hawkish than most rhetoric from President Obama and reflects her long comfort with using force, from voting for the war in Iraq to pushing action in Syria, which Obama ultimately rejected. In a Democratic primary, as Clinton learned in 2008, this is a liability. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is running on left-wing economic policy, but there's space to critique Clinton on foreign policy and win votes from the anti-war left. With that said, Clinton's approach may be the right tack for a general election. Again, voters want change. But they support diplomacy and don't want another war or occupation. Clinton offers a third way: Obama-style policies merged with hawkish rhetoric. It satisfies the public but keeps Clinton to the left of the Republican Party, and clears her path for attacks on GOP candidates. Which, incidentally, is what she did. ""That's not leadership, that's recklessness,"" said Clinton of Republican rhetoric. ""It would set us right down the very dangerous path we've worked so hard to avoid. ... Great powers can't just jump agreements and expect the rest of the world to go along with us."" Hillary has a new attack line, and she owes it all to her (and Obama's) opponents in the GOP."	Hillary Clinton Is Offering a More Muscular Version of Obama's Foreign Policy
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/republican_presidential_candidates_are_blaming_crime_on_black_lives_matter.html	"Almost everyone has something to demagogue in the 2016 Republican primary. For Donald Trump, it's Latino immigration, and Mexican migrants in particular. For Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, it's the nuclear deal with Iran; for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, it's the Kim Davis affair in Kentucky, where a county official was jailed for refusing to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples; and for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, it's crime. That may seem like a strange choice, given broad trends. National rates of violent crime are down to their lowest levels in a generation, with steep drops in gun homicide among all groups. And while violence is still a problem for isolated, low-income black Americans, the overall portrait is good: Twenty years after the crime waves of the 1990s, American cities and metropolitan areas are as safe as they've ever been. Long-term trends can obscure short-term variations, however, and there's contested evidence that we're in the middle of a violent crime spike, sparked by a so-called Ferguson effect where less aggressive policing--fueled by ""Black Lives Matter"" protests--encourages criminals. ""Cities across the nation are seeing a startling rise in murders after years of declines,"" reports the New York Times in a story on the rising murder rate in Milwaukee. Critics say this is overblown. Writing for the Marshall Project, Bruce Frederick--a senior research fellow at the Vera Institute of Justice--notes that of the 20 most populous U.S. cities for which there's public data, only three experienced a ""statistically reliable increase"" in homicide rates. For the rest, ""the observed increases could have occurred by chance alone."" If there is a new trend, we need more data. The same goes for the ""Ferguson effect""; there's no evidence that less policing has produced more violent crime. But humans are built to see patterns in unrelated events, and the crime increase--plus a rash of high-profile shootings aimed at police officers--has brought new partisan attacks on Black Lives Matter, even while 2015 stands as an unusually safe year for police officers, so far. ""In the last six years under President Obama, we've seen a rise in anti-police rhetoric,"" wrote Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in an op-ed last week, citing ""demonstrations and chants where people describe police as 'pigs' and call for them to be 'fried like bacon.' "" Walker was referring to a small group of protesters in Minnesota who by all accounts are unrepresentative of the larger movement. Still, their actions came in the wake of a brutal attack on a Texas police officer, Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth, who was shot 15 times at a gas station near Houston. And as such, it was fuel for Walker's charge, as well as for claims from Fox News and other conservative outlets that Black Lives Matter is a ""hate group."" A struggling Christie--who, along with Huckabee and Cruz, lags far behind in the polls--has picked up on this, and run with it. On Tuesday, during an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the New Jersey governor slammed Democrats on crime. ""It's the liberal policies in this city that have led to the lawlessness that's been encouraged by the president of the United States,"" he said. ""And I'm telling you, people in this country are getting more and more fed up."" Likewise, on Fox News, he blasted President Obama's rhetoric--or alleged lack thereof--on police killings. ""The president says little or nothing about these issues where police officers are being hunted,"" claimed Christie. This isn't true. But that doesn't mean Christie can't find traction. With crime and killings in the news, Democrats may be vulnerable to claims of indifference or even encouragement, given their support for Blacks Live Matter. Indeed, this violence threatens the whole project for criminal justice reform. To a large degree, the move toward deincarceration and less draconian policing is a product of declining crime. Americans are less afraid of being victimized, which makes them either open to policies that might look ""soft"" in a more dangerous environment, or they are just apathetic about the issue. But even apathy works; when the public is indifferent, it's easier to pass unpopular policies or make potentially unpopular commitments. It's one reason why Hillary Clinton--a cautious politician by any measure--has felt confident enough to openly endorse Black Lives Matter; outside of a dedicated few, no one is paying attention, and no one is trying to use it against her. Christie and other Republicans are trying to change that. By blaming Obama and Black Lives Matter for an increase in crime or new attacks on police officers, they're working to conjure the fear and uncertainty of the '80s and '90s--when violent crime was at an all-time high--and capitalize on them. And it's worth noting the extent to which these appeals come at the same time that Republicans need to increase their share of the white vote to win a national majority. It's no accident, perhaps, that Trump has called for giving ""power back to the police, because crime is rampant."" ""Cops across this country are feeling the assault,"" said Cruz from the trail last week. ""They're feeling the assault from the president, from the top on down as we see. Whether it's in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response of senior officials of the president, of the attorney general, is to vilify law enforcement. That is fundamentally wrong, and it is endangering the safety and security of us all."" Cruz isn't as invested in this message as Christie is--he's busy rallying against same-sex marriage in Kentucky and the Iran deal in Washington--but he's part of the same push to make Black Lives Matter a liability for Democrats. Yes, this rhetoric is false. Neither Obama nor Eric Holder nor Loretta Lynch, the present attorney general, has ""villified"" law enforcement. But trust has limited reach in national politics. The question for projecting an outcome is whether crime is salient again. If it is, then Democrats are stuck between a protest movement they ostensibly support and a scared and anxious public. And if it isn't, then Christie and his peers will have to find something else to save their flailing campaigns from fast-approaching obscurity."	GOP Candidates Are Using Black Lives Matter to Scare Whites Into Voting for Them
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/donald_trump_and_white_nationalism_does_the_candidate_s_rise_represent_the.html	"Fear of ""white nationalism"" is very much in vogue. To Thomas Edsall, writing in the New York Times, the rise of Donald Trump is a predictable consequence of the fact that the Republican Party is ""the home of an often angry and resentful white constituency,"" which fears that discrimination against whites is a growing problem. Evan Osnos of the New Yorker, in a similar vein, seeks to explain the Trump phenomenon by viewing it through the lens of radical white nationalists, who warn that white Americans face cultural genocide as their numerical majority shrinks. Ben Domenech, publisher of the Federalist, argues that Republicans face a choice: They can build their coalition around a more inclusive libertarian vision, the path that he prefers, or they can follow Trump and redefine themselves as the defenders of white interests in a bitterly divided multiracial society. Does Donald Trump represent the ascendancy of white nationalism on the American right? I'm skeptical, for a number of reasons. While anti-immigration rhetoric is certainly a big part of Trump's appeal, it is also true that he fares particularly well among the minority of Republican voters who identify themselves as moderate or liberal. As a general rule, moderate and liberal Republicans are more favorably inclined toward amnesty and affirmative action than their conservative counterparts. Moreover, as Jason Willick of the American Interest has observed, the leading second-choice candidates are Ben Carson, the black neurosurgeon, and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both of whom are senators of Cuban descent, the latter of whom played a leading role in crafting immigration reform legislation. Granted, it could still be true that Trump is benefiting from white racial resentment. It's just not clear to me that Trump is anything more than Herman Cain with an extra billion or so dollars in the bank and over a decade's worth of experience as host of one of network television's most popular reality shows. Nevertheless, I believe that white identity politics is indeed going to become a more potent force in the years to come, for the simple reason that non-Hispanic whites are increasingly aware of the fact that they are destined to become a minority of all Americans. According to current projections, that day will come in 2044. Non-Hispanic whites will become a minority of eligible voters a few years later, in 2052. According to States of Change, a report by Ruy Teixeira, William H. Frey, and Robert Griffin, California and Texas are set to join Hawaii and New Mexico in having majority-minority electorates in the next few years, and several other states will follow in the 2030s. Why does it matter that in the near future, non-Hispanic whites will become a minority in one state after another? The most obvious reason is that non-Hispanic whites might lose their sense of security. They will be outnumbered and outvoted. If they remain wealthier than average, as seems likely, they might fear that majority-minority constituencies will vote to redistribute their wealth. Over time, they might resent seeing their cultural symbols give way to those of minority communities--which is to say the cultural symbols of other minority communities. In a 1916 essay in the Atlantic, Randolph Bourne, at the time one of America's leading left-wing intellectuals, attacked the melting-pot ideal, in which immigrants to the United States and their descendants were expected to assimilate into a common culture. He saw instead America evolving into ""a cosmopolitan federation of national colonies, of foreign cultures, from whom the sting of devastating competition has been removed."" Instead of forging a common American identity, the country he envisioned would be one where members of minority ethnic groups preserved their cultural separateness. To fully realize this ideal, however, it was vitally important that Anglo-Saxon Americans not assert themselves in the same way as the members of other ethnic groups. Why? Because if Anglo-Saxon Americans were to celebrate their identity as a people with longstanding ties to their American homeland, it would implicitly discount the American-ness of those from minority ethnic backgrounds. For Bourne, and for those who've advocated for his brand of cultural pluralism since, it is the obligation of Anglo-Saxon Americans, and other white Americans with no strong ties to a non-American homeland, to be post-ethnic cosmopolitans. But what if being a post-ethnic cosmopolitan is not actually that satisfying? In his highly inventive 2004 book The Rise and Fall of Anglo-America, the sociologist Eric Kaufmann calls this bargain ""asymmetrical multiculturalism."" Under asymmetrical multiculturalism, minority ethnic groups are encouraged to assert their group identities and to defend their group interests while the majority ethnic group is strongly discouraged from doing the same. Overt expressions of Jewish, Mexican, Laotian, or Bengali pride are very welcome. Overt expressions of WASP pride, however, are not. Kaufmann maintains that because WASPs, and to a lesser extent other whites, are denied the option of celebrating their ethnic heritage, they instead champion essentially ideological ideas, like individualism or a vague, ill-defined belief in ""American exceptionalism"" that is bereft of any real cultural content. It should go without saying that white Americans have been quite effective at advancing their interests, even without overt expressions of ethnic pride. You could cynically suggest that it is all well and good for Bengalis to have their Bengali pride as long as whites have all their power. The majority does not need to assert itself, as members of the majority can be serenely confident that their interests will always be served. The trouble is that this serenity is much harder to maintain as majority-group status slips away. So what form might white identity politics take as whites become a minority group? We don't have much experience with this dynamic at a national level, yet there are cities and other communities where whites are already conscious of themselves as a minority group. By 2020, Americans under the age of 18 will be majority-minority, and the attitudes of these young whites will tell us a great deal about the future. For now, we can imagine a number of different possibilities. In its most extreme manifestation, white identity politics could take the form of outright racial separatism. For example, Osnos interviewed radical white-nationalist thinkers who hope to establish a sovereign ethno-state exclusively for people of European origin. These thinkers are marginal for now. But radical white nationalists are betting on the possibility that as whites become a minority, ethnic conflict will intensify and more whites will wish to extricate themselves from diverse environments. (To some extent, this already happens: As white Americans age and form families, it is not at all uncommon for them to leave diverse cities for less diverse suburbs or indeed less diverse regions.) You can also imagine a far milder form of white identity politics, in which whites accept ethnic diversity yet insist that they secure a fair share of resources and respect as members of a cohesive ethnic bloc of their own. But this turn toward white identity politics is not inevitable. The boundaries separating majority groups from minority groups are fluid. We can't reliably anticipate future rates of intermarriage, or whether Americans with one or two Mexican-born grandparents will identify as Mexican Americans. It could be that just as America's Anglo-Protestant cultural majority gave way to a more inclusive ""white"" cultural majority, which over the course of the 20th century came to include southern and Eastern Europeans and others who might have once been excluded from the dominant group, our sense of who counts as white will expand to include many Americans we'd now think of as Latino, Asian, or black. This desire to blur boundaries lies at the heart of the melting-pot ideal, and it is why at least some conservatives, myself included, believe that we ought to embrace a more melting pot-friendly immigration policy. Essentially, this view holds that America's diverse groups can over time blend into a new ""American"" ethnicity. To get there, however, we'd have to moderately reduce immigration flows that both put economic pressure on immigrants who already live and work in the U.S. and that reinforce their ethnic ties to their ancestral homelands. Whether this view will prevail is very much in doubt. Anti-immigration rhetoric tends to frame high levels of immigration as a threat to natives, not as a barrier to integration, assimilation, and upward mobility for the tens of millions of immigrant families that have made their homes in the U.S. over the past several decades. There is no major politician I know of who is offering a robust case for the melting-pot ideal. And that is a shame."	Does Donald Trump Represent the Ascendancy of White Nationalism on the American Right?
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/donald_trump_is_a_test_for_all_republican_presidential_candidates_how_they.html	"Jeb Bush has decided to stoop to conquer. The onetime GOP front-runner didn't think Donald Trump was worth his time. By simply being the adult in the race, he hoped, voters would stick with him and turn away from Trump. Or, at the very least, voters would ignore Trump's trolling of Bush. But the decent opinions of mankind did not kick in. Bush's poll numbers dropped, while Trump's rose. Now Bush is confronting Trump head-on. ""Donald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency,"" Bush said Thursday. Bush is also picking up the frequency of his assaults, taking on Trump in ads, with an online quiz about his liberal past, on Instagram, and in television appearances. ""Trump is wrong for the party and the country,"" said a Bush aide. ""We are going to fight for it. Ducking and hoping he goes away is not a path to success."" This is not just a frivolous slap fight. If a Republican who is not Trump becomes president, how he or she dealt with the Teflon Don will be the first major test he or she faced. Campaigns are an imperfect measure of the attributes presidents need in office. They encourage superficiality, and the skills they reward, like fancy speechmaking, aren't as useful when it comes to time to govern. But some campaign moments offer a pretty good test of some of the skills required for the job. Presidents must adapt quickly to surprising, powerful forces that ignore the existing rules. That's the kind of challenge Trump presents. He also offers an opportunity: A nimble president uses a challenge to focus the public mind and consolidate power. There is not a right or wrong way to take on America's loudest real estate magnate. But the Trump challenge gives us an opportunity to measure and evaluate. We can assess the candidates and their penchant for action. When GOP candidates talk about President Obama, they deride him for planting himself in his pensive citadel, contemplating and not taking action. He leads from behind. They promise that when it comes to Putin or ISIS or immigration, they will act. Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Gov. Rick Perry were the first to respond when presented with the Trump test. They attacked. Graham called him a ""jackass,"" and Perry said he was ""a cancer on conservatism."" It didn't work out so well for them. As Trump never tires of pointing out, after Graham and Perry attacked him, their poll numbers dropped. Sen. Marco Rubio has taken the opposite approach. He has largely refused to entertain Trump questions. ""If I comment on everything he says, my whole campaign will be consumed by it,"" Rubio told Chuck Todd of Meet the Press. He's going to run his campaign and hope that Trump falls of his own weight. In his case, no action is the best course of action. This is itself a Trump strategy: Stick to your plan and execute your plan; don't get distracted. Rubio may not like the comparison, but his approach is very much like the approach Obama would probably take. Ben Carson has taken a similar approach, working his way to second in the polls in Iowa and nationally. Govs. Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal have not attacked Trump directly, but have suggested that governing requires more than ""simplistic"" solutions--that's the word Christie used to describe Trump's immigration plan. Jindal used a question about Trump as an opportunity to talk about his experience actually balancing budgets in Louisiana. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Scott Walker have both chosen to hug Trump. Walker has adopted Trump's tone somewhat, shifting to portray himself as a foe of the establishment in Washington. Cruz, who already has those credentials, has a strategy that amounts to an elaborate sidling--complimenting and associating himself with the billionaire at key moments. Cruz met with Trump at his office, and is joining Trump at a rally in Washington next week opposing the nuclear deal with Iran. The Bush strategy has been slow getting to its feet, unintentionally confirming Trump's critique that the former Florida governor is ""low-energy."" At first, Bush criticized Trump's tone. That was too vague. Now he's making more specific claims that Trump appeals to the worst in our nature, is hawking unworkable immigration policies, and is a phony conservative. Bush's coordinated media campaign against Trump shares some similarities with his brother's successful effort to repel Sen. John McCain in 2000. George W. Bush also thought his upstart rival would fade away. When he didn't, his counterattack revolved around questioning whether McCain was anything more than talk. George Bush called himself a ""Reformer with Results."" Jeb is now touting his ""record of reform and results."" George Bush emphasized that McCain behaved like a Washington insider. Jeb recently said, ""It's almost as though Donald Trump is acting like a Washington politician."" After Bush vanquished McCain, he thanked him for ""putting me through my paces,"" recognizing that through competition a candidate improves. That's why the truly nimble and talented candidate can use Trump as a foil--taking advantage of the churn, chaos, and attention he creates to promote his or her own vision. Or more important, offering his or her own vision to the voters Trump has excited. That isn't a necessity to defeat Trump--perhaps getting reporters to cover Trump's thin answers to questioning by Hugh Hewitt is enough to defeat him--but it is an opportunity to show voters something more,  including that a candidate can seize opportunities that look like burdens. Bush, for example, could use Trump as a foil to make a loud and proud case for the optimistic, inclusive brand of Republicanism that he says he's running on. He says that he wants to be joyful and optimistic, but never really shows it. Responding to Trump's claim that he is ""low-energy"" with a recitation of all the campaign stops he's hit isn't the same as actually demonstrating buoyancy in his response. If the GOP nominee ultimately isn't Donald Trump, he or she may get there by taking him on or ignoring him. Both are plans of action made after confrontation with an unpredictable and powerful force and tell us something about what the nominee would do in office. We don't have to rely on the candidates' promises about what kind of president they will be. We're getting a little window into that right now."	Donald Trump Is Revealing How Other Republicans Deal With an Unexpected Threat
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/donald_trump_s_loyalty_pledge_to_the_republican_party_how_the_real_estate.html	"Donald Trump made Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, come to him. The occasion was Trump's signing of a so-called loyalty pledge drafted by the RNC and distributed to each of the candidates, but obviously created specifically to corral Trump. The text is brief but comprehensive. ""I, [name], affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,"" it reads. ""I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party."" Each of the candidates will likely sign this piece of paper and submit it to the boss. There are severe consequences for any candidate who breaches this agreement: Priebus will ... give that candidate a look of disappointment, expressing displeasure. Perhaps Priebus will even issue a statement expressing his displeasure. In other words, there are no hard consequences for breaking this pledge. A candidate runs the risk of being labeled A Guy Who Breaks Pledges. But come now; if Trump were to run as an independent, he would simply come out and say that it was Priebus, the crooked establishment Republican Beltway insider fat cat, who reneged on the terms of the pledge by calling him a name, real or imagined. ""I have no intention of changing my mind,"" Trump said at his Thursday afternoon press conference in Trump Tower, following Priebus' departure. And sure, that's a statement of fact: Who has ever intended to change his mind? This is not the pledge that matters. Instead it was the Republican parties of certain states, most notably South Carolina, that brought Trump to a decision point. Palmetto State GOP leaders made inclusion on its primary ballot conditional on the signing of a loyalty pledge by Sept. 30. Trump was compelled to sign that and other pledges to get on the ballots. Priebus is just formalizing the states' dirty work, like any good small-government federalist would. And as soon as primary season ends, Trump could break most of the state pledges, too. And yet, why would he? The logic behind a Trump independent run doesn't hold up on the most basic level. If he remains atop the polls as time goes on--and his ceiling for support keeps growing--he will win the Republican nomination. If he collapses, then he collapses, and he no longer has the political support to make an independent presidential bid a worthwhile expenditure of personal resources. Still, there's too much on the line for Priebus and fellow custodians of the GOP presidential nomination process to call Trump's bluff.  If Trump were to launch an independent bid, even one that attracted few percentage points, that would likely be the ballgame for the Republican Party. This dynamic left Priebus and state party leaders in a desperate position to do whatever was necessary to get Trump to sign a loyalty pledge and then pray that hopefully, hopefully it means enough to the real estate magnate that he feels compelled to honor his word. Priebus' visit to Trump Tower further cements this reality television star's transformation into a ""real"" presidential candidate who cannot be ignored or laughed off as the cycle deepens. And though Trump has signed this piece of paper saying he will and won't do certain things next year, he has not signed any piece of paper requiring him to disavow the unorthodox nationalist, protectionist, tax increase-supporting agenda with which he's carved his sizable lane. The Republican Party, however, has now committed itself to supporting this agenda, which goes against decades of its own dogma, if Trump is able to pull off the nomination. Most of today's news has been framed as Trump signs pledge to support eventual nominee. Another way to look at it is Establishment Republican candidates pledge to support Donald Trump. Trump has not pledged to incorporate into his candidacy any of the cheerier tones or traditional Republican policies that the GOP establishment would like to see from him. The Republican Party, though, has agreed to incorporate Trump. In bringing his politics into the fold, the GOP has also handed Trump a shield just when he might need it. Jeb Bush's campaign has begun the offensive against Trump's political past, putting together a montage of Trump over the years stating that he's pro-choice, a friend and admirer of Hillary Clinton's, and an advocate for a single-payer health care system--all delivered with the same phony conviction that he wields now to emphasize the opposite. Now, when Bush or whoever else uses these attacks against Trump on the trail or at the next debate, Trump can fire right back: Didn't you see Reince Priebus come to my office? Didn't you see me just pledge my support to the Republican nominee? If I were a liberal, why would I do that? ""I will be totally pledging my allegiance,"" Trump stated Thursday, in one of his most devilishly Trumpian formulations yet, ""to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands."" And the Republican Party has pledged its allegiance to him."	How Trump Outsmarted the GOP
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/jeb_bush_s_millions_will_keep_his_struggling_campaign_going_did_republican.html	"Last fall, when Jeb Bush was still mulling a bid for the presidency, Bloomberg Politics reported on what was considered then--and is still considered now--Bush's greatest advantage as a presidential candidate: His ability to separate wealthy donors from vast sums of money quickly. ""Unlike his competitors,"" the thinking went, ""Bush could lure donors off the fence in a hurry, without undergoing a hazing trial to test skill and stability."" That is precisely what happened. Instants after announcing over the winter that he was ""seriously considering the possibility of running for president,"" Bush and his team set up the Right to Rise PAC and super PAC to serve as cash receptacles for eager GOP establishment donors. The money rolled in, and by July the super PAC announced that it had met its goal of raising more than $100 million in the first six months of the year. The popular former governor of Florida, who hadn't run for office since his 2002 re-election bid, was able to take it to the bank based on his family's success at winning presidential nominations and his ability to flatter the right crowds at events like the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. And indeed, he was able to bypass a thorough vetting of his aptitude for a presidential run en route to this fortune. Whoops. Because it's clear right now that ""a hazing trial to test skill and stability"" was exactly what wealthy establishment Republican donors should have subjected Bush to before opening their checkbooks. It's not a matter of sunk costs. The very wealthy, by their standards, can still buy politics on the cheap: losing a million bucks on a lemon of a candidate won't send them to the poor house. But by imbuing the Bush operation with more primary cash than has ever been seen, they have already ensured that the Bush campaign--even a clumsy, poll-trailing Bush campaign--can go deep into the 2016 primary calendar. Unless Bush can really turn his image around, that means that the process of settling on an establishment candidate will play out far longer than the party may prefer--and perhaps even throw the nomination to the dreaded ""outsider"" candidate of the establishment's worst nightmares. Go ahead, fellas: Clutch those pearls. Had Bush undergone the hazing trial from which over-exuberant donors exempted him, red flags would have been flying all over the place. He is gaffe-prone. He struggles to opine coherently on the most obvious question for which he's had years to prepare. He speaks, in the words of his great foil Donald Trump, in a ""low-energy"" manner. His last name remains Bush, a problem for both his primary and general elections prospects. All of these flaws are reflected in his polling numbers, which aren't the most important metric to look at this early, as well as his fundamentals. Seemingly each new polling of favorability, a rough way of considering a candidate's ceiling of support, shows Bush in horrendous shape. A Public Policy Polling national survey of Republican voters released Tuesday pins Bush near the middle of the pack in support (as in, 20 or so points behind Trump), and near the bottom of the pack in net favorability. His 39-42 negative favorability rating is among the worst in the field, surpassed in dislike only by candidates such as Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul whose viability was always limited. (Meanwhile Trump, whose unfavorables only a few months ago soared into the 60s or even 70s, now finds himself with a solid 56-30 rating.) You know who is well liked? Sen. Marco Rubio, the notoriously amnesty-curious junior senator from Florida. While still low in overall support, Rubio's slow-and-steady, mostly gaffe-free campaign has left him in prime position to surge once various other early flirtations have expired. PPP's survey finds Rubio's favorable-unfavorable at 58-24, the second best margin behind only Ben Carson, who will face extraordinary scrutiny if his nascent surge lasts much longer. This is only the latest survey in a long string of them that reflects the fond feelings Republican voters have for Rubio, a candidate who's been through the wringer of conservative furor and lived not just to tell about it, but to thrive. It's almost like Rubio is shaping into a fine presidential candidate, acceptable to conservatives and moderates alike, who could compete gamely in a general election. It's almost like Rubio ... what's a way of putting this? ... has undergone a hazing trial to test his skill and stability and passed, with plenty of room to grow after the Summer of Trump and all of the silly, early dabbling that comes with that. Rubio's problem--and perhaps soon a problem for the GOP establishment and the Republican Party writ large--is that Bush will face no financial pressure to leave the scene. These donors made the mistake of paying the contractor in full before he'd begun the job. In no way can Bush be ruled out as the nominee. But we're definitely at the point where he cannot simply wait for the other candidates to cancel each other out, McCain-style, and have their support matriculate to him as the only acceptable option. Bush will have to find some way to go from an unpopular politician to a moderately popular politician. Let's say that he's unable to pull off that difficult task. He'd still be well-known and well-liked enough among a modest segment of party to retain 10 or 20 percent support--just enough to prevent Rubio (or the always-discussed, never-realized white knight) from reaching escape velocity. We race past Super Tuesday at the beginning of March and reach the latter end of the calendar when state primary rules switch from proportional to winner-take-all delegate allocation. Jeb and his super PAC still have bushels of money and figure they might as well stick around and hope something changes, because why not? He and Rubio split up the moderates. Trump either doesn't blow up or retains enough support to take those winner-take-all states on his own, or he does blow up, and a figure like Cruz successfully coalesces the anti-establishment vote. These are the problems that GOP establishment donors created by throwing million-dollar checks at Bush before seeing if anyone liked him or he was up to the task on the campaign trail. Thus far he has failed in both regards. But he still has all that loot and, much like his brother once said about the political capital he'd accumulated, he intends to spend it. Perhaps his Bush family WASP instincts will kick in and, like a gentleman, he'll call it quits early if things aren't working out, instructing his super PAC from then on to devote its resources to Rubio. Or maybe his Bush family ""destroy everyone!"" instincts will override the WASP side, and he'll fight--and fight nasty--until the bitter end. The establishment invested heavily in Bush early to avoid the lengthy, damaging primary fight of the 2012 cycle. In doing so, they may well have created a far longer process, with far more dangerous results."	Will Jeb Bush Become the Nightmare that Republican Donors Once Feared?
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/democrats_have_the_right_to_be_angry_with_hillary_clinton_her_email_scandal.html	"Another week brings another chapter in the endless scandal of Hillary Clinton's email management. On Monday, the State Department released 4,368 emails--totaling 7,121 pages--from Clinton's private email server. If you don't know the story, it's straightforward: Instead of using her official account, Clinton built a personal server that sent and received messages outside of the State Department's channels. Republicans think this is nefarious. ""On hundreds of occasions, Hillary Clinton's reckless attempt to skirt transparency laws put sensitive information and our national security at risk,"" said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus in a statement. ""With the FBI continuing to investigate, Hillary Clinton's growing email scandal shows she cannot be trusted with the White House."" And on the other side, some nervous Democrats are casting everywhere for an alternative to the Democratic front-runner, terrified that Clinton will sink under the scrutiny. The downside for Democrats is that the scrutiny won't end. With thousands of emails left to drop, the story will continue through the year, into 2016. Even if the emails themselves are banal--quick confirmations, unsolicited advice, gossip, requests for television shows, cryptic references to ""gefilte fish""--the reoccurring story will bring coverage, spark scandal fatigue, and hurt Clinton with the public. But there's an upside. Yes, Clinton and the Democratic Party will deal with bad press over her private email. But it won't be catastrophic, since--as far as anyone can tell--the former secretary hasn't done anything illegal, criminal, or that falls under the vague category of ""wrongdoing."" For starters, notes David Ignatius for the Washington Post, ""there's no legal difference whether Clinton and her aides passed sensitive information using her private server or the official 'state.gov' account that many now argue should have been used. Neither system is authorized for transmitting classified information."" Which is to say that, in a sense, it doesn't matter much that Clinton used a private server--both it and her official account are subject to public records laws, and neither was cleared for classified information. If Clinton or her aides had sent sensitive material to or from the state.gov account, they would have been just as culpable. To that point, there's no evidence--at least not yet--that either Clinton or her aides sent classified material through the system. At most, her emails contained information that was classified after the fact. When Priebus says, ""These new emails show Hillary Clinton exposed even more classified information on her secret server than previously known,"" that's what he means. Beyond that, Clinton's behavior doesn't seem too out-of-step with typical practice. Here's Ignatius again: ""Informal back channels existed long before e-mail. One former State Department official recalled the days when most embassies overseas had only a few phones authorized for secret communications. Rather than go to the executive office to make such a call, officers would use their regular phones, bypassing any truly sensitive details."" The point isn't that this is OK or that we shouldn't discuss it, but that--as a matter of practice--we aren't looking at a serious violation. At worse, so far, we just have misjudgment. But on that score, Democrats are right to be angry. As one of the most scrutinized people in American politics, Clinton had a duty to her party to tread carefully and avoid obvious mistakes. The private server is an obvious mistake, and if nothing else, it will feed the bottomless media appetite for Clinton scandals, even when they don't bear fruit. And although you could make the case that this is unavoidable--that she can't escape the ""Clinton rules,"" so why bother--it's also fair for Democrats to want more prudence from their likely nominee. As it stands, her bid for the nomination has been harmed by a self-inflicted wound. It's not grievous, but looking at the damage so far, that doesn't mean it won't count.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/hillary_clinton_s_newly_released_email_messages_what_the_state_department.html	"It's fun to read other people's email. It's especially fun to rummage through the email of Hillary Clinton, our most famous person. But ""fun"" is about where this road ends, assuming it ever does. The State Department released its latest tranche of Clinton's emails Monday night, some 7,000 pages from the secretary's first two years at Foggy Bottom. Twitter wasted no time unearthing some of the treasures from the batch. There's the gefilte fish one. ""Where are we on this?"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asks two subordinates at 9:56 in the morning on March 5, 2010. (Yes, this was a thing.) We have D.C. lawyer/lobbyist/PR fixer Lanny Davis humiliating himself at length, groveling at the feet of his ""dear friend Hillary"" in search of a ""personal favor."" After a several-hundred-word windup, in which the Clinton confidante complains about the right, the left, the media, and other people who simply don't understand Lanny Davis, comes the ask: Can she say nice things about him to a reporter who's profiling him and his ""unique multi-disciplinary"" practice? ""Pls advise. [Redacted]. Thx,"" our nation's top diplomat instructs her handlers at 10:53 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 17, 2010. ""I would advise [redacted],"" Cheryl Mills responds around sunrise the following morning. ""[Redacted],"" Philippe Reines chimes in several hours later. Sidney Blumenthal, the ""Clinton whisperer,"" is constantly bombarding her with articles that his son Max has written. And here Blumenthal tells her that he talked to the journalist Steve Clemons, who talked to Gen. David Petraeus, who spoke ""freely"" about running for president. Such gossips! On Sunday, Jan. 3, 2010, at 6:20 in the evening, Clinton reminds an aide to purchase skim milk for her tea and asks when the television programs Parks and Recreations and The Good Wife air. Et cetera. This is fun stuff, both for the nuggets of recent historical trivia and the This Town-esque look at the comical way that powerful, famous people suck up to the even more powerful, famous people. And yes, there are also some serious emails, too, about fixing Haiti and this country and that country. But the effect of this release is more anthropological, given the lack of a hard-news smoking gun relevant to the current controversy over what exactly was on Clinton's private email server. The best headline that our newspaper of record can come up with, after browsing through this collection, is: ""Insights, and Redactions, in Latest Release of Hillary Clinton's Emails."" Insights! This changes everything, if there are insights. This release, much like the previous releases and future releases, and basically all news about Hilary Clinton over the last 20 years, will only confirm one's prior beliefs about Hillary Clinton. Those who support Hillary Clinton will focus on the number of emails where she shows her ""normal side."" (And what normal person doesn't have a personal assistant to tell her what time popular TV shows air?) They will also point out the emails where Clinton demands someone be held accountable for some error, or where she writes a friendly note to a co-worker, or where she discusses saving children in third-world countries. Those who do not support Clinton will see something else: redactions. To those elements that bank on conspiracy, each redaction is the cover-up of some truly devious crime. What does Clinton write in that redacted response to Davis' whiny email? Perhaps that is where she orders the murder of the American ambassador in Benghazi, two years in advance. (These Clintons, they plan their worst deeds well in advance.) There are those who will see any whited-out strip of text and presume that here Clinton gives Huma Abedin the precise description of how she ""took out"" Vince Foster. The main effect of these email releases is to keep afloat in the public mind the very fact that Clinton is suffering from a controversy over her private email server. That's no small thing. Thousands of pages of emails will be released periodically over the coming months, and each time a new collection drops, it will make news. (It would be beneficial for the Clinton campaign to have all of the emails released at once, but it didn't help those efforts by hand-delivering 55,000 pages of paper for the State Department to scan.) Instead, the simple mechanics of manual labor will ensure that, regardless of content, the story will resurface every few months. And once this tedious process is finished, it will be resolved the same way all other Clinton controversies are resolved: It will never be resolved. In the meantime, enjoy the gefilte fish."	What Hillary Clinton's New Batch of Emails Actually Reveals
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/hurricane_katrina_10_years_later_the_myths_that_persist_debunked.html	"This story was produced by the Lens, a reader-supported, nonprofit newsroom serving New Orleans. Ten years after Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent floods from the failed federal levees, out-of-town media and politicians are still getting some things wrong. Here are five of the most stubborn myths about the disaster, the recovery, and the city of New Orleans--plus one self-delusional bonus myth we just can't let stand. 1. No one could have predicted it. ""That 'perfect storm' of a combination of catastrophes exceeded the foresight of the planners, and maybe anybody's foresight.""
 -- Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, Sept. 5, 2005 ""I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.""
 --President George W. Bush, Sept. 1, 2005 ""Well, God bless everyone, because nature we can't control. She does what she wants.""
 --Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, April 30, 2015 There are two problems. The first is thinking of what happened as a natural disaster. Hurricane Katrina itself was a natural phenomenon, but most of the flooding in and around New Orleans was the result of the poor construction and design of the city's flood-protection system by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, causing more than 50 breaches. Researchers estimated that water pouring in through the broken levees may have caused as much as 84 percent of the flooding. The extent of the flooding also made it harder to push the water out of the city because many pump stations were flooded. Some that worked were useless because they were just recirculating water in and out of the breaches. The other problem: A disaster of this scale had been predicted, and levee failure had been discussed. A Katrina-like catastrophe was predicted as recently as one year before the storm. In 2004, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness conducted the ""Hurricane Pam Exercise."" The exercise modeled a Category 3 hurricane hitting New Orleans, overtopping the levee system and flooding the city with up to 20 feet of water. The Pam model showed levees being overtopped, but it did not predict that the levees would break. That possibility, however, did appear in the Times-Picayune's 2002 series, ""Washing Away."" That series described a worst-case scenario storm, one even more intense than Katrina, hitting the metro area. Experts interviewed in the series described a scenario where the city's levees, combined with its bowl-shaped geography, would trap storm surge water inside for weeks or months in the event of major overtopping or a breach. ""Hundreds of thousands would be left homeless, and it would take months to dry out the area and begin to make it livable. But there wouldn't be much for residents to come home to. The local economy would be in ruins,"" reporters Mark Schleifstein and John McQuaid wrote. More troubling, though, were the unheeded warnings of possible levee failure one year before Katrina. In 2004, residents who lived near the 17th Street Canal, which was breached in the storm, reported water pooling in their yards to the water utility, the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board. This was a sign that the levees were likely leaking, an early signal of their instability. But the Corps of Engineers was never informed of the problem. 2. New Orleans is below sea level. ""An estimated 80 percent of the below-sea-level city was under water, up to 20 feet deep in places, with miles and miles of homes swamped.""
 --Associated Press, Aug. 30, 2005 ""It makes no sense to spend billions of dollars to rebuild a city that's seven feet under sea level, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said of federal assistance for hurricane-devastated New Orleans.""
 --Associated Press, Sept. 1, 2005 ""For instance, an existing high school geography standard requires students 'explain how humans interact with their environment.' Then, a series of bullet points outlines specific approaches for teachers to use in class, such as talking about how New Orleans is below sea level for a lesson in land usage.""
 --Sioux Falls Argus Leader, Nov. 16, 2014 Like the unpredictable natural disaster myth, New Orleans' low elevation has played a role in political debates about whether the city is a worthwhile investment. Some have even asked why the city was built in the first place. This one is half true: About half of New Orleans is below sea level. But even some areas above sea level, including much of the Lower 9th Ward, flooded after Katrina because of levee failures. In a 2007 report, Tulane University geographer Richard Campanella found that 51 percent of the urbanized area in metropolitan New Orleans was above sea level. In 2000, 185,000 people in the city lived above sea level. This map produced by the Data Center, a New Orleans think tank, makes it clear: For much of the city's first 200 years, most of its population lived on high ground. The oldest parts of the city, near the Mississippi River, can be more than 10 feet above sea level. In the 19th and 20th centuries, a citywide drainage system and automobiles allowed New Orleanians to live farther away from the river, and developers began building in low-lying areas closer to Lake Pontchartrain. But even much of that was once on higher ground than it is now. Ironically, the city's flood control systems have caused it to sink. The first problem was the levee system, which, for the most part, keeps the area dry. Southeast Louisiana was built by sediment carried down the Mississippi River, deposited across the delta when the river overtopped its banks during spring floods. The levees prevented that annual replenishment. The city's drainage system--like the levees, built to keep the population dry--further contributed to the problem. The city was built on wet delta soil; the protected land inside the levees needs rainwater to remain hydrated. When too much water is pumped out, the soil dries and sinks--a process called subsidence--and the city ultimately becomes more vulnerable to catastrophic flooding. 3. Shooters were picking off cops and relief workers. ""Storm victims were raped and beaten, fights and fires broke out, corpses lay out in the open, and rescue helicopters and law enforcement officers were shot at as flooded-out New Orleans descended into anarchy today.""
 --Associated Press, Sept. 1, 2005 ""Our hotel was overrun with gangs.""
 --Brian Williams, interview published July 26, 2014 This is perhaps the most outrageous example in the ""post-Katrina crime wave"" genre. There was, of course, the purported chaos at the city's two shelters of last resort: the Superdome and the convention center. The rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl at the convention center, dozens of killings at the Superdome, bodies piled up at both. But by the end of September 2005, reporting by the Times-Picayune debunked many of these stories. In fact, officials only confirmed one killing at either site: Danny Brumfield, who was shot by police. There were also the reports of mass looting, which led to an order authorizing police to shoot looters. Though there were many confirmed reports of looting after the storm, at least some of the alleged ""looting"" appears, in many cases, to have been desperate people gathering food, water, and supplies. Even early news stories included reports of people carrying food. But the stories of citizens shooting at relief workers and police may trump those because of the consequences. Reports of officers being shot in New Orleans appear to have contributed to the decision by officials in a nearby suburb to seal off a bridge over the Mississippi River, leaving hundreds stranded on the flooded side of the river. It also played a role in the infamous Danziger Bridge shootings, in which police officers opened fire on unarmed civilians crossing the bridge, killing two and seriously injuring four. Initial police reports claimed that people on the bridge were firing on several officers and a group of relief workers, but those were later proven false in court. The media took much of the blame for the over-the-top coverage. But as former Times-Picayune reporter Gordon Russell, who now works for the New Orleans Advocate, noted, ""their information was often coming from people who would ordinarily be considered reliable sources,"" such as Mayor Ray Nagin and Police Superintendent Eddie Compass. 4. The Recovery School District was created due to Hurricane Katrina. ""One prototype is the all-charter, state-run Recovery School District in New Orleans, which was created in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's devastation.""
 --Los Angeles Times, Feb. 8, 2015 ""According to a UIUC news release on the article, after Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over 102 of the Orleans Parish School Board's 117 schools that were deemed worst performers, and created the Recovery School District (RSD).""
 --WUIS-FM, June 1, 2015 Although it's true Hurricane Katrina hastened the expansion of Louisiana's state-run Recovery School District, the district was not born from the storm. The Recovery School District was created in 2003. The name comes from its mission to help failing schools recover academically. It was a natural next step in the state's accountability system established in mid-1990s. Going into the 2005-06 school year, the RSD already had taken over a handful of schools in New Orleans. It was after the storm, in a special session of the legislature, that lawmakers changed the threshold for failing and allowed for the state takeover of a failing district. The move was clearly targeted at New Orleans' crippled school system. That change enabled the RSD to take over a majority of the city's schools, leaving only the highest-performing ones under the Orleans Parish School Board's control. Today, the districts operate side by side. The RSD converted schools to charters and now oversees the country's first all-charter district. The school board operates a majority-charter district but, contrary to some inaccurate rhetoric, the district still runs five traditional schools. 5. Everything is better now. ""There are three ways things could have gone. In the first story, New Orleans slides into its own wet grave, another urban tragedy of geography and economics. In the second story, New Orleans rebuilds itself as it was before -- a sleepy southern belle of a town serving up wet weekends of intemperance. In the third story, Hurricane Katrina somehow kickstarts an age of innovation and an economic renaissance in a city written off for dead. The Big Easy has chosen the third path -- the hard path, and their struggle has revealed both the tantalizing allure, and the deep challenges, of reinventing a city.""
 --The Atlantic, April 8, 2013 ""Hurricane Katrina gave a great American city a rebirth.""
 --Chicago Tribune, Aug. 13, 2015 The myth of the Katrina ""reset"" is popular with national media. The idea is that the storm and the floods that followed left the city a blank slate, allowing its leaders to rebuild it better than it was before: better planning, more efficient government, and no corruption. The most recent, and possibly the most offensive, example was a column by Chicago Tribune writer Kristen McQueary. As a member of the newspaper's editorial board, McQueary recently spoke to New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who was making the rounds in the runup to the anniversary. ""I find myself wishing for a storm in Chicago -- an unpredictable, haughty, devastating swirl of fury. A dramatic levee break. Geysers bursting through manhole covers. A sleeping city, forced onto the rooftops,"" McQueary wrote. ""That's what it took to hit the reset button in New Orleans. Chaos. Tragedy. Heartbreak."" The truth is more complicated than that. It's true that the city has grown from near-abandonment immediately after the storm to 80 percent of its pre-Katrina population, and it continues to grow faster than most other major cities. Its police department and jail are undergoing massive reform efforts. And tax collections are up year over year. The city's schools are showing large gains in student test scores and graduation rates, according to a recently released study. Still, the floods were devastating, and they continue to affect the area. About 1,800 people died, many of those in New Orleans. Nearly 80 percent of New Orleanians' homes were flooded. Ten years later, the city still suffers many blighted homes and overgrown lots. Violent crime continues to be a problem, and the city's homicide rate consistently ranks near or at the top nationwide. The city's fiscal progress could be undone by millions of dollars in unmet obligations. And advances from the police department and jail reforms are fitful. The sweeping school overhaul also remains extremely controversial. Thousands of public school teachers lost their jobs after the storm and the state takeover. Schools in the Recovery School District still rank low, with about 40 percent earning a ""D,"" ""F,"" or ""T"" (ungraded turnaround school) in the state's letter-grade accountability system. And a poll released Monday found that only 34 percent of black New Orleanians, whose children make up most of the city's public school enrollment, think schools have improved, compared with 55 percent of whites. Many people were never able to return. The overall population is lower, and the city has 100,000 fewer black residents now than before the storm, though it is still majority black. The city's black population has not seen the same income gains as its white population. A report by the Data Center found that while the percentage of white middle- and upper-income households increased after Katrina, the percentage of black households in the same income tiers has shrunk. Although the area has seen job growth, much of it has been in low-wage tourism and retail jobs. The city's overall poverty rate is 27 percent, compared with 16 percent nationally. The New Orleans rate is virtually the same as it was before the storm. The childhood poverty rate is 39 percent, 17 percentage points above the national average and only a slight decrease from 41 percent in 1999. Meanwhile, the city's lack of affordable housing is reaching a near-crisis point. About 50 percent of the city's residents spend more than 35 percent of their income on housing, and 37 percent spend more than half their income on housing. 6. Then-FEMA chief Michael Brown did a great job. ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.""
 --President George W. Bush, Bush Press Archives, Sept. 2, 2005 OK, fine: It's actually not a widely held myth that Michael ""Brownie"" Brown, who was the Bush administration's FEMA director when Katrina hit, handled the disaster competently. Bush didn't even seem to believe that for very long. Shortly after Bush's public praise, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff removed Brown from the Gulf Coast. Ten years later, the only person who believes Brown did anything close to a heckuva job may be Brown himself. On Thursday, two days before the anniversary, Politico published a piece by Brown titled ""Stop Blaming Me for Hurricane Katrina."" In it, Brown disabuses readers of the notion that he was to blame for the city's incomplete evacuation, cites a breakdown in the proper ""chain of command"" under Chertoff, and complains about his relationship with the press. Of those, the first is the only one really worth addressing. To get a good idea of how Brown was behaving while New Orleans was devastated, it's best to check source documents, such as emails between Brown and his staff in the days immediately before and after the storm. Luckily, those are easy to find. Emails showed that Brown dismissed reports that the city's levees had breached and seemed to be preoccupied with his appearance as he anticipated national television interviews. His exchanges with Marty Bahamonde are also telling. Bahamonde, a FEMA public affairs official, was notably the only FEMA employee in the city of New Orleans in the days before the storm. Brown later testified before a congressional committee that the agency had more than a dozen officials in the Superdome. On Aug. 31, 2005, Bahamonde sent a desperate email to Brown telling him that the Superdome was quickly running out of supplies and that medical patients were in imminent danger of death. ""We are running out of food and water at the dome,"" Bahamonde wrote. ""Thanks for the update. Anything specific I need to do or tweak?"" Brown responded. Brown would later testify that Bahamonde said the Superdome had ""plenty of food."" The same day Bahamonde sent the email about the dire conditions in the Superdome, Brown's press secretary let FEMA employee Cindy Taylor know that ""It is very important that time is allowed for Mr. Brown to eat dinner"" and would need plenty of time to ""get to and from a location of his choice, followed by wait service from the restaurant staff, eating, etc."" Taylor forwarded the email to Bahamonde. ""Just tell her that I just ate an MRE and crapped in the hallway of the Superdome with 30,000 other close friends,"" Bahamonde wrote back."	Ten Years After Katrina, Myths About Warnings, Violence, and Recovery Persist. Here's the Truth.
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/donald_trump_s_lasting_impression_how_the_gop_candidate_can_make_a_difference.html	"By now it is fairly clear that Donald Trump can get away with expressing views that would sink almost any other GOP candidate. While the other Republican presidential contenders had readied themselves for several rounds of more-conservative-than-thou--the usual contest in the GOP primary--Trump has blithely abandoned any number of conservative orthodoxies, and he doesn't appear to have lost any supporters in the process. Indeed, he may well have gained a few. This week, pollster Frank Luntz conducted a focus group of current and former Trump supporters. For over two and a half hours, Luntz probed their reactions to Trump's past support for abortion rights and stricter gun laws, among other heresies, and he found that none of them seemed to care. Luntz's findings help explain the persistence of Trump's lead in polls of GOP primary voters over the past several weeks, even as Jeb Bush has been on a mission to prove that Trump is a barely disguised tax-and-spend liberal. Can you imagine another Republican praising Canada's single-payer health care system and socialized medicine in Scotland, as Trump did during the Fox News GOP debate? And then getting away with it? In a recent interview with Chuck Todd of Meet the Press, Trump said that he was ""fine with affirmative action,"" having ""lived with it for a long time."" Suffice it to say, conservative opponents of racial preferences were less than pleased. But have Trump's diehard supporters been abandoning him in droves? They haven't yet. In that same Meet the Press interview, Trump warned against corporations that ""have no loyalty to this country,"" language that brought to mind John Kerry's campaign against ""Benedict Arnold CEOs."" Yes, Trump followed up by saying we ought to cut corporate taxes to keep these companies from fleeing our shores--a stance embraced by most mainstream Republicans--but it's the vehemence with which Trump attacks CEOs that is noteworthy. It's very hard to imagine a member of the Bush family using the same language--or a libertarian conservative like Rand Paul for that matter. And while several of Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination have either embraced a flat tax outright or praised the idea in principle, the billionaire real estate developer offered a robust defense of progressive taxation on Fox & Friends. When asked about hedge-fund managers in particular, Trump said without hesitation that ""they're not paying enough tax."" He then implied that well-heeled hedge-funders have been shielded from higher taxes by politicians who depend on their campaign contributions. This is very much in keeping with the way Trump has ridiculed his opponents for being so dependent on wealthy donors. What does all of this mean? It means that Trump has a realistic shot at building a lasting political movement that operates outside of the mainstream American right. I'm of the view that the 20-25 percent of the GOP primary vote that Trump currently commands is close to his ceiling, and that he is unlikely to win the Republican presidential nomination. Eventually, the rest of the party will rally around a candidate capable of defeating him. I am also convinced, however, that Trump represents a serious political current in American life, which rhymes with, though it is not identical to, many of the nationalist and populist political movements that have been roiling European politics for the last decade and a half. So instead of kowtowing to the GOP establishment by, say, ruling out a third-party run for the White House, and jeopardizing his hard-earned brand as an in-your-face populist truth-teller in the process, Trump could match or even surpass the share of the popular vote Ross Perot won in 1992 by embracing a potent mix of right-wing and left-wing policy prescriptions. What might full-spectrum Trumpism look like? What are the positions Trump should take to expand his political base on issues other than immigration? One good place to start would be campaign finance reform. If Trump embraced the campaign finance reform proposals of Larry Lessig, the liberal activist and Harvard professor of constitutional law who is running a quixotic single-issue campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he would do a number of things all at once.* First, by advocating for public funding for campaigns and curbs on high-dollar contributions, he would have an excuse to keep shaming his GOP opponents for their reliance on wealthy donors and their notionally independent Super PACs. Second, he would add intellectual heft to his populism, which would force his media detractors to give him at least some begrudging respect. Granted, Trump's core supporters are mostly indifferent to media sentiment. But favorable coverage of his proposals will soften anti-Trump attitudes among those who don't support him, making them more persuadable. In his recent interview with Todd, Trump said that he favored keeping the minimum wage roughly where it is now. That is a political (though not a substantive) mistake, as 42 percent of Republicans favor an increase in the federal minimum wage to $10.10, and 18 percent favor an even steeper increase to $15. The Republicans who back minimum wage increases tend to be more blue-collar than white-collar, and it is blue-collar voters who've been most enthusiastic about Trump. One could imagine Trump making an argument not unlike that made by Ron Unz in the American Conservative back in 2011. ""The automatic rejoinder to proposals for hiking the minimum wage is that 'jobs will be lost,' "" wrote Unz. ""But in today's America a huge fraction of jobs at or near the minimum wage are held by immigrants, often illegal ones."" And so, he went on to argue, eliminating jobs that serve as a magnet for less-skilled immigrants ""is a central goal of the plan, not a feature or a bug."" Backing a minimum wage hike would strengthen Trump's populist credentials, and it might even win him some union voters from the other side of the aisle. Having come out in favor of progressive taxes and steeper taxes for hedge-fund managers, where should Trump land on tax reform? One thing to keep in mind is that while it is fairly rare that tax reform proposals dreamed up in the heat of a presidential campaign actually add up, Trump is under even less pressure to offer a tax reform plan that makes sense than his opponents, as his strength flows from his ability to convince his supporters that his alleged negotiating prowess is all he needs to make miracles happen. So I would suggest that Trump create a new tax bracket for millionaires that would apply to both wage and nonwage income--this is how he'd get the hedge-funders--and then propose a deep cut in the Social Security payroll tax, one that could apply to all workers or only to those earning below the median income. Naturally, cutting the payroll tax will raise concerns about Trump's commitment to Social Security, which is why he should then call for hiking Social Security benefits. Is it at all wise to cut Social Security taxes while also raising benefits? No, it is not. But I doubt that will matter to Trump's supporters. Finally, Trump should exhume a proposal that died during the Obamacare debate, yet would command the enthusiastic backing of many American voters: He should allow Americans under the age of 65 to ""buy-in"" to Medicare. Back in 2007, Gerald F. Anderson and Hugh R. Waters, both of Johns Hopkins University, devised a program they called Medicare Part E, with the ""E"" standing for ""Everyone."" Essentially, they proposed that everyone, whether through their employers or as individuals, be allowed to enroll in Medicare, provided they pay a premium that reflects their ability to pay. Trump could tread more lightly by, say, limiting Medicare Part E to Americans above a certain age, like 50. This would lower the cost of the proposal, and it would also resonate with middle-aged voters frustrated with their private health insurance options. Fiscal conservatives, myself included, would flip out at such a proposal, and so might some members of Trump's inner circle, including his chief campaign guru, Corey Lewandowski, a veteran of the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity. What can't be denied, however, is that Medicare is wildly popular. If Trump adopted every one of these proposals, wouldn't he just be a liberal? We can certainly expect that Trump's conservative opponents will make that argument. As long as Trump remains committed to a more assertive and nationalistic approach to immigration and foreign policy, however, he'll have an easy time presenting himself as a man of the right. I'm fairly confident that Trump won't go down this road I've described. But if he does, Trump and Trumpism will be with us for many years to come, for better or for worse.
