""Folks, wake up,"" said President Obama last week. ""Those who didn't get everything they wanted,""said Vice President Biden this week, ""it's time to just buck up here."" If the early leaks are right, the ""professional left""--Press Secretary Robert Gibbs's instantly immortal, probably accidental term--is about to get all the bucking-up it needs. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, according to just about everybody, is probably leaving the White House this week to prove that Chicago can be governed by someone not named ""Daley."" He is being treated to more of the rose-scented superlatives that followed him since he returned to politics in 2002, when he ran the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006, and when he joined the Obama administration. ""He began each day before the sun did,"" said Jake Tapper of ABC News, reporting last night, ""often by swimming a mile, and he was perhaps the hardest worker in the White House."" This is the kind of stuff liberals are used to hearing about Emanuel. If it ever impressed them, it doesn't anymore. After two years of Emanuel, they are convinced that he was a paper tiger, a hack who never missed a chance to weaken the progressive agenda and a man whose toughness never translated to big, meaningful victories over Republicans. ""I thought we'd get the guy who busted balls in the House,"" says Markos Moulitsas, the founder of Daily Kos, one of many online salons of anti-Rahm sentiment. ""Instead, we got a White House more obsessed with getting [Wyoming Republican Sen. Mike] Enzi aboard the health care reform plan than on passing the best possible legislation and doing whatever it took to make it happen."" When was the last time that there was a perception gap between the media and the ""netroots"" on Rahm Emanuel? As far as the press is concerned, Emanuel is a political fixer who's been proved right about the administration's big goals. As far as the left is concerned, Emanuel was the reason the administration fumbled on those goals. Liberals clip and save stories in which Emanuel was the administration's voice of compromise. He was ready to bargain with Blue Dog Democrats for a micro-health care bill after Scott Brown's victory. He didn't think the monster stimulus bill that Christina Romer wanted was politically viable--but thought a smaller, less effective stimulus was. (As one Democrat put it to me, Emanuel's desire for a quick fix helped enforce the idea that ""60 was the new 51"" in the Senate--not all his fault, but a symbol of how much liberals are willing to blame him for.) As far as progressives were concerned, he was a Rasputin, a bearer of inevitable wrongness and weakness who kept leading the czar astray. In retrospect--if we can be retrospective about something that's supposedly going to happen on Friday--the professional left would have been dishonest if it didn't blame Emanuel for the administration's shortcomings. His reputation, before this job, was built on his record at the DCCC, when he presided over the 2006 conquest of the House and the capture of 30 Republican seats. His reputation, among progressives, was as the guy who took the credit that they and their paladin, DNC Chairman Howard Dean, truly deserved. All of that is spelled out in  Herding Donkeys, reporter Ari Berman's new book about Dean's stewardship of the DNC. The magazine profiles of Emanuel are the textbook history of the Democratic comeback; Berman's book is the Howard Zinn version, the story of the people who were pushed out of the frame. In it, Emanuel is the foul-mouthed operative who tells Dean to his face that his operations in swing districts were ""fucking bullshit,"" chats to reporters about what a disaster Dean is, and remains silent for days after the 2006 election as James Carville and Stanley Greenberg claim that Dean's lousy fundraising ruined Emanuel's strategy for the midterms. The reality, as Berman points out, is less kind to both Emanuel and Dean. The top three recipients of DCCC aid, who sucked up almost $10 million, all lost. (Netroots activists were particularly angry about Christine Cegelis, an activist in Henry Hyde's Illinois district, who was battered by DCCC money in the Democratic primary. Emanuel backed candidate Tammy Duckworth, who lost the general election.) Emanuel's reputation grew as Dean faded into the background, beloved by activists, dismissed by the media. (A Republican joke in D.C. goes like this: ""Michael Steele is who we were hoping Howard Dean would be."" I.e., a gaffe-prone disaster.) Emanuel's arrival at the White House was, for progressives, an original sin. It was compounded by the way he made sure that Dean would stay outside of the White House. ""There was never any intention to hire Dean,"" says one Democrat who talked to Berman, ""and in fact there was a great deal of satisfaction in dissing him."" That, according to the professional left, just proved what they thought about Emanuel. He thought the left was so overzealous and useless that he relished in ignoring it. Proving the left wrong was synonymous with having the right policy. ""Rahm's Beltway reputation is mostly from his record in Congress, at the DCCC, and at the White House, of fighting progressives,"" says Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has pitched petition after petition, fundraising appeal after fundraising appeal, on anti-Emanuel sentiment. ""When was the last time Rahm actually bullied a Republican or corporate executive, forcing them to cave on a popular progressive issue? It's hard to think of a single time."" As Emanuel heads for the exit, he loses some of his ability to shape his legacy. Objectively, he was the chief of staff for the busiest liberal White House since LBJ; objectively, he was the chief of staff who left an administration that was weakened, unpopular, presiding over 9.6 percent unemployment, and heading for brutal election losses. After the losses come, Rahm Emanuel won't be in Washington to explain--on background, of course--that liberals blew it by asking for too much and being complacent when they didn't get it. ""His role was to win at all costs, and he was good at that job in the House,"" says Moulitsas. ""In the White House, he failed. Shit, Dems can't even pass a middle class tax cut."" So the Professional Left faces life, for the first time, without Rahm. Do they find a new foe in Robert Gibbs or Emanuel's eventual replacement? Do they hone in on the structural weaknesses that he failed to correct, like the administration's snail-paced appointments to courts and Treasury positions? And perhaps most important--or most poignant--in a Rahm-less world, with no blood feuds: Who will pay attention to them? Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/the_buck_starts_here.html	"In a recent Rolling Stone interview, President Obama tried to stir Democratic voters this way: ""People need to shake off this lethargy. People need to buck up. ... If people now want to take their ball and go home, that tells me folks weren't serious in the first place."" Insofar as a campaign strategy can be contained in a quote, it's an interesting one. But before I continue with this story, allow me to interrupt with a question. If you're a Democratic voter, what do you hear when the president says, ""Buck up""? Enter your response in the box below or in the comments section. The president must already miss his soon-to-depart Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. When people in the White House say, ""Buck up,"" they often receive Emanuel's favorite epithet in return. (Hint: The first word of the phrase rhymes with buck.) Telling people to ""buck up"" suggests they are ignorant, inattentive, or lazy. This doesn't seem a promising approach to bringing Democrats out of their fuming repose. Of course, for those who already share the president's point of view, this call will seem reasonable. For the last few weeks the president has been telling Democrats ""wake up"" to what's at stake in this election. If they don't participate, Republicans will take over. Whatever the Obama administration's deficiencies, Republican control of either or both houses of Congress will be far worse. But the president isn't preaching to the converted. He's talking directly to members of his base, who are disappointed and angry with him. They've been angered afresh by Vice President Joe Biden, who not only told them to ""buck up"" but chided Democrats for ""whining."" (Aside: When has an order to someone to ""stop whining"" made that someone less irritated?) Since the president's performance in office is at issue, the ""buck up"" call creates a second offense: It could be read to suggest that the president is blameless in causing the current lethargy. If part of the grievance is that these voters don't think they are being taken seriously or listened to, this would only seem to exacerbate that feeling. Finally, there is a kind of tautological problem: How do you persuade people to stop whining by whining about it? At best, the president is likely to lock in the existing feelings in his Democratic base. I asked the readers of the Slate Gabfest Facebook page for their responses to the president's remarks. Obama had his defenders--and some excellent translators of his message--but won no converts from the group he was addressing. He did, however, stir some anger. ""I hear a President taking no personal responsibility for producing that apathy,"" said Tim Oliver. ""As a left-of-center person, I hear: 'sit down and quit your whining,' "" wrote Gant Zky. A Democratic strategist thought the president was building a case for blame after the election: it was all the spiteful base's fault. ""Buck up"" isn't the president's only message. White House aides were pointing to the recent small-business legislation to illustrate how the president is delivering despite Republican obstruction. The president will  also be trying to rally the Democratic base in a speech to students at the University of Wisconsin late Tuesday that is likely to have the soaring, lyrical Obama campaign touch. He will argue that all they voted for in 2008 will be undone if they stay out of politics now. The speech will try to lift Democrats to the polls, whereas the ""buck up"" message seeks to push them there. Perhaps the mix of sweet and sour will be more effective than simply sour. The Republicans have faced a similar debate with Tea Party members who want purity over electoral viability. The difference with the Republicans is that GOP leaders are courting the activists, not telling them to shape up (a reversal of attention that progressives recognize). It is the establishment GOP figures who are given the counseling. After Christine O'Donnell's victory in the Republican primary in Delaware, Sarah Palin chided Karl Rove, who worried O'Donnell was unelectable. ""Well, bless his heart,"" said Palin. ""We love our friends there in the machine, the expert politicos. But my message to those who say that the GOP nominee is not electable, or that they're not even going to try, well I say, buck up!""

In the following weeks, I'll try to answer some of these questions. Feel free to weigh in with answers--or with more political questions--at  slatepolitics@gmail.com or in the comments section below. Here are this week's questions: What's the penalty for staying mum? This week, Christine O'Donnell, the Tea Party favorite who is the Republican candidate for senator in Delaware, said she was not going to do any more national interviews. Smart move. She's got a lot of work to do in Delaware, and besides, voters like it when you say they're important. There are some downsides, though. Doing no national interviews will deprive her of the national media foil. While the cable channels were obsessing over her youthful dalliance with witchcraft and canceled checks for questionable campaign expenses, she was raising a lot of money. It also means she presumably will actually put herself before the editorial boards and reporters of Delaware. When they ask reasonable questions, they'll be harder to paint as tools of the left. O'Donnell's attempt to wall off her media coverage is a part of a larger transition in political coverage. It used to be that when you had to say, ""No comment,"" you were either emerging from a courthouse or heading into one. Now lots of candidates are trying to have a closed-circuit conversation with their voters through only the media they want to talk to. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has tried, as has Gov. Jan Brewer in Arizona. All of which raises the question: Will voters penalize any candidates for avoiding the media-- or see them as heroes fighting against the media? What does a ""softer""chief of staff look like? The word on Rahm Emanuel's departure from the White House is that everyone assumes he'll leave to run for mayor of Chicago, but they haven't been told that specifically yet. So, the guessing game for who will replace him is in full swing. One thing that has come up in my conversations with people in a position to know is that Obama's next chief of staff will likely be geared toward finding ways to work with Republicans. This is obvious--there will be more Republicans in Washington than now--and they might have control of one or both houses of Congress. But what does such a person actually look like? The president has taken on Republicans recently. (A fundraising letter from the Democratic Senatorial Committee that has been sent under his name repeats a sentiment from recent speeches: ""If I said the sky was blue, these Republicans would say no way."") Members of the Democratic base like this harder line. Some would like the president to use the coming Republican strength in Washington as a way to continue showing that there is a choice between parties. If the president is looking for a deal-maker chief of staff rather than a fighter (and Emanuel was actually both), then that suggests a future of possible attempted compromises along the lines of what Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted months ago. Can Sarah Palin destroy as well as create? During the primaries Sarah Palin compiled a pretty good record endorsing candidates who won GOP contests. Now the challenge is to use her power to help those candidates in the general election, where they'll either need to pick up independent voters or build a conservative constituency so large that Palin-backed candidates don't need too many swing voters. Now comes a new question: Can she show any power or magic in defeating candidates from the other party? In a recent Facebook post, she asked followers to target 20 Democrats who voted for President Obama's health care reform legislation and who represent districts John McCain carried in 2008. She's launched a Web site with this call: ""Don't get demoralized, get organized. It's time to take a stand."" This is a new branch of the Palin brand. Will it be as successful in motivating conservatives, bewitching the media, and frightening her potential 2012 allies as her Facebook outreach has been? Can Palin organize people in new ways? Is she able to organize money and voters simply by highlighting races? Or, is she targeting races Republicans are almost certain to win so that she can receive credit for their victories once the inevitable happens and build her reputation?

Last week, I called Christine O'Donnell a ""masturbation socialist."" A chorus of political theorists--Will Wilkinson, Kevin Williamson, and now Ross Douthat--has descended on me, protesting that O'Donnell does not, in fact, advocate government control of wanking. It's heartening to see conservatives become so precise about defining socialism.

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/the_republican_spending_addiction.html	"In a speech in June, George W. Bush said his biggest disappointment as president was the failure to reform Social Security. This remark puzzled some observers, who plausibly offer the 1,500 people who died during the Katrina aftermath, or wrecking the nation's economy, as competitive alternatives. But Bush's enduring concern with Social Security speaks to a schism on the right that cannot be plastered over by the homilies of the Pledge to America released today. And that is: Everyone says that the burning political issue of this election is government spending. Opposition to spending is the scalding water that fuels the Tea Party, and so the Republicans who controlled Congress for more than half of the last decade now say that the GOP ""lost our way"" on spending during the Bush presidency. But what do Republicans plan to do about government spending that they favor, or indeed created? If they once were lost, have they now been found? If you really think that the problem with the economy and/or the federal budget is as simple as too much government spending, then you have to point your finger squarely at the national Republican Party. Of the six recent Congresses essentially controlled by the GOP, from 1995 to 2006, not one ever reduced federal outlays. (The last year in which federal outlays were lower than the year before was 1965, when Democrats ran both the White House and Congress.) As soon as Republicans controlled both Congress and the White House in 2001, spending really took off, with more than $100 billion added to federal outlays every year that Bush sat in the White House (considerably more than either Bill Clinton or Bush 41). Hence Bush's preoccupation with Social Security, basically the largest government expenditure. (Military spending is larger these days, but it is spread over different budgets.) He knows that's where the real money is spent, and he knows why it won't change. Presumably, Bush's upcoming memoir will offer more details, but in press accounts of his June speech, he said that it was resistance withinhisown party--not from Democrats--that nixed his plans to privatize Social Security. The only thing surprising about this is that Bush seems surprised about it. Incumbent Republicans love Social Security for the same reason that all incumbents do: because voters love Social Security. More than three-quarters of all American adults say they want to know that Social Security will be there when they retire, even if they feel they won't need it. That's why Republicans did nothing to stop spending on Social Security, from about $433 billion in 2001 to $586 billion in fiscal year 2007 (the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 election). If a Republican president working with a Republican-controlled Congress couldn't stop the growth of Social Security spending, there's little reason to think it will happen any other way, Tea Party or no Tea Party. And if today's Republicans have a credible plan for trimming this budget item--or even slowing it down--they're being quiet about it. The same goes for Medicare. A strong majority of Americans opposes tinkering with Medicare, and among older Americans--who are more likely to vote--opposition is 5-to-1. And so, Republicans did nothing to halt Medicare's explosion from about $217 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $372 billion in fiscal year 2007. No one thinks that, as America's population grows older, there will be any stopping the growth in these programs--and that's half the federal budget right there. Next up is defense and security, about $1 trillion a year. Maybe, just maybe, we'll get a tiny peace dividend from the end of the military mission in Iraq, but some of that will be eaten up by increased veteran benefits and services, to say nothing of Afghanistan. Both wars were started by a Republican president and supported by Republican members of Congress. Lately, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., has made some very cogent points about wasteful military spending. But they are not much different from what John McCain said through much of the '80s and '90s, and his impact on military spending has been nil.  And the fiscal year 2011 budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security--a Republican creation--is a hefty $56 billion. How much of that will Republicans cut? Crickets ... All of the above is spending that Republicans over the last 15 years or so either created, or could have cut or slowed--and never did. The relatively small portions of the federal government that the Pledge to America focuses on are almost all so-called domestic discretionary expenses, and despite Republican complaints that these expenses are ballooning, they actually got smaller, as a portion of overall spending, under Bush. Of course, that's not because they've shrunk--it's because of the huge rise in spending that Republicans approved for the military! Hence, when you look through the GOP proposals to cut spending, they are uniformly, laughably puny. A typical idea is to permit the government to hire only one new worker for every two who leave. Leaving aside the arbitrariness of the idea, its own proponents claim that it will save a whopping $35 billion--over 10 years.  They are whacking weeds at the edge of a large field where they let sacred cows get fatter. When Republicans denounce ""government spending,"" then, they're talking only about government spending that they don't like: the TARP (a Republican creation), health care reform, stimulus spending, the auto industry bailout. But the plain fiscal fact is that the national Republican Party has been addicted to its own forms of government spending at least since the Nixon administration. The very notion of taking a ""pledge"" evokes their addiction--This time it's different, we swear! Sure, the pledge tactic could have considerable short-term political traction, especially as the economy continues its anemic growth. The Republican Party has long shown it can win elections by hollering about taxing and spending. But winning elections won't solve the longer-term problem that the GOP will face from the Tea Party's embrace--which is that, unlike congressional Republicans, these people actually believe the rhetoric.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/summers_end.html	"Now that Larry Summers has announced he's leaving the Obama administration to return to Harvard, it's a good time to reflect on his tenure as head of the National Economic Council--not from the point of view of progressives or neoliberals, Wall Street, or the unemployed but from the point of view of Larry himself. I have two questions: Why did Summers take this job in the first place? And how is he feeling right now? Of course, I have no idea. I've never met the guy. But I know people familiar with his thinking, as they say, and have followed the Obama administration's economic policy pretty closely. From 1999 to 2001, Summers held one of the most powerful positions in the world: Treasury secretary of the United States. After he went back to the private sector, he had a pretty cushy life, consulting for a high-end hedge fund and as an academic. (Yes, his time as Harvard's president was controversial, but it was also comfortable.) There are three potential motivations for Summers' return to public service in 2009: Save the stimulus, save the world. It's rare that a macroeconomist gets the chance to prevent a second Great Depression. After the collapse of the financial sector in late 2008, the people advising President-Elect--and then President--Obama on the stimulus were going to have a huge effect on the future of the country. How could he turn that down? In retrospect, Summers is probably disappointed with the way this turned out. He is infamously reported to have kept the $1.2 trillion-proposal of Christina Romer, then chair of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, off the table. Instead, he pushed for an insurance-policy approach in which all the government had to do was prevent a total collapse of the economy and growth would take off on its own. Now growth is sputtering, unemployment is still very high, and the very notion of Keynesian stimulus is toxic because it wasn't carried out seriously enough to begin with. Summers Fact: Like Guns n' Roses, some people were cooler in the 1980s. In 1986, Summers wrote an influential paper about ""hysteresis"" in unemployment. He argued that unemployment, instead of returning to a mythical ""natural"" rate, could build on itself. Higher unemployment could generate more unemployment, which would push this natural rate upward. If he took his own advice to heart, he would be doing everything he could to get unemployment down right now. Save the world, save his reputation. The modern era of financial deregulation started with Jimmy Carter's ""Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act"" in 1980. But it is Larry Summers and Robert Rubin's actions toward the derivative market in the late 1990s that most people remember as the height of financial-deregulatory fever. And with good reason: Their tarring and the subsequent dismissal of Brooksley Born let civil servants know who was in charge in the relationship between Wall Street and the regulators. (As chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the late 1990s, Born argued for greater regulation of financial derivatives.) So it's possible Summers wanted to get involved with the process of reregulating Wall Street to help clear his name. But history is unlikely to grant him a rewrite.  In his second go-round as a public servant, Summers didn't appear to be involved with any of the more structural reforms of Wall Street. He instead fell in line with the Treasury approach, which gave regulators more scope and powers to resolve problematic financial firms rather than to prevent financial crises. Summers Fact: Like Sting, some people were more punk rock in the 1980s. In 1989, Summers wrote a paper arguing for a financial transaction tax titled ""When Financial Markets Work too Well: A Cautious Case for a Securities Transaction Tax."" Though this is a great solution for helping with the deficit and creating sensible brakes on the financial markets, it's a tough opinion to maintain once you start consulting for high-end hedge funds. Save his reputation, get a better job. The most sensible explanation for his return to public service is that Summers wanted to be close to the administration in order to try out for the job of chairman of the Federal Reserve. But Obama decided to renominate Ben Bernanke, who was ultimately confirmed. How would Summers have done? Bernanke's approach consists of acknowledging there is a problem, acknowledging that the Fed could be doing something about it, and then saying that the Fed will wait and see: Yes, this is my job, but maybe I'll do it later. Perhaps this excuse works at the highest level of our elite policymakers. But don't try it at home. It's possible Summers would have been more aggressive than Bernanke in using monetary policy to fight unemployment. After all, he was clearly uncomfortable using fiscal policy--that is, spending more government money--to fight our way out of the crisis. Either way, he couldn't possibly do less than Bernanke is doing now. So how will Summers think of his time in the Obama administration? Probably as one of missed opportunities, cautious misreadings, and frustration. In that sense, maybe he'll have a lot in common with the progressives who rail against him.Like Slate on  Facebook.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/punitive_dissonance.html	"Three days from today, Virginia will execute Teresa Lewis for the murders of her husband and stepson. Gov. Bob McDonnell rejected her clemency plea on Friday. Although Lewis didn't pull the trigger, the governor observed, she ""paid for the firearms"" and ""intentionally left a rear door to their home unlocked"" so that her co-conspirators could commit the murders. For this, she will die. Like other conservatives, McDonnell believes that the taking of human life, even by proxy, must be gravely punished. And like other abortion opponents, he claims that the right to life ""applies to every American--born and unborn."" Yet every day, thousands of women do to their fetuses what Lewis did to her stepson. They pay to get rid of an unwanted life, and they provide access to the victim. What punishment does McDonnell propose for these women? Absolutely nothing. Seven years ago, as a delegate to Virginia's General Assembly, McDonnell introduced legislation to outlaw partial-birth abortions. The bill's first paragraph declared: ""Any person who deliberately and intentionally performs a partial birth abortion or a dilation and extraction abortion is guilty of a Class 4 felony."" But its fifth paragraph stipulated: ""A woman upon whom [the abortion] is performed shall not be prosecuted under this section for a conspiracy to violate this section or for any other offense arising out of the performance of such procedure."" In committee, McDonnell merged his bill with a second bill, changing the name of the offense from abortion to infanticide. ""Any person who knowingly performs partial birth infanticide and thereby kills a human infant is guilty of a Class 4 felony,"" said the revised legislation. But again, it added: ""A woman upon whom [the procedure] is performed may not be prosecuted for any criminal offensearising out of the performance of such procedure."" In April 2003, that bill became Virginia law. The law prohibits ""partial birth infanticide"" and holds the doctor responsible for a Class 4 felony. But it includes the same caveat: ""The mother may not be prosecuted for any criminal offense based on the performance of any act or procedure by a physician in violation of this section."" In 2006, McDonnell became the state's attorney general. He vigorously defended the law in court, eventually prevailing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. Today, if a woman in Virginia hires a doctor to commit what the state calls ""infanticide,"" the doctor is subject to a prison term of two to 10 years. But the woman walks. The standard pro-life rationale for not prosecuting women in these cases is that women don't understand what's being done to their babies. But McDonnell has worked hard to make sure that they do understand. Nine years ago, he introduced legislation stipulating that 24 hours before an abortion, the doctor must offer the woman ""printed materials"" depicting the fetus, its ""physiological characteristics,"" and ""the methods of abortion procedures commonly employed."" Those rules were enacted in 2001 and have been Virginia law ever since. Even if a woman refuses the materials, the law requires the doctor to tell her the ""gestational age of the fetus"" and to offer ""further information concerning the procedures"" that will be used. Supporters of Teresa Lewis tried to persuade McDonnell that she, too, didn't fully understand what she was doing. They noted that she's ""just above the line of mental retardation"" and argued that during the crime she ""was numbed by the medications she was taking."" Yet she got the death penalty while the triggermen got life--exactly the opposite of McDonnell's abortion law, which punishes the forceps-wielder but not the client. McDonnell is unmoved. He holds Lewis fully responsible because she bought the guns, left her door unlocked, and doesn't meet the ""statutory definition of mentally retarded."" Had she paid for an ""infanticide"" and positioned her body to facilitate it, he would have given her a pass. Why the discrepancy? The answer is obvious: Like other pro-lifers, McDonnell doesn't really believe that fetuses have the same right to life as the rest of us. If he did, he'd hold women responsible for contract hits on their fetuses. Instead, he forbids prosecution of these women and insults our intelligence by calling their non-prosecutable offenses ""infanticide."" Any legislator, attorney general, or governor who prohibited prosecution of infanticide procurers would promptly be thrown out of office. But in the context of abortion, politicians do this routinely. And pro-lifers applaud them. If you seriously believe that killing a late-term fetus is infanticide, you should be outraged at the legal immunity guaranteed to purchasers of this crime under ""pro-life"" legislation. But regardless of your views on abortion, Virginia's double standard is plainly unjust. A state can't criminalize late-term abortion as infanticide, systematically prosecute the doctor but not the woman, and then execute a woman but not her triggermen for an arranged murder. It doesn't add up. Ordinarily, this kind of inconsistency can be addressed in the course of time. But Lewis has no time. Is killing by proxy a noncrime or a capital offense? Gov. McDonnell, you have three days to sort this out.

In the following weeks, I'll try to answer some of these questions. Feel free to weigh in with answers--or with more political questions--at  slatepolitics@gmail.com  or in the comments section below. Here are this week's questions: Are voters confused? For a while now, there has been a seeming disconnect in the polls. In the most recent CBS News poll we see it again, more voters say they have an unfavorable view of Republicans (58 percent) than of Democrats (56 percent), and more disapprove of GOP policies (68 percent) than of Democratic ones (58 percent). On key questions about the economy, they also like Democratic policies better than Republican policies. For example, when CBS asked which party was better at helping small business, respondents preferred the Democrats 49 percent to 41 percent. Asked about creating new jobs the response was 44 percent to 38 percent in favor of Democrats. Yet when you ask people if they will be voting for the Republican over the Democrat, they say yes. The margin is only two points (40 percent to 38 percent), but given those other numbers, wouldn't you expect people to favor Democrats? I am in search of explanations and analogies. Campaign strategists from both parties tell me this disconnect is a sign that voters want not some radical shift but a brake on the Democrats in Congress. One Democratic strategist, for example, suggested that a Republican could run an ad with this tag line: ""I'm OK with the president, and when he's right I'll support him. But sometimes he and the Democrats in Congress just go too far and spend too much."" Pollsters offer a few theories. The first is that the generic ballot question--which asks people whether they would prefer the Republican or the Democrat--is wacky, sometimes showing parity between the parties, other times showing a big Republican advantage. The main argument I hear is that the economy so irritates people they want to punish the people in Washington. They want to try a different route--any route--even if that route leads them down a path they say they don't want. That desire overwhelms their other views about parties or the specific policies of those parties. So for the moment I've settled on this analogy: You're a long-haul trucker on the highway, and you're hungry. You wish you'd eaten a good healthy meal, but those are time-consuming and expensive. You see a choice at the next exit: McDonald's or Burger King. You're not thrilled about either, but in general you prefer McDonald's to Burger King and, if asked, you'd probably agree that you like every comparable menu item (fries, burger, drink, Happy Meal toy) better at McDonald's than at Burger King. But you've eaten at McDonald's for eight straight days. So, you go to Burger King. Is it time to start declaring races over? With just more than seven weeks to go until Election Day, we're going to start seeing races move out of reach for certain candidates. The two parties will stop spending money on their advertising and organizing in some districts so that those resources can be used in other races. For a while, we've been in a twilight period where a candidate appears to be a lost cause yet national party leaders make robust claims that they haven't given up. Most of the triage has happened on the Democratic side because this is a bad year for Democrats. (Though John Hickenlooper in the Colorado governor's race is a Democratic race that seems over.) It looks like the Democrats are going to have to start making some tough choices in Ohio. John Kasich, the Republican candidate for governor, is up over his Democratic challenger by 10 points in an average of the polls. Rob Portman, the Republican candidate for Senate, is up over his challenger by the same amount. In a recent Quinnipiac poll, both men were up by almost 20. I asked a Democratic official involved in the Senate race if it was over. This is someone who could make you believe the Washington Nationals still have a chance to win the pennant. ""It's over,"" is what I got. The Florida Senate race might be heading into the win category for the GOP too. Republican strategists involved in that race, some of whom are sympathetic to independent candidate and current Gov. Charlie Crist, said that after the Democrats held their primary, Republican candidate Marco Rubio would start to take off. Democrats who had flirted with Crist would leave him for the official party nominee, Kendrick Meek. That may be what's  happening. In July and early August, Crist was up in the polls. Since the late August Democratic primary, Rubio has been ahead. He now leads by 10 points in the average of the polls. How much ridicule can one candidate take?  During my reporting about Christine O'Donnell's victory in Delaware, I was reminded of the early days after Sharron Angle's victory in Nevada. Democrats were happy to have an extreme candidate who wanted to phase out Social Security (she now favors privatization), abolish the Department of Education, and flirted with calling for armed resistance. But since mid-July, Angle has stayed even with Harry Reid. Why hasn't she fallen through the basement? Does this tell us anything about what will happen to O'Donnell? Yes and no. Angle did fall quite a bit after her introduction to voters in early June, and she's not rising. The reason Reid is not ahead is that he is not well-liked and represents an unpopular party. But Delaware, if I may be allowed to state the obvious, is not Nevada. The electorate leans toward the Democrats, and the Democratic candidate Chris Coons is nowhere near as damaged as Reid. But what we can say, perhaps, about Delaware is that with an enthusiastic conservative base and Democrats who are less than thrilled with their candidate, there's only so far a Republican nominee can fall--no matter how many of her gaffes and blunders are posted on YouTube.

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/toppled_castle.html	"As Democratic and Republican leaders fret, we don't know yet which party will be hurt more come November by the rise of the Tea Party. But there is already one sure casualty this conservative revolution: federal elections reform. Tuesday's defeat of Delaware Rep. Mike Castle, in his Republican primary Senate race against Tea Party candidate Christine O'Donnell, spells doom for campaign finance bills in the next Congress. And the defeat of Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, who lost to Rand Paul in Kentucky's Republican Senate primary in May, could jeopardize the chance for a desperately needed federal fix for how we run our elections. Campaign finance reform has long been a  signature issue for Castle: He was one of only two House Republicans to vote for the DISCLOSE Act, which, among other things, would require effective disclosure of the steady flow of corporate and union election spending unleashed by the Supreme Court's decision earlier this year in Citizens United v. FEC. If Castle had moved to the Senate, he likely would have led on this issue and provided cover for some of his more skittish Republican counterparts. Maybe he could have persuaded them to vote with him on a more modest disclosure bill than the current version of the DISCLOSE Act, to which Democrats had added new corporate spending limits. Castle also was an important supporter of a bill that aims to fix our broken system of public financing of presidential elections. With Castle gone, the chances for campaign finance go from slim to perhaps none in January. Sen. John McCain, in his move to the right to win re-election in Arizona, has given up the reform mantle. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, moderates on other issues, have not been willing to spend their political capital on this one. Neither has Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, despite intense lobbying from reform advocates. Trey Grayson, the outgoing secretary of state in Kentucky, was a nationally respected bipartisan leader on election reform issues. He co-authored an important op-ed with Missouri Democratic Secretary of State Robin Carnahan calling on Congress to modernize the voter registration process to make it easier for people to register to vote and to eliminate voter registration fraud (a big issue in the 2008 campaign). Grayson had testified in Congress about these problems and was not afraid to cross the aisle to work on them. Neither Rand Paul nor any other Republican candidate for Senate--nor any sitting senator--has Grayson's comparable expertise and experience. Meanwhile, New York's primary election Tuesday verged on chaos because of what New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called a ""royal screw-up"" in rolling out new voting machines. The New York meltdown led Ohio State University law professor Ned Foley to ponder, nearly 10 years after the Florida meltdown and Bush v. Gore, whether it is possible for election administrators to be both nonpartisan and competent. It is clear that there is still much work to be done to make the basic casting and counting of ballots go smoothly. Congress made a bit of progress in recent years, by funding new voting technology and tightening the process for casting overseas and military ballots. But even this latest fix is now mired in controversy, as conservatives claim that the Obama Department of Justice is giving too many states waivers from the new requirements in an effort to suppress (presumably Republican) military ballots. Meanwhile, the DoJ inspector general has announced an investigation into how the DoJ enforces voting rights rules, based on complaints from congressional Republicans about a controversy over whether the department failed to adequately prosecute a case against the New Black Panthers for intimidating voters in Philadelphia during the 2008 election. This, of course, follows years of Democratic criticism of how the Bush administration ran the DoJ. The bottom line is that it when it comes to election reform, it doesn't really matter whether the Democrats keep the House in November. Without moderates like Castle and Grayson, they will not have the votes to overcome a Senate filibuster and get cracking. This is one of those issues to which few people pay attention until the machines break and the chads hang, or a secretly funded ""Swift boat"" attack launches, and then everyone wonders why we're still in a mess. It is going to take hard work and bipartisanship to fix our elections. Both just got a whole lot tougher to come by. Like  Slate  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."	The real loser in the Tea Party wins is election reform.
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/fussy_hysterical_winesipping_pols.html	"Last month, former Republican National Committee chairman Kenneth Mehlman came out of the closet, saying he'd taken 43 years to get comfortable with this part of himself. ""Encouraging adults who love each other and who want to make a lifelong commitment to each other to get married"" is consistent with GOP policy, he added. In a better world, conservatives would see the light, beg for forgiveness, and declare that gay-baiting was no longer a legitimate strategy for either party. But the fact is that gay-baiting, whether fine-tuned to the point of near-subliminality or outrageously transparent, continues to fit comfortably into the modern political discourse. Generally, gay-baiting is the linguistic practice of publicly insinuating, with little or no evidence, that a rival might be gay, without ever using the word ""gay"" or homosexual."" Successful euphemistic smears include ""San Francisco,"" ""weak,"" or even ""hairdresser."" The practice has been around since before the Revolutionary War, and recycles the same tropes. In 2010, of course, the difference should be that it's no longer a damning insinuation. Out gay politicians are members of congress and mayors of major American cities; Don't Ask, Don't Tell is on the way out, with the approval of 57 percent of the population; gay couples across the country raise adopted and biological children; and legal gay marriage is an imminent possibility. And yet the bait goes on. Baiting succeeds because it relies on the kind of bad joke in which many people still take guilty or not-so-guilty pleasure, prompting the defense that critics just need to lighten up. Just last week in Delaware, in the lead-up to Tuesday's GOP primary, consultants employed until recently by Tea Partier and Mama Grizzly Christine O'Donnell ran a television ad in which an announcer asks a person onscreen about O'Donnell's opponent's sexuality: ""Isn't Mike Castle cheating on his wife with a man?"" The person onscreen replies with a knowing laugh, ""That's the rumor."" Huh? Is this a joke? What rumor? As underhanded campaign tactics go, baiting carries almost no consequences for the baiter; he or she can claim ignorance of anything but the literal meaning of the words being used to insinuate something very different. Baiting is adaptable to a wide variety of media--speeches, off-the-cuff comments, press releases, political ads. And given the Internet, it's more spreadable than ever. The most salacious or absurd baits easily go viral, often helped along by blog posts from people honestly decrying it. In Mehlman's case, a reporter broke through this annoying cycle of rumors by just asking the man, and then pressed him until he came out and answered. Maybe this can become the future model: Combat the subtle and devious art of gay-baiting by just bluntly asking every time a bait is laid. It wouldn't hurt, either, for closeted gay politicians who vote against gay rights to come out of the closet while still in office and start voting for LGBT equality. And so, without further ado, Slate's taxonomy of American political gay-baits. The EuphemismsA perfect baiting euphemism is many steps removed from the realm of sexual orientation and merely relies on certain preexisting association in the public's mind. In the past people used terms with sexual meaning--pervert or sexual deviant, for example. This generation has a new set of phrases, most notably, ""San Francisco,"" ""wine drinker,"" and even ""renter"" rather than homeowner. This television ad run by Republican incumbent Sam Graves against Democrat challenger Kay Barnes in the 2008 Missouri 6th District congressional race is a classic, so packed with gay stereotypes that it could be mistaken for a parody of gay-baiting.""In San Francisco,"" sneers the announcer, ""Nancy Pelosi is throwing  ... a ritzy California fundraiser celebrating [Kay] Barnes' San Francisco values."" One of the newer euphemisms to emerge is the ""renter."" In the 2008 race for Minnesota's 3rd District House seat, Republican Erik Paulsen's campaign repeatedly questioned Democrat Ashwin Madia's ""lifestyle,"" a term frequently used by social conservatives in lieu of ""sexual orientation."" (""Lifestyle"" implies there's a choice to the matter.) One specific the Paulsen campaign did cite was the fact that Madia  had ""never, never even owned a home."" The subtext is not just that Madia didn't pay homeowner taxes. A renter is a transient, unwilling to settle down, promiscuous when it comes to real estate and, the campaign implied, who knows what else. The Aggressive MetaphorThe classic of this category is the memo the Republican National Committee under Lee Atwater sent around in 1991. Titled ""Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet,"" it compared the rising Speaker of the House's voting record to that of out gay congressman Barney Frank's. The slur met with criticism in almost every quarter, yet Foley, who had been married for 20 years at the time, felt he had no choice but to address the charges on national television, ""I am, of course, not a homosexual,"" and deny them before his fellow Democrats, to the reported embarrassment of all involved. Atwater, by then an acknowledged smear-master, initially claimed that there was nothing untoward about the title of the Foley memo, then added that he hadn't seen the document before it went out and fired his communications director. Weak and WhinyOne way to suggest a man is gay is to play to the notion that a man with a soft voice, touch, or walk is weak, and that weak men are gay. South Carolina Democratic party chairman Dick Harpootlian famously commented in 2001 that Republican Lindsey Graham, then a candidate for Strom Thurmond's U.S. Senate seat, was ""a little too light in the loafers"" to fill the shoes of his predecessor. Though ""light in the loafers"" is one of the most tired gay euphemisms there is, Harpootlian claimed he was unaware that his remark about Graham's loafers had gay connotations, to which journalist Greg Hambrick responded in the Charleston City Paper, ""Apparently he didn't know what too thick in the head meant either."" During the  2005 Virginia governor's race, a local paper described Republican Jerry Kilgore's voice as a ""Ned Flanders meets Mr. Rogers' whine."" In other words, the guy's voice sounds gay. Then an ad for then-candidate and ultimately Governor Tim Kaine, a Democrat, called Kilgore ""too weak to lead Virginia"" and included the line, ""Jerry Kilgore is not being straight."" In the 2010 midterm elections, the Mama Grizzlies have deployed the weak bait with gusto. Karen Handel, a candidate in the Georgia GOP's gubernatorial primary, informed her opponent that it was ""time to put the big boy pants on."" This year, gearing up for midterm elections, Sarah Palin used this bait on Obama, stating on Fox News Sunday that, unlike Arizona governor Jan Brewer, a woman has bigger cojones than the president when it comes to dealing with illegal immigration. Like a WomanAnother way to suggest that a male politician is sexually attracted to other men is to liken him to a woman. Massachusetts Bay colonists mocked British customs officials by questioning their masculinity. John McCain's 2008 campaign once called Obama ""fussy"" and ""hysterical,"" and in an ad compared him to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. Maureen Dowd, who trots out this bait all too often, referred to then-candidate Obama as ""a diffident debutante,"" and an obsessive ""starlet"" with a ""feminine management style."" She had competition from Tucker Carlson, who once suggested Obama's effeminacy was obvious in the then-candidate's  book-club attendance--anti-intellectualism is implicit in the Effete Elite bait. Blogger John Aravosis summed-up the Like a Woman bait when he wrote of the Obama smears, he ""is prone to hysteria, and reminds you of ditzy blonde chicks. Sorry, but that's a stereotypical gay guy."" French Among the sillier cases of baiting in recent history is the attention journalists and right-wing pundits paid in 2004 to John Kerry's Francophilia. Men's rights site mensnewsdaily.com titled an article, ""Men Are From Mars, John Kerry Is From Paris."" Rush Limbaugh repeatedly referred to Kerry as ""Monsieur Kerry"" and ""Jean Cheri,"" writing Kerry off both figuratively (calling up some Americans' notion that French men have innate homosexual leanings) and literally (Jean Cheri translates to ""Dear John""). The New York Times may have helped spread the smear by quoting an unnamed GOP source saying that Kerry ""looked French,"" a play on Kerry's French relatives and Swiss boarding-school education. The conceit worked well with the GOP's 2004 strategy to distinguish itself, the party of manly men, from the party of liberal flip-floppers. When the New York Times covered it yet again, Roger Cohen further added to the image of Kerry's effeminacy by quoting a Republican National Committee spokeswoman noting Kerry's ""fondness for brie and Evian."" The Democratic VersionThe right is not always the source of homophobic messaging. Gay-baiting has a long bipartisan history. Despite the fact that most LGBT votes and campaign contributions--fondly known as the GayTM--go to Democrats, Democratic pols engage in gay-baiting almost as often as their Republican counterparts, and their baits can be far more diabolical. Take, for instance, the 2002 U.S. Senate race in Montana between Democrat incumbent Max Baucus and Republican challenger Mike Taylor. The Montana Democratic Party sponsored an ad showing Taylor, who owned a hair salon in the 1980s, applying lather to a man's face as part of a shaving demonstration. The ad concludes, ""That's not how we do business here in Montana."" In the face of this betrayal by their supposed representatives, LGBT advocates often are reluctant to protest, not wanting to hurt the Democratic candidate's chances. If the Republican victim protests--Taylor called the implications ""loathsome""--critics turn his objections back on him. Why is looking gay ""despicable""? Taylor was asked. He quickly withdrew from the race, after rephrasing his objection to completely sidestep the true meaning of the ad. ""Are they saying someone from my field in not qualified to be senator?"" he asked. LifestyleAt least since the 19th century, opponents, journalists, and others have called attention to certain male political figures' aristocratic upbringing and manners, their Ivy League or equivalent educations, and their epicurean tastes--also associated with gay men. The goal of this bait isn't necessarily to make voters believe the target is gay, only to make them think he possesses negative, stereotypically gay male qualities. In the 1840s, supporters of Whig presidential candidate William Henry Harrison described incumbent Democratic president Martin Van Buren as ""luxury-loving."" Boston's pro-Whig Atlas described Van Buren as a ""dandy"" in ""nicely plaited ruffles,"" who was ""leading off a minuet"" while Harrison fought the War of 1812. The Harrison slogan ""Van Van, you're a used-up man,"" suggested squandered masculinity--whether on frivolous pursuits or fellow men was left to the imagination. All of which bears a striking similarity to the ad all but one of Texas' major newspapers ran three weeks ago calling incumbent Republican governor Rick Perry a coward. Funded by Back to Basics, a political action committee formed by Texas Democrats this year, the ad describes the governor, ""When he's not in San Francisco ... Perry's ... flipping through the pages of his Food and Wine magazine ... in his fancy ... rental mansion."" This bait sticks not just because it is blatantly coded--""San Francisco,"" ""Food and Wine,"" ""fancy,""--or because it could also be cross-listed under ""weak"" and ""effeminate"" (the ad concludes, ""Tell Rick Perry to stop cowering and face Texans like a man"")--but because it refreshes public memory of the already existing, unsubstantiated rumors that Perry is gay. In 2004 the Austin Chronicle's Michael King reported the rumors in a way that both did and didn't discredit them, describing them as based on ""no evidence ... whatsoever"" but ""extraordinary in their baroque detail and remarkable persistence."" LGBT rights organizations didn't object, probably because they are so eager to see a Democrat in office, especially given the Texas Democratic Party's recent revision of its platform to explicitly support ""repeal of discriminatory laws and policies against members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community."" All the Single LadiesAlso known as the sporty/brainy-ladies-with-short-haircuts-and-no-kiddos bait. If a single woman rises to power in politics, her sexual orientation is assumed to be fodder for the rumor mill. Discussing Janet Napolitano on her nighttime talk show, Joy Behar of TheView asked two gay male guests, ""Isn't she gay?"" In 2009, the New York Times Magazine came as close as it ever has to asking a politician directly whether she's gay when Deborah Solomon put to Napolitano this nonquestion: ""Men don't know what to make of women who choose to be single. Rumors of lesbianism have dogged women in politics like you, Condoleezza Rice and Ann Richards,"" thereby re-baiting both Rice and the late Texas governor. Napolitano in return gave a nonanswer: ""I think the more people get to know a person, the less that becomes an issue."" Certain tropes--athletics, pant-suits, glasses, for instance--really help get a single-lady bait off the ground, and even the most dignified news organizations often can't resist playing along. The Wall Street Journal decided to announce Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation proceedings alongside a photo of Kagan in her softball-playing days on its front page, and throughout the 1990s, Janet Reno's size and outdoorsiness were fodder for jokes around Washington and, of course, on Saturday Night Live. Journalist Michael Lacey once led a piece with the statement, ""If Janet Napolitano isn't a lesbian, I'll eat your hat. She is a walking, one-woman LPGA tour."" Media outlets ran articles on Rice's hardcore workout regimen. (The Rice rumor was also a spectacular example of the media re-laying the bait. The Times of London concluded its piece on the rumor with this bit of gossip from a washingtonpost.com commenter, ""It is widely believed in gay circles that Condi is a lesbian."") Unruly WifeThis rumor insinuates that a political wife who refuses to allow her ambitions to be overwhelmed by her husband's--who in this sense acts like a single lady--must be a lesbian. Hillary Clinton has been a victim of this bait throughout her career. The same Christian Action Network ad that announced the rumor of her lesbianism also announced, ""It is rumored that Hillary Clinton will leave her husband upon taking office."" The ploy, however, is age-old. For an example, look to our friends the French. Compared with Clinton's, Marie Antoinette's behavior was proto-Gaga in its shock value, and the rumors about France's last queen were equally salacious. While M.A. wore the crown, anti-royalists circulated pornographic pamphlets suggesting that she conducted lesbian and bisexual orgies at court. Here's an excerpt:"	A history of political gay-baiting.
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/rotten_at_the_core.html	"It's tempting to skip over the recent news stories about fighting corruption in Afghanistan. (""Of course there's corruption,"" you might have muttered while turning the page.) But resist the urge; go back and read them. They're just as important as the stories about fighting the Taliban in Kandahar--maybe more so. In a counterinsurgency war, such as the one we're waging in Afghanistan, the legitimacy of the host government, in the eyes of its own people, is key to the prospects for success. And legitimacy is nearly unachievable if the government is blatantly corrupt. The Obama administration is now debating what to do about the blatant corruption of Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai. All the players recognize the connection between the war on corruption and the war against the Taliban--and the former's crucial effect on the latter. Last September, in hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked why the Taliban were doing so well despite the U.S. military's vastly larger forces. The problem, Mullen replied, is ""clearly the lack of legitimacy of the [Afghan] government."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked, ""We could send a million troops, and that wouldn't restore legitimacy in the government?"" Mullen replied, ""That is correct."" Around the same time, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, then the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, wrote in a secret 66-page memo (which was leaked to the Washington Post's Bob Woodward) that the aim of a counterinsurgency strategy is to ""provide for the needs of the population by, with, and through the Afghan government."" A ""responsible and accountable government,"" which the Afghan people ""find acceptable,"" was just as important as a secure environment. However, McChrystal went on, ""widespread corruption by various officials ... has given Afghans little reason to support the government,"" a condition that sows ""fertile ground for the insurgency."" Maj. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the senior U.S. military intelligence officer in Afghanistan, made the same point to Dexter Filkins of the New York Times: ""If we are going to conduct a population-centric strategy in Afghanistan, and we are perceived as backing thugs, then we are just undermining ourselves."" That was the subject of a Sept. 13 meeting between President Barack Obama and several high-ranking officials from the Pentagon, the State Department, the Justice Department, and the CIA: How to pressure Karzai to crack down on corruption and thus wipe away the perception that we're ""backing thugs."" The problem is that Karzai and his cronies are, in many cases, at the center of the corruption. Earlier in the year, the reform drive seemed to be moving forward; the Obama administration was funding a massive anti-corruption program and training a cadre of Afghan investigators. Then, this summer, their wiretaps caught one of Karzai's top aides, Mohammed Zia Salehi, soliciting bribes. He was arrested and thrown in jail--but then released under orders from Karzai. The New York Times' Mark Mazzetti and Rod Nordland report in today's paper that since that summer scandal, progress in several other corruption cases has screeched to a standstill. Here's the dilemma: Crack down on Karzai too hard, and he'll scream, storm off, and issue threats under fear that his sovereignty is being threatened. But go too easy on Karzai, let him solve the problem in his own way at his own pace, and his regime will look even more unaccountable and illegitimate. Another way to put it: Escalate tensions between Washington and Kabul, and risk alienating Karzai to the point that he doesn't cooperate fully in the war against the Taliban. Or ease tensions, and let Karzai run his own affairs to the point that the Afghan people distrust him still further--and thus undermine the war against the Taliban. Either way, things look bad. Obama has directed his aides to develop guidelines that, as the Times reports, might ""isolate the corruption that fuels anger among Afghans and drives many of them into the ranks of the insurgency, as opposed to the more routine kickbacks and bribes that grease the Afghan political system."" It's a nice concept in theory, but, as the Times further notes, ""Such distinctions could be difficult to draw."" The same officials, some of them very high up, are involved in both categories of corruption. There was a time, around last year's presidential election, when Obama officials, fed up with Karzai's evasions and malfeasance, considered dropping him and throwing their support to an opposition candidate. The discussion intensified when a flood of evidence revealed that the election, which Karzai ""won,"" was fixed. U.S. emissaries convinced Karzai to hold a run-off election, but then the runner-up dropped out. At that point, we were stuck with Karzai; there was no alternative. This past May, Obama ordered his aides to stop their bickering on the issue and to start treating the Afghan president with respect; maybe that would spur him to action on corruption. It did seem to spur him, but only for a while and only up to a point. So what to do now? Is there anything we can do? And if not, is counterinsurgency still a viable strategy for Afghanistan? The answer depends, in part, on how long we're planning to stay there in large numbers. John Nagl, who helped write the Army's field manual on counterinsurgency and is now president of the Center for a New American Security (a Washington think tank that some call Counterinsurgency Central), says we're going to keep troops in Afghanistan ""for a long time,"" increasingly in an advisory role but still sizable and active enough to prod Karzai, gently but strategically, to do the right thing. Therefore, it's worth sticking with the policy. However, Andrew Exum, a former special-operations officer and now a scholar at Nagl's think tank, wrote this week in his ""Abu Muqawama"" blog that, though anti-corruption efforts play a central role in counterinsurgency campaigns, ""the reality is that we are trying to leave Afghanistan."" So ""trying to target corruption in Afghanistan is, like counter-narcotics, the very definition of mission creep."" As an alternative, Exum proposed, ""Let's just train up the Afghan National Security Forces and transition to a security force assistance-type mission as soon as humanly possible ... unless we plan on retaining a very strong presence in Afghanistan well past June 2011."" July 2011, of course, is when President Obama has said he will begin to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan. He has recently stressed that the extent and pace of this withdrawal will be determined by ""conditions on the ground."" But, though nobody has put it in these terms, those conditions should include the political conditions in Kabul as well as the strictly military conditions in, say, the villages and mountainous borderlands further south. For now, Karzai seems to think that the United States has a bigger stake in the war's success than he does and, therefore, that he's the one with the leverage in this relationship. The Obama administration's challenge is to convince Karzai that if he doesn't clean up his act, he really will pay a price--we really might leave or, short of that, funnel arms, money, and other resources to provincial chiefs whose elevation would pose a challenge to Karzai's authority. This is easier said than done, and carries its own risks for Afghanistan's stability.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/newt_is_nuts.html	"The release of a new book by Dinesh D'Souza prompts a perennial question: Why do people keep publishing books by Dinesh D'Souza? There's a simple answer. Newt Gingrich provided it to me and National Review's Robert Costa on Saturday night. After the premiere of his documentary America at Risk, Gingrich mused about the brilliance of D'Souza's Forbes magazine cover story about the ""roots of Obama's rage,"" based on his upcoming book with that title. The roots, according to D'Souza, were in mid-1960s, Marxist-inspired, Kenyan anti-colonialism. Gingrich repeated those words--""Kenyan, anti-colonial""--and called the article ""brilliant."" ""I'm going to actually get it, post it, and send to people regularly,"" said Gingrich. ""It's the most interesting insight. You guys,"" he said, nodding at Costa, ""might want to do a conference on it, unless AEI does it."" Getting Newt Gingrich to endorse your article is, in the year 2010, a nuclear trigger. Within a few hours, Gingrich was condemned by every Democrat with blogging software. The D'Souza thesis became the latest conservative idea denounced by Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman who likes to defuse grenades by jumping on top of them. And that's the answer to the ""Why publish D'Souza?"" question. It should be obvious by now that there is literally no conservative argument too ""crazy"" to be obsessed over by liberals. Every time a new one surfaces, they try to run it out of the mainstream by drawing extra attention to it. In 2008, Obama campaign's strategy was to refuse to comment on rumors or conspiracy talk--until the campaign launched a Web site in June devoted to debunking all of it. In 2010, the Democratic strategy is to freak out, all the time, about everything. It's not going so well, but that's largely because the economy isn't going so well, either. Still, it's jarring to see D'Souza making the latest attack. His book, The Roots of Obama's Rage, is a mess. His most memorable previous books were messes, too. Every time he publishes a new mess, it gets the full Pastor Jones treatment in the respectable press. That's had basically no effect on his ability to get published or his ability to get onto the stage at conservative conferences. But it is good for liberals. D'Souza was the first modern conservative author to discover--the hard way--that if you want to be a pundit, there is no downside to making a reprehensible argument. The downside comes for the people who may agree with your politics but not your argument. The start of the D'Souza phenomenon came in 1995, when he published  The End of Racism. Written to ride the wave of books and articles that called for white America to get over its racial guilt, it included lines like the ""American slave was treated like property, which is to say, pretty well."" It was so sloppy and unconvincing that it killed the genre for a few years; it's a 700-page doorstop by a one-time AEI scholar that no one cites today. The next D'Souza implosion came in 2007, with the publication of another book that killed its genre. The Enemy at Home consisted of an argument that the ""left"" was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. That was an irresistible hook for a publisher, especially after the public had turned on the Bush administration and the war on terror. But D'Souza made such a hash out of it that the people who had danced around the left-and-9/11 idea realized how deeply stupid it was. Victor Davis Hanson joined the mob and pointed out, as politely as he could, that D'Souza's enemies list was ""nonsensical."" So The Roots of Obama's Rage is D'Souza's third pseudo-academic swing for the fences. In the book, and in the Forbes article that Gingrich plans to spread far and wide, he strikes out. D'Souza's point is that Obama's  Dreams From My Father and his father's 1965 report on socialism tell us all we need to know about why his love for America is a little limp, but he pads out the book and the article with a lot of meandering and dross about how he came to this conclusion. As in The End of Racism, he performs a pre-emptive ad hominem rebuttal to critics. ""I'm a native of Mumbai, India,"" D'Souza writes in the new book, ""so I grew up in a different part of the world, as Obama did. I'm nonwhite, as he is. He had a white mom and grew up in an inter-racial family."" (In 1995, he wrote: ""I feel especially qualified to address the subject of multiculturalism because I am a kind of walking embodiment of it. I was born in Bombay, India in 1961."") This is the literary equivalent of putting on eyeglasses so a bully won't hit you. Well, the hits are deserved. D'Souza admits to readers that this is his third crack at a Grand Unifying Theory of Obama, after a Hobbesian take he called ""Obama's Leviathan"" and an argument that ""Obama got his big government philosophy from the civil rights era."" Only after seeing Obama give a definition of ""American exceptionalism"" that didn't sound right did D'Souza go back to Obama's books and realize that the president was cribbing his politics from 1960s Marxist and anti-colonial theory. ""This is intellectual terrain I know well,"" he writes. Obama ""demonizes his predecessor and his opponents,"" according to D'Souza, because he looks to former Kenyan Prime Minister and President Jomo Kenyatta as an inspiration. That creates a mystery about why George W. Bush criticized Bill Clinton or Clinton criticized Bush's father, but never mind: D'Souza's rolling. D'Souza looks at Obama's 2008 campaign and sees ""social and cultural whitening"" and the ""triumph of lactification,"" a word he invents to describe said whitening. While everyone else read Dreams From My Father and saw Obama burning with disappointment in Barack Sr., D'Souza sees a man burning with ""hatred derived from the debris of the anti-colonial wars."" Even the title of Obama's book becomes ominous, when D'Souza takes his third crack at analyzing it: ""[T]here have been cases of men who are so preoccupied with their dark dreams that they have difficulty adjusting to contemporary reality. The dream, as it were, becomes a time machine."" Read this book, or the version mystifyingly splashed on the cover of Forbes, and you have to think that D'Souza has ruined a very fun game for conservatives. He's taken a not-so-subtle political trick--the intimation that Obama must be hiding something about his past, something that reveals why he's been such a left-wing president--and made it much more difficult. That's because the quest to find anti-colonial sentiment in Obama's biography reminds us that, in fact, Obama has never tried to cover up this part of his past. If he had, the first lines of his star-making 2004 DNC speech screwed that up. ""My father was a foreign student,"" said Obama, ""born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father--my grandfather--was a cook, a domestic servant to the British."" There's nothing in that speech about Obama Sr.'s 1965 musing about confiscatory taxes, but here's the man making his national political debut by hinting at the ""source of his rage"":  colonialism. He seemed to have gotten over it. And if pulling that one quote from this speech to make a point seems cheap, it's less of a stretch then poring over, literally, a few dozen pages of a best-selling memoir to argue that the man who favored a smaller stimulus than Paul Krugman and a wider war in Afghanistan than Joe Biden is a closet Mau Mau. What will be the impact of D'Souza's book? If 1995 and 2007 repeat themselves, Gingrich will be the exception--people in the rest of the movement will realize just how tissue-thin this research is. If they realize that, they may then look askance at Glenn Beck's search for similar evidence of Obama's radical history. They may even question the wisdom of questioning Obama's birthplace. Could the search for some skeleton key in Obama's past be a distraction? It could be! If it were a book, it could be called the The End of Birtherism. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/the_weekend_of_magical_thinking.html	"If Republicans win the midterm elections in a rout, it will be because of people like Brian Hegarty. In January, he appeared on Fox and Friends to talk about a town hall meeting where he asked Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., how Holt could support the Affordable Care Act since it ""violated the Constitution."" Not long after that he lost his job as a carpenter, which may or may not have had something to do with what his union thought of the TV appearance. ""I can sure as hell attest to the fact that they weren't happy,"" said Hegarty. I learned of Hegarty's fate this weekend in the lower level ballroom of the Mayflower Hotel, where he was attending the first-ever conference of the Faith and Freedom Coalition--a new conservative action network launched by former Christian Coalition strategist Ralph Reed. Hegarty was one of 50 people who'd traveled by bus to the conference from New Jersey to hoot and cheer when Anna Little, the Republican candidate in New Jersey's 6th district, gave her speech. Afterward, he was going to climb back onto the bus and go to the rally against the ""Ground Zero mosque"" in New York City. ""We don't assimilate to every subculture that comes across the border,"" said Hegarty, explaining why he was going to New York. ""They're supposed to come here and assimilate to our Constitution, our laws, and our customs."" The next day, he would bus back down to Washington and attend the second annual Taxpayer March on Washington run by FreedomWorks. Would that be a distraction from the work of electing Anna Little? Hell no, he said. He was going right back to work. ""The Republicans are gonna win the House,"" he said. ""It's a done deal. We just need to do what we said we were gonna do."" As I talked to Hegarty in the short hall next to the main ballroom, Ralph Reed walked back and forth, talking to speakers and reporters, greeting many by name. Hegarty proved what Reed was telling them--there was a possible landslide in the making, and districts no one thought would be on the map, like New Jersey's 6th, were worth fighting for. Reed told the overflowing room that Republicans had a chance to ""change the electorate."" He remembered his own experience, seeing Florida senatorial candidate Marco Rubio speak when polls showed him getting buried in the Republican primary by Charlie Crist. ""I remember thinking to myself this guy is so fantastic, it's just unfortunate that he can't win,"" said Reed. ""But I wrote him a check anyway. When you have people thinking like that--I don't care if he or she wins or not, I want to give them money--get ready to put on a gown or a tuxedo, because you're going to a victory party. That's how it works. You run people who the pundits and the prognosticators and the pollsters don't think can win. They can make contact with the voters, and the voters get excited."" Reed's conference was not an attempt to energize conservative activists. It was only the latest attempt--one of several this weekend--to try to capture or direct some of the boundless energy of those activists. Since the start of the Tea Party movement in February 2009, they have evolved from fear to resolve to a sort of steely-eyed giddiness in the countdown to the midterms. They now believe they can win everything. If they don't believe that, a Republican strategist will tell them they can. At Reed's event, the positive reinforcement came from pollsters, candidates, and pundits who people recognized from Fox News. Dick Morris, whose fall from grace 14 years ago was not lurid enough to deny him access to a family-friendly conference, appeared via a recorded video with champagne wishes of massive Republican gains of 60-odd House seats and at least 10 Senate seats. ""I   wouldn't rule out the possibility of defeating Kirsten Gillibrand * in New York,"" said Morris, ""or Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut, or Ron Wyden in Oregon, which would bring us up to 54 or 55 seats ... but these are not written in stone. These are just polling numbers. You need to make these happen by working in those districts and making it happen."" A happy crowd that swelled to more than 500 people over the course of two days devoured all of this news. In breakout sessions, audience members occasionally expressed doubt and worry that their local candidates would lose to Democrats. They were told what they were getting wrong by strategists who are figuring out ways to maximize Tea Party turnout and liking what they see. (This event was scheduled for the 9/11 weekend to capitalize on interest in the FreedomWorks rally.) According to Deal Hudson, who once ran Catholic outreach for the Bush-Cheney campaign and is now the director of operations at Inside Catholic, the job is pretty easy. ""If you screen for people who attend church every week,"" said Hudson, ""you get the vast majority of Tea Party activists."" In an interview, Reed told me that Republican turnout in 2010 has the potential to exceed ""anything we've seen before,"" and made the case that the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Overtrick software and literature drops were going to be part of that. And he was going to be part of that, which was a surprise in itself. This was his return to the D.C. bubble after everyone wrote him off as a casualty of the Abramoff scandal. The infamous lobbyist hired him to work with Indian casinos; the fallout killed Reed's bid for lieutenant governor of Georgia. Reed doesn't even blink when asked about it now. ""I think I'm in a much better place personally,"" he said. ""And a lot of people said the same thing about Newt Gingrich after he stepped down as speaker. Now, look where he is today. He might be running for president. So I don't know what the future holds."" Gingrich was one of the GOP stars who blessed Reed's weekend comeback with a speech about the coming rout. He also presided over his own celebration on Saturday night--a lavish premiere for America at Risk, the war-on-terror documentary ""hosted"" by him and his wife Callista. Citizens United, which is releasing the movie, was still tweaking it only days before the premiere. The result: a narrative that makes the case for neoconservative foreign policy by paying tribute to the people who protested the ""Ground Zero mosque"" in August. In the audience, alongside people like James Woolsey and Doug Schoen, were members of the Tea Party movement who'd scored e-mail invites. Who else will see Gingrich's film? We don't know. It will play at the RedState Gathering in Texas this week, and it will be distributed on DVD and on college campuses. And it's a natural hit for Tea Partiers. The movie doesn't just reinforce their fears about President Obama's American-ness. It explains why Obama is making them less safe.   It re-enacts the old LBJ ""Daisy"" ad with a fast-cut scene that shows a nuclear missile taking off from Iran, Israelis going about their day, and then, boom--a mushroom cloud. * Reed informed Tea Partiers that they had the ability to remake Congress. Gingrich informed them that they had a chance to save the world. The weekend ended with that much-hyped taxpayer march. It was the only event of the weekend where nothing new was being sold to the movement. Instead, it was a tribute to what they'd already done, and a pep rally for everything they expected to win. It was the first Tea Party rally in months that failed to overwhelm. Organizers quietly put the blame for that on Glenn Beck, who'd asked the Tea Party to come to Washington just two weeks earlier. Who had that much time and money to spend traveling to Washington? Yet despite thin turnout and rain and paranoia about milling reporters who were probably trying to ""nail"" them for the NAACP, the crowd seemed happy--buoyed by the knowledge that they were winning. And by the knowledge that they were now basking in thanks and pleas from the sort of people, like Ralph Reed and Newt Gingrich, who used to lead their party. ""We've rehabilitated the Republican Party,"" said FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe. ""Or as I like to say, we've had a hostile takeover."" Correction, Sept. 13, 2010: The original article misspelled the first name of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. (Return  to the corrected sentence.) It also misdescribed a political advertisement, which shows a nuclear missile taking off from Iran, not Iraq. (Return  to the corrected sentence.) Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/inequality_petard.html	"The Associated Press reports that ""newly released census figures"" show that income inequality got worse between 2008, when the latest recession began, and 2009, when it ended. (The official dates for the recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, were December 2007 through June 2009; the jobless recovery that followed has been no cause for celebration.) That's true--with three caveats. The firstis that the figures aren't ""newly released."" They were released nearly two weeks ago. The secondis that the Census didn't actually say the income-inequality trend got worse during the recession. The AP reporter, Hope Yen, calculated that on her own using data from a Sept. 16 Census report. (I'm terrible at math, so I asked Ed Welniak, chief of the Census's income statistics branch, whether Yen's calculations were correct. He said they appeared to be.) And the thirdcaveatis that if you follow the standard measure of income inequality, Yen is incorrect. Income inequality in 2009 did not differ in any statistically significant way from income inequality in 2008. Why, then, do I say her story was true? Because if you follow an alternative measure mentioned in the Census report, income inequality increased significantly between 2008 and 2009. The larger story, which I outlined in a recent 10-part Slate series (PDF; serial version; slide show), is that income inequality in the United States has been growing for three decades. Since the early 1990s, the main driver of income inequality has been skyrocketing incomes at the top. But during the recession the main driver appears to be an increase in the poverty rate steeper than anything we've seen since 1994. (See accompanying chart.) What's interesting about the alternative measure Yen used is that it (or something like it) happens to be favored by conservatives (and also some nonideological contrarians like Georgetown economist Steven J. Rose, author of  Rebound, and Reuters blogger Gregg Easterbrook, author of  Sonic Boom)who argue that all this talk about income inequality is overblown. To me, the news in the AP story isn't ""Income Inequality on Rise."" Rather, it's ""Inequality Minimizers and Deniers Hoist by Own Petard."" It was a matter of personal pride, when I wrote my Slate inequality series, that I neverburdened readers with the unlovely phrase Gini coefficient. Now, alas, I can't avoid it. The Gini coefficient (or Gini index) is the principal means by which economists measure income inequality. Its inventor was an Italian statistician named Corrado Gini (1884-1965), whose lesser works (let me say it before Jonah Goldberg does) include a 1927 paper titled ""The Scientific Basis of Fascism."" Gini's coefficient (whose use is not confined to economics) measures dispersion. The index runs from zero (perfectly equal distribution) to 1 (maximum possible unequal distribution). In economics, the higher you score on the Gini index, the more unequal your society's distribution of income. In the United States, the Gini index was 0.468 in 2009. By the standards of other leading industrialized nations, that's pretty bad. It's worse than Germany (0.27), worse than France (0.327), worse than the United Kingdom (0.34), worse than Italy (0.32), worse than Spain (0.32), worse than Sweden (0.23), worse than Japan (0.381), worse than Israel (0.392), and worse than the entire European Union (0.31). The countries that are worse than the United States (Central African Republic, 0.613; Zimbabwe, 0.501) tend to be pretty uncongenial. But the United States may be an even bigger outlier than these numbers suggest, because the Gini coefficient has certain disadvantages when it comes to measuring rapid income growth at the tippy-top of the income scale. Indeed, the Sept. 16 Census report says the Gini index has experienced no statistically significant changes since 1993, which is about when income gains for people who make more than $1 million per year began their present rapid acceleration. The Gini index doesn't reflect that. The lone exception to the Gini flat line during the Clinton years and after was a 1.5 percent decrease between 2006 and 2007. Why did the AP's Yen write that income inequality increased between 2008 and 2009 when the Census was saying it didn't?  Because Yen wasn't going by the standard measurement. Instead, her calculations were--sorry, here comes more jargon--equivalence-adjusted. The Census Bureau's standard measure of income inequality is based on household incomes. For sticklers, that's problematic because a household can be a sprawling family of 12, or it can be a single elderly retiree. Different groupings require varying quantities of cash to get by. That's often why those who deny or minimize the income inequality claim that the official numbers are illegitimate. When you factor in differences in household size and circumstance, they say, income inequality is not as bad. They're right. To answer this criticism, the Census published, alongside its standard calculation, a separate calculation that was equivalence-adjusted. The Census's equivalence-adjusted measure of income inequality factored in the number of people occupying a household and also took into account  three key variations: children consume less than adults; a single parent's first child costs more than a couple's first child; and as families grow, they realize certain efficiencies of scale. By this unofficial measure, which is what the AP's Yen chose to use, income inequality is not as great as it is by the Census' standard measure. The Gini coefficient isn't 0.468; it's 0.458. But that's not the end of the story. When you calculate using equivalence-adjusted data, income inequality is shown to have grown at a much faster rate over the past three decades than it is when you calculate using the Census' standard measure. Since 1967, the Gini index has increased 23.8 percent using equivalence-adjusted income, compared to a 17.9 percent increase using the standard measure. The equivalence-adjusted method shows inequality to be growing more rapidly in the short term, too. So while the Census' official measurement shows the Gini index remaining the same between 2008 and 2009, the equivalence-adjusted measurement favored by the AP's Yen shows the Gini index increasing from 0.451 to 0.458. That's statistically significant, according to the Census. I don't pretend that this revelation about equivalence-adjusted income will silence the small band of people dedicated to arguing  that income inequality is a minor problem at best. But it ought to give them pause when they consider that their preferred measurement shows income inequality to be accelerating more quickly than we (or they) previously knew. Like Slate on  Facebook.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/theoretical_egalitarians.html	"Earlier this month I published a 10-part Slate series (PDF; serial version; slide show) about the 30-year rise in income inequality that Princeton's Paul Krugman has dubbed ""The Great Divergence."" In the first installment, I noted that in 1915, when the richest 1 percent accounted for about 18 percent of the nation's income, the prospect of class warfare was imminent. Today, the richest 1 percent account for 24 percent of the nation's income, yet the prospect of class warfare is utterly remote. Indeed, the political question foremost in Washington's mind is how thoroughly the political party more closely associated with the working class (that would be the Democrats) will get clobbered in the next election. Why aren't the bottom 99 percent marching in the streets? One possible answer is sheer ignorance. People know we're living in a time of growing income inequality, Krugman told me, but ""the ordinary person is not really aware of how big it is."" The ignorance hypothesis gets a strong assist from a new paper for the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science: ""Building a Better America--One Wealth Quintile at a Time."" The authors are Michael I. Norton, a psychologist who teaches at Harvard Business School, and Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist (and blogger) at Duke. Norton and Ariely focus on the distribution of wealth, which is even more top-heavy than the distribution of income. The richest 1 percent account for 35 percent of the nation's net worth; subtract housing, and their share rises to 43 percent. The richest 20 percent (or ""top quintile"") account for 85 percent; subtract housing and their share rises to 93 percent. But when Norton and Ariely surveyed a group whose incomes, voting patterns, and geographic distribution approximated that of the U.S. population, the respondents guessed that the top quintile accounted for only 59 percent of the nation's wealth. In his book The Wisdom of Crowds, James Surowiecki cites example after example in which collective judgment proves remarkably accurate. When a finance professor polled his class about the number of jelly beans in a jar, individual answers were all over the map, but when he averaged them, the group estimate was less than 3 percent off. When a British statistician reviewed tickets from a contest to guess the weight of an ox at a livestock fair, he found similarly diverse answers, but when he averaged them, the group estimate (1,197 pounds) was less than 0.1 percent off. Such ""crowd-sourcing,"" however, turns out to be a terrible method for estimating the distribution of wealth. Norton and Ariely's respondents were off by 31 percent, even though wealth distribution (unlike income distribution) has remained essentially unchanged for a generation. Norton and Ariely broke down the responses by income group and found the guesses became slightly more accurate as you moved up the income scale. But more striking was the uniformity among income groups. All five quintiles imagined the top quintile to possess about 60 percent of the nation's wealth. (Again, the real figure is 85 percent.) More surprising still, the average guess of a respondent who'd voted for George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election was not appreciably different from the average guess of a respondent who'd voted for John Kerry. The Kerry voters imagined the top quintile's share to be larger than the Bush voters did, but again, both figured it was about 60 percent. Norton and Ariely also asked respondents what they thought the ideal distribution of wealth should be, and found, again, little difference among income groups, or between Bush voters and Kerry voters. Most favored a wealth distribution resembling that in ... Sweden! But when you examine Norton and Ariely's method, that particular finding gets a little shaky. They showed respondents three unlabeled pie charts. One depicted utopian equality, with wealth distributed equally among five groups. The second depicted the United States, with wealth distributed very unequally among five groups (one of which gobbled up 85 percent--Norton and Ariely put it at 84 percent, but let's not quibble). The third depicted Sweden, where the top quintile accounts for 35 percent of the nation's wealth. Neither the Swedish pie chart nor the U.S. pie chart was identified by nation. Norton and Ariely were astonished that 47 percent of respondents--remember these were all Americans--chose the pie chart depicting Sweden. But surely most survey-takers, when presented with two extreme options and one that lies in the middle, will instinctively gravitate, like Goldilocks, toward the middle option. More surprising to me was that second place went to Utopia (43 percent). Only 10 percent voted for the pie chart depicting the country the respondents actually live in. Americans' ignorance about wealth (and, probably, income) distribution is encouraging in the sense that it offers hope that most voters might opt for government policies more conducive to equality if only they knew how unequal things were. But it's dismaying in the sense that people who occupy a position of relative privilege seem to go out of their way to avoid acknowledging it. A recent example is M. Todd Henderson, a law professor at the University of Chicago whose annual household income exceeds $250,000, putting him comfortably ahead of 98 percent of his fellow Americans. Henderson was foolish enough to write a blog post venturing that even though he and his wife earn more than $250,000, his Hyde Park neighbor Barack Obama shouldn't raise his taxes because ""we can't afford it"" after paying the mortgage, the kids' private school tuition, the nanny, etc. You can imagine the response he got. Henderson, who promptly took the post down (futile in this era of Web caches) used the occasion to excavate deeper wells of self-pity (""The electronic lynch mob that has attacked and harassed me--you should see the emails sent to me personally!--has made my family feel threatened and insecure.... You have caused untold damage to me personally""). Henderson said he was sorry--not for making asinine claims about how much money you need to get by in America, but for violating his wife's privacy by splashing details of their financial lives all over the Internet. (He said his wife ""disagrees vehemently with my opinion."" Sensible woman.) I know a lot of people like Henderson--well, maybe not quite as clueless as Henderson, but liable, in private, to confide that making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year doesn't make them feel rich. The United States may possess a shrinking middle class, but the number of its citizens who consider themselves middle class (because they can't face that they're rich) may actually be growing. Perhaps a similarly large number consider themselves middle class because they can't face that they're poor. What we can conclude with some certainty is that counting dollars belonging to oneself relative to others is a much more emotionally distorted activity than counting jelly beans."

But on Sept. 7, he released  The Forgotten Man, which portrays President Obama looking smug and trampling the Constitution, and it was an instant sensation. Below Obama, dollar bills and ignored legislation flutter with the wind. Beside him, a forlorn and impoverished man sulks on a bench.

In a series of stiff speeches, the House members attacked Obama's programs and promised to shrink the government by cutting spending and taxes. Unlike the unveiling of the Contract with America in 1994, when some 180 raucous GOP candidates gathered on the steps of the Capitol, the press conference just outside Washington was a low-key affair. Twelve party officials stood in a semi-circle between stacks of maple, birch, and gypsum. They spoke on behalf of the people but to an audience made up almost entirely of reporters. The visuals fit the message: modest, sober, and focused on the economy. The Republicans admitted that while they strove to limit spending, they were not offering anything as bold as a plan to balance the budget. They weren't promising ""Morning in America,"" but merely steps that would get the country ""back on track."" The biggest goal of the plan is political: to send a message that lawmakers are not ignoring voters. It contained garden-variety Republican talking points, but leaders pitched it as the outcome of a 20-month process of ""listening"" to voters. That was its most important political message in a year where each party has accused the other of not listening to voters. ""We get it. We get it,"" said Minority Leader John Boehner, whose Republican counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, was sending the identical message. The other important message was economic. GOP strategists have for months been arguing that Republicans need to present independent, center-right voters a set of ideas related to jobs. Under the ""Pledge,"" small businesses will be allowed to deduct 20 percent of their annual income. The Bush tax cuts will be allowed to continue for all income brackets, which Republicans say will remove uncertainty that is crippling business. All regulations that affect more than $100 million or more in economic activity will require congressional approval. Republicans bet that the constituency at issue here (center-right leaning independents) will be on their side in a debate about whether these policies can spur economic activity. A recent Pew poll shows they are already leaning heavily toward the GOP. Democrats saw their own advantage in the plan. They argue the tax cuts will explode the deficit. Undoing the Obama health care plan will increase the number of uninsured and changing the rules for regulations will put lobbyists back in charge (because they can influence members of Congress voting on regulation). Democrats have been asking voters to look at the election as a choice between two visions for governing and not a referendum on Obama. Now there are specific policies that can be compared. ""Now it's all on paper,"" said a White House aide. ""They have to answer for it."" The pledge looks like a corporate report for a Midwestern conglomerate. Pictures of tree-lined streets, the Statue of Liberty, and a cowboy with a lasso are interspersed between policy promises that also cover national defense and health care reform. Big issues like education and energy policy--ones you've probably heard about--are barely addressed or go unmentioned. While the leaders promised to restore ""fiscal sanity,"" the $100 billion in annual cuts they propose are unspecific and tackle only a small portion of the $1.4 trillion deficit. There is no balanced-budget amendment, which disappointed some conservatives. Plus, the document says very little about how they would reform or curb entitlements to start addressing deficit growth in the future. A longtime budget policy hawk who works with Republicans labeled the plan ""underwhelming."" Republicans believe entitlement reform is where the big savings can be found, but to get specific is to open candidates up to attack. Boehner said he wanted to have an ""adult conversation"" about entitlements but not until after the election. The actual adult thing to do would be for both sides to offer their plans before the election and let the voters decide. GOP leaders also included a host of congressional reforms in the pledge. All future bills will be posted online three days before a vote, and all legislation must cite the constitutional authority behind it. The latter provision was lauded by Tea Party groups. The pledge's repeated references to the Constitution also seemed aimed at that group. What undermined the calls for transparency and an end to the charades in Congress were the charades the Republican leaders engaged in during the presentation. For example, they called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to enact this agenda now before Congress goes home in early October. They know this is impossible. It's rhetorical and unserious, but it's also dangerous. It suggests these kinds of reforms can be enacted overnight. As Boehner knows better than anyone, legislating takes time, particularly if you want lawmakers to actually read the bill. Making it seem like changes can happen with a snap may help undermine Nancy Pelosi with his voters now, but if John Boehner takes over her job, he'll face expectations he'll never be able to meet.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/the_masturbation_lobby.html	"Unlike most politicians, who fear taking on the enormous interest group of people with hands, Christine O'Donnell has come out against masturbation. ""The Bible says that lust in your heart is committing adultery. So you can't masturbate without lust,"" she said in 1996. ""If he already knows what pleases him and he can please himself, then why am I in the picture?"" O'Donnell, now the Republican nominee for senator in Delaware, has no idea how difficult it is for men to masturbate without pictures. She made these philosophical statements as founder of the Christian lobbying group Savior's Alliance for Lifting the Truth, which sprung out of her earlier work for the anti-porn group Enough Is Enough, whose president, Donna Rice Hughes, found her calling after her extramarital affair with former Sen. Gary Hart. O'Donnell found her truth after going to college in New Jersey and having sexual relationships with men she wasn't dating, which I thought was pretty much covered by ""going to college in New Jersey."" In college she also says she ""dabbled into witchcraft,"" which may have so disgusted her that it led to her anti-onanistic beliefs, since witches masturbate more than any group except sirens, wood nymphs, succubae, and every member of every male species. Though O'Donnell has been ridiculed for her prudishness, I actually think she's right. Masturbation is bad for marriage. Our pornified, DIY sex culture leads to husbands who would rather go to their man-cave for an hour than attempt to negotiate intimacy with their wives--especially because many of those wives aren't Asian. Just like we'd be closer to our spouses if we could only eat in their presence, so we would be really eager to see our wives if we didn't masturbate. Also, we'd be much more efficient. Imagine if we used our computers only for work. The industrial revolution would have never happened if, when you pulled the factory lever one way you made a Model T, and if you moved it the other way, you saw hot girl-on-girl action. My wife, who isn't completely wrong to worry that porn images have ruined my ability to connect in a natural way, thinks it's healthy if I masturbate to fantasies about her. This is incredibly naive. If she had any idea of what was being done to her in those fantasies, those would be the ones she would be trying to get rid of first. Being anti-masturbation was not an insane opinion a few decades ago. The masturbation episode of Seinfeld was shocking in 1992, and Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders had to resign in 1994 because she suggested that self-love be taught as part of sexual education. Which would have been a great idea, since then there would have been at least one subject in which boys got better grades than girls. To  see if I could cut down on my addiction, I called Craig Gross, * the founder of the Christian porn-addiction site xxxchurch.com. He was strongly anti-masturbation, saying he'd rather his kids slipped up and had sex before marriage than started a lifelong pattern of self-pleasure that they couldn't break even after finding a spouse. ""Laurence Fishburne's daughter goes into porn and it's, 'Poor Laurence Fishburne.' But then Christine O'Donnell makes this statement and we jump down her throat for that,"" he said. ""No one wants to lump it all into the same camp: the porn, the masturbation, the unfaithful spouses, and Tiger Woods' mistresses in People magazine."" Gross also said a lot of specific stuff about how much women get paid to do different sexual acts in porn, which must have been weird for him since I could hear his children in the back of his car as he drove them to a Jonas Brothers concert. They may be the only children in America who will need more therapy than my son. After giving it a lot of thought, I don't think I'm going to stop masturbating. I mean, I will while I'm typing this column, but that's about it. And I don't think Christine O'Donnell should be a senator even of a completely made-up state like Delaware. But she and the rest of the far-right movement do play an important role in my life. If we listen to them instead of reflexively mocking them--which is very difficult to do, especially when they dabble in witchcraft--they can force us to consider the downside of progress. By which I mean lots and lots of porn. But there is another kind of progress: It's undeniably better for kids not to grow up ashamed of their bodies and sexual desires, which led some of them to suicide, self-flagellation, and the priesthood. Conservatives like O'Donnell argue that social norms formed by millions of people over thousands of years have a wisdom that must be weighed against progress. All improvements have downsides, and we might want to make sure our virtual sex lives don't consume our real ones. Even if they are much, much, much better. I've got to go.

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/digging_out_the_grass_roots.html	"COLUMBUS, Ohio--Steve Nicholson barely opens the storm door for the Democratic campaign volunteer trying to talk to him about the Ohio governor's race. ""I don't care for either one,"" he says, ""I just want jobs."" The volunteer says that's exactly why he should vote for the incumbent, Democrat Ted Strickland. ""Not voting is a vote for Kasich,"" she says, referring to Republican challenger John Kasich. ""Strickland will be better for jobs,"" agrees Nicholson, 30. So will he vote? No. Does he at least want a little campaign literature to learn about the race? No. The storm door closes. Rachel Harris lives two blocks away and sounds at first a lot like her neighbor up the street. ""I want the same thing everyone else wants,"" she says. ""Jobs."" At 29 years old, Harris is the mother of five and makes $7.50 an hour working as a cashier at a dairy. ""I don't know which is which,"" she says of the candidates. But as the volunteer goes through the slate, Harris softens. ""That means good jobs,"" she says when she hears about renewable energy programs. ""Thank you for informing me,"" she says, promising that she's likely to vote for the Democrats. For the Democratic Party, the difference this year between a rout and survival may come down to Steve Nicholson vs. Rachel Harris. Neither is likely to vote Republican. But it's unlikely that both will vote Democratic. As Nov. 2 approaches, Democrats face a highly motivated opposition. The search for ways to excite people--not just their core voters but anyone who might be receptive to their message--grows more desperate by the day. ""Folks, wake up!"" President Obama told a group of Democrats Monday night. ""This is not some academic exercise."" Democratic hopes rest in part on Organizing for America, the Obama campaign organization that mobilized such an army for his victory in 2008. In Ohio, OFA has joined with the Democratic Party in perhaps the largest ground effort in the country. They are aided by labor unions. The AFL-CIO has been targeting workplaces and walking the streets talking to its members. In their most expansive moments, Democrats talk about OFA as the ""sleeping giant"" in what looks like a bad year for Democrats. For months Obama adviser David Plouffe has been  preaching the gospel that if the organization can motivate a portion of those roughly 15 million first-time voters who came out for Obama, the Democrats will win close contests. President Obama just taped a video message to OFA volunteersasking them to ""fight for our candidates as strongly as you fought for me. ... I need everyone here to step up their game. We have to have the same energy. The same enthusiasm. ... We've just gone through the first quarter. The game is still on."" The quasi-scientific precision of the process sure looks and sounds impressive. Aides talk about ""capacity"" and ""metrics"" as if they could produce voters like car parts. In Ohio, they've already reached out to more voters than they had by August 2008, in part because they've added more paid staff. Neighborhood captains who organized for Obama have been working their contacts ever since. The science of organizing says that voter contact is the best way to motivate your voters. Volunteers walk the neighborhoods with sharp-looking maps, black dots marking each house that might have first-time voters or ""sporadic Democrats."" Scripts volunteers read to voters are tweaked frequently. Each contact is tabulated to gauge motivation for the next round of outreach In a recent moment of low morale, OFA aides sent around Obama clips from 2008 to remind themselves of the spark that started it all--and perhaps what it used to be like to have hope, enthusiasm, and momentum. Polls in the race for Senate and governor show the Republicans up by 20 percentage points. Ignore the polls, say Democratic organizers who are determined to battle the rising flood waters. But it's hard to tell whether they're stacking sandbags or sugar packets. An afternoon of canvassing for Democratic votes highlights how hard it is to build a robust turnout. Some of the challenges come simply from trying to motivate voters in a midterm rather than presidential year. There's no presidential horserace to follow. People are unfamiliar with the candidates. (Democrats can take heart that several people said they'd vote for the party even though they were unfamiliar with the candidates.) Conservatives are motivated by the desire for change. Democrats can't use that argument this time. Instead they have to make arguments for patience and herald incremental change, none of which is very stirring. Samy Sekar, the highly motivated 20-year-old Ohio State student I followed, was patient and engaging. Wearing a faded ""Team Obama 08"" T-shirt, she talked to even the most gruff people as if they were in the food line at a Democratic picnic. But for the low-information voters thinking through unfamiliar names, being pulled into a discussion about the issues on a weekend is like doing homework. Even the most engaging volunteer can only be so forceful. One strategist working to turn out the vote in Ohio pointed out that when voters are told that it took a long time to get into the economic mess and it's going to take some time to get out of it, they seem to better understand their plight and why change has been slow. But it doesn't motivate them to vote. Like Nicholson, they aren't going to punish Democrats; they just don't think their vote matters in a world of such slow incremental change. A  wide-ranging federal corruption probe of Democratic office-holders in Cleveland, a Democratic stronghold, may also depress turnout. ""It's grim,"" says one Democratic strategist involved in helping a variety of House and Senate candidates. When I asked another Democratic strategist for his assessment of Ohio, he referred to Bill Clinton's ability to come back in 1996 after the '94 losses. Handicappers are making ominous predictions, too.  Congressional Quarterly just moved two Ohio congressional races from ""toss-up"" to ""lean Republican."" The difficulty on the ground in Ohio has led to speculation about whether the national Democratic committees are  going to write off the state. Why throw good money after candidates that are sure to lose? Local Democratic organizers promise they have built an organization large enough that even if the rate of return is low on the outreach, they'll still get enough votes. The most aggressive outreach has only just begun, they say. Democratic voters are starting to recognize the economic stakes in the election, as are swing voters. It's an argument the New Democratic Network's Simon Rosenberg has made recentlyabout the national landscape for Democrats. Local organizers argue that despite the chatter from pundits and strategists, their national partners are engaged. That's what they're supposed to say. But Ohio is a special state. It may be the most important redistricting battleground this year. Vice President Joe Biden, who just visited the state to campaign for Strickland, called the governor's race the most important in the country. That's in part because the next governor and other statewide candidates will preside over the redistricting process after this year's census. The party in power could lock in an advantage in more than a dozen House seats for 10 years. Obama is scheduled to return to Ohio in early October. For the president, building strength in Ohio is important for 2010--but also for 2012. One strategist in the state said that if the Democrats are successful this year, Ohio ""can serve as a firewall"" for the presidential campaign in two years. If there is to be a Democratic comeback in Ohio, it will rely on a two-pronged attack that relies on tying Republican candidates to Wall Street and their support for free trade. In the African-American community, the comeback argument is different: It's all about Obama. Posters at OFA headquarters that go up in African-American communities read ""Our Time is Now"" and show Obama getting his hair cut at the barber shop. Says one organizer explaining the pitch, ""The Republicans want to take down Obama in 2010, and you need to have his back."" Become a fan of  Slate and  John Dickerson on Facebook.

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/comic_timing.html	"The Facebook page for Jon Stewart's Oct. 30 Rally to Restore Sanity was on its way to 100,000 attendees when liberals rediscovered that most familiar of emotions: panic. Why would there be panic about the first fun or galvanizing event that Barack Obama's liberal base had to look forward to since their limited edition Shepard Fairey prints came in the mail? It's simple. Democrats look at the electoral map and see that they're doomed. Their hope rests on the resilience of liberal activists and union members, who will be spending the final 72 hours of the campaign pulling voters to the polls. And all of a sudden here come Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, turning a joke into a mega-rally and plucking liberals right out of their get-out-the-vote operations during their most crucial weekend. ""A lot of people on campus are going,"" says William Vogt, a Georgetown University junior and spokesman for the campus's College Democrats. ""I'm planning to attend it, too. Right now I don't think we're worried about an effect on GOTV. The rally is Saturday; Halloween is Sunday. We're still going to vote on Tuesday."" This is high-grade Democratic nightmare fuel. In 2008, college kids from Washington, D.C., campuses regularly boarded buses to campaign for Obama-Biden in Virginia. In Iowa, twentysomething Obama volunteers erased bad memories of Howard Dean's messy campaign by getting to know locals and mastering caucus politics. Both of these activities seemed more useful than an attention-getting rally that, like so many rallies, will just reinforce what the activists think. And what they think when they watch Stewart and Colbert is: ""Aren't these right-wingers a bunch of rubes?"" Democrats don't think this is helpful, and a few of them poured their hearts out to Politico's Ben Smith. ""To the extent that some people who will attend his rally would otherwise be involved in GOTV efforts,"" wrote party strategist Steve Rosenthal, ""this is not helpful."" Tea Partiers are on the same page. They appreciate the distraction from the labor movement's One Nation rally on Oct. 2, which has only started to get attention since ... well, since it started being analyzed as a victim of Restoring Sanity. They also appreciate liberal activists taking themselves out of the GOTV game for a day. ""I'd much rather see liberals coming to D.C. that weekend than staying in their districts and GOTV-ing,"" says Brendan Steinhauser, director of state campaigns for FreedomWorks and a key organizer of the group's two 9/12 rallies. ""Our guys are going to be in Ohio and Pennsylvania knocking on doors."" There's no blaming Jon Stewart here. The Tea Partiers went through their own period of reflection about the wisdom of rallies. It was in March 2009; the conclusion was that the rallies were wise. They discovered their natural allies and brainstormed new organizations, and by summer 2010, they were deep into horse-race politics, candidate endorsements, and the humiliation of moderate Republicans in party primaries. Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor rally, the inspiration for the Stewart/Colbert shindig, was bookended by D.C. strategy sessions and rallies by groups like FreedomWorks. This year's 9/12 rally, much smaller than last year's, was all about the election. A much-discussed National Tea Party Unity Convention, organized by the people who planned the Nashville convention in February, is probably not going to happen, and one reason is that activists are too busy with electioneering to rally. That prompts a question: Why do Democrats think the Stewart/Colbert stunt is pulling away potential electioneers? The only sure thing about the 2010 election is that liberals aren't as excited to vote as conservatives are. Monday's Gallup Poll on the generic ballot found, for the first time in a while, that Democrats were tied with Republicans in a one-to-one vote. But it also found that Republican voters were much more certain to vote than Democrats were. Forty-seven percent of Republicans were ""very enthusiastic,"" while only 28 percent of Democrats were. That was exactly the kind of sluggishness that killed the Republicans and boosted the Democrats in 2008. But what do the stars of Comedy Central do to change that? The plan, as Stewart and Colbert opaquely describe it, would seem to be a booster shot of smugness. On the Rally to Restore Sanity Facebook page, the disembodied voice of Stewart issues a call for ""the people who think shouting is annoying, counterproductive, and terrible for your throat; who feel that the loudest voices shouldn't be the only ones that get heard; and who believe that the only time it's appropriate to draw a Hitler mustache on someone is when that person is actually Hitler."" That's quite a bow to the new reality. A few years ago, it was liberals wincing at their fellow travelers when they were stupid enough to think that rallying on the Mall with Bush-Hitler signs would change anything. With the start of the Obama campaign in 2007, the liberal pose became happy and self-righteous.  The biggest rally in recent American history was not 9/12; it was a gathering of liberals on the Mall on Jan. 20, celebrating the arrival of the leader whose face they had on their walls. * This was not comfortable turf for liberals. It was very comfortable turf for both conservatives and for satirists like Stewart and Colbert, because the cult of Obama and the optimism of liberals was fairly ridiculous. When the Tea Party movement started up, egged on by Stewart's accidental archenemy Beck, it broadened the focus of the satirists, but it didn't galvanize liberals. They'd spent eight years being alternately smug or afraid when they thought about Republicans. They got rid of the Republicans. And now they were supposed to rediscover their smugness? The Democratic panic is out of whack. Stewart's rally will attract two kinds of people: The liberals who weren't going to GOTV anyway, and the liberals who needed this final jolt to reconnect with their elitism. The people who were going to turn votes for the Democrats won't be there. ""I don't think it's going to be a big deal among union voters,"" says Eddie Vale, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO. ""If you've got a steelworker in Pennsylvania who's door-knocking that day, he's not going to say, 'Oh, shit! I need to see Jon Stewart!' "" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.Correction,  Sept. 23, 2010: This article originally referred to Obama's inauguration as the ""biggest rally in modern American history."" It was the largest American gathering in the past 20 years but not over such a broad time period. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's Oct. 30 rally will ruin the election for Democrats? Hilarious.
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/the_rights_new_left.html	"After its primary victories this week in Delaware and New York--following ones in Kentucky, Arizona, and Alaska--there is no longer any question about whether to take the Tea Party seriously. Come 2011, we are likely to have Mama Grizzlies in the House and Senate, and the movement's gravitational pull is sucking in traditional Republicans by the day. While the Tea Party doesn't control the GOP, it's likely to remain the largest force acting on it for some time. So who are these people and what do they want from us? A series of polls, as well as be-ins like Glenn Beck's Washington rally last month, have given us a picture of a movement predominated by middle-class, middle-aged white men angry about the expansion of government and hostile to societal change. But that profile could accurately describe the past several right-wing insurgencies, from the California tax revolt of the late 1970s to the Contract with America of 1994--not to mention the very Republican establishment that the Tea Party positions itself against. What's new and most distinctive about the Tea Party is its streak of anarchism--its antagonism toward any authority, its belligerent style of self-expression, and its lack of any coherent program or alternative to the policies it condemns. In this sense, you might think of the Tea Party as the Right's version of the 1960s New Left. It's an unorganized and unorganizable community of people coming together to assert their individualism and subvert the established order. But where the New Left was young and looked forward to a new Aquarian age, the Tea Party is old and looks backward to a capitalist-constitutionalist paradise that, needless to say, never existed. The strongest note in its tannic brew is nostalgia. Tea Partiers are constantly talking about ""restoring honor,"" getting back to America's roots, and ""taking back"" their country. How far back to take it is one of the questions that divides the movement into segments. The tricorn hats and powder horns carried by Revolutionary re-enactors point to the most extreme libertarian view: a Constitutional fundamentalism that would limit the federal government to the exercise of enumerated powers. The Roanoke Tea Party, for example, proposes a ""Freedom for Virginians Act,"" that would empower the state to invalidate laws it deems unconstitutional. It's been settled business that you can't do this since the Supreme Court decided McCullough v. Maryland in 1819. Beck, a century more modern, feeds his audience quack history that blames the fall from grace on the Progressive Era, when Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson introduced socialism into the American bloodstream. Others in the Tea Party fetishize the pre-lapsarian state before the New Deal, or before the Great Society, or simply before Obama. There is also a more evangelically inclined Tea Party splinter focused on repudiating the sexual revolution. But calls for any new restrictions on personal conduct seem like an aberration. Delaware Senate nominee's Christine O'Donnell objection to masturbation, which she helpfully points out is a selfish activity, is at odds with the movement's fixation on individual choice in matters social as well as economic. Self-pleasuring must remain a form of protected expression for those who reject any infringement on personal autonomy as a step on the road to serfdom. Other than nostalgia, the strongest emotion at Tea Parties is resentment, defined as placing blame for one's woes on those either above or below you in the social hierarchy. This finds expression in hostility toward a variety of elites: the ""liberal"" media, ""career"" politicians, ""so-called"" experts, and sometimes even the hoariest of populist targets, Wall Street bankers. These groups stand accused of promoting the interests of the poor, minorities and immigrants--or in the case of the financiers, the very rich--against those of hard-working, middle-class taxpayers. Beck and Sarah Palin, the fun couple that headlines the Tea Party, express their feelings of victimization at the hands of their betters and lessers on a daily basis--he in his histrionic vein, she in her preening one. Both hedge their resentment in a careful way that often walks the line of bigotry but seldom states it directly. Anti-elitism defined in cultural terms is hardly a fresh theme for Republicans. But here, too, the Tea Partiers take it to a new level. The most radical statement of individualism is choosing your own reality, and to some in the Tea Party, the very fact that experts believe something is sufficient to disprove it. The media's insistence that Barack Obama was born in the United States, or that he is a Christian rather than a Muslim, merely fuels their radical skepticism. Other touchstones of the movement's separate reality include the view that Obama has a secret plan to deprive Americans of their guns, that global warming is a leftist hoax, and that--this is Christine O'Donnell again--there's more evidence for creationism than for evolution. Nostalgia, resentment, and reality-denial are all expressions of the same underlying anxiety about losing one's place in the country or of losing control of it to someone else. When you look at the surveys, the Tea Partiers are not primarily the victims of economic transformation, but rather people whose position is threatened by social change. Because racial bias is unacceptable both in American political culture and in an individualist ideology, Tea Partiers don't say directly what Pat Buchanan used to: that moving from a predominantly white Christian nation to a majority nonwhite one is a bad thing and should be stopped. Instead, their resistance finds sublimated expression through their reality distortion field: Beck's claim that Obama ""has a deep-seated hatred of white people""' or Dinesh D'Souza's Newt-endorsed theory that Obama is a Kenyan Mau Mau in mufti, or the prevalent Tea Party opinion that policies like Obamacare and the stimulus are merely mechanisms for transferring income from the middle class to the minority poor and illegal immigrants--i.e., socialism. Of no previous movement has Richard Hofstadter's depiction of populism as driven by ""status anxiety"" been so apt. For the Republican Party, the rise of the Tea Party is the essence of mixed blessing. The political problem is how to co-opt the movement's energy and motivational anger without succumbing to its incoherence and being tainted by the wacko voices within it. This is something the Democrats were fundamentally unable to do in relation to the New Left in the 1960s, and the Tea Party's radicalism threatens the GOP in a similar way. We've seen party elders confront this challenge week by week through the primaries, with senior figures within the GOP furiously recalibrating their visceral horror at the nutball purity of a Rand Paul or Sharron Angle into expressions of support and encouragement. Liberals may be humoring themselves in seeing it as good news for them, but for the moment it's fun to watch slippery conservative politicians--Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich--scramble aboard the tiger. As mobs go, Republicans will find this one will be especially hard to lead, pacify, or dispel. The Tea Party is fundamentally about venting anger at change it doesn't like, not about fixing what's broken. Turn the movement's rage into a political program and you've already betrayed it.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/sulking_from_gomorrah.html	"On Wednesday, the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security held a hearing on selling minors for sex. Lawmakers and activists spent most of the hearing talking about how bad the problem has become. But the last two witnesses scolded anti-trafficking crusaders for persecuting an online sex-ad purveyor and making the problem worse. The two witnesses represented that purveyor: Craigslist. Two weeks ago, under public pressure from state attorneys general, Craigslist closed its ""adult services"" section. At the time, I speculated that the company sought to prove what it had said all along: that if its sex-ad business were shut down, buyers and sellers would relocate to other venues that did less to screen ads for sexual abuse. Its testimony at Wednesday's hearing confirms this speculation. Essentially, its message to the committee was: We told you so. Here's what the company's representatives said. 1. You won't have Craigslist to kick around anymore. ""In craigslist, law enforcement and NGO advocates had a highly responsive partner that listened to and was willing to meet with all concerned parties,"" Elizabeth McDougall, the company's outside counsel, told the committee. Now you don't. So there! 2. The media spearheaded our persecution to protect their ad business. ""The incidence of crime relating to use of craigslist is extremely low,"" said William Powell, the company's director of customer service and law enforcement relations. ""However, despite craigslist's best efforts, it is not and cannot be zero, and any incidence of crime across tens of millions of people will generate enough crime stories to keep the newspapers, who compete with us in the classifieds business, busy reporting."" Ouch! 3. You're forcing sex ads back into public areas where everyone will see them. Powell testified that Craigslist set up its sex-ads section nine years ago ""at the request of craigslist users tired of seeing adult services ads mixed into the personals categories."" Now the sex ads will get mixed back in. Nice going. 4. Sex ads are just shifting to other sites. ""Craigslist is employing proprietary technical measures to force the migration of adult services ads from craigslist to other venues,"" McDougall testified. As a result, ""traffic at other venues for adult service ads has risen significantly."" 5. The other sites won't be as nice as we were. McDougall told the committee, ""Migration of the relatively small percentage of total U.S. adult services advertising that had been posted on craigslist to less socially responsible venues uninterested in best practices is an unfortunate step backward in the fight against trafficking and exploitation."" You'll be sorry you drove us out of the business, you zealots. 6. We told you this before, but you ignored us. McDougall testified that a year ago, ""I participated in a number of calls with staff of the Attorneys General of various states, sharing data regarding the migration of ads for adult services from craigslist to other online venues in their particular states. We also shared summaries that contrasted craigslist ads and practices with adult advertising and practices in local media publications in the Attorney General's states."" But did these politicians heed the data and the warning? Of course not. Now they'll have to grapple with the irresponsible sex-ad practices of those self-serving media outlets. The politicians and newspapers that blamed the problem on us will have to deal with the worsened problem and with each other. Serves them right. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

She opposes socialism because she believes in the individual. In her view, you should be free to live your own life, unencumbered by others. Except when it comes to touching your genitals. O'Donnell expressed her views on socialism clearly in a speech last year. ""There is a fundamental flaw with socialism that makes it never work,"" she explained. ""And the fundamental flaw in socialism is that it reduces the human being to a cog in the wheel. ... Under a socialist economy, the people exist to empower the government. It should be the other way around: A government should exist to empower and protect the people."" O'Donnell recalled a TV panelist who thought the government should have taken over more of General Motors.  ""At least this socialist has the guts to come out of the closet,"" she joked. But perhaps O'Donnell should come out of the closet herself. In fact, all of us should come out of the closet, since, in her view, none of us should come in the closet. That act--masturbation--would be a sin by the individual against society. It's well known that O'Donnell, in her previous job as president and founder of the Savior's Alliance for Lifting the Truth, preached the evils of masturbation. What's less understood is her rationale for doing so. In a 1996 program on MTV, she and her SALT colleagues explained their philosophy. ""Masturbation is a selfish act,"" said the group's marketing director. O'Donnell cautioned that anyone who masturbates is ""toying with his sexuality."" She concluded: ""You're going to be pleasing each other. And if he already knows what pleases him, and he can please himself, then why am I in the picture?"" O'Donnell didn't invent this objection. It's the official doctrine of her Catholic faith, ignored by many Catholics but not by O'Donnell. Under ""Offenses against chastity,"" the church's Catechism says this:"	Christine O'Donnell, masturbation socialist.

(Does this train take me to Flatbush?) Democrats also spent the day working on a new symbol for the Republican Party: the Mad Hatter. With the election of Tea Party favorite Christine O'Donnell in Delaware, Democrats now believe they have a body of evidence--eight Senate races in which Tea Party candidates won the Republican nomination--that allows them to argue that the Republican Party has gone nuts. Democrats were already bringing GOP bogeymen to each rally, but Tuesday's results allow them to pump a little more air into the image. The success of Tea Party-backed candidates also allows them to feel good about something when so much of the news lately has been bad. Still, the question must be asked: How much will this internal Republican fight actually help Democrats? O'Donnell's victory turns what looked like a safe Republican pickup into a seat Democrats are likely to now hold on to. Democrats also hope the sum of the Tea Party victories pays off more generally with two voter blocs: The first is independent voters who tend to turn out less than in presidential years. They decide late and tend to not like extremism. In a just-released CBS poll, 33 percent of independents are still undecided. Independent voters have a dim view of the Tea Party. In the poll, 31 percent viewed the movement negatively and only 18 percent viewed it positively. Some 26 percent of independents say they are less likely to vote for a candidate affiliated with the Tea Party, and only 12 percent say they are more so. Independent voters tend to not like risky characters with brash ideas, which is why Democrats are using terms like ""extremist"" and ""scary"" and highlighting ideas like privatizing Social Security. The trick here for Democrats is to transfer bad feelings voters may have about the Tea Party and its candidates to the entire GOP. They may be helped by a GOP leadership worried about angering its most active, organized constituents. The Republican Senatorial Committee at first told reporters they were not going to support O'Donnell--but then Sen. John Cornyn, the chairman of that committee, issued an endorsement. (So did RNC Chairman Michael Steele and likely presidential candidate Mitt Romney.) The second group of voters Democrats are hoping to excite are their base voters and first-time Obama voters. The specter of a GOP-controlled Congress was already a central theme of this campaign year, but now the idea of a Tea Party-dominated Republican Party just got scarier. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee sent out a fundraising letter the morning after the O'Donnell win: ""Help us turn back the Tea Party tide! Your immediate donation of $5 will help fight O'Donnell, Sharron Angle, Rand Paul and the rest of these radical candidates. President Obama's agenda depends on keeping our Senate majority."" The Democratic base isn't the only group of core supporters that gets excited. As an anti-establishment figure, O'Donnell is benefiting from a flood of new cash. (Democrats also claim an increase in donations to her opponent.) Could the bashing backfire? Possibly, say Democratic strategists. But Tea Party activists are already energized, so there's little risk in doing things that might make them more angry The other benefit of the Tea Party victories for Democrats is psychic. The White House and Democrats now hope that the Republican Party will be lured into the daily cycle of distractions they've been experiencing. The Dems can now enjoy reading stories of disappointed supporters, a party in disarray, and internal sniping. Sarah Palin fulfilled Democrats' dreams when she treated Karl Rove like he was in diapers. Rove had criticized Palin-backed O'Donnell. ""Well, bless [Karl Rove's] heart,"" she said on Fox. ""We love our friends there in the machine, these expert politicos ... who say the GOP nominee is not electable or that they're not going to even try. Well, I say, 'Buck up. Buck up.' Competition is really good."" Speaking of Palin: Her profile, if not influence, rises with the success of the Tea Party--and Democrats see that as another glimmer of hope. She has been a smashing success in support of the Tea Party, but now she and the Tea Party have to come out of the clubhouse and face voters in the general election. Palin has not gotten more popular among voters the more they've seen her. In the CBS poll, her favorability rating among all voters was 21 percent; 43 percent of voters view her unfavorably. Among Tea Party voters, Palin's endorsement would make them 36 percent more likely to vote for a candidate and only 12 percent less likely to do so. In the general public, those numbers essentially flip (12 percent and 37 percent, respectively). Now that the primaries are over, Democrats may have their best opportunity to define this election as a choice between two philosophies. That the Republican ranks are now populated by creative, colorful Tea Party characters helps bring the differences into higher relief than would otherwise have been the case with establishment candidates. But this may all still be a side show in anxious economic times. If voters want to punish the party in power for the slow pace of the recovery, all of these hopeful new strategies may be about as effective as changing a logo.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/the_tea_party_scorecard.html	"The favorite line of Tea Party activists just so happens to be true. The turning point of their long war against the ""establishment"" was the nearly successful campaign of Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman in New York's 23rd district. Hoffman, aided by national endorsements from Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express, chased Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of the race at the 11th hour, as her campaign collapsed. Liberals saw it as a triumph of lunacy over electability, but it scared the D.C. committees out of endorsing their other sure-thing, best-bet establishment candidates. As the primaries come to a close--they are over in every state except Hawaii--we can see the results of N.Y.-23. The Republican establishment has quietly encouraged its chosen candidates but occasionally been caught flat-footed by the out-of-nowhere Tea Party movement. Here's the scorecard for gubernatorial and federal races. The criteria for whether a candidate was a Tea Party outsider: an endorsement from Sarah Palin, Jim DeMint, the Tea Party Express, or FreedomWorks, or local Tea Party groups. ALABAMA: 1/3 Establishment picks:  Robert Bentley for governor, Parker Griffith and Martha Roby for Congress Tea Party picks: Tim James, Mo Brooks, and Rick Barber Results: Almost Tea Party rout, which had more to do with the generally agreeable conservatism of the ""establishment"" candidates than the movement's weakness. But the movement took out Parker Griffith, a former Democrat who switched parties, demanded and got establishment support, and lost to the conservative, Brooks, who had scared him into making the switch. ALASKA:1/1 Establishment pick: Sen. Lisa Murkowski Tea Party pick: Joe Miller Results: Miller won. He had Mike Huckabee, Sarah Palin, the Tea Party Express, and local Tea Party groups on his side and pulled the upset. ARIZONA: 1/2 Establishment picks: Sen. John McCain, Jonathan Patton in Ariz.-08 Tea Party picks: J.D. Hayworth for Senate, Jesse Kelly in Ariz.-08 Results: McCain won, aided by Palin, local Tea Party groups, and the general awfulness of Hayworth; Kelly won with Palin's endorsement. CALIFORNIA: 0/1 Establishment pick: Carly Fiorina, a candidate for the Senate Tea Party pick: Chuck DeVore Results: Fiorina won, aided by her own support from conservatives like Palin and the Susan B. Anthony List. COLORADO: 2/2 Establishment picks: Scott McInnis for governor, Jane Norton for Senate Tea Party picks: Dan Maes and Ken Buck Results: Both of the insurgents won, although Maes has spent the month since then defying calls to quit the race for someone electable. CONNECTICUT: 0/1 Establishment pick: Linda McMahon for Senate Tea Party pick: Peter Schiff Results: Schiff, a libertarian economist, never caught fire the way his ideological ally Rand Paul did in Kentucky. DELAWARE: 2/2 Establishment picks: Mike Castle for Senate, Michelle Rollins for House Tea Party picks: Christine O'Donnell for Senate, Glen Urquhart Results:  Tea Partiers strategically attacked this state with a tiny Republican electorate and, as far as most people are concerned, have produced the only state where Democrats will sweep in two months. FLORIDA: 2/3 Establishment picks: Daniel Webster in Fla.-08, Charlie Crist for Senate, and Bill McCollum for governor. Tea Party picks: Todd Young in Fla.-08, Marco Rubio for Senate, and Rick Scott for governor. Results: Only Webster, who entered the race late and locked up from people like Huckabee, outwitted the Tea Party. IDAHO: 1/1 Establishment pick: Vaughn Ward for Congress Tea Party pick: Raul Labrador Results: This one was a mess. The national GOP and Palin both liked Ward. Local activists liked Labrador. The Tea Party Express gave its lone Democratic endorsement to Rep. Walt Minnick, the man they wanted to defeat. But Ward stumbled in debates and lost to Labrador, who did a better job of courting the movement. ILLINOIS: 1/3 Establishment picks: Rep. Mark Kirk for U.S. Senate, Kirk Dillard for governor, Kathleen Parker for Ill.-10 Tea Party picks: Pat Hughes for U.S. Senate, Adam Andrzejewski for governor, Robert Dold for Ill.-10 Results: Kirk's rout and Andrewjeski's poor showing inspired a few news outlets to prematurely declare the Tea Party's political power overrated. It's clear now, however, that the movement's political organs just needed more money and experience: Illinois's February primary was too early to take advantage of. INDIANA: 0/2 Establishment pick: Dan Coats for U.S. Senate, Dan Burton for Congress Tea Party pick: Marlin Stutzman, multiple candidates against Burton Results: Stutzman, aided by Jim DeMint, outperformed the polls but lost a three-way race; Burton's vote collapsed, but he got more support than any one challenger. Stutzman got a happy ending: After Rep. Mark Souder was felled by a sex scandal, Sutzman won the right to run and replace him. IOWA: 1/2 Establishment picks: Terry Branstad for governor, Jim Gibbons for Congress Tea Party picks: Bob Vander Plaats, Brad Zaun Results: Branstad, helped by a surprising Palin endorsement that offended some of Palin's Iowa supporters, held off Vander Plaats; Zaun surprised everyone. KANSAS: 0/1 Establishment pick: Jerry Moran for Senate Tea Party pick: Todd Tiahrt for Senate Results: Tiahrt lost despite support from Palin and the Tea Party Express and a campaign based on his down-the-line conservatism. KENTUCKY: 2/2 Establishment picks: Trey Grayson for U.S. Senate, Jeff Reetz for Ky.-3 Tea Party picks: Rand Paul, Todd Lally Results: Paul and Lally easily won; in the latter race, a wealthy restaurant owner was defeated by a commercial pilot. MARYLAND: 0/1 Establishment pick: Bob Ehrlich for governor Tea Party pick: Brian Murphy Results: Ehrlich easily defeated Murphy, who had jumped into the face first and gotten the faintest of second winds when Sarah Palin endorsed him. MICHIGAN: 2/2 Establishment picks: Mickey Switalski, Jason Allen Tea Party picks: Andrew Raczkowski, Dan Benishek Results: The Tea Party candidates entered their races long before the movement really got going and kept their support after stronger-on-paper candidates came in. Banishek triumphed by 15 votes in his primary, a reward for taking on Bart Stupak when no one else would. MISSOURI: 1/1 Establishment pick: Bill Stouffer for Congress Tea Party pick: Vicky Hartzler Results: Hartzler, who had retired from politics and was viewed nervously by the local GOP, upset Stouffer, a state senator. NEVADA: 1/1 Establishment pick: Sue Lowden Tea Party pick: Sharron Angle Results: The Tea Party benefited from Harry Reid's successful kneecapping of Lowden, his best-polling opponent, and got Angle over the finish line, where she immediately emerged as a ""problematic"" candidate who needed D.C. aides to bail her out. NEW HAMPSHIRE: 2/3 Establishment picks: Kelly Ayotte for Senate, Frank Guinta and Charlie Bass for House Tea Party picks: Ovide Lamontagne for Senate, multiple candidates for House Results: Chalk it up to the multiple candidate problem. guinta and Bass won, but Ayotte pulled it out in the Senate primary. NEW JERSEY: 1/2 Establishment pick: Diane Gooch and Jon Runyan for Congress Tea Party pick: Anna Little and Justin Murphy Results: Little, a local mayor, narrowly defeated the self-funding newspaper publisher Gooch. Runyan, a former Philadelphia Eagle, held off Murphy by 18 points. NEW YORK: 1/4 Establishment picks: Rick Lazio for governor, Joe DioGuardi for Senate, and Nan Hayworth for House Tea Party picks: Doug Hoffman, Carl Paladino, David Malpass, Neil DiCarlo, and Matt Doheny Results: The big headline went to Paladino, who destroyed Lazio, but the rest of the candidates with the most Tea Party support lost. That won't matter in the Senate race, but Republicans feel more confident about their shots at two House seats having nominated their preferred candidates. PENNSYLVANIA: 2/2 Establishment picks: Arlen Specter, Mary Beth Buchanan for Congress Tea Party picks: Pat Toomey, Keith Rothfus Results: Toomey scared Specter out of the GOP, while Rothfus helped Buchanan disprove the truism that U.S. Attorneys make good candidates. SOUTH CAROLINA: 3/3 Establishment picks: Gresham Barrett for governor, Paul Thurmond, and Rep. Bob Inglis for Congress. Tea Party picks: Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, and Trey Gowdy. Results: It was a rout: The establishment lost every race, and handily. Barrett and Inglis never overcame their support for TARP. TEXAS: 0.5/1 Establishment pick: Kay Bailey Hutchison for governor. Tea Party pick: Debra Medina. Results: Medina, a Ron Paul supporter, surged in the final month of the campaign but imploded after appearing to indicate that she had doubts about the official story of 9/11. But it wasn't a big Tea Party defeat, as Rick Perry was renominated for governor. UTAH: 1/1 Establishment pick: Sen. Bob Bennett Tea Party pick: Mike Lee Results: Lee was one of two candidates who beat Bennett at the state convention before narrowly winning the party primary, aided by FreedomWorks and Jim DeMint. VIRGINIA: 0/2 Establishment picks: Robert Hurt and Scott Rigell for Congress Tea Party picks: Multiple opponents of Hurt and Rigell Results: In another election overinterpreted as a major Tea Party defeat, Hurt and Rigell overwhelmed their divided opposition. WASHINGTON: 0/2 Establishment picks: Dino Rossi for Senate, Jaime Herrera for Congress Tea Party picks: Clint Didier for Senate, David Castillo for Congress Results: The Tea Party candidates entered their races before there was any sign of Democratic trouble and were easily defeated by candidates who jumped in after the pickings looked easy. THE RESULTS: Tea Party activists made a real go at winning 51 races. They won 24 of them. Corrections, Sept. 15, 2010: This article misspelled the name of former Colorado gubernatorial candidate Scott McInnis; former Illinois gubernatorial candidate Adam Andrzejewski; Michigan congressional candidate Dan Benishek; and New York congressional candidate Nan Hayworth. The article misidentified South Carolina congressional candidate Paul Thurmond. It listed Hayworth and Rep.

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/obamavs_boehner.html	"Barack Obama is not Justin Coussoule, but he sounds like him sometimes. Coussoule is the Ohio Democrat running against House Minority Leader John Boehner. Last week, Obama singled out Boehner in two different speeches. On Monday, Obama did it again in a meeting with voters. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs started the day by going on the network morning shows to comment on Boehner, then ended it by exchanging Twitter barbs with him. There are 50 days to go before the election. At this pace, the spat between the president and the minority leader may achieve the majesty of a school-board fight. Everything about this fight feels like a wash. In its most recent iteration, over extending the Bush tax cuts, both parties have muddled positions, and neither the frequency nor the smallness of the combat seem likely to change the dynamic much among voters. In a year when the economy, voter enthusiasm, and history favor Republicans, a wash isn't good for Democrats. But don't take my word for it. Take a look at the positions of both sides and make the call yourself. First, the latest details. The most recent round of combat started Friday. At his news conference, the president said that Republicans were holding the middle class ""hostage."" They were blocking an extension of the Bush tax cuts to those making less than $250,000, demanding tax relief for everyone--or ""tax cuts for millionaires,"" as the president put it. On  Face the Nation on Sunday, Boehner said that he would work to extend the Bush tax cuts to everyone, but if he were only given an option of voting for middle-class tax cuts alone, he would take that. Now for the spin: The White House view: Boehner was off-message, which meant Republicans had to spend a day asserting that they were unified in their support of tax cuts for everyone. ""During a campaign you are either on offense or defense,"" said a Bush-era veteran from the sidelines. ""And this seems very defensive. The White House has to love this."" By seeming to agree to a compromise, Boehner is in a box. He will either have to vote with the Democrats or  explain why, when a vote comes up in the House, he wasn't for extending the tax cuts to the middle class. He will look either cynical or like a flip-flopper, say White House aides. When he votes against the tax cuts (as Democrats expect), his back and forth will show everyone that in the end the GOP cares more about those who make over $250,000 than those who don't. If nothing else, the broader fight and its most recent chapter put Boehner in the news cycle for another day. The only way the press is going to cover the election in the way that the White House wants--which is as a choice between Democratic and Republican philosophies, not as a referendum on Obama or the economy--is if there's conflict. Obama vs. Boehner provides that. (The White House sought to highlight this bigger ideological battle  in a blog post at the end of the day Monday.) A Boehner vs. Obama fight also gives focus to White House aides. As during the 2008 campaign, they can wake up with a political mission every day: How do we define John Boehner? (The Democratic National Committee answered that question today with a  new ad about him.) It also gets editors and producers to start asking, ""What do we really know about John Boehner?"" That leads to stories like  this New York Times piece on Boehner's ties to lobbyists. The exposure also might give people second thoughts about giving Republicans control of Congress. Inconsistency, confusion, and other minor errors grow larger when people start to think of a politician as the leader of the majority in Congress. The Republican view: When Obama is saying Republicans are inflexible and unwilling to accept any compromise, why is it bad for the potential House GOP leader to seem open to a compromise? Boehner's comment isn't exactly like  Joe Barton's apology to BP executives, which was easy to repeat and required no explanation to voters. Sure, Republicans had to spend a news cycle reasserting their positions. But they aren't nearly as confused on the question of tax cuts as the Democrats are. Obama spoke Monday in the Virginia district of  Gerry Connolly, a Democrat  who essentially holds the Boehner position on tax cuts. Democratic Senate aides report that seven Senate Democrats and Joe Lieberman have said they prefer extending the tax cuts for everyone. A group of moderate House Democrats circulated a letter Monday asking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to do the same. The vote that Democrats are anxious to have in the House in order to expose John Boehner will also expose Democrats in tough districts who don't want to vote on anything that can be characterized as a tax increase. True, Boehner is getting more scrutiny. But sometimes that coverage can be good, like this MSNBC story about Boehner's  humble roots that his office posted on its Web site. Also, if Robert Gibbs wants to tweet New York Times stories about lobbyist ties, then Republicans  can do the same thing with Obama lobbyist work. If this election is a debate about general governing philosophies, there's evidence that it isn't hurting Republicans. The latest  CNN and  Washington Post polls show that despite a fuzzy agenda Republicans are now more trusted on several key issues than Democrats. For now, the debate over what Boehner may do if faced with a vote in the House is moot. Democratic leaders have decided to let the Senate go first in the debate over tax cuts. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says his caucus is united against any tax legislation that does not extend all the tax cuts. That effectively blocks the legislation. If the Senate version dies, the House may take up the legislation, but the matter is still being debated among a split caucus. Some in the White House want the House Democratic leadership to force Boehner's hand and call a vote--but the president, at least as of this writing, doesn't have a vote in the House. Even though at times he behaves like a candidate who wants one. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

""It's a very bad idea to build that mosque and center that close to Ground Zero,"" Newt Gingrich said yesterday on Fox News Sunday. ""It is, in fact, an affront to virtually all the families who lost loved ones at 9/11."" On Meet the Press, Rudy Giuliani agreed: ""The people [it's] hurting here most are the families that have lost loved ones. ... Eighty or 90 percent feel extremely hurt by this. It's making them relive the pain. They should be the ones to get the most consideration."" But what's behind those feelings? Why do these families object to a house of worship for Muslims who had nothing to do with 9/11? This weekend, we got a chance to hear their point of view. Opponents of the mosque staged a rally near Ground Zero to commemorate 9/11 and denounce the project. The lead organizer, activist Pamela Geller, credited the event to ""the large number of [9/11] family members who have contacted me and asked us to help them speak out for their loved ones."" She cited a press release from "" 9/11 Parents & Families of Firefighters and WTC Victims,"" which declared that"	Should we respect the anti-Muslim feelings of some 9/11 families?
