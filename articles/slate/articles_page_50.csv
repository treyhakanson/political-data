""It was flat-out murder. And when you see the footage, it will illustrate that."" It's hard not to agree. If you watch the Walmart surveillance footage of Crawford's killing--released Wednesday by prosecutors in the case--you don't see a confrontation, or anything like the scenario described by Ronald Ritchie, the witness who called 911. In Ritchie's account of the event, Crawford ""was just waving [the gun] at children and people. ... I couldn't hear anything that he was saying. I'm thinking that he is either going to rob the place or he's there to shoot somebody."" Moreover, said Ritchie, ""He didn't really want to be looked at, and when people did look at him, he was pointing the gun at them. He was pointing at people. Children walking by."" Indeed, on the emergency call, Ritchie said that Crawford was trying to load the gun, leading dispatchers to tell officers that ""he just put some bullets inside."" The problem is that isn't true. In surveillance footage, there are no people in the aisle or children walking by--Crawford is alone, on a phone. He has a gun by his side, but as we later learned, it was an unloaded air rifle. What's more, Ohio is an open-carry state--legally, there's no reason to approach Crawford if he isn't using the gun to harm people. Which he wasn't. Police say they called out to Crawford before they shot, but the footage throws doubt on the claim. In the video, there's no indication Crawford heard police commands before they shot him--police rush from the side and shoot, and Crawford falls to the ground. He tries to get away, but police corner and arrest him. He died later, at a nearby hospital. To go back to Crawford's father, it's difficult to watch this video and conclude his son wasn't murdered. The pace of the event--the speed with which police used lethal force--gives it the feel of a summary execution. In that, it's similar to the killing of Kajieme Powell, who police shot moments after confronting him near a convenience store in St. Louis last month. In Powell's case, the police officers were put on administrative leave, and the St. Louis Police Department is pursuing an investigation. In the case of Crawford, prosecutors charged the officers with murder, reckless homicide, and negligent homicide, but the grand jury declined to indict them. Not that this was a surprise. Even in the most restrictive departments--where officers have little leeway on the use of force--police are granted wide latitude for their actions. As Dara Lind points out for Vox, the key to the legal standards for use of force ""is that it doesn't matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used. Instead, what matters is the officer's 'objectively reasonable' belief that there is a threat."" Barring an extraordinary misuse of force--a cold-blooded killing, for instance--police are nearly immune to criminal prosecution (though they can be fired or face civil consequences). That is true for federal investigations, too. ""Federal prosecutors,"" notes the Associated Press, ""declined to charge New York police officers who killed the unarmed Sean Bell in 2006 in a 50-shot barrage following his bachelor party in Queens."" Likewise, in 1999, the New York officers who shot Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant, never faced federal charges for his killing. The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the shooting of John Crawford as well as the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting of Michael Brown, but past cases suggest both will end without charges. In a sense, the real scandal isn't that police killed Crawford--it's what police can get away with in the use of lethal force. The answer, by and large, is everything. And for communities that face the brunt of official violence, it feels as if--when it comes to police--they are outside the protection of the law. During the Ferguson protests, National Review writer Charles Cooke made an important point about black American anger over police violence:"	The Real Crime Is That the Police Who Killed John Crawford Are Probably Free to Kill Again

Created in 2012 by the League of Women Voters, it's a day in September when volunteers work to register voters and increase participation. In the last two years, the effort helped add 350,000 people to the voter rolls, and this year more than 2,000 groups have organized events to mark the occasion and repeat the success. In Atlanta, for example, the NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, and the American Legal Advocacy Center of Georgia gathered at the State Capitol to host a mass registration event. Likewise, in Ohio, the state Democratic Party held registration events in Cincinnati and Columbus, by way of a statewide bus tour. And on a more national note, the Democratic National Committee issued a message in support of National Voter Registration Day. The Republican Party has not responded with similar enthusiasm. Nearly two years after it pledged more outreach to traditionally Democratic communities, the Republican Party remains committed to a strategy of voter suppression. Voter identification laws in North Carolina and Texas have kept thousands of people from the polls, while some Ohio Republicans are charging through judicial setbacks to pass a new voter ID law and maintain attempted cuts to early voting. And in Wisconsin this month, a panel of Republican judges on the 7th Circuit overturned an injunction against the state's voter ID law, which was criticized for its burden on low-income and minority voters. ""Unfortunately,"" wrote DNC Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on her organization's website, ""Republicans have made the cynical calculation that their path to victory is a smaller electorate. Obstacles to registering to vote--such as elimination of same-day registration and refusal to adopt online registration--disproportionately affect young people, women, and communities of color."" Wasserman Schultz's statement is typically partisan, but it's not wrong. Beyond voter ID, there's been a raft of GOP efforts to blunt voter registration efforts. The frenzy that began with ACORN in 2009--in which Congress pulled the group's federal funding after misleading videos of alleged misbehavior and false cries of voter fraud--has extended to state capitols across the country. Most have been challenged in court, and some--like a Florida law that reduced the time for returning registration forms and levied stiff fines for missing the deadline--were blocked entirely. What's striking, however, are the lengths officials have gone to burden groups that register voters. To use one instance, Republican lawmakers in Kansas, Georgia, Alabama, and Arizona have passed ""proof of citizenship"" laws for state voter registration--burdening low-income and elderly voters without birth certificates. In 2011, Texas Republicans took the unusual step of creating a mandatory official volunteer system for anyone who wants to run a voter registration drive. The rules for inclusion are among the strictest in the nation: Non-Texans are barred from participating; anyone registering voters most undergo training through a specific county; approved registrars can only register voters in the county they were approved; and all registration forms must be personally delivered to officials. Failing to deliver forms within five days, says the law, is a criminal offense. As usual, the justification for this was ""voter fraud,"" despite the gross lack of evidence or any indication these rules would stop absentee ballot fraud, which is extremely uncommon, or in-person fraud, which is almost nonexistent. At the moment, Georgia Republicans are trying to use the same playbook against efforts to register black and Latino voters in the state--after the New Georgia Project delivered 85,000 registration forms, the Republican secretary of state announced an investigation into potential--and thus far unfounded--""fraud."" When it comes to voter engagement and participation, the most you can say of Republicans is they've thought of their own supporters. It's why--to mark National Voter Registration Day--they announced a ""get out the vote"" tool for GOP voters, called Vote GOP. In fairness, it acts as a general tool for anyone who wants to know the details for voting in their state. Still, when considered alongside GOP efforts against registration, it gives an ugly message: Sure, Republicans are happy to help other Republicans vote. Otherwise, you can expect roadblocks."

The producers hired a bunch of actors, one portraying a Muslim man working a deli counter and the others a rotating cast of incorrigible racists who loudly objected to being served by a ""terrorist."" Rather encouragingly, the people of Kingston rose to the man's defense again and again, and the emotional payoff came when a U.S. Army soldier in uniform offered an eloquent defense of the freedom of religion before telling the racist provocateur to buzz off. You will not be shocked to learn that the good people at Upworthy, the perfecters of earnest virality, shared the resulting video clip with their legions of followers. Despite my deeply ingrained cynicism, I found this little slice of Americana heartwarming: Simple decency is a wonderful thing. The specifics of this contrived scenario also resonated with me, as I was raised in a Muslim household and, despite my lack of a religious impulse, continue to identify with the Muslim community in a loose way. Ages ago, when I was just starting the ninth grade, I recall watching a 1993 Firing Line debate on PBS in which Pat Robertson jokingly stated that no Muslim should be allowed in the Cabinet because surely no one would want Muammar al-Qaddafi to serve as secretary of defense. The audience laughed, but I found myself perturbed. Did Robertson understand that there are living, breathing Muslim Americans out there? But this was long before the 9/11 terror attacks, at which time the specter of an Islamic fifth column became particularly vivid. And while that What Would You Do? episode might reassure us that Americans, regardless of religious beliefs or ethnic backgrounds, are one big happy family, that's not always true. Consider the tale of Mufid A. Elgeeh, a 30-year-old Yemen-born naturalized U.S. citizen who stands accused of aiding and abetting ISIS (and who may or may not have been plotting, or at least fantasizing about, terrorist acts of his own). Elgeeh ran Halal Mojo and Food Mart in Rochester, New York, where one assumes he interacted with all kinds of customers who knew nothing about his roiling inner life. Was Elgeeh subjected to bigotry and abuse, like that cooked up by the producers of What Would You Do?, and one day it just made him snap? Was he a devout believer who always identified more with a global community of radical jihadis than with the United States and his Rochester neighbors? I have no idea. I do know, however, that this less-than-heartwarming story is one that we've been hearing a lot lately as ISIS lures recruits from the West. The reality is that some Muslim Americans and Muslim citizens of other Western democracies identify less with their countries of citizenship than with an Islamic identity they find more inspiring. Scott Brown, the former senator from Massachusetts who is running for a Senate seat in New Hampshire, has called for stripping homegrown jihadis like Elgeeh of their U.S. citizenship. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has since embraced the idea. Several commentators have warned that Brown's proposal is a dangerous and foolish one that exaggerates the extent of the problem. Indeed, America's Muslims are not nearly as radical as Belgium's or even Canada's, if the per capita number of ISIS-joining jihadis is anything to go by. But focusing on the fact that Muslim Americans like Elgeeh are outliers prevents us from thinking through the larger issue of what it means to be a member of the American community.  Brown and Cruz appear to be in favor of creating an ideological test to determine who belongs in the United States. But I feel like the issue here is more a cultural than an ideological one. Let's all agree that if you're fighting alongside ISIS and you're plotting to murder your fellow Americans in a series of terror attacks and you spend your spare time recruiting anti-American guerrilla fighters, you're not exactly a candidate for Patriot of the Year. (In fact, you might be guilty of treason, a crime that has long been punishable by death.) Stripping these individuals of citizenship would tell us that these people were never really Americans in the first place. But is that right? Though the United States talks a good game about being a country based on ideas--freedom! democracy! liberty!--we are, whether we acknowledge it or not, a nation-state just as much as France, Germany, and Italy are nation-states. We are a diverse nation-state, to be sure, but we have a core English-speaking culture rooted in the traditions of Northern European settlers and the descendants of enslaved Africans, which has been enriched by contributions from various other groups, including, in relatively small numbers, Muslim immigrants. Just as there are teetotaling Frenchmen who bitterly hate cheese, there are American Bolsheviks and anarchists and Islamists. Like it or not, most of these people watched the same Saturday morning cartoons you did, and grew up mouthing the lyrics to the same songs. You can't undo the fact that these people are Americans, even if you find their beliefs loathsome. Their Americanness is about who they are, not what they believe. Instead of debating how and when we should terminate citizenship, we ought to focus more on how we grant citizenship in the first place. Many advanced democracies are tightening their naturalization procedures to ensure that new citizens have the cultural knowledge they need to be full members of the national community. With this in mind, countries are lengthening residency requirements and, in some cases, giving a preference to immigrants who can demonstrate that they are adopting the norms of their adopted country. The United States would be wise to follow suit. For one thing, doing so would help address lingering, unfair doubts about Muslim Americans' loyalty. In his 2011 National Affairs essay on ""The Muslim-American Muddle,"" Peter Skerry, a political scientist at Boston College, describes how many American Muslims find themselves confused about what it means to be active participants in American society. To some degree, this reflects the influence of political Islam, which preaches against national loyalties. But it also reflects ""contemporary America's unwillingness to place serious demands on its citizens."" Demanding more from new Americans would send clearer signals about the values we share. Making citizenship requirements more stringent wouldn't guarantee that naturalized Americans like Elgeeh would never again betray their country. Yet it would serve as a reminder that citizenship is more than a matter of convenience--that it is about a common cultural bond that deserves to be taken seriously. The people who were sticking up for the young Muslim shopkeeper in that What Would You Do? episode were doing so because he was their neighbor and fellow American. There's something very beautiful about that."	How Ted Cruz and Scott Brown Misunderstand What It Means to Be an American Citizen

Rand Paul arrived. Night one of the annual Liberty Political Action Conference had just started, with a speech from the WWE superstar Kane. Sans costume, the 7-foot tall Glenn Jacobs had explained that ""the world's governments"" chose to build nuclear power plants with dicey uranium, instead of safe thorium, ""because they were interested in the waste product--plutonium."" After Jacobs wrapped, a representative of the Campaign for Liberty Foundation announced the four winners of that year's Ron Paul Scholarships, and invited ""the gentleman whose idea it was for the scholarship--Sen. Rand Paul!"" And there he was, taking the stage to the sound of Metallica's ""Enter Sandman,"" as 100-odd, mostly young members of the liberty movement stood and cheered. Paul stayed onstage after the awards were handed out. ""So, we just finished celebrating Constitution Day,"" said Paul, as if leading into a joke about two guys walking into a bar. ""Barack Obama celebrated by doing one more unconstitutional thing. He started an unconstitutional war this week. That's not unusual for him."" Outside the Alexandra Hilton Mark Center, Paul's libertarian cred was being questioned. The Washington Post had reviewed Paul's speeches, op-eds, and bills, and called Paul's support for airstrikes against ISIS a ""stark change of heart."" In an interview with the Daily Beast, Paul admitted that he was ""like anyone else, susceptible to a certain degree, to the emotions of seeing Americans beheaded."" Could Paul remain the libertarian peace candidate? Well, yeah. Before heading to the conference, Paul voted against a government-funding bill that included money to train rebel forces in Syria. He explained his vote in a floor speech, insisting that ""the burden of proof lies with those who wish to engage in war,"" and that they had not met it. The leaders and both Houses were going to recess without a new vote on military action. That was what Paul had called for, and he didn't get it, which gave him a fresh chance to shame his colleagues. ""Everybody criticized it,"" said Paul of the punted war authorization vote, ""then everyone was like, 'oh well, it's an election year, let's wait until December.' "" He contrasted that with the arguments the administration had just made, insisting that the 2001 authorization of military force against anyone tangentially tied to the 9/11 plot could cover the strikes on ISIS. ""If you said we could go after terrorists anywhere in the world who might be al-Qaida,"" said Paul, ""or might be cooperating or associating with al-Qaida, you're saying that the authorization of force from 2001 could be used against the people you now want us to support!"" Paul's audience cheered again, louder this time. The media that covered this senator simply did not get it. And there was plenty of media in the room--The New Yorker, CNN, BuzzFeed, Politico, MSNBC (which Paul bashes at every opportunity), Time, the Daily Beast. They were there to spot any cracks in the Paul coalition, and they found some. But the cracks were spackled over as soon as the light hit them. The crisis in Iraq, which has caused a surge in the numbers of Republicans ready to send ground troops back into the Middle East, has not really rattled Paul's people. He has what very few political figures still have; his supporters assume that he simply must agree with them, no matter what he says. To the frustration of Democrats, Paul has taken less heat from his base for new Iraq airstrikes than President Obama has taken from his. The LPAC attendees were savvy: They knew that Rand was saying what he had to, but was not diverting, not really, from the path of the realist. ""Everybody started coming at me last week with this--'Oh, he's switching from his daddy,' "" said Dylan Stephenson, a system engineer from the D.C. suburbs, sitting near the hotel bar between sessions. ""Well, I read his articles. He's saying: Let's team up with the Iranians, let's team up with Assad. I had a friend at work tell me that Rand was changing. I showed him that article and he was like--'Oh no, he's crazy again!' "" Stephenson laughed. ""That's the neoconservative mentality. Did you hear McCain's mess-up? He said, talking about Rand, 'Did he meet with ISIS?' They have pictures of McCain with ISIS!"" About that. Paul has insisted, several times, that a viral photo of Sen. McCain standing with armed men in Iraq portrays a meeting between ISIS and the king of all hawks. ""That really shows you the quandary of determining who are the moderates and who aren't,"" Paul told the Daily Beast this week. McCain denied it to the same magazine, telling it that ""most of the guys in that picture are dead now, killed by ISIS."" The accusation remains, based on the photo and on careful misreadings of how McCain describes it. On the Sept. 15 episode of Fox News's Hannity, when the host asked McCain to rebut Paul, the Arizonan sputtered: ""Has Rand Paul ever been to Syria? Has he ever met with ISIS? Has he ever met with any of these people?"" This, in Paulworld, is enough to sow doubt that McCain himself did meet with them. Paul, meanwhile, can convince his audience of the moment that he has never been inconsistent, and never been duped. He responded to the lengthy Washington Post exegesis in a friendly conversation with the Federalist, a year-old conservative news site. He was not asked to respond to any point-by-point questions about his plan. ""Do you believe you've changed your mind about the proper policy approach in this arena,"" asked his interviewer, ""or is this just a matter of people not making a distinction about the threats involved?"" Paul went through Door No. 2. ""People say, 'well, two months ago you were less likely to want to be involved in the Iraqi civil war,' "" he said. ""Well, five years ago I'd say that also."" End of argument. If there is a rebellion against Rand Paul, it's not likely to start at a conference founded by allies of his father, where scholarships named for him are handed out to youthful free marketeers. The 21-year-old who discovers Rand Paul today was 14 when Ron Paul ran his first Republican primary campaign; he may have no memory at all of George W. Bush's campaigns for president. Paul is able to describe his foreign policy, and its critics, in a narrative that makes the liberty movement ineffably right. And ineffably patriotic. The first night of LPAC ended with a speech from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who talked more about campaign finance reform and IRS spies than about foreign policy. After 10 p.m., when he was done, the young liberty movement spread across the hotel, into an ergonomic bar. Soon, a busload of World War II and Korean War veterans, part of the Honor Flight charity tours that let these men see their monuments, unloaded into the lobby. Everyone stood up and cheered. They were against any new war; they were on the soldiers' side."	How the Libertarian Hero Makes His Foreign Policy Contradictions Disappear
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/how_republicans_would_run_the_senate_their_strategy_for_nominations_obamacare.html	"Rep. Bruce Braley may yet become a senator from Iowa. Half a year has passed since Braley, a four-term Democrat from the state's bluest district, was filmed telling some out-of-state lawyers why they needed to donate to his campaign. If he lost, ""you might have a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law, serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee,"" said Braley. ""If Democrats lose the majority, Chuck Grassley will be the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee."" It was a gaffe par excellence, not just because Republicans got so much out of it. (Say ""farmer from Iowa"" at any GOP rally there and the crowd stars laughing.) The candidate absorbed the damage, mostly, and has fought his Republican opponent to a tie with a razor-edged, ideological campaign about entitlements and wages. No: This was a perfect gaffe because Braley was telling his donors the truth. If they cared about nothing else, they needed to realize how close Democrats were to losing committee chairmanships. They could have Vermont Sen. Pat Leahy holding the gavel, or they could have a tort reformer who wanted to eliminate three seats on the D.C. Circuit and lock in a conservative majority for years. Almost none of the campaign promises of 2014 would matter. The majority and the gavel would. Republicans have had years to imagine what it would be like to have control of the Senate. If they win it, in six weeks, they won't be able to do much. With a sweep of the races in red states, they'll win a 52-48 majority. If they upset Democrats in the blue states where the GOP is polling the strongest--Iowa, Colorado, and New Hampshire--they'll finally restore the majority they lost in 2006. They won't get close to the 60-vote cloture threshold to pass legislation. Indeed, they'll already be tapping donors for a 2016 election in which most of the vulnerable seats belong to their party. ""If we don't win the Senate in 2014,"" Rick Santorum says in his campaign speeches, ""we won't win it in 2016."" He's not wrong. So, how would a Republican Senate change Washington? Conversations with senators, congressmen, and staffers from both parties suggest a brief period of conflict--which would peter out as the presidential primaries got underway--and a long war against the president getting any of the nominees he wants. That's a good place to start. Nominations The twin filibuster reforms of 2013 were probably the greatest achievements of President Obama's second term, ending the 60-vote chokepoint for all nominees for offices below the Supreme Court. They allowed the president to get his picks for the Cabinet, for circuit courts--including the D.C. Circuit that is likely to squelch new challenges of the Affordable Care Act. If there was a voter backlash, Democrats never felt it. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has hinted at a new ""conversation,"" after the election, about undoing the rule change. There's some worry among Republicans about ramming this through with the majority's votes, instead of changing the rules with a two-thirds supermajority. That might be viewed as ""using the nuclear option to undo the nuclear option."" The change would need to be reframed as a house-cleaning measure, a stand against Harry Reid's recklessness. Everyone agrees this would be a slog if Republicans won a majority with six red-state wins, and exponentially easier with every seat they picked up in a blue state. But that might not matter. One Republican aide summed it up this way: ""You don't need the filibuster if you have the committees."" Even a 51-49 Republican majority could vote down Obama nominees. Grassley would get to strike out judicial nominees; Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, who successfully blocked a Nobel Prize nominee for the Fed, would have new sway over candidates for Treasury and the IRS. The safest nominee, paradoxically, might be a high-profile theoretical pick for the Supreme Court, because those fights rally the base and several Republicans will be fighting for new terms in blue states--Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. It could be tight. Five Republican senators backed Obama's last Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan. Only two--Sens. Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins--remain. Investigations Preventing some Democratic nominee from putting on judicial robes--that could have repercussions for a generation. Two years of adversarial hearings would inflict a sharper, shorter kind of pain, mostly from, yes, Sen. Grassley. ""Let's get to the bottom of something that's been out there a long time--Fast and Furious,"" Grassley told Politico this month for a story about how he and other ranking members might lead. ""Let's get to the bottom of [the] IRS."" The other chairmen-in-waiting sound less intense. Wisconsin's Sen. Johnson was the guy whose needling of Hillary Clinton about Benghazi deaths led her to utter the immortal (and usually misremembered) line ""What difference, at this point, does it make?"" If Sen. John McCain decides to take the Armed Services Committee, Johnson is set to run Homeland Security. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a Syria and ISIS hawk, would take over Foreign Relations. Both say they're more interested in policy than show trials; both of them happen to be extraordinarily good at starting media show trials. We are talking about a Wisconsin senator whose own lawsuit against the ACA was dismissed just two months ago. Obamacare Every Republican senator and candidate knows that the Affordable Care Act passed in the budget reconciliation process, the only way to get a bill through without the threat of cloture. Every one of them thinks reconciliation can be used to gut it. ""I think we got something with this tax issue,"" McConnell reportedly told aides after the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare while defining its health care mandate as a tax. ""Figure out how to repeal this through reconciliation."" McConnell no longer talks like that in public. In a revealing interview with Politico's Manu Raju, McConnell walked through all of his 2015 priorities, all the ways they could be forced through in the budget process. He didn't promise to repeal Obamacare. He didn't even say that in a secret (then leaked) speech to a donor conference organized by the Kochs. The current plan is to use next year's budget process to chip away at the law by ending the medical device tax, or ending the employer mandate, and forcing the president to veto or accept it. Basically, look at what the health care industry wants to change, then expect Republicans to agree with it. Of course, in the summer of 2013, ""the plan"" was to avoid a fight over funding Obamacare. Conservatives in the House and Senate forced one, and forced a shutdown. Plenty of Democrats expect a shutdown next year, because Republicans seem to think they can ""win one."" Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who'll be majority whip if his party takes over, has said the blame for a government implosion shifts dramatically if a Republican House and Senate send a bill to the president's desk. That may have been disproved by the 1995-1996 shutdown, but the theory is unkillable. ""If we take the Senate, we've got to deal with Obamacare,"" says Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold, a Tea Party winner in 2010 who now holds a safe seat. ""Remember, Obamacare was done through the reconciliation process and only took 51 votes. If we take the Senate, we've got the opportunity to either repeal, replace, or fix Obamacare."" Everything else Beyond Obamacare, the theory goes that a Republican Senate can liberate all of the House GOP's bottled-up dream bills. There are hundreds of them, bill after bill that would cut taxes or drug-test welfare recipients or make it easier to file lawsuits against the executive branch. Some of these priorities, like the deathless bill to allow the Keystone XL pipeline, already might have 60 votes in the Senate. Eleven Democrats are on record wanting Keystone, though five of them are either retiring or on the watch list in this midterm--Montana Sen. John Walsh, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, and Alaska Sen. Mark Begich. McConnell, who alternates between promises of a ""working Senate"" and Bond villain descriptions of how he'll bring down Obama, has insisted that a Republican Senate would be collaborative. His caucus has other ideas. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, for one, was raring to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn environmental rules. ""Probably the very first thing to do is to go after the EPA regulations,"" said Inhofe. ""As these rules go into effect, and they become final, on that day you can file a CRA. I'm going to do that and go after them all."" Yet Inhofe had a problem with the question. He'd been asked, hypothetically, how Republicans could govern if they won the Senate. ""You mean 'when,' "" said Inhofe. ""Not 'if.' """	How the Republicans Would Run the Senate

Within three years, the federal government estimates, roughly four in 10 of those former prisoners will be back behind bars, either because they committed a new crime or violated the conditions of their release. The reasons for this huge recidivism rate are myriad and interconnected. But chief among the many challenges ex-cons face are finding places to live and work--two tasks required under most rules of release and ones made all the more difficult when they have criminal records. Researchers at Princeton University have found that having a criminal record in New York City, for example, can cut the chances of a black applicant landing a job by as much as 57 percent. (The drop for white ex-cons is 35 percent.) Add to those challenges weak personal support networks and the fact that the phrase correctional system is more aspirational than apt in America, and it's no wonder that many released inmates find themselves back behind bars. The federal government has tried to address the recidivism crisis. In 2008, George W. Bush signed the bipartisan Second Chance Act into law, providing millions of dollars for states, local governments, and nonprofits to help ex-cons get on their feet. It has been at the state and local level where the lion's share of innovation has happened: promising initiatives that provide substance abuse help, job training, and housing assistance. But in addition to the more comprehensive programs in places like Colorado and Hawaii, a more pinpointed effort is underway here in Iowa that could provide a blueprint for the rest of the nation. The latest government figures suggest that more than half of all jail and prison inmates have mental health issues, a trend that holds true in Iowa. Much has been written about how our justice system fails the mentally ill, from how the police interact with mentally ill people in the first place to how they're treated while in prison. The mentally ill also face daunting problems upon their immediate release. Consider: A typical inmate who is being treated for mental illness is given a limited supply of medication upon leaving prison, typically between three and 30 days' worth. Even the 30-day prescription an inmate receives in states like Iowa won't buy nearly enough time for an ex-con to jump through all the necessary hoops to get a new prescription once he's on the other side of the prison walls. The average waiting time to see a behavior health provider in Polk County, Iowa's most populous county, is about three months, and the wait is likely longer for those who live in rural areas with fewer medical resources. To address this glaring problem, Iowa is experimenting with an elegantly simple solution. Under the Central Pharmacy Pilot Project, an inmate is still given his 30-day supply of medication upon his release but is also handed prescriptions for an additional 60 days of medication. Those prescriptions--for everything from thiothixene for schizophrenia to hydroxyzine for anxiety--can be filled at one of 320 participating pharmacies around the state, at no cost to the inmate. ""We found that [the former inmates] were really struggling to get access,"" says Jon-Michael Rosmann, the executive director of the Iowa Prescription Drug Corp., a nonprofit that partnered with the state to launch the program. ""There are just a lot of things that have to occur. They have to find a place to live, find financial assistance, start a job search--and without access to their medication, the likelihood that all those will occur is incredibly low."" The logic is obvious. A newly released inmate is more likely to succeed in society if he doesn't have to make the transition without his meds. By extending the prescription, the government gives the former inmate the time he needs to secure his own medical care--either with the help of a re-entry program or on his own--and a better chance at making the difficult move back into society. (As an added bonus, the Iowa program also helps participants navigate the health care system so they have less to worry about once their 90-day medication supply is up.) The pilot program has been running for less than two years, but the early returns are promising. Through the program's first nine months--the last time the stats were compiled--none of the 165 participants had been charged with a violent crime in the first 90 days after his release, compared to 1.6 percent of a similar population of severely mentally ill former inmates who were not in the program. The gains were even more pronounced when it came to the type of smaller violations that can land an ex-con back in prison for violating the conditions of his release. Less than 3 percent of participants suffering from less severe but still chronic mental illnesses had their releases revoked, compared with 11.3 percent of nonparticipants with similar conditions. This is obviously a small population, in which a few cases could potentially skew the results. But it's a promising start, one that lines up with our intuition that providing medication to people who need it is good public policy. State spending on corrections quadrupled over the last two decades, making it the fastest-growing area of state budgets other than Medicaid, according to the Pew Center on the States. Together, states are spending more than $50 billion a year on their corrections systems, the bulk of which is funneled to prisons. It costs an average of about $33,000 a year to incarcerate someone in Iowa--that's $90.81 per day. Given that the state has spent an average of just $93.85 per participant in the pilot program, the initiative seems like a no-brainer, an outlay that will pay for itself if it keeps even a tiny percentage of inmates from reoffending. ""It's such a small investment with such huge returns,"" says Rosmann. ""And, obviously, it's the right thing to do."" The pilot program--originally launched with cash the state Attorney General's Office won in a pair of class-action suits against two large pharmacy benefit managers, and continued with a settlement from a different suit against a major drugmaker--is set to run for at least another three years. If its early success continues, there's no reason why other states shouldn't follow Iowa's lead. State governments might also consider making a relatively small investment upfront in the form of permanently free prescriptions for mentally ill ex-inmates. Sure, that would cost more than providing medication for 30 or 90 days. But that sort of expenditure would also help a lot of people, and it could help cut down on potentially huge prison bills at the same time."	An Obvious Way to Help Keep Ex-Cons Out of Prison That Pays for Itself

""You and me--let's go! I was actually considering dropping everything and going over there to be part of what's happening in Scotland."" Williams is a Vermont secessionist. As far as he knows, he is the only elected official in Vermont--he's on a school board--who avowedly favors the state's divorce from the union, a return to its pre-1791 status as an independent republic. The idea was starting to catch on in the Green Mountain State when George W. Bush was president. It faded after Barack Obama replaced him. The reasons were not mysterious. Then came the Scottish referendum. Secessionists like Williams had followed the Scottish National Party for years, as it first won concessions, then elections, then the right to an independence vote. In the last month, finally, polls showed the yes campaign creeping into a lead. If Scotland could secede, why not Vermont? ""The Scottish referendum has really captured a lot of attention and helped make secession look like a viable and sexy alternative to empire and centralization,"" says Williams. ""We're not talking about secession in Yemen or Sudan, or some place Americans consider less relatable. We're talking about Scotland! Making secession sexy in the West is fantastic. If the Scots do vote to secede, it proves that some Western nation under the yoke of empire can exercise its sovereignty and choose to leave."" It's been a while since secession fever broke out in America. The media hasn't been particularly interested in it since brief periods after Barack Obama's wins, when polls could find nearly half of Republicans in Texas or other red states ready to secede. In 2012, 80,000 Texans signed a nonbinding petition asking for secession; coverage of this did not always mention that more than 26 million people live in Texas. Still, the reasons for Scotland's crisis are the reasons why perfectly normal Americans become convinced that their states should leave the union. The reasons why it might fail are the reasons why the American secessionists are on a 149-year losing streak. ""I don't know what would be sufficient to really move people toward secession,"" says Kirkpatrick Sale. He should know: His Middlebury Institute has held multiple conferences on secession, and he's published books about the idea, full of arguments that have bounced right off the skulls of average Americans. ""If the condition of this country as it is today is not enough to make people want to leave it, I cannot tell you what would,"" says Sale. ""If you have no faith in your central government; if Congress has the support of 10 to 12 percent of the public; if the president's approval numbers are close to 30 percent in some states; I don't know why this resentment doesn't translate into secession, which is the only reliable peaceful way to make change."" Other secessionists are more hopeful. Start with the Texas Nationalist Movement, which has been in close contact with the Scottish nationalists for years, and which is currently using the referendum as a PR and recruitment tool. ""We are, here in Texas, where Scotland was many years ago,"" says Daniel Miller, president of the Texas group. ""People continually told the Scots that this can't happen, that this is a pipe dream. And then the people of Scotland put their minds to it. That's been one of the major recurring themes of our message--this is not just about Texas independence, but about how independence and self-determination are the global trends of our time."" Miller concedes that his Texans need to do far more of the legwork and math that Scottish nationalists did, to come up with proof--though they know it to be true--that an independent Texas would be wealthy and energy-independent. But Miller has led the Texas secessionists since 2001, from the time a Texan sat in the Oval Office--not ideal for recruitment--to the momentum-building reign of President Obama. His experiences, and the struggles of blue-state secessionists, have echoed in Scotland. Scottish voters roundly rejected the Conservative Party in 2010's national elections, giving them only one of 59 parliamentary constituencies. The Scottish National Party's leader, Alex Salmond, has promised Scots a social-democratic future for Scotland, one in which the Tories could never rule them. And it's worked--the yes vote finally surged as Labour voters became warmer to it. American secessionists realize that they need the luck of time and place. The Alaskan Independence Party has performed most strongly when voters have been angriest with the feds. Cascadia Now, a campaign to create a new country from the greenest parts of the Pacific coast, has attracted the most attention when it's looked like Republicans were going to ruin everything for Greater Portlandia. ""The most powerful moment we've had was when the government shut itself down,"" says Brandon Letsinger, director of Cascadia Now since 2005. ""We've never gotten more hits on our webpage than when that happened. If they can't get it together, maybe we need something else. So if the Republicans sweep both the House and the Senate, then I really expect our momentum will pick up and take off."" The Scottish referendum, according to Letsinger, is drawing up a ""great game plan to use in a future Casacadia 2020 campaign."" Ideally, it would happen in some Ted Cruz-run dystopia, from which liberals could not wait to flee. But dystopia may not be enough to shake people loose from the United States. For a little while in the Bush years, a group called Christian Exodus attempted to gather a critical mass of believers to build a new society and country out of a red state. They tried South Carolina for a while, then Idaho. Then, they moved on to a campaign of ""personal secession"" at home and nullification of federal laws in the states. Ask Christian Exodus' old executive director Keith Humphrey and he'll tell you: Secession was never going to work. ""The people who could have made it work had places to live, commitments at home,"" he says. ""They couldn't move. The people willing to move were the kind that had nothing left to lose. They'd already burned bridges with family and friends. They were not very employable. They were not ready for self-government, because many of them were getting government benefits."" Humphrey laughs at the debacle. ""All these people who love liberty, and they're on food stamps! How do you reconcile that ideal with that reality? If all the people involved have a socialistic mindset, then you can't tell them they're better off going independent."" That wasn't the only problem. In the South, says Humphrey, too many of the would-be-secessionists' neighbors held a ""reflexive support for war overseas."" Sure, it didn't help that the go-to story of secession was the Civil War, and that in South Carolina and beyond, secessionists were tarred whenever the League of the South gave them a call. The larger, existential problem was that secessionists were trying to create a smaller and more isolationist country that would not, to use Kirkpatrick Sale's term, continue ""the empire."" That's a deal-breaker for the average American conservative. It's less of a problem for secession-curious progressives. It's just no problem at all in Scotland, where Salmond and the SNP have said, for years, that a newly independent country would say no to foreign wars. ""We're facing a breaking point in the econ system when it'll be impossible to pay for entitlements, starting with Obamacare,"" says Humphrey. ""The future that we've been talking about is coming true. For years, people would mock us and say, ha-ha, look how crazy those Christians are. Now it's not crazy."""	Scotland Is Inspiring Secessionists Across America
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/corporal_punishment_in_black_culture_what_charles_barkley_doesn_t_understand.html	"I'm guessing that Charles Barkley delivered exactly what CBS's producers hoped for when they invited him on The NFL Today this past Sunday. Barkley came on the football pregame show to talk about race and corporal punishment in the wake of Adrian Peterson's arrest on allegations that he abused his 4-year-old son by repeatedly striking his bare skin with a switch. Asked whether it was ever permissible to hit a child, the highly quotable NBA Hall of Famer suggested that not only is it OK to do so, but that the practice is so common in parts of the country as to be unremarkable. ""Whipping--we do that all the time,"" the Alabama native said, adding that if corporal punishment were made illegal, ""every black parent in the South is going to be in jail under those circumstances."" Barkley's was the loudest voice in a chorus of those who came forward to support Peterson. But the problem is that Barkley and the rest of the NFL star's supporters have offered exposition without explanation--they are describing something that happens without addressing why it happens, let alone making a convincing case for why it should continue. Barkley's circular logic comes down to: It's OK to hit your child in the name of discipline because many parents hit their children in the name of discipline. Such thinking is not only illogical--it's also dangerous. To understand why, we first need to address the uncomfortable truth contained in Barkley's remarks. The perception that black parents are more likely to employ corporal punishment than their nonblack counterparts is borne out by academic research. In one study that examined 20,000 kindergartners and their parents, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin found that 89 percent of black parents had spanked their children, compared with 79 percent of white parents, 80 percent of Hispanic parents, and 73 percent of Asian parents. There is no single reason why blacks are more likely to turn to the rod for discipline, but the numbers are correlated with factors that include socio-economic status, religious upbringing, and even the heartbreaking feeling that, as it's often put, ""I'd rather my child get a beating from me than from police."" Still, it's important to note that while black parents might be more likely to spank their kids, they're not alone in raising a hand to administer punishment--the rates for white, Hispanic, and Asian parents in that University of Texas study are all above 70 percent. In a Harris poll conducted last year, 81 percent of respondents said it was sometimes ""appropriate"" to spank their kids, with 67 percent of those who took part in the survey admitting they had done so to their own children. As Daphne S. Cain, an associate professor at Louisiana State University's School of Social Work, has written: ""Corporal punishment is not counter to mainstream parenting practices; it is actually the norm."" Support for corporal punishment--which remains legal in much of the United States--is all the more surprising given the mounting evidence that it can have negative impacts on both the child and the larger community, and that doesn't even consider the parents, like Peterson, who go far beyond any possible definition of ""disciplining their children."" Why, then, does corporal punishment have such staying power? One possible explanation may lie in a string of studies that suggest the negative psychological impacts on the child are actually less pronounced in communities where corporal punishment is more common. Put another way, a kid is less likely to feel ashamed and singled out if all the other children in his neighborhood are getting spanked too. That may sound counterintuitive at first, but the explanation likely lies in the reasons that corporal punishment tends to cause psychological problems in the first place. In short, the context of the punishment can matter as much if not more than the punishment itself. (It's worth noting here, as Slate parenting columnist Melinda Wenner Moyer has previously, that there is room for some nuance in the debate: Whipping a child with a switch will likely result in a far worse psychological outcome than a light spanking delivered over the clothes with an open hand.) Some researchers believe that if a kid sees his spanking as unusual--a ""non-normative experience,"" in psychological parlance--he may be more likely to interpret it as a sign of parental rejection, which in turn fuels his anxiety and aggressiveness, the most common psychological problems associated with corporal punishment. So, does the fact that spanking is more common in black communities mean that black children won't suffer adverse consequences from corporal punishment? Jennifer E. Lansford, an associate research professor at the Social Science Research Institute at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy, cautions not to go that far. ""The effects may not be as pronounced for children in black communities, but let me be clear: The negative effects are still there,"" she says. If the consequences are less pronounced in a particular community, though, then it stands to reason that the community will be less likely to view physical punishment as a problem. And so the cycle fuels itself: The more a community embraces spanking, the more children are spanked, the less social stigma there is attached to the act, the less children feel ashamed and preyed upon, the less likely the community sees it as a problem that needs to be addressed, the more parents embrace spanking. That cycle is only exacerbated by how Barkley and his fellow Peterson supporters are talking about corporal punishment. One recent study of more than 100 children and their parents, for example, found that every parent who approved of spanking a child for hitting a sibling passed that belief on to his kids. Few of us want to admit that our parents were doing something wrong when they were, quite likely, doing what they thought was best. And so we refuse to consider that we turned out all right in spite of the spankings, not because of them. Perhaps the best example of how we should be talking about corporal punishment came from a different NFL pregame show. On ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown, Cris Carter--who, like Peterson, played for the Vikings--delivered an emotional speech that proved it was possible to avoid blaming our parents while still promising not to make the same mistakes they did. ""My mom did the best job she could do, raising seven kids by herself,"" an emotional Carter said. ""But there are thousands of things that I have learned since then that my mom was wrong. It's the 21st century. My mom was wrong. She did the best she could, but she was wrong about some of that stuff she taught me. And I promise my kids I won't teach that mess to them."" To put an end to corporal punishment, we need more Cris Carters and fewer Charles Barkleys. The only way to stop this vicious cycle is to understand that just because everyone is doing it, that doesn't mean it's right."	What Charles Barkley Gets Wrong About Corporal Punishment and Black Culture

It was hard to tell which was more pregnant. Clinton didn't mention her candidacy directly, but in her first visit to the state since her third-place showing in the 2008 caucuses, she made a succession of coy references. ""Of course there's that other thing,"" she said after talking about how she and her husband were consumed with the prospect of their first grandchild. ""Well it is true, I am thinking about it, but for today that is not why I'm here. I'm here for the steak."" There were a few other nods and winks and Clinton concluded by saying, ""Let's not let another seven years go by."" The audience of 10,000 got the joke. As they filed out, I asked James Hanifen, a World War II veteran, if he thought, based on what he'd heard, that she was running for president. ""It's obvious she is. I mean, unless you're really, really dumb."" The Clinton campaign has been conceived and everyone is just waiting around for the birth announcement. That makes it murky to assess the Clinton candidacy. You can hardly judge a couple's parenting skills before the baby arrives. Though that doesn't stop the criticisms. The conventional complaint among Democratic campaign veterans and strategists who are not in the Clinton camp is that she has not developed a message and a rationale for her candidacy. She's running on the fact that it's her turn. Inevitability is deadly for candidates. That critique is wildly premature. Not only has the official campaign where she could articulate a vision not started, but even when it does, Clinton is a prohibitive front-runner of a kind we have not seen in this century, which means she has time to get her act together. But, if she has time, there were plenty of signs that she was working to fix the problems of the past and address the challenges of the present. During the last campaign, one of the criticisms in Iowa was that she was too removed from voters. So as she worked the rope line on the balloon field, she shook hands, signed copies of her book, and leaned into selfies for far longer than if she'd just been there to pay tribute to retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, the ostensible reason for the visit. There were also other signs behind the scenes. Interviews with Clinton allies have a similarity to them, as if there's been an effort to get everyone on the same page. You get answers to questions you haven't raised about her ability to connect with middle-class voters and why she'll do better in Iowa this time. If you ask an open-ended question about the challenges facing the next president--whoever that might be--they describe a future with a Hillary-shaped hole in it. When Clinton spoke, other than bouts of presidential peekaboo, the clearest indication she was running came when she tried to bolt her life story onto the life story of Sen. Harkin, the progressive hero who had brought everyone to that hillside. ""When I got to know Tom and Ruth, I recognized from them the same values that I learned from my own parents,"" she said, before telling the story of her mother's difficult childhood, which taught her the lesson that people need a second chance. ""That was one of the most important lessons of my life and I know that it was for Tom and Ruth as well. They have never forgotten where they came from, who they are, and what they want to do: to open doors and to put that ladder up for others. They've actually lived that lesson. Now Tom keeps score in politics the same way that Bill and I do: We ask ourselves, are people better for your efforts? Do children have brighter futures, do we find ways to work together instead of working apart and divided?"" Clinton was letting the crowd know that while she may have multiple homes and great wealth now, she comes from the same place they and their progressive hero come from. If she were simply in that balloon field to promote other candidates and herald Harkin, she wouldn't have put this riff into her speech. (Also, those Hillaryland sources regularly cite her mother as the locus of her groundedness.) Clinton echoed the origin story that Harkin had told minutes before about his father who had found dignity and hope during the Great Depression by working for the Works Progress Administration. He keeps his father's WPA card on the wall in his office as a reminder that ""with the right people in office and the willingness to work, our country can do the right thing for people."" The day was designed to pay tribute to Harkin and to promote the Democrats running for election this November, but it was also a celebration of activist government, born in the Depression, aimed at ""the least, the lost, and the left behind,"" as Harkin put it. It is members of the Harkin wing of the party who have suspicions about Clinton. They worry she is from the Goldman Sachs wing of the party, too influenced by wealthy elites. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, says his organization won't back the former secretary of state until they can vet her economic team to make sure that it's not filled with Wall Street insiders. It's an issue she needs to address, and while Clinton talked about her mother, it would have been easy to do much more. She could have really sung the song of Tom Harkin and the power of activist government, which would have delighted the crowd without boxing her in to future commitments. (She's not a declared candidate, after all.) Harkin certainly tried to do just that, boasting that Clinton's ""fingerprints were all over"" the Affordable Care Act, because of her past work on the issue. She didn't really say anything terribly moving on that score. Hillary Clinton was also overshadowed by her husband who followed her on stage as protocol demands for a former president. Bill Clinton was really only in the mid-range of his talents, but his easy, sometimes rambling but accessible speech is just a far more entertaining product in the bright sunlight. ""Bill's still got it,"" a group of women repeated to each other after he left the stage. I asked a man passing by what he thought of the afternoon. ""She's no Bill,"" he said. That's always going to be the case, but it's not clear that it really matters. It's theater review--those who fawn over Bill can list a series of Hillary Clinton's strengths they admire. The overwhelming majority on that hillside were thrilled to see Hillary Clinton, and she received the largest applause of the day. Afterward, lots of people I talked to were thrilled by her. Of course that's in part because the audience was boosted by Ready for Hillary, the super PAC urging her to run. The organization was everywhere: on billboards, on the back of a bus, and on the buttons and T-shirts of the college students organized for the event. The whole Ready for Hillary organization has the relentless cheer of that friend of yours who starts preparing for the New Year's Eve party in June. There were plenty of people in the audience who didn't need to be wowed by Clinton. They were already on her team because they think she will deliver on the issues that matter to them most. I asked Iowan Angie Collins why she liked Hillary and she jumped right over the political this-and-that and got right to what matters to her: her daughter. ""I'm very middle class. Just recently my daughter broke her arm and we didn't have insurance. No doctor would see her. I had to fight to get a real cast on her. I spent all day going to different doctors and emergency rooms. I shouldn't have to do that for my daughter. She should never be turned away just because I'm not making enough money."" If there was one dark note for Hillary Clinton it was among a handful of voters I talked to who worried about the Clinton baggage. ""I like Hillary, but I'm not sure I'm ready for Hillary,"" said Rose Mary Prat, 66, who wore a shirt from Harkin's 1972 campaign. ""I didn't like the resurrection of the Clinton White House the last time [she ran]. It gives the opposition more reasons to be negative or divisive. It won't lead to common ground. Do we have to go back and revisit all of it? That's a political reality. A fresh face, that's what I'm looking for."" A constant theme of the day had been moving forward in the 2014 elections, which sounded a little discordant against a potential candidacy that will contain so many figures from the political past. ""It's great to look back,"" said Ruth Harkin, ""but don't stare."" But then, it was a day for inconsistencies. The steaks are grilled, not fried, at the Steak Fry. Another woman, who declined to give her name because she worried she was being too candid and interesting, said her biggest worry was that ""they'll beat her up in the campaign and never elect her."" Hellen Hanifer took her thumb and pushed it downward like she was driving in a flathead thumb tack. ""They'll drive her down. The old boys network does not want to let a woman in power."" The younger generation didn't seem so concerned about this, though at times it was hard to tell if they weren't just happy to be out in the field on a beautiful Sunday. A few of them fashioned one of the ""Ready to Vote"" signs into an airplane. (Those signs were the nod the ""Ready for Hillary"" folks made to the fact that the day was supposed to be about 2014 candidates.) They made several hearty attempts to get the plane to fly, but no matter how hard they pushed it or creased its wings, the plane nosedived. With a day so purposefully pregnant with meaning, it was hard not to see symbols everywhere. But there was nothing in Clinton's perfectly successful return to Iowa to suggest this was an omen. Perhaps it was a re-enactment of Clinton's last Iowa campaign, which the once and future candidate has now begun the process of expelling."	The Final Days of the Unofficial Hillary Clinton Campaign

Thank you! Life is full of disappoints, and I'm sorry for being the latest person to remind you of this. Also, I'm sorry to be packing up at Slate. That's no reflection on my next job. It's a tribute to my favorite magazine, a place I dreamed of writing for, a place that then hired me to cover politics, from the living rooms of Tea Party activists to the hastily organized filing troughs of the 2012 presidential debates. Slate's political coverage has been sharp and world-beating since the Internet was wee. I've been taking sepia-toned tours of the old politics archives to figure out why. Where to start? I discovered Slate during the Clinton impeachment, when I was a teenager going to high school in England. (Dad's job relocated him for a few years. No, I did not have to wear a tie or master wand-craft.) This was a depressing time to be an American anywhere, much less a place where everyone who heard your accent offered the same icebreaker, but Slate's coverage of ""Flytrap"" was a real solace. There was no hefty moralizing. Seth Stevenson's column defending the behavior of the president and his paramour, which called Clinton's fidelity ""a promise we never should have asked for,"" put into words what a 16-year-old me couldn't say coherently. Yet I didn't become a real political junkie until the 2000 election. (I was not just a voter, but an elector, in the state of Delaware for Ralph Nader. Iraq war? My fault.) The first Slate column I remember engaging with, as opposed to just reading, was Josh Marshall's pundit-beating assessment of why Hillary Clinton should not be the 2004 Democratic candidate. ""George W. Bush beat Gore by almost 2-to-1 among white males,"" Marshall wrote, ""and if we're talking about voters in Ohio, western Pennsylvania, or Missouri, do you think candidate Hillary Clinton improves on that score?"" Here was clean, data-reliant logic that mocked the conceits of my-gut-tells-me punditry. For the same reason, I turned into a fan of Mickey Kaus, whose Feiler Faster Thesis has remained one of the truest conceits about politics and news. I cheerfully ripped off Kaus' style of adding errata to the bottom of posts and challenging stupid ideas with a bracketed note from a ghostly ""editor."" And if Kaus' theory of the ""undernews"" made sense before 2008, the John Edwards scandal--which he was right about, when lots of true believers were wrong--should have landed it in J-school syllabi. This was what I loved (and love) about Slate--great ideas could come in short bursts or in long takes. Chris Suellentrop's coverage of the 2004 election discovered small moments during the parts of rallies that other reporters might have ignored while they were filing their ""Bush slams Kerry"" ledes. ""The Bush Pledge"" is a great example of Sullentropiana. In 2008, Noreen Malone schlepped around Amish country to profile voters that only she and the campaigns were paying attention to. During my time here, Will Saletan wrote at great length about Mitt Romney's conversion on abortion, and managed to be fresh and definitive on a story you might have thought was overcovered. And Slate is funny about an often draining and pointless pastime. I often revisit Chris Beam's 2010 story that purposefully drained all the drama from politics by imagining how political scientists would cover it. (""Democrats have also slipped in their standing among 'independent voters.' That phrase, by the way, is meaningless. Voters may self-identify as 'independent' but in almost all cases they lean toward one party."") Whenever John Dickerson writes about the tropes of Washington itself, he explains why its people are able to fight so bitterly about nothing. The momentum of daily journalism assumes action, but sometimes every trend is pointing at inaction. Sometimes, as Emma Roller wrote about the ""knockout game,"" or Jack Shafer wrote about lots of things, politics can be driven by something that's utterly faux. This hasn't been a list of the ""best of Slate politics."" (If that's what you thought you clicked on, here you go.) This is what I've loved about Slate for 14-odd years. This is what Slate has done brilliantly, and what former Slate-sters have taken with them into other publications, like nanites being injected into new hosts. This nanite will keep on reading.

A growing number of school districts, including ones in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Miami, are committing to keep meat off the menu for one day a week to combat childhood obesity. These ""Meatless Monday"" initiatives have drawn the ire of America's beef, poultry, and pork interests, which see them as the first, flesh-free volley in a war against America's meat peddlers. The less-meat movement has also proved to be a flashpoint for elected officials, namely those from farm states, who seem to be placing the economic interests of their home-state industries above the health and wellbeing of their states' populaces. This story played out somewhat quietly on the national stage several years ago, when a few grandstanding politicians caught wind of an interoffice newsletter at the U.S. Department of Agriculture suggesting employees consider eating less meat. Now, it's getting more attention at the local level. This week Todd Staples, the head of Texas' Agriculture Department, unleashed a blistering--if largely fact-free--jeremiad against the Meatless Monday movement after learning that it had been enacted by elementary schools in Dripping Springs, an Austin suburb. (He was apparently unaware that several schools in Houston have been experimenting with the idea for some time.) ""Restricting children's meal choice to not include meat is irresponsible and has no place in our schools,"" Staples wrote in an op-ed published by the Austin American-Statesman. ""This activist movement called 'Meatless Monday' is a carefully orchestrated campaign that seeks to eliminate meat from Americans' diets seven days a week--starting with Mondays."" Dun dun DUN! An elected official like Staples can, of course, stake out a position that aligns with a particular industry without simply being a mouthpiece for it. But the agriculture commissioner's overblown rhetoric echoes the official company line of the meat industry, which has filled his campaign coffers with at least $116,000 since 2010, according to public records. It's hard to fault meat producers for wanting people to eat more meat. It's a different story, though, when someone like Staples spouts such talking points at a time when the nation is battling both an obesity epidemic and a global climate crisis--two problems driven, at least in part, by resource-intensive meat production. In some corners of the country, neither of those concerns is seen as much of a reason to impose mandates from above. The irony here is that the Dripping Springs initiative is a local one--the very type of decision that small-government advocates say is under attack from the national school-lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama. ""Are we having a war on meat in Dripping Springs? Definitely not,"" John Crowley, the head of nutrition services for the school district, told a local CBS affiliate this week. ""We're trying to think outside the box, and we serve a lot of Texas beef on our menus. We've had requests for more vegetarian options, and I thought, 'Why don't I give it a try and see how it's received by kids?' "" This is a message that kids should be receiving. According to the 2011 National Survey of Children's Health, nearly one-third of American kids are either overweight or obese, a classification linked to Type 2 diabetes and myriad other health problems. The meat industry, meanwhile, is one of the top contributors to climate change, with the United Nations estimating that it directly or indirectly produces about 14.5 percent of the world's anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Everyone from the American Heart Association to the Norwegian military has touted the health and environmental benefits of eating less meat. Such endorsements mean little to Staples and his meat-minded allies, who either downplay or downright deny the benefits of curbing meat consumption. But their dire warnings of The End of Meat aside, their argument also fails on a smaller scale. Opponents routinely overlook the fact that meatless meals are not by definition protein-free, a claim at the heart of Staples' op-ed. ""It is important to remember that for many underprivileged children the meals they eat at school often represents their best meals of the day,"" the Republican commissioner wrote. ""To deprive them of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day."" That makes no sense given that Meatless Monday menus include items like bean-and-cheese burritos and cheese pizza, meals that come with a hefty serving of protein--and, thanks to dairy, animal protein at that. Meanwhile, the national school lunch program requires schools to offer a weekly menu that meets a minimum threshold for protein, so a Dripping Springs student who goes meatless on Monday is in little danger of being protein-deprived come Friday. Kids who want a ham sandwich, meanwhile, are still welcome to bring one from home--and there are obviously no restrictions on what a child can eat outside school. The participating cafeterias, meanwhile, continue to serve up a variety of meats the rest of the week. Following Staples' logic will take you to an absurd place. If a lunch menu is an edict from on high as he suggests, then when a cafeteria serves a hamburger but not a hot dog, it is ""forcing"" kids to eat beef while ""denying"" them pork--or any number of food items not on that particular day's menu, for that matter, be it chicken, fish, or a tarragon shallot egg salad sandwich with a side of butternut squash soup with chestnuts. As commissioner, Staples oversees the agency that administers the school lunch programs in his state. There appears to be little he can do, at least formally, to stop the cafeterias' Meatless Mondays from spreading their steak-free sentiments across the rest of Texas. ""As long as [the schools] follow the requirements of the National School Lunch Program, they can serve anything they want,"" says Humane Society of the United States food policy director Eddie Garza, who worked with the Dripping Springs cafeterias to implement the program. ""Staples doesn't have any real weight on this other than writing op-eds."" While Staples' formal power may be limited, his industry allies have managed to score meaty victories in the past. Last summer they managed to squash a small-scale Meatless Monday program in Capitol Hill cafeterias in a matter of days by branding it ""an acknowledged tool of animal rights and environmental organizations who seek to publicly denigrate U.S. livestock and poultry production."" One of their more notable wins came in 2012, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture published that interoffice newsletter. It read, in part: ""One simple way to reduce your environmental impact while dining at our cafeterias is to participate in the 'Meatless Monday' initiative."" The backlash from the industry--and the backtracking from the agency that followed--was strong and instantaneous. Almost immediately after the National Cattlemen's Beef Association publicly voiced its anger, farm-state lawmakers like Iowa Republicans Chuck Grassley and Steve King scrambled to fall in line. Sen. Grassley tweeted, ""I will eat more meat on Monday to compensate for stupid USDA recommendation [about] a meatless Monday."" Rep. King was even more specific with his plan, promising to stage his own ""double rib-eye Mondays"" in protest. ""With extreme drought conditions plaguing much of the United States, the USDA should be more concerned about helping drought-stricken producers rather than demonizing an industry reeling from the lack of rain,"" Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran told Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement that appeared all the more short-sighted given the realities of climate change. Before the day was out, the newsletter was taken offline, and the USDA issued a statement saying that it ""does not endorse Meatless Monday."" The newsletter--which also offered a variety of other small-scale energy-efficiency tips for agency employees--""was posted without proper clearance,"" according to the department. Unwilling to forgive and forget, Staples chimed in by calling for the employee who wrote the newsletter to be fired, calling the very suggestion that people eat less meat ""treasonous."" ""Last I checked,"" Staples said then, ""USDA had a very specific duty to promote and champion American agriculture. Imagine Ford or Chevy discouraging the purchase of their pickup trucks. Anyone else see the absurdity? How about the betrayal?"" That type of twisted logic only works in a world where agriculture officials serve the food industry and not the American public. Unfortunately, that feels like it's the case all too often."	"No, ""Meatless Monday"" Is Not an Evil Plot to Deprive Our Children of Steak, Pork, and Chicken"

Right now, the conversation doesn't look like it is going to make us any smarter. Polls show that Americans are scared and want action. In a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, more of those surveyed said the United States is less safe now than at any point since 9/11. In a Pew poll, 62 percent said they were very concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world--the largest percentage to say so since 2007. A somewhat smaller majority (53 percent) is very concerned about the same problem in the United States--tying a record high. Republicans say the president has been too slow to act, and Democrats are rushing to agree. Out of this moment broad foreign policy conclusions are being drawn. The conventional wisdom is that the pendulum has swung too far after the presidency of George W. Bush, and now it must swing back toward a more assertive foreign policy. Whether the topic is Syria, Islamic extremism, or Russia, actions are increasingly being framed around showing weakness or strength. When Americans are being beheaded, no one wants to be accused of weakness, so there's not much discussion about what actual weakness or strength means in a given context. That's the kind of chin-pulling that makes Obama ineffective; the incentive is just to ""show strength""--whatever that means. The public mood has switched quickly in favor of military action. Two-thirds of Americans believe that it is in the nation's interest to confront ISIS. Thirty-four percent of the country is even in favor of the use of ground troops. A year ago, when the president considered taking action against Syria for using chemical weapons, only 21 percent said the action was even in the national interest. The president's numbers have also fallen sharply. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, just 32 percent approve of the president's handling of foreign policy, an all-time low in the survey. The GOP has an 18-point advantage on which party can handle foreign policy issues, an 11-point increase from a year ago. Republicans hold a 38-point lead among voters when they are asked which party best ensures a strong national defense. That's the GOP's largest lead on this question in more than 10 years. In the latest Washington Post poll, the president hit a new low on the question of leadership. Just 43 percent call Obama a strong leader, down 11 points in the past year to the lowest level of his presidency. What this political pressure means in practical terms is that the signals to show strength in order to survive politically are coming in much stronger than the signals to evaluate foreign policy action based on the merits, an evaluation of national interest and prudence. If the public thinks the unpopular president is too contemplative and cautious, you must do the other thing. Or at least you must sound like you are, through pledges of action and boasts of resolve, all of which reaffirm the underlying move toward displays of strength. So, for example, it has now become conventional wisdom that Obama should have armed the Syrian opposition long ago. If he had, perhaps ISIS would not have grown to such a threat. The Wall Street Journal says it, Hillary Clinton says it, and Dick Cheney says it. Democratic senators trying to stay alive in a tough year are echoing the claim or piling on. Sen. Kay Hagan, in her first debate in North Carolina, said Obama should have supported the opposition. Democrats are not only criticizing the president's speed in the past, but his understanding of the threat facing the country. Sen. Al Franken said he was troubled that the president said he didn't have a strategy for combating ISIS. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said she disagreed with Obama's characterization that ISIS is ""manageable."" The president now faces the accusation, ratified by members of his own party, that he took his eye off the ball, one of the strongest critiques of his predecessor. After the president's speech, Hagan and Shaheen gave him qualified support, stressing that they were going to press him to use every tool short of ground troops to take on ISIS. There were significant risks to arming the Syrian opposition when it was first debated several years ago. The ""good rebels"" were hard to identify, the arms might fall into the hands of ISIS and other jihadist groups, and the United States has a poor track record for backing resistance movements. The research shows it leads to costlier and longer wars. Indeed, Sen. Rand Paul criticizes the president for the limited arms he provided the Syrian rebels at all--he says the support ended up in ISIS's hands--which is the exact opposite position of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page. If two of the president's chief critics can't even agree on the chain of causation in Syria, that suggests the issue is a little more complicated than it is being presented. Will that complexity be debated? Sen. Mark Begich, an endangered Democratic senator from Alaska, said he did not approve of arming the Syrian opposition. ""We must have greater assurance that we aren't arming extremists who will eventually use the weapons against us."" In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall, who also faces a tough re-election, said, ""I will not give this president ... a blank check to begin another land war."" The president didn't just start a new military phase of the war on terrorism; he started a new round in the foreign policy conversation. He was brought to office by a war-weary nation. Now the polls suggest the nation is tired of him. For the moment that means the country is looking for a more assertive foreign policy. Whether that is a permanent new condition depends on future violence and success. But at the moment the incentive is for most politicians to make declarations of strength to distinguish themselves from the unpopular incumbent. The presidential candidates in 2016 will be particularly emboldened, since they traditionally run as an antidote to the perceived deficiencies of the current occupant. That's certainly the way Sen. Barack Obama won office. If his overcorrection was born in his simplistic response to the deficiencies of his predecessor, then judging by the way this current foreign policy debate is going so far, it likely contains the seeds of the next overcorrection."	Our Next Presidential Candidates Will Take the Wrong Lessons From Obama's War on ISIS
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/zephyr_teachout_larry_lessig_and_progressive_candidates_the_left_has_new.html	"Zephyr Teachout only wanted to say hello. It was Saturday morning, the start of New York City's Labor Day parade, four days before the Democratic primary, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo's challenger thought she might enable their only human interaction of the campaign. The Cuomo campaign, which extends to most of the state's governing party, had spent the day before accusing Teachout and her running mate Tim Wu of refusing to ""stand strong with Israel"" and--worse, perhaps--of being ""professors."" (The latter charge was true.) So when Teachout and Wu spotted Cuomo and his running mate, Kathy Hochul, they decided to greet them and move on. ""We've been running against each other for three months now,"" Teachout told me later, ""and I figured it might be the last time we were in the same place together. It seemed like a courtesy."" The blogger and reporter John Kenny filmed what happened next. Cuomo's aide John Percoco blocked Teachout, briefly, and when he moved to wrangle cameras, Teachout tapped Hochul on the shoulder. The candidate for lieutenant governor did not respond. Cuomo looked to the side, beckoning New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio--""Where's the mayor when you need him?""--as Teachout bit her lip. In a separate encounter, Wu was able to elicit a handshake and a ""good to see you!"" from his governor, as Rep. Carolyn Maloney, one of the Democrats who'd accused the challengers as not ""clear about their support for Israel,"" spoke sotto voce to Hochul. For at least the second time in a short primary season, Cuomo had made an unforced error and gifted Teachout with free media coverage. Previously, instead of ignoring an opponent that had run no TV ads and raised a fraction of his $30 million, Cuomo backed a legal challenge to Teachout's residency. The result: A surge of free media for Teachout. This time, instead of a mostly harmless photo of two candidates making nice, New York media got a story about a hubristic, brittle incumbent acting like a Mean Girl. He was asked about The Diss at three successive press conferences. ""Tim Wu said you failed a basic test of decency,"" said one reporter at an event in Midtown. ""I never saw her,"" said Cuomo. ""If anything, I failed an eyesight test."" Cuomo's failure, if that's what you want to call it, will make Tuesday's primaries an unexpected test of explicitly progressive, explicitly ""anti-corruption"" politics. In New Hampshire, Harvard professor Larry Lessig's Mayday PAC has spent more than $1.6 million to promote Jim Rubens, a conservative Republican running on campaign finance reform, in a primary against Massachusetts immigrant-turned-Senate candidate Scott Brown. In Rhode Island, progressives have complicated--but may not squelch--the ambitions of a Democratic candidate for governor who made her name by cutting state pensions. In New York, Teachout has become a phenomenon, with fellow veterans of the Howard Dean presidential campaign, celebrities, and even the New York Times buying into her case against Cuomo. The Times did not actually endorse Teachout (it did endorse Wu), but it gave her campaign theme a crucial assist. She and Wu were in the race, but getting little attention, until a blockbuster July story in the Times revealed how Cuomo had created an independent commission to investigate corruption (""The politicians in Albany won't like it!"") and shuttered it when it got too close to his own Dumpsters. Still, the press does not automatically spend time on primary challengers with little money and no polling that says they might win. Cuomo's hubristic attacks on Teachout--who, to date, he has not mentioned by name--backfired completely, and according to people familiar with internal polling, Cuomo might lose more than 30 percent of the vote to a first-time candidate. For comparison, in 2006, Hillary Clinton lost only 19 percent of the vote on her left flank to Jonathan Tasini, a writer and organizer who attacked her then-raw vote for the war in Iraq. Teachout has used her moment to talk about the very nature of government and how people interact with it. The Internet, she says, creates giant-killing networks that traditional power cannot see coming, and cannot stop--the ""fracktivists,"" for example, who want to leave natural gas in the ground. ""New York State was supposed to have hydrofracking just like every other shale-rich state,"" Teachout told reporter Nancy Scola last week. ""And they stopped it, without Big Green, without big national politicians, without mainstream media. They stopped it through a network of listservs, really."" Lessig's PAC had not planned to endorse Teachout. Mayday was targeting federal races. But on Aug. 13, Lessig asked Mayday supporters to back Teachout, ""the most important anti-corruption candidate in any race in America today."" ""He is our (Democrats') Nixon,"" Lessig described Cuomo this week, after the Diss video went viral. ""Why can't we make him our Eric Cantor? Because to revive this democracy enough to give anyone under 40 a reason to care would require as much. In a literal sense of the word, it is possible. There are more than enough New York Democrats connected to these tubes to defeat Cuomo."" Meanwhile, just north of New York, Lessig's PAC and its supporters were trying to elect a Republican senator. Jim Rubens, a former state senator in New Hampshire, had been floating in the single digits and collecting endorsements from conservative and libertarian groups. Mayday's spending gave him a race. In a Public Policy Polling survey conducted the week before the primary, Scott Brown led Rubens by a 53-24 margin and 71 percent of Republicans agreed that a candidate in favor of ""reducing the amount of money in politics"" would get their votes. (Bob Smith, an unpredictable former senator who moved to Florida for a while, is also in the race.) That did not happen overnight. Lessig met Rubens on Oct. 23, 2013, at an event sponsored by the anti-corruption New Hampshire Rebellion. ""Larry Lessig and I batted some ideas back and forth before he started Mayday,"" Rubens told me. ""I passed my concept of the voucher system, a tax rebate that could be spent on campaigns, and he was kind enough to provide me comments. So I polished that idea up a bit."" Like Teachout, Rubens got a boost from his opponent's out-of-nowhere hubris. Mayday's buy in New Hampshire included mailers to Republican voters informing them that Scott Brown was a ""former Washington lobbyist"" who ""refuses to sign a pledge limiting special interest money in elections."" Two days before the primary, Brown's campaign issued a cease-and-desist letter to Lessig, which it shared with reporters. That did not succeed in stopping the ads. It succeeded in reviving the question about what Brown did when he became a ""business and governmental affairs"" expert at a lobbying firm. Within a day, reporters armed with shaky cameras were getting on Brown's nerves about this. But Brown's likely to win. So is Cuomo. So is Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island's treasurer, in a race that progressives worry that they could have won. In a September 2013 profile by Matt Taibbi, progressives outside Rhode Island got to know Raimondo as the ambitious Wall Streeter who handed 14 percent of the state's pensions to hedge funds. Her Gov. Chris Christie-style campaign of real-talk town hall meetings, where she sold her plan to raise the retirement age and cap cost-of-living adjustments for pensions, was bolstered by $700,000 from a mysterious group that folded as soon as Raimondo succeeded. This was a candidate progressives wanted to make into an example. Raimondo's strongest challenger appeared to be Angel Taveras, Providence's mayor, who went after the front-runner by relentlessly attacking financiers. ""Wall Street values?"" asked Taveras in one of his first ads. ""They make money off of your hard work. I believe we're all in this together."" In his closing TV ad, Taveras repeated that ""pensions need to be protected from Wall Street."" But Taveras did not get a one-on-one race against Raimondo. Clay Pell, the grandson of the senator best known for his eponymous Pell grants, jumped into the race with a standard ""outsider"" pitch. Taveras and Raimondo fought over the specifics of pension reform, with trade unions generally getting behind her as AFSCME got behind the mayor. Teacher's unions, which (understandably) soured on Taveras after he fired every teacher in the city, sided with Pell. The result may be a Raimondo win. The struggles she had--like Cuomo's struggles, like Brown's sudden irritation--represent a new kind of reform politics that got a late start this year. No problem. There's always another election."	Can the Progressives Strike Back?
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/hillary_clinton_visits_iowa_voters_hope_for_change_but_midterm_elections.html	"The Iowa State Fair is over, but the circus is coming to town. On Sept. 14, Hillary and Bill Clinton will attend the 37th annual Harkin Steak Fry, the famous Iowa political event named after Sen. Tom Harkin. A mess of journalists will rush after the couple, looking for signs of a presidential campaign and drawing conclusions on the nearest barn wall. (It is fitting that the event takes place on a hot air balloon field.) But there will also be thousands of normal human beings in that Indianola field, extending their phones like periscopes to capture one or both of the Clintons as they pledge allegiance before a vast flag or pretend to cook steak on a grill that's almost as large. The press will be there to cover the hype (and create it), but the people sinking their folding chairs into the grass during the political speeches will be there for the hope. It is the engine that drives all presidential campaigns. Voters are exhausted with Washington politicians debating one another in adjacent boxes on TV, but they can still be thrilled by a presidential candidate walking in the fall air. Some will have brought their kids so they can get a glimpse of perhaps the first female president. That's not simply a change from the previous president, but from the 227 years there will have been presidents. But is this the beginning or the end of something? This will be Harkin's last steak fry--the senator is retiring after five terms, and there's a tough fight to replace him. The winner will become a freshman in a body that is drastically different than the one Harkin entered--different even than the one Hillary Clinton joined in 2001. It is partisan and deadlocked, and the election of 2014 will show us why it's likely to stay that way. The structure of modern politics is driving toward more gridlock. That means the sense of hope and high expectation that's fueling all those people coming out to look at Hillary Clinton may be a vain one. It's easy to see why presidential campaigns encourage hope for progress. It's not just that so many parties, including the media, are invested in the conceit that big ideas are being debated and decided by the electorate. The structure of the presidential campaign helps encourage the notion that, despite the occasional silliness, progress is being made. In Washington, it doesn't seem to matter how many people march or protest, little happens when the gavel sounds. In a campaign, though, every yard sign and Facebook posting is aimed at a guaranteed result: the verdict of Election Day. Everyone who chooses to participate can believe that he or she might be doing the thing that changes minds and determines outcomes. When that verdict is rendered, all the activity that led to it is supposed to represent the people's will. A president chosen through that productive process will have a honeymoon and a mandate. But is that an old idea that has died? The election of 2012 changed nothing: Afterward it was the same players, the same debates, the same clog. Still, voters will show up in that field in Iowa this week, full of hope. Usually we have to wait until a president disappoints us before the hope dissipates, but the tall oaks of disappointment are being planted this fall. The election feels national--control of the Senate is at stake, after all, and the president's performance in office is on the ballot. But the electorate participating will be small, and there isn't much actual engagement on national issues that could provide a mandate or give us a sense of the public mood. And even if there were, the politicians would learn soon enough to ignore the public message and follow the guidance of the structure that rules elections. In the election of 2014, only a small number of seats are in a position to act as a proving ground for a battle of ideas. The Center for the Study of the American Electorate suggests that this might be the lowest midterm turnout in history. The number of people who will participate in states with elections that will determine control of the Senate is even smaller still. The House represents a national election of sorts, since all 435 members are up for re-election, but of that group only 30 (6 percent) are in races that are considered up for grabs. Even if there were a great chunk of the population being asked to weigh in on competing visions about the issues of the day, those people would have lots of free time. The two parties are running parallel campaigns aimed at motivating their core voters. Republicans want the race to be about national issues and the failures of the president. Democrats want it to be about everything but that, so they're focusing on local issues. In North Carolina last week, Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan ran four ads with voters describing how the education cuts of her opponent, state House Speaker Thom Tillis, have affected them. On the other side, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce launched its second general election ad attacking Hagan for her ties to President Obama. When the two candidates participated in their first debate last week, Hagan focused her remarks on how Tillis was bad for women. Tillis talked about how Hagan was a rubber stamp for the president. If the candidates aren't discussing issues in an election, the election can't ratify one set of policy ideas over another. Elections don't need to be about issues because, as the National Journal's Ron Brownstein points out, congressional elections are increasingly just a method for voters to show their presidential preferences. In the 2006 midterm election, Republicans won six of the 10 Senate races in states where exit polls showed President Bush's approval rating reaching 46 percent or above, but lost 19 of the 20 in states where he stood at 45 percent or below. In 2010, Democrats won Senate races in nine of the 10 states in which President Obama's approval reached 48 percent or higher, and lost 13 of the 15 states that gave him lower marks. As Brownstein has been arguing, the death of split-ticket voting has changed the electoral structure so that senators who were once encouraged to compromise no longer have to. During the Reagan and Nixon presidencies, Republicans controlled about half the Senate seats in the states they won. That meant there were Democrats representing states that preferred Republicans at the presidential level. That encouraged compromise. A senator needed to show his voters who did not share his ideology that he was not abandoning them. But that pressure has disappeared. During Bill Clinton's term, two-thirds of the senators from states Clinton carried were also Democrats. Under President George W. Bush, that share became three-fourths. Now, under President Obama, Democrats hold 83 percent of the Senate seats in the states he won. Democrats are sure to lose seats in 2014, and they may lose control of the Senate, which should be the ultimate rebuke of their party and their president. But since elections are increasingly driven by structural rather than policy differences, the incentive will be for Democrats to hew to the structure, not bend to some new policy view ratified by the last election. The 2016 map favors Democrats the way the 2014 map favors Republicans. Republican senators are on the ballot on blue or purple states like Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania. Democrats will be encouraged to block Republican ideas and blame them as Obama-hating. In 2016 Democrats will run as the antidote to GOP overreach in a presidential election where members of the Democratic coalition turn out in greater numbers than they do during a midterm. If the first viable female nominee is on their ticket, that will help Democrats even more. It won't just be Democrats with an inclination to keep things bottled up in Washington. Republican senators facing re-election will have to fear challenges from the Tea Party on the right. One GOP strategist is advising every Republican up for re-election in 2016 to plan for a primary. That will not encourage Republicans running in competitive states to take vast risks for the sake of bipartisanship, particularly if the Democrats are being difficult. Hope doesn't have much of a chance in that environment. An even stronger version of this hope was on display at the Harkin Steak Fry in 2006 when President Obama was the keynote speaker. Iowa was a spiritual birthplace for Obama, since his victory in its state caucus boosted his chances. He went on to win the state twice in the general elections. But that hope was dashed, too. As I was typing this piece and making plane reservations to bring my tank of air to join the Hillary throng, an email came in from Gallup about the Iowa Senate race: ""As a key U.S. Senate race unfolds in Iowa ... Obama's approval rating among Iowans for the first half of the year stood at 38 percent, five percentage points below the national average and the lowest rating Gallup has measured in Iowa during his presidency."" At an Iowa campaign rally, presidential candidates present a world of easy possibility. Solutions promise to be effective, and entrenched opposition is easy to vanquish. The stump speeches are infectious, because at a time of high cynicism, people allow themselves the chance to believe that it really could be like this. Perhaps Sen. Rand Paul or Gov. Chris Christie or Hillary Clinton can pull this off. Every presidential season the feeling that the right candidate can change things gets replanted like a field of corn. But the way elections are heading, the idea that salvation can arise from an Iowa cornfield is starting to feel like something that only makes sense in Hollywood."	Why the Hopes of Naive Voters Are No Match for the 2014 Midterm Elections
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/economist_s_review_of_edward_baptist_s_book_on_slavery_a_few_rules_to_remember.html	"I don't have any do's for writing book reviews on slavery--I don't have any do's for writing book reviews, period--but I have a few don'ts, courtesy of the Economist's now-withdrawn review of The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism, a new book from Cornell University historian Edward Baptist. Don't use movie stills to illustrate your review. In particular, don't use a photo of Patsey from 12 Years a Slave, captioned with the point that she was a ""valuable property,"" since in the film--and in reality--Patsey was raped and beaten by her owner. When confronted with evidence that slavery was an immense driver of American prosperity--by 1860, the nearly 4 million American slaves were worth $3.5 billion, the single largest financial asset in the entire economy at the time--don't assert that this is ""overstating the case"" and that we can't dismiss the ""'traditional explanations' for America's success: its individualistic culture, Puritanism, the lure of open land and high wages, Yankee ingenuity and government policies."" If that's your objection, you have to make the case with evidence, and admit those explanations include pro-slavery government policies. Part of the story of the early American economy was its reliance on cotton production. By 1860, thanks to huge gains in cotton productivity, the United States supplied a huge portion of the world's cotton consumption. Cotton brought investment, was used as collateral, and fueled business across the country, from slaveholders in the South to entrepreneurs in the North. For Baptist, a part of this productivity is greater control over slave activities and greater slave-master brutality. If you disagree with this, reviewer, don't wave it away with ambiguity--""a historian cannot know whether these few spokesmen adequately speak for all""--and special pleading, ""Slave owners surely had a vested interest in keeping their 'hands' ever fitter and stronger to pick more cotton. Some of the rise in productivity could have come from better treatment."" After all, we know quite a bit about slave treatment, and how high value didn't stop slaveowners from torture, sexual assault, whippings, and selling children as punishment. And let's talk about your conclusion. You write: ""Mr. Baptist has not written an objective history of slavery. Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains. This is not history; it is advocacy."" Here's the problem: If American slavery was anything, it was an institution where almost all the blacks involved were victims and almost all the whites involved were villains. Which is to say, my last piece of advice is this: Don't slam an author for a lack of balance in a book on slavery. Like it or not, this is a case where there is no balance to have. You either side with the slaves, or like a host of now-disgraced historians you've channelled, you don't."	A Few Helpful Rules for Reviewing Books about Slavery

Among Democratic voters, there has been considerably more enthusiasm for would-be candidates in 2016 than actual candidates in the fast-approaching November midterms. But a large survey of 4,507 Americans from the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute released Tuesday offers a bit of good news for liberals: The country is feeling relatively progressive. PRRI's survey of Americans' values found that a majority of Americans think inequality unfairly holds people back. Two-thirds of those surveyed (66 percent) would like the government to do more to address the gap between rich and poor, a 6 percentage point rise from 2012. Though there is still a big difference based on party affiliation, a slim majority of Americans (51 percent) think that the best policy to help spur economic growth is government spending on education, infrastructure, and tax increases for the wealthy. The effects of the recession are still keenly felt, and more Americans see themselves as ""working class""--a group who would like a bit more help from the state--rather than ""middle class"" than before. That's not to say that the differences between Democrats and Republicans are about to melt away. Though many middle-class Americans say they live with notable levels of economic insecurity, few Republicans feel the same way: They are the only group to mostly report feeling at ease about their future finances. Still, there is one issue where an overwhelming consensus between both parties can be found. A staggering 81 percent of Americans are in favor of requiring companies to offer paid sick leave, and 78 percent favor offering leave for the arrival of a child.  For sick leave, especially, support is universal, with 90 percent of Democrats, 82 percent of Independents, and 76 percent of Republicans in favor. Men and women both think we ought to require that employers offer paid leave for parents. Promoting this issue would win points with a wide demographic, from urban women (who tend to vote Democrat) to white working-class dads (who tend to vote Republican). Yet it is Democrats who have been almost exclusively at pains to advocate for it. The president has called it ""heartbreaking"" that some parents must choose between caring for their child and losing their job because of the lack of paid leave. Last week, a panel at the Center for American Progress that included Hillary Clinton, Sen. Patty Murray, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi underscored that Democrats want to push their House and Senate colleagues to do more. Were Republicans to seize on the issue, ""it would be a win for them with working whites,"" says Robert Jones, an author of the study. But the GOP has instead worked to block sick leave laws. Last year, bills to ban local sick leave legislation backed by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council cropped up in Michigan and Mississippi. A measure was signed into law in Florida. Jones couldn't think of any Republican who has supported sick leave. Arguably, it could be hard for Republicans to embrace paid leave. Business interests protest that it would be a job-killer (though real-world studies suggest that wouldn't be the case). But Connecticut and California passed sick leave bills this year, and Massachusetts may become the third state to do so in November. The issue is on a slew of local ballots across the country and recent successes may lead to more statewide votes. (Colorado, Maryland, Illinois, and Vermont are among the states looking to take it up in 2015.) If Democrats keep talking about it, perhaps in two years time, it will help them woo some of those lost white working-class votes back into the fold. And by then Republican politicians may think it's safe to advocate for something everyone already wants."	The One Issue Everyone Supports--Except the Republican Party
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/saul_alinsky_correspondence_with_hillary_clinton_how_can_she_support_wall.html	"My Twitter feed and my email inbox are in tension. Conservatives have been passing around a story on Twitter from the Washington Free Beacon, which has been doing great work unearthing new items from Hillary Clinton's past. The paper found a 1971 letter from Clinton to radical socialist organizer Saul Alinsky. The argument is that Clinton, who wrote her thesis on Alinsky's methods and his approach to alleviating poverty, retains her college-era radicalism. But at the same time, the Republican National Committee is filling my inbox with emails plinking Clinton for her relationships with celebrities, fat cats, and financiers as part of her work with the Clinton Global Initiative, which holds its annual gathering this week in New York. The GOP committee asserts that Clinton's coziness with the wealthy and powerful are going to cause her trouble with the liberal Elizabeth Warren wing of her party. The only way this tension could be reconciled is if Clinton appears at the Clinton Global Initiative and protests herself. Despite the enthusiasm with which some conservatives greeted the Alinsky revelation, it's unlikely to break out into the general political conversation. The letter, while an interesting artifact, doesn't add much to the story of Clinton's well-known liberal college days and is at odds with the reigning Republican critique of the moment. Why does anyone care about a 43-year-old letter? Origin stories can be powerful in politics. They can contain easily digestible nuggets from which voters can form instinctual impressions about a candidate. Bill Clinton recast his image during his 1992 convention video by highlighting his humble upbringing, branding himself as the Man From Hope and connecting himself with Democratic icon John Kennedy through old footage of the two shaking hands. Democrats tried to use George W. Bush's origin story against him, painting him as a callow youth besotted with drink. Obama's complicated origin story offered his opponents a chance to characterize him as different. When former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour was considering running for president, he offered an opinion about why there were so many rumors about President Obama and his upbringing. ""There's not much known about him, in college, or growing up. ... We don't know any of the childhood things,"" he said, though Obama had written a book on the topic. By comparison, he said, we all knew that George Washington ""chopped down a cherry tree."" (Which, of course, is the original apocryphal origin story.) Clinton has used her origin story to tell people who she is now. Before she ran for the presidency in 2008, her first autobiography described growing up in the heartland as a Methodist helping poor families and her journey from Goldwater Girl to campus radical. At Sen. Tom Harkin's steak fry in Iowa last weekend, she was doing it again, talking about the values her mother taught her about giving people a second chance. The message was that she was raised with a certain set of values that she retains even today, no matter how high she has risen in life. Now conservatives are trying to make a similar case about the indelible markings of her youth. The Alinsky connection will no doubt start appearing in the speeches of Clinton's possible GOP presidential rivals. Though she refers to their biennial conversations, the connection sounds more sinister than talking about her more protracted work for George McGovern in 1972 or any number of other liberal associations she's had. But that's about as far as it's likely to go as a political weapon. No one outside of conservative circles or liberal organizations knows who Saul Alinsky is--in part because he died in 1972. If you try to explain why a more than four-decade-old letter is so important, regular voters are going to think you're a little overheated. (And if they don't, then they probably already believe far worse about Clinton.) As a political matter, origin stories work when voters don't know much about the candidate or when the past confirms a current caricature. Clinton is perhaps the most well-covered likely presidential candidate since Gen. Dwight Eisenhower. And the dominant Republican caricature of her is the direct opposite of this Alinsky-inspired one. For the last several months, Clinton detractors have been working to convey the impression that her wealth has walled her off from regular people and that her attempts to claim solidarity with the middle class through tales of being ""dead broke"" were laughable. Alinsky writes in Rules for Radicals: ""The Prince was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away."" The Clintons are not the Have-Nots. That's why on the Free Beacon website the story right above the story on the Alinsky letters is about how Clinton's wealth reveals how she has broken so thoroughly with Alinsky's teachings. If the story of Clinton's liberal past hadn't appeared in a conservative outlet, someone might have accused Clinton of planting it to restore her liberal credibility among Democratic primary voters. Though it's not likely to do much good, since liberals are familiar with Clinton's past. A letter from Nixon's first term isn't going to convince them of much. Tell them who her economic advisers will be and they might change their opinion that she is a member of the Democratic Party's Wall Street wing. The burden of this discovery is not just to prove that Clinton is a limousine liberal, which she obviously is. The claim emanating from this old correspondence is that she is a closet Alinskyite--a sleeper cell of one prepping for radical redistribution. For more than 40 years, she has been biding her time, amassing a fortune, hanging out with the privileged that Alinsky despised, asking them repeatedly for money to fuel her campaigns, voting for foreign military intervention, and consistently infuriating the grassroots liberals most likely to join in an Alinskylike crusade all in furtherance of an Alinsky revolution that she will spring on the country once she's elected. That is nuts. What's more plausible is that Hillary Clinton is a liberal with some lumpy mix of pragmatism and expedience gained through experience. Also, if she's an acolyte of Saul Alinsky at the genetic level, she wouldn't have been so thoroughly out-organized in the 2008 Democratic primary by a community organizer from Chicago trained in the Alinsky method."	How Can Hillary Clinton Be Both a Limousine Liberal and a Saul Alinsky Radical?
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/spencer_piston_s_study_of_skin_color_and_party_affiliation_why_do_lighter.html	"If you had to describe Republican and Democratic Party coalitions in a single term, you could do worse than ""stigmatized"" versus ""non-stigmatized."" Core Democratic voters come from a host of marginal or formerly marginal groups: blacks, Latinos, Asians, single women, Jewish Americans, and LGBT Americans. By contrast, core Republican voters tend to belong to historically dominant groups, from middle-income and affluent workers and managers, to business owners and suburban whites. But the distribution of stigma isn't static over time. Through the 19th century and into the 20th, Democrats attracted Irish, Italian, and Eastern European immigrants and their descendants, until rising prosperity and mainstream integration brought them to the post-World War II Republican Party. This dynamic--of stigma driving politics--still holds, and you see it in the broad picture of American life as well as in the details and the margins. In particular, says Syracuse political scientist Spencer Piston, skin color plays a strong part in partisan affiliation for Latino and Asian voters. Put simply, even after you account for education, age, income, and foreign birth, lighter-skinned Latinos and Asians are more likely to identify and vote Republican than their darker-skinned counterparts. First, a few notes. Piston's study doesn't deal with black Americans, who are overwhelmingly Democratic in a way that isn't true of any other group. Second, he relies on nationally representative data from the 2012 American National Election Studies and the 2008 Collaborative Multi-Racial Post-Election Survey. In the former, interviewers measured skin color, which can introduce substantial bias. As Piston notes, ""It is possible that an interviewer's estimate of a respondent's skin color is influenced by the interviewer's perceptions of the respondent's political views--if, for example, the interviewer holds a stereotype that Obama supporters are dark-skinned."" For the latter survey, however, skin-color was self-reported, and interviews were conducted in Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, and Vietnamese. It's also true that, while Piston finds a real pattern, these are estimates--there's a modest spread in how Republican lighter-skinned groups are versus darker-skinned ones. With that said, the results are fascinating. On party identification, the difference between the darkest- and lightest-skinned Latinos is the difference between a strong Democratic partisan and a relative independent. For the 2012 Senate races, however, darker-skinned Latinos were much more likely to vote Democratic than lighter-skinned Latinos, who split their votes between the two parties. The differences are less stark for Asians, but they're still noteworthy: Light-skinned Asians were less likely to vote Democrat in the 2008 national elections, and more likely to identify as independent or Republican. Piston says it's ""striking that across two different ethnic groups, two national datasets, and two different modes of measuring skin tone, lighter-skinned individuals are more likely than dark-skinned individuals to prefer Republicans."" He's right, and it's a testament to the role skin color (and racism) can play in social integration. In other words, while race defines the boundaries of broad disadvantage, skin color influences the relative position of people within them. As a group, blacks are disadvantaged in competition for jobs and other resources. But within the group, dark-skinned blacks are more likely to face job discrimination than light-skinned blacks, and--in terms of social perception--are more likely to seem ""criminal."" The same dynamic applies to immigrants, regardless of racial or ethnic background: Darker-skinned immigrants suffer a wage penalty when compared to their lighter-skinned counterparts. On the immediate question of political allegiance, data like this is more evidence for the need for humility in long-term political forecasts. We don't know if minorities will make up the majority in the United States in 50 years, as many people predict. Given rates of intermarriage, it's possible we'll have a large population of people who are Latino and Asian in the same way that Italian Americans are Italian. And if we do become a ""majority-minority"" country, there's no guarantee minorities will hold their Democratic allegiance. But, regardless of how it looks, we'll have a multiracial society. And this study--like others around color--raise larger questions of how it might develop over the next century. Indeed, if the strength and durability of color stigma is any indication, we might move to a country where we've eased the problems of racial discrimination, only to find ourselves--like our Latin American neighbors--in a new hierarchy of color prejudice."	Why Are Lighter-Skinned Latinos and Asians More Likely to Vote Republican?
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/blacks_and_corporal_punishment_why_we_invent_black_pathologies.html	"""While 70 percent of Americans approve of corporal punishment,"" wrote sociologist Michael Eric Dyson for the New York Times on Wednesday, ""black Americans have a distinct history with the subject. Beating children has been a depressingly familiar habit in black families since our arrival in the New World."" Dyson was just one of many commenters writing on corporal punishment this week, and specifically, linking it to the particular cultural life of black Americans. For instance, in a piece for CNN, Steven Holmes asserted, ""Corporal punishment is deeply ingrained in black culture, as it is in many other groups,"" and asked that ""we, as black people, stop waxing nostalgically--and defensively--about this particular child-rearing practice."" On cable news, CNN anchor Don Lemon wondered if spanking was a legacy of slavery. ""For me as an African-American,"" he said, ""the question is where did you learn that from? Is that learned from the slave master? Getting the switch? Being beaten?"" And on the opposite side, Charles Barkley--speaking during a roundtable discussion on The NFL Today--gave a typically blunt take on the practice. ""Whipping--we do that all the time,"" Barkley said. ""Every black parent in the South is going to be in jail"" if corporal punishment is made illegal. At 85 percent approval, there's no doubt most blacks support corporal punishment. But so do most whites--73 percent accept spanking as a legitimate punishment. The gap, notes Harry Enten for FiveThirtyEight, is generally a scant 11 points between the two groups. For those who ""strongly agree"" with spanking, the gap is 15 points, or 40 percent for blacks versus 25 percent for whites. And while you could attribute this to the particulars of the black American experience, you probably shouldn't. Consider that while most Americans support spanking (about 70 percent), born-again Christians are more likely to support than non-born-again Christians (80 percent versus 65 percent), and Southerners are more likely to support it than people from other parts of the country. What's more, support for spanking is strongly related to low levels of education, high levels of poverty, and high levels of environmental stress. With that in mind, it's no surprise blacks are more likely to support corporal punishment--not only are they disproportionately Southern, but Southern black culture extends throughout the country by way of the Great Migration. In addition, they're disproportionately religious, and more likely to live in low-income or impoverished areas. And other groups with similar characteristics show similar support for spanking. The Mid-South includes parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Alabama, and is one of the poorest areas in the country. There, notes Aaron Blake for the Washington Post, the white/black gap on spanking doesn't exist. Yes, there's a cultural component to how black parents explain and rationalize corporal punishment, but that's true of all groups: It's not hard to find white comedians with routines on the necessity of spanking. Despite this, the national conversation on corporal punishment and abuse has treated it as a black problem, not an American one. Some of this stems from the particular subjects of this debate--black American football players. At the same time, it's reminiscent of other conversations around broad-based behaviors or beliefs that become pathological and purely ""black"" when displayed by black Americans in elevated numbers. You saw this in the aftermath of California's Proposition 8. Exit polls had black support at 70 percent, and pegged them at 10 percent of the electorate--a critical segment in the fight to ban same-sex marriage. For many opponents of Prop 8, this made blacks and ""black homophobia"" the culprits. ""I'm done pretending that the handful of racist gay white men out there--and they're out there, and I think they're scum--are a bigger problem for African Americans, gay and straight, than the huge numbers of homophobic African Americans are for gay Americans, whatever their color,"" wrote Dan Savage, a day after the vote. ""The black church is one of the most powerful forces fomenting homophobia in America, and has fostered attitudes that have literally killed countless gay black men,"" wrote Andrew Sullivan, echoing his pre-vote comments on the danger blacks posed to marriage equality. ""There is, alas, no ethnic community as homophobic in America as African-Americans,"" he wrote that September. ""Which is why the ballot initiative in California could be close."" This basic sentiment defined postelection analysis of the Prop 8 vote. Writing for Slate, Farhad Manjoo noted that ""Obama brought a huge number of strongly anti-gay-marriage voters to the polls."" ""The same voters who turned out strongest for Barack Obama also drove a stake through the heart of same-sex marriage,"" declared the Washington Post. Except, not at all. Two months after the vote, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force issued a report on the results in Proposition 8 that challenged the conventional wisdom. For starters, the exit polls were wrong. Fifty-eight percent of blacks voted for Prop 8--not 70 percent--and they were 7 percent of the electorate, not 10 percent. Compared with Latinos--who were just as supportive but a larger portion of the electorate--they were less consequential to the final outcome. Moreover, the difference between whites and blacks (and Latinos) on Prop 8, about 10 percentage points, had everything to do with church attendance--account for religiosity, and the gap disappears. Prop 8 didn't win because of blacks or Latinos, it won because millions of Californians--white as much as black or brown--opposed same-sex marriage. Older Californians were most opposed (67 percent), but a near-majority of 30-to-44-year-olds and 45-to-64-year-olds also supported the amendment. And yet, the narrative was set: If not for homophobic blacks, Prop 8 would have lost. As such, when North Carolina banned same-sex marriage in 2012, the blame fell again on black Americans, treating black support as a function of ""blackness"" and not religiosity or age. Corporal punishment and opposition to same-sex marriage are just the most concrete examples of invented black pathology. There are many more, each based on the most nebulous of facts and inferences. Take the ""acting white"" phenomenon. Denounced by President Obama--and many others--it's the idea that black children see academic achievement as ""white"" behavior. ""Kids who raise their hands in class, who are bookish, who are nerdish, get made fun of, get beat up, get harassed,"" said Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley during a recent event at the American Enterprise Institute. Anecdote aside however, there's little evidence of black disdain for educational achievement. Using data from a CBS News survey of educational attitudes, Howard University professor Ivory Toldson shines light on the ""acting white"" theory and finds it lacking:"	Blacks Don't Have a Corporal Punishment Problem
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/mark_udall_and_cory_gardner_colorado_senate_race_democrats_and_republicans.html	"DENVER--The Colorado referendum on women is just 47 days away. That's not its official title. Most people here refer to it as the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Democrat Mark Udall and his Republican challenger, Cory Gardner. But the campaigns' intense and protracted focus on women's reproductive issues makes it seem like those issues are up for their own special vote. Like all competitive Senate races, the neck-and-neck contest in Colorado may determine which party controls the Senate, but the race is also the central battleground for the fight between Republicans and Democrats over female voters. Will Democrats win by returning to the tested playbook of focusing on reproductive issues to run up their support with women, or have Republicans found a way to blunt that attack? The outcome will render a verdict on the principal strategic gambit of the Democratic Party, and it will contribute to a running debate within Republican ranks. Can the GOP win in competitive states--and even a national presidential contest--with its current positions, or must its candidates do more than offer cosmetic changes to core beliefs? In two days this week, three new ads were launched in this Colorado race. In one, Udall spoke directly to the camera, saying his opponent is ""promoting harsh anti-abortion laws and a bill to outlaw birth control."" The Democratic outside group NextGen Climate ran an apocalyptic ad in which it claimed Gardner's position on contraception meant ""he'd like to make your most private choices for you."" The pro-Republican group Crossroads GPS put up its own ad in which four women standing around a kitchen island bemoan that Udall wasn't talking about issues that matter. These ads are only the most recent volleys over a set of issues that have dominated the campaign since April. Two of Udall's first three ads hammered Gardner on his conservative position on abortion and past support for the state's ""personhood"" initiatives, which would grant a fetus rights and protections that apply to people. National Democratic organizations have been hammering these issues too, as has Planned Parenthood. ""There's been so much advertising touching on so-called 'women's issues' in this race that it's noticeable when a Democratic ad doesn't mention them,"" says Elizabeth Wilner, vice president of Kantar Media Ad Intelligence, which tracks campaign and issue advertising. Democrats need women to turn out to vote in all of their toughest races, including Colorado. (Women are so important in the contested states that in my notes from interviewing one top Democratic strategist who described the key factors in each of those races, I scribbled the Venus symbol next to seven of them.) The challenge is to get women to turn out in a nonpresidential year. In 2010, 22 million fewer unmarried women voted than in 2008, according to a study by the Voter Participation Center and Lake Research Partners. Among married women, the drop-off was 10 million. Democrats have a problem with male voters too, but the solution to that problem is harder to find. There isn't a set of defined issues that appeal to men as personally as reproductive issues do to women, and there aren't organizations like Planned Parenthood working for men. ""It's the easiest, black-white issue on which you have a clear contrast that is so important to a key constituency,"" says Ted Trimpa, a Democratic strategist. The Democratic Party's strategy is modeled after the one Sen. Michael Bennet used in Colorado in 2010. Like this year, the national climate was bad for Democrats, and Bennet did not have Udall's deep ties to the state or the political pedigree, but he won because he beat his opponent, Ken Buck, among women by 17 points. Still, Bennet only won the race by 30,000 votes. A similar version of this strategy was also used in the Virginia governor's race, which helped Democrat Terry McAuliffe win all female voters by nine points and unmarried women by a staggering 67-25. The questions for this race, and all Democratic races, are how far can a women-focused strategy get you with female voters, and how much must be handed to you by an inept opponent who offends them. In 2010 when Buck said homosexuality was like alcoholism and that people should vote for him because he doesn't wear high heels, he embraced, in real time, the caricature Democrats had painted of him. He showed voters that he was out of the mainstream and boosted Bennet's prospects at the same time. Gardner is no Buck. Even Democrats think he is a good candidate. ""He's not going to make a gaffe,"" says Trimpa, who has watched Gardner since he was in the state legislature. Another Democrat working to re-elect Udall described Gardner as ""the kind of candidate who lights up a room."" In the Republican Party debate after the GOP losses of 2012, some said that candidates needed to moderate their positions. Others, like Gardner, said candidates should not water down their principles but simply communicate better. GOP strategists think Gardner is the prototype of the rock-solid conservative who can connect. Gardner's challenge is his voting record. His biggest problem on contraception relates to his support of the ""personhood"" initiative. It does not seek to ban forms of contraception, as Udall claims in his ad, but it opens the door to limiting birth control products that prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Twice voters in Colorado defeated ballot initiatives that Gardner was closely associated with when he was a state lawmaker. He has since announced that he was wrong to do so, a change he said was based on learning that the measures restrict some forms of birth control. Democrats have kept up their attacks, saying election season conversions can't obscure a long record. Gardner also continues to support a federal personhood bill, which contains similar language that would make a ban of some forms of contraception a possibility. The contraception issue is particularly powerful, worry some Republicans, because as one GOP strategist put it, ""If you're against contraception, it means that you're weird."" Gardner hasn't just altered his position on personhood at the state level--he's putting forward his own policies on birth control, promoting a program where birth control would be available over the counter and even running an ad on the issue. For Republicans, the race represents the prototype for how to reduce a GOP candidate's vulnerability with female voters. ""Gardner knew this was coming, and they set up a whole strategy,"" say one GOP strategist working on the Senate races. ""We've really retooled our message to women. You have to address the reproductive rights issues. You can't sit there and say, 'Well, let me tell you how I'm going to give you a better job,'--but then you do what Gardner did by offering over-the-counter, which was brilliant. And all of a sudden, you just completely kind of inoculated yourself. The far left is never going to vote for him anyway, but for the women who are open and asking, 'Is this guy really crazy enough to take all of our birth control away?' No, he's not. He's making it over-the-counter. OK, we're done. Now let's move on."" In North Carolina, Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis is following the same playbook. Traditionally, when you're fighting on the other guy's turf, you're losing. Under that theory, Gardner is making a mistake by joining the fight over birth control. He should rebut the charge, but then move on to his issues, including attacking Udall for his record. It's a variation on the idea of issue ownership: Whomever's issues are being debated is winning the argument, regardless of the outcome of a specific debate on that issue. ""Please, please, let's a have a debate about lady parts,"" says one of the Democratic activists working on the Senate race, responding to Gardner's ad. Extended conversation exposes more voters to the issue, and since they tend to trust Democrats on that question, it becomes an advertisement for the Democrat. For the Gardner campaign, every debate over Gardner's plan for contraception reinforces the idea that he has a plan for contraception and isn't some extremist who wants to ban it. Planned Parenthood has attacked the congressman's plan for over-the-counter contraception, saying it would not cover all methods of birth control and would force women to pay up to $600 a year that is now covered by insurance companies. But in order for them to make that rebuttal, they have to repeat the fact that Gardner has a contraception plan. He's no longer out of the mainstream--he just has a different point of view. The ad by Crossroads GPS also tests a corollary to the idea of issue ownership. Keeping the debate on your turf gives you the chance to bait your opponent into a stumble because he, by definition, isn't as versed on the topic and can trip all kinds of landmines, or overreach as he tries too hard. In the ad, which is the start of a $6 million campaign, the four women stand around a kitchen island lamenting that Mark Udall won't talk about the issues. ""After 15 years in Washington, all Mark Udall has left are political scare tactics,"" says one. Says another: ""We're not single-issue voters."" They note that Udall votes with President Obama 99 percent of the time. The ad touched off a debate over which side was patronizing women. Democrats said that by showing women collected in the kitchen it suggested that was their natural habitat. They also said the ad suggested that women who cared about reproductive rights didn't care about the economy or were narrow-minded single-issue voters. ""You don't tell women voters what they should and shouldn't care about,"" said Craig Hughes, a former strategist for the Bennet campaign, referring to the ad's line that women want to ""have a discussion about things that matter."" What started as a debate about birth control can quickly become a debate about how you address female voters and their opinions. Katie Packer Gage, who served as deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney in 2012 and heads a firm aimed at helping Republicans woo female voters, says it's the underlying Democratic strategy that is patronizing. ""Democrats act as though the only issues that matter are those affecting women's reproductive organs. Women care about this president's mismanagement of foreign policy and Obamacare and jobs."" Republicans don't have to persuade every woman to back Gardner. They only need to shrink Udall's margin. Democrats, on the other hand, say their strategy is powerful because while it's true that abortion, personhood, and birth control aren't a priority for most female voters, they are issues where a candidate's position can disqualify him from further consideration. If a candidate believes one thing about contraception, so the thinking goes, he's likely to do the conservative extreme thing on the other issues I care about. ""These aren't niche issues,"" says Hughes. ""They touch on a broad set of values. If you're extreme on this, you are extreme on other things. Voters can walk that path."" That's the explicit message of the NextGen Climate ad, which is supposed to be about Gardner's views on environmental issues, but starts by talking about his position on contraception. Colorado is one of the best examples of a state that reflects the political forces alive in America. Democrats, including President Obama, have succeeded by attracting younger voters, culturally more liberal voters, minorities, and college-educated women. Republicans in the state have tapped the energy of cultural conservatives and mostly white voters in rural areas, including many Tea Party activists. After the 2012 election losses for Republicans, Gardner balked at the idea of watering down his views; he would simply communicate with greater precision. Now to win in Colorado he has followed both paths, moderating his position on the hot-button issue of personhood and running a disciplined campaign as a conservative. Democrats haven't moderated anything, running a voter turnout strategy that was successful here four years ago with even greater gusto. Whoever wins this referendum will carve a route that will be repeated far beyond the Rocky Mountains."	Ground Zero for the Fight Over Female Voters

Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared before a Senate committee on Tuesday and said that, under certain circumstances, he might recommend that President Obama send U.S. ground forces to help fight ISIS, the terrorist group known as Islamic State. The front-page headlines were predictable, as was the New York Times editorial fuming, ""There is no way to read this other than as a reversal from the firm commitment Mr. Obama made not to immerse the country in another endless ground war in the Middle East,"" adding that ""the Obama administration has turned on a dime in record time."" This is overblown. First, ""the Obama administration"" hasn't turned on anything. As a rule, the White House doesn't review congressional testimony by the JCS chairman. The Times editors are simply wrong when they write, ""It's impossible to believe that General Dempsey was speaking just for himself."" It's in fact quite likely that he was. Second, Dempsey was careful to say that he thought Obama's current approach--U.S. air power supporting Iraqi ground troops--would work, noting only that if he turned out to be wrong about this, he ""would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of U.S. military ground forces."" Even then, he said, the idea would be for American advisers to accompany Iraqi soldiers onto the battlefield but not to engage in the fighting directly. That is what the JCS chairman is supposed to do: give the president his military advice on what's needed to complete a mission. It's up to the president to accept or reject that advice on the basis of his own broader strategic goals (or for whatever reason he chooses). That said, the Times editors do have a point; their worries are well in line, and anyone with a sense of history would be daft to disagree. The dreadful movie we've seen before is, of course, the Vietnam War, and while Vietnam parallels are often stretched beyond reason, the similarities here are worth noting. America's involvement in that war began when President Dwight Eisenhower sent U.S. weapons and advisers to help the South Vietnamese army stave off the Viet Cong guerrillas. In 1959, after eight of these Americans were shot in their dining hall while watching a movie (two of the men were killed), Eisenhower ordered the advisers, who now numbered in the thousands, to accompany their trainees onto the battlefield. The advisers were not to engage with the Viet Cong directly, though ""rules of engagement"" let them in self-defense fire back if fired upon. President John F. Kennedy continued this policy, dispatched more advisers, and created an elite counterinsurgency force--the Green Berets--to fight these ""shadow wars"" against Communists in remote jungles. But he resisted his generals' urgings to send in ""combat forces."" The distinction between advisers and combat forces had blurred by this point, but it helped him keep a lid on the pressures to escalate. President Obama is hardly a dove, but, like Kennedy, he's leery of military optimism, having had a sour taste of it in Afghanistan (just as Kennedy had in Laos, Berlin, and Cuba), and he's very cautious about stepping into dark rooms without first looking for the exit signs. Dempsey's remarks aren't so worrisome in the short run. Even if the current strategy on ISIS doesn't work--and there's a good chance it won't--Obama doesn't seem likely to take the general's bait and step deeper into the darkness. What's worth a shudder is thinking about what his successor might do. Obama has said that the fight against ISIS will extend beyond his own presidency. I will probably vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 (if just for the lack of anyone better), but it is worth noting that, during her tenure as Obama's secretary of state, she sided with the generals in nearly every debate, including the one on escalation in Afghanistan. The only disagreement between them was over Libya: The generals didn't much want to send in military forces, but she very much did. She has also criticized Obama in recent weeks over his decision not to send arms to the Syrian rebels in 2011, and she derided his cautiousness, saying, "" 'Don't do stupid stuff' ""--which Obama once pronounced as his prime directive in foreign policy--""is not an organizing principle."" She may be right, but it's not a bad starting point and shouldn't be laughed off by someone who, as a senator, voted to authorize George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq. There's one more cause for concern in Dempsey's statement about sending in U.S. ground forces: It was a statement, not an offhand remark. That is, he read the line aloud as part of his written opening testimony. This was unusual. When a general wants to go a bit off script, the standard drill is to wait for a senator to ask a question that begins, ""General, in your professional military judgment ... "" (Sometimes, a general's staff plants such a question ahead of time.) That way, if his political masters raise a stink afterward, the general can say that, under the circumstances, he was duty-bound to reply honestly. The most famous case of this was when Gen. Eric Shinseki, then the Army chief of staff, was asked, shortly before the invasion of Iraq, how many troops would be needed to restore order afterward. He hemmed and hawed before saying ""several hundred thousand""--angering his civilian bosses in the Pentagon, who had been assuring Congress of much lower numbers. Was Dempsey sending a signal, either to the president or to Congress? Some of the military's strongest supporters on the Hill have said that defeating ISIS will require at least a few thousand U.S. special operations forces, and that the combination of American bombs and Iraqi troops won't be enough. It's likely that some active-duty officers in the Pentagon feel the same way. If Obama's approach doesn't do the trick, these officers will want it known that they're not to blame--that they had a Plan B, and it's not their fault if the president didn't want to play it. In his May 28 West Point speech, Obama told the graduating cadets that America's costliest mistakes have stemmed from rushing into armed adventures ""without thinking through the consequences"" and ""without leveling with the American people about the sacrifice required."" Whatever Dempsey's intentions, his testimony should set the occasion for a more serious debate. Do the generals think that the current approach toward ISIS can succeed? What are the odds? If it doesn't succeed, how many U.S. advisers would be needed on the ground, in the fray of battle, to give the Iraqi army a good chance of winning? What is the likelihood, in this scenario, that some of those advisers would have to take on ""combat"" roles? If other analysts, in the White House or elsewhere, dispute these appraisals, why? (This isn't to say that the military's judgment is always right; often, it's not. The point is that this sort of commitment warrants a debate, which hasn't happened.) Some of these questions might have been tossed around in Obama's meeting on Wednesday with the senior officers of U.S. Central Command at their headquarters in Tampa. (In a speech to the CentCom troops, Obama reaffirmed his stance: ""American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission,"" he said. ""I will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq."") The evolving logic of this military campaign--its scope, aims, and limits--should be shared with the American people, at least in broad terms, so we know ""the sacrifice required"" before burrowing in any deeper."	Obama Isn't Sending Troops to Fight ISIS. But the Next President Might.
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/st_louis_blacks_and_white_disagree_on_michael_brown_s_killing_hold_almost.html	"Early in the Ferguson protests, the Pew Research Center polled reactions to the Michael Brown shooting nationally. For blacks, it confirmed their mistrust of the police; 65 percent said police had gone too far in their response to the protests. Whites were more reticent, with 32 percent who said the response was ""about right"" and 35 percent who ""didn't know."" That told us quite a bit about opinions nationwide, but it said little about views in St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located. Now, thanks to a new survey from the Remington Research Group--based in Kansas City, Missouri--we know. The firm polled 604 residents of St. Louis County on aspects of the controversy, from the shooting of Brown to the police response to protesters. And on most questions, they found a stark racial divide. When asked if ""the shooting of an African American teen by law enforcement in Ferguson, Missouri"" was justified, 62 percent of whites said it was, along with 35 percent of blacks. The ""noes"" were a mirror image: 65 percent of blacks--and 38 percent of whites--said it wasn't justified. This, more than any result in the survey, is astonishing. Remember, we know little on the circumstances that led to Brown's death. At most, we have witness reports, which say Brown had surrendered when he was killed, and the testimony of Officer Darren Wilson, who says he was attacked by the teenager. It's impossible to say anything for certain, but my hunch is that this divide has a good deal to do with implicit racial bias and the divergent views of law enforcement among whites and blacks. In addition, we can't dismiss perceptions of the protests in trying to explain why so many white St. Louis County residents think Brown's shooting was justified. Two things are worth noting. First, a recent paper from political scientists Christian Davenport, David Armstrong, and Sarah Soule found a strong connection between the race of protesters and the depth and aggression of a police response. In particular, ""African American protesters are more likely to draw police presence and that once police are present they are more likely to make arrests, use force and violence, and use force and violence in combination with arrests at African American protest events."" At the same time, according to similar research from Armstrong and political scientist Rose McDermott, race affects how blacks and whites perceive protests. When protesters are black and police are white, they find, ""African Americans are much less likely to blame the black protestors for what transpires,"" and ""whites are less likely to blame the white police."" (It's worth noting that when both police and protesters are black, blacks still tend to side with the protesters.) Even in the best circumstances--where police were calm and protesters, orderly--there's a good chance whites would have sided with law enforcement and its version of events. Given the reality, where police were heavily militarized and the protests had elements of disorder, white support for the police was inevitable. Larger than the divide on the shooting of Brown was the divide on the role of race. Just 23 percent of whites agreed that Brown was targeted because of his color, compared with 64 percent of black Americans. By contrast, a whopping 77 percent of whites said race had nothing to do with the shooting. And a similar number (72 percent) don't think the police officer should be arrested and charged with a crime. Again, the number is reversed for blacks; there, 71 percent say he should be charged with a crime. Blacks and whites in St. Louis County disagree on nearly everything around Ferguson and Brown's shooting. Just 39 percent of whites, for example, believe black Americans are ""unfairly targeted by law enforcement"" (compared with 70 percent of blacks), and the large majority of whites (71 percent) see county prosecutor Bob McCulloch as a fair and impartial actor in the proceedings, despite his personal connections to St. Louis police and his long-standing deference to the force when it comes to police shootings. Insofar that white and black St. Louisians share anything, it's their disdain for the media (81 percent of whites and 50 percent of blacks said media made the situation in Ferguson worse) and for Gov. Jay Nixon's handling of the unrest (62 percent of whites and 70 percent of blacks give the beleaguered Democrat an ""unfavorable"" rating). While in Ferguson, I wrote on the sharp divide between white and black residents in the suburb. Whites saw the protests as an unpleasant distraction--an unfair mark against a pleasant community. Blacks, on the other hand, saw them as necessary: a resounding response to police harassment and political disenfranchisement. If this poll shows anything, it's the extent to which those divides define the entire area. Thanks to decades of white flight, segregation, and deep racial tension, blacks and whites in St. Louis County don't just live in different neighborhoods--they reside on different planets."	Blacks and Whites Disagree About Michael Brown's Killing More Than Anyone Guessed
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/scott_walker_wants_to_drug_test_the_poor_the_gop_s_agenda_is_about_solving.html	"Scott Walker wants drug tests. Specifically, the Wisconsin governor wants to drug-test people applying for food stamps and unemployment insurance. So far, there are no details to share; insofar that there's a plan, it's a single line from a campaign document, detailing Walker's agenda for a second term. And lack of detail aside, there's a small problem: States aren't allowed to take this step with either food stamps or unemployment insurance. If Walker wants drug tests, he'll need permission from the federal government, which he's prepared to fight on the issue. ""We believe that there will potentially be a fight with the federal government and in court. ... Our goal here is not to make it harder to get government assistance; it's to make it easier to get a job,"" he said in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. This push for drug tests doesn't come out of the ether. Across the country, drug tests for public benefits are standard fare for Republican politicians. Since 2010, Republicans in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, Missouri, Arizona, Utah, Kansas, and Oklahoma have passed drug-testing laws for welfare recipients. The measures vary from state to state, but the rationales are almost always the same. ""It protects hard-earned taxpayer dollars from enabling a dangerous habit,"" said Alabama state Sen. Trip Pittman in support of his drug-testing proposal. And North Carolina state Rep. Dean Arp defended his bill as a way to ""end a bad practice of supporting active drug abusers with the hard-earned money of law-abiding North Carolinians."" The problem, however, is that this isn't a problem. The vast majority of people on public assistance aren't drug users and aren't addicted to any illegal substances. In one study, only 3.6 percent of recipients satisfied the screening criteria for drug abuse and dependence. In another, among people who received food stamps, the rate was similarly low. You can see this in the poor record for drug-testing programs. In the first year of Utah's program, for instance, only 12 people showed evidence of drug use after a mandatory screening, at a cost of $25,000. And in Florida, from 2011 to 2012, just 108 of the 4,086 people who took a drug test failed--a rate of 2.6 percent--at a cost of nearly $46,000 to taxpayers. Welfare drug tests waste money and add new stigma to public assistance. Still, Republicans push and support them, a bad ""solution"" to an imaginary problem. To be clear, this isn't an instance of good ideas and bad ideas, where a problem exists, and lawmakers have done a poor job of fixing it. No, with their drug tests, Walker and other Republicans have launched an assault on a problem--drug-addled welfare users--that doesn't exist. But this isn't the first time Republicans have attacked a fake problem with real--and harmful--policy. Take voter fraud. A rallying cry for Republicans, the specter of fraudulent voting has justified a whole host of strict identification laws. ""Voter fraud is a well-documented reality in American elections,"" wrote Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas, which has one of the toughest voter ID laws in the country. He continued: ""Evidence of voter fraud is present in all 50 states, and public confidence in the integrity of elections is at an all-time low."" Likewise, in their book Who's Counting?, columnist John Fund and Republican lawyer Hans von Spakovsky declare that ""Election fraud, whether it's phony voter registrations, illegal absentee ballots, vote-buying, shady recounts, or old-fashioned ballot-box stuffing, can be found in every part of the United States."" To that end, von Spakovsky is a vocal supporter for voter ID laws, which he calls ""a commonsense reform intended to protect the integrity of the election process for all candidates."" To that apparent end, lawmakers in 19 states have passed a bevy of restrictive voting measures, including photo ID requirements and an end to same-day registration. In Wisconsin, for example, a Scott Walker-backed law reduced early voting on weeknights and eliminated them on weekends, placing a huge burden on urban precincts throughout the state. Again, this was unnecessary. We don't need to fight voter fraud because it doesn't exist, or at least, it doesn't exist at a scale that requires drastic action. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, tracked every instance of voter fraud from 2000 to present. He found 31 incidents out of one billion ballots cast. Put another way, you're more likely to see a UFO or get killed by lightning than you are to witness in-person voter fraud--the kind supposedly ""prevented"" by voter ID laws. Still, ""protecting the ballot"" is a priority for Republicans, regardless of what it means for voter access and participation. Then there is the fake problem of bad abortion clinic design. In states like Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, lawmakers have passed targeted regulations of abortion providers (""TRAP"" laws), which--as my colleague Amanda Marcotte described--""single out abortion clinics for medical regulations no other clinics that provide similarly low-risk services need to obey."" Examples include hospital-admitting privileges for clinics that perform first trimester abortions--which have minimal risk of major complications--and onerous building requirements that have little to do with safety; in 2013, Virginia required clinics performing first trimester abortions to expand their parking lots. Now, tens of millions of Americans oppose abortion, and it's clear these laws are meant to reduce its availability. On paper, at least, the goal is to--in the words of one Republican lawmaker--""protect the right of women having an abortion to have it in a healthy, safe environment."" But there's no epidemic of unhealthy, unsafe clinics, either in Alabama or nationwide; a House Republican investigation of abortion clinics--following the Kermit Gosnell trial--uncovered little in the way of misconduct. Overwhelmingly, authorities already heavily monitored abortion providers, long before this new wave of targeted regulation. If this were just rhetoric--if Republicans were just talking about voter fraud, addicts on welfare, and out-of-control abortion clinics--it would be tolerable. But on each score, the GOP has pushed policies that, over the past four years, have discouraged voting, stripped benefits from low-income Americans, and limited abortion access. In other words, the GOP might be fighting fake problems, but they provide real excuses for the most draconian parts of the Republican agenda."	The GOP's Agenda Is About Solving Problems That Don't Exist
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/institute_for_justice_lawsuit_against_philadelphia_libertarians_fight_civil.html	"PHILADELPHIA--The most notorious courtroom in America is surprisingly small and bright, and noisier than the multiple ""silence"" signs might suggest. Every weekday morning, people who have had property seized by the city show up to Courtroom 478 in City Hall; they find chairs and wait for their names or their addresses to be called. Some of them talk to a legal observer, who quietly takes notes on a yellow legal pad. Some of them talk among themselves. On Thursday morning, after spotting my notebook, one of them turned and talked to me. ""This is bullshit,"" said Brian Corrine, 42 years old and skinny, fidgeting in his roomy T-shirt and shorts. He started talking about how the city's Public Nuisance Task Force, which had been monitoring his methadone clinic, busted him after mistaking one of his conversations for a drug deal. ""There was a gun to my head,"" he said. ""I thought I was being carjacked. Then I seen the cop in the rearview mirror, and I was like: Oh, no, I surrender. They took my phone, the $90 I had on me. They left my car in the parking lot, window down. I got locked up on $5,000 bail."" As Corrine told the rest of the story, a couple nearby nodded and grimaced, holding hands. After being freed, Corrine had to go through the civil forfeiture process to get his possessions. ""But if you see my forfeiture, it says nothing about my phone,"" he said. ""They thought I was recording, probably. I know I hit record."" The couple next to Corrine were beckoned outside. They were trying to recover money taken when one of them was caught with an ounce of crack; the city had lost their paperwork, and they'd need to head to another room to restart the process. Their place in Courtroom 478 was taken by Anthony Moore, a 38-year-old parking attendant who'd been making money on the side reselling iPhones, until he was pulled over by police in November 2013. They grabbed his car, the 60 phones he had on him, and $800 in cash. ""I got the car back three months later,"" he said. ""They'd torn it up. There was a foot of ice in the trunk. And in the meantime, I was out of business. You build relationships with customers, and then you can't work with them anymore."" But he was still trying to get back the money and the phones. As he talked, Brian Corrine's father, Joseph, entered the court and started talking to his son about their strategy. The phone had been on Joseph's family plan; he'd notarized a letter asking the city to give him back his property. Finally, they got called up, beckoned into the hallway--and told that they'd need to file a new complaint. ""This is corrupt as shit!"" said Joseph Corrine to the city worker who'd broken the bad news. ""I spent three years in the Army for this country. I got used to hurry-and-wait, but it was never like this. This is bullshit."" Corrine steadied his nerves and walked over to me. ""You know what this is, right? This is a fundraising scheme for the city."" That's what the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the city and the District Attorney's Office are claiming. On Aug. 11 the D.C.-based libertarian Institute for Justice charged that Philadelphia operated a ""veritable machine"" of civil forfeiture, which violated the due process clause of the Constitution. If there is a post-Ferguson marriage of principles between progressives and libertarians, it is breaking out in Philadelphia. The Institute for Justice's stated goal is the end of civil forfeiture. As thousands of Philadelphians work through the system every year, they must wonder whether the libertarians have it right. The Institute for Justice filed its lawsuit after months of observing the courtroom, four years after it published a report on how civil forfeiture meant ""property is guilty until you prove it innocent,"" two years after Philadelphia City Paper reporter Isaiah Thompson published a lengthy investigation of the process, and one year after a blockbuster New Yorker piece about forfeitures around the country. The basic argument, in the articles and in the lawsuit, was that Philadelphia's use of forfeiture was wildly out of whack. Thompson's reporting found that the city brought in ""upwards of $6 million a year"" from forfeitures, or about five times as much as Brooklyn. Those numbers, and Thompson's subsequent reporting, are cited in the Institute for Justice's filing. ""If you fail to show up in 478, they call your name, and prosecutor marks your case for default,"" said the Institute for Justice's lead attorney on the case, Darpana Sheth. She'd previously worked on a forfeiture case in Massachusetts, which the group had made famous--George Will even wrote a datelined column about it. ""If you tell average people on the street how this works,"" said Sheth, ""it sounds so foreign to the American system, they can't believe it."" The city's DA office, full of lawyers who definitely consider themselves American--and who are required to live within city lines--say that the public is getting a false narrative. By the time I sat down with them, on Thursday, they'd seen stories about the lawsuit on CNN, in Forbes, in the Wall Street Journal. Most of the stories focused on the lead plaintiffs, Christos and Markela Sourovelis, whose home was padlocked for a week after their son was arrested for selling $40 of drugs. The DA's office was tired of that version of the story. The Sourovelises' son, said Chief Assistant DA Beth Grossman, was caught up in an investigation into the heroin trade. ""I'm sure I don't have to tell you that heroin makes zombies out of people,"" said Grossman. ""Heroin is truly, truly a poison."" CNN's report, among others, had been clear about that. Grossman said that the rest of the raid and seizure had been soft-pedaled. ""The police execute a search and seizure warrant,"" she said, running through a timeline of the incident. ""They are identified as police. They knock on the door. Mom, after being directed to restrain her pit bull, refuses to. Eventually she restrains the pit bull, but during this time her son, who's in the house, is running up the stairs to flush his drugs down the toilet. The mom, who could have been arrested for obstructing justice, is not, but an officer is able to reach his hand down the toilet--which was running--and extract the heroin. It's a little bit beyond what has been covered."" George D. Mosee Jr. is the deputy district attorney; he has been on the job for 26 years, since before the 1992 toughening of the civil forfeiture policy. He suggested that the critics did not stop to think of how much crime was being prevented. It wasn't like homes were sold off right away. The Sourovelises, for example, had moved back in. Meanwhile, pimps who could have climbed back into their cars watched those cars be sold off. Drug dealers who otherwise could have re-established home bases were deprived of them. ""One of the things I've heard is that they believe that these are victimless crimes,"" said Mosee. ""I would point out that there are always victims. They are just not readily identifiable victims. If you live next door to a crack house, or a house that's being used as a weed store, then they're victims."" ""And why is it OK for people to deal in and out of their houses?"" asked Grossman. ""It's illegal. What are they adding to society? Nothing."" The libertarian critics are blunt about the civil seizure policy: It is terrifying, and possibly unconstitutional, and shouldn't exist. The angry people wondering why they have to fight for their property, who think that the state is raking in money, are right. A few hours after I left the DA's office, Christos Sourovelis invited me into his now-famous home. It was located far from Philadelphia's blighted areas, in the northeast corner of the city-county, on a street where more than one sedan bore a Fraternal Order of Police bumper sticker. The also-famous canine, a red-nosed bulldog named Max, jumped around at the sight of an intruder but calmed down eventually. Sourovelis remembered how police had pointed guns at his dog--many dogs, in similar raids, have ended up dead--and was dumbfounded to hear a version of his story in which the dog and his family were obstructing justice. ""What that dog supposed to do?"" said Sourovelis in his thick Greek accent. ""He let them come inside the house? My wife and my son, they were sleeping. What he supposed to do? He did what he did to you, he bark."" As evening fell, the backyard decorations built by Sourovelis slowly came to life. The fountain that he'd put together out of stones pulled from a river and statues of Greek gods lit up with green lights. Red lights glittered around the quasi-Tiki bar he'd put together, with a TV (""to watch football, watch hockey"") nestled beside a brick oven and keggerator. ""I built this with my own two hands!"" said Sourovelis. He did not want to hear any arguments about a war on drugs. ""They know where is the crack house and where is the money house,"" said Sourovelis. ""They were tracking the dealer who gave drugs to my son, and they didn't arrest him right away, because they wanted this house."" The plaintiff's mind had been made up long ago. He did not want money. The libertarian law firm was representing him pro bono. He was asking for just $1 in damages. He wanted to bring down the system. That was all. ""What I say is, molon labe,"" said Sourovelis. ""You know the Battle of Thermopylae? Did you see 300? Those guys, the Persians, they want to take the Spartans' land. King Leonidas says: 'Molon labe. You want this, you come and take it.' I'm not gonna give it to you. I'm gonna fight for my rights. I'm surprised no one else do this before."""	Libertarians Are Fighting for Justice in Philadelphia
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/stacey_abrams_new_georgia_project_shocks_georgia_s_gop_republicans_fighting.html	"In 2008, under the best possible conditions for a Democrat, Barack Obama lost Georgia by just over 200,000 votes, or 5.2 percent of Georgians who voted. Four years later he lost again by just over 300,000 votes, or 7.8 percent of Georgians who voted. By any measure the state is a reach for Democrats. And yet, the party is optimistic, both now--Michelle Nunn and Jason Carter, its Senate and gubernatorial candidates, respectively, are running close races--and for the future. The ""why"" is easy to answer: Georgia has roughly 700,000 unregistered black voters. If Democrats could cut that number by less than a third--and bring nearly 200,000 likely Democrats to the polls--they would turn a red state purple, and land a major blow to the national Republican Party. Or, as Michelle Obama said during a campaign rally on Monday, ""If just 50 Democratic voters per precinct who didn't vote in 2010 get out and vote this November--just 50 per precinct--then Michelle Nunn and Jason Carter will win."" Given 2,727 precincts in Georgia, that's just 136,350 new voters. Enter the New Georgia Project. Led by Stacey Abrams, Democratic leader in the state House of Representatives, the project is meant to do just that--register hundreds of thousands of blacks and other minorities. Their goal, says Abrams, is to ""directly or indirectly collect 120,000 voter registration applications."" That could be enough to push Democrats over the top. And it makes the project one of the largest voter registration drives in recent Georgia history. So far, it's been a success. ""In addition to the 85,000 we have collected as an organization directly,"" says Abrams, ""we have also supported the efforts of 12 organizations around the state. We know there are groups doing registration in the Latino community, in the Asian community, and in the youth community, and we wanted to support their efforts as well."" These groups, she says, have collected 20,000 to 25,000 applications, putting the New Georgia Project in striking distance of its goal two months before Election Day. Which brings us to this week. On Tuesday, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp--a Republican--said his office was investigating allegations of voter fraud from the New Georgia Project, following complaints about voter applications submitted by the group. To that end, Kemp has issued subpoenas to the group and its parent organization, Third Sector Development. ""Preliminary investigation has revealed significant illegal activities' including forged voter registration applications, forged signatures on releases, and applications with false or inaccurate information,"" he wrote in a memo to county election officials. To Abrams, this has less to do with protecting the process and more to do with suppressing the registration effort. After all, she notes, Georgia law ""requires that we turn in all application forms we collect, regardless of concerns over validity."" It's the job of the secretary of state, she says, to determine the status of the applications. ""We do not get to make the decisions about whether or not a form is valid or not."" She's right. ""A private entity shall promptly transmit all completed voter registration applications to the Secretary of State or the appropriate board of registrars within ten days after receiving the application or by the close of registration, whichever period is earlier,"" says the Georgia Secretary of State's Office website. Nowhere are private organizations asked or required to filter or discard applications. There's little information on the scope of the alleged fraud. But there is an aggressive subpoena that, Abrams says, ""essentially demands every document we have ever produced."" She calls it a ""fishing expedition"" meant to ""suppress our efforts."" A spokesperson for the New Georgia Project, the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock of Ebenezer Baptist Church, was a little more explicit. ""I see this move by the secretary of state as the latest effort in voter suppression in the state of Georgia,"" he said. Kemp insists that this investigation is impartial and nonpartisan. ""At the end of the day this is not going to be about politics,"" he told a local reporter. ""This is about potential fraud which we think happened."" At the same time, Abrams and Warnock are rightfully suspicious. Not only was Kemp a vocal supporter of the state's divisive voter identification law, but he's a Republican in a state where the GOP has worked hard to dilute the strength of black voters. Under the old Voting Rights Act, Georgia officials had to clear voting changes with the Justice Department, and for good reason: The state had a long history of disenfranchisement, and ""preclearance"" was a way to pre-empt discrimination or prevent it entirely. That changed with the Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County v. Holder last year, which struck preclearance from the VRA. Now, along with other Southern states, Georgia was free to change its laws and procedures for voting. And it did. That year, in Augusta--which has a large black population--officials moved municipal elections from their traditional November dates, a change with huge, negative effects on turnout. (For a case study, look to Ferguson, Missouri.) Likewise, officials in rural Greene County implemented a redistricting plan previously blocked by the Justice Department, and lawmakers in Morgan County floated a plan to eliminate half the area's polling sites, a move that would have its greatest effect on low-income and minority voters. Then, Georgia Democrats realized they could play the same game. Last week officials in the large, mostly black area of DeKalb County announced plans for Sunday voting for the upcoming November election. The state's Republican lawmakers have responded with outrage. ""[T]his location is dominated by African American shoppers and it is near several large African American mega churches such as New Birth Missionary Baptist,"" said state Sen. Fran Millar, citing the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Jim Galloway, ""I'm sure Michelle Nunn and Jason Carter are delighted with this blatantly partisan move in DeKalb."" Millar is investigating ways to ""stop this action,"" and hopes to ""eliminate this election law loophole."" Against this backdrop of voter suppression, it's no surprise Abrams is suspicious of the state's investigation: From the harsh accusations of ""fraud"" to the aggressive actions from Kemp, it looks like another attack on efforts to increase participation and diversify the electorate. With that said, there's only so long Republicans can hope to win through such divisive methods. Six years ago, a ""purple"" Georgia was a pipe dream. Now, in a year when Republicans have the national advantage, it's a possibility. The pace of demographic change is so fast that, soon enough, Democrats like Abrams won't have to work to change the electorate--it will have happened on its own."	Georgia Democrats Have Registered So Many Minorities, Republicans Are Speechless--Except When They Cry Fraud
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/abolish_the_single_member_district_that_s_the_best_way_to_ensure_truly_fair.html	"As a conservative living in New York City, my vote for Congress is essentially a socially approved form of venting. A short while ago, I moved from an extremely liberal neighborhood in Manhattan to an extremely liberal neighborhood in Brooklyn. In my old apartment, I was represented by Jerrold Nadler, an extremely liberal Democrat. In 2012, he defeated his Republican opponent, the redoubtable Michael Chan, by a margin of 69.8 percent to 16.6 percent. In my new home, I am represented by Nydia Velazquez, also an extremely liberal Democrat. She trounced her Conservative Party opponent, James Murray, by 79 percent to 4.4 percent in 2012. More depressing still, Murray was crushed by blank ballots, which accounted for more than 16 percent of the total. Something tells me that Velazquez is not losing sleep over her re-election bid. To be sure, had I moved to Staten Island or Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, I would have found myself in the congressional district of Michael Grimm, a colorful Republican who likes to mix it up with the press. But Grimm is considered one of the most endangered incumbents in the House, thanks in no small part to, um, a 20-count federal indictment relating to, among other things, his alleged mismanagement of his old health food store, Healthalicious. (You know, the usual.) There is an excellent chance that in a few months' time, New York City's congressional delegation will consist entirely of Democrats. None of this should come as a shock. New York City is a liberal town, and I've long since resigned myself to being part of a small political minority. What I find galling is that, as observed in May by Rob Richie, the executive director of the electoral reform group FairVote, there are actually quite a few conservatives in New York City--believe it or not, Mitt Romney won 435,000 votes here. If Grimm goes down in November, Republicans in New York City will have no representation at the national level, an outcome that Richie rightly sees as a reflection of a much larger problem. I don't expect you to weep for the Big Apple's hearty band of unreconstructed Reaganites, as we are, after all, free to pick up stakes and move to Wyoming. Yet the problem we face--that our political influence doesn't match our numbers--is one faced by many groups, including liberals in conservative parts of the country, and members of racial, ethnic, and other minorities who want and consistently fail to get their fair share of political power. The root of the problem, as Richie and the good people at FairVote have long maintained, lies in our reliance on single-member districts to elect legislators. What's wrong with single-member districts? Let's start with gerrymandering, the practice in which the officials charged with drawing the boundaries of our various legislative districts do so with an eye toward boosting the members of a particular political party or group. There are many people who believe that gerrymandering is the root of all evil in American political life, and that we need to draw districts in an entirely apolitical manner. That is a fantasy. As long as we have single-member districts, it is inevitable that some group of people will be disadvantaged by the lines we draw, whether or not the line-drawers have sinister motives. Take the problem of Democratic underrepresentation in the House. If we assume that the parties should win congressional seats roughly in proportion to their share of the vote, Democrats in 2012 were underrepresented by a whopping 18 seats, according to an analysis by Christopher Ingraham. In Pennsylvania, for example, Democratic candidates won just more than 50 percent of the vote in the 2012 congressional elections while winning just five of the state's 18 congressional districts. Nate Cohn of the New York Times' Upshot has written that while partisan gerrymandering has indeed given Republicans an edge in holding the House of Representatives, the deeper problem is that Democrats are highly concentrated in densely populated urban and suburban districts, like those in and around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. By contrast, Republicans are, as a general rule, more evenly distributed across the map, which allows them to win more rural Pennsylvania districts with smaller margins. Slate's David Weigel has replied, reasonably enough, that there is an easy workaround to the fact that Democrats like to live cheek-by-jowl: simply carve up the cities in which they live and parcel them out across different congressional districts that also include less densely populated Republican territory. But this approach seems like just another way to institutionalize unfairness. If we wind up with pizza-slice districts that distribute Democrats into a larger number of heterogeneous districts, Republicans will complain that their voices have been squelched. If our goal is to create legislative districts that truly reflect their electorates, our best bet would be to give up on single-member districts altogether and replace them with multi-member ones. Take the case of my tribe, the forlorn conservatives of New York City. Even if the New York state Legislature decided that it wanted to carve out a new district to represent conservatives scattered across the five boroughs, and not just those in Michael Grimm's swing district, they'd have an almost impossible time doing so. For one thing, we don't all live in a heavily Republican enclave called ""Giulianiville."" A similar problem arises for minority groups that aren't isolated in particular neighborhoods. The only reason it is possible to draw majority-minority districts for blacks in the Deep South and some Northern and Western cities is that black segregation is still with us. Drawing majority-minority districts for less-segregated minorities, like Asians, is a different story. (The only Asian-majority congressional district in the United States is in Hawaii, though there is one district in California's Silicon Valley that comes close.) When you combine single-member districts into bigger multi-member districts, the picture starts to look quite different. The beauty of multi-member districts is that they allow us to use what FairVote calls ""fair representation voting."" (FairVote is stacking the deck a bit with that terminology, admittedly.) There are several different forms of fair representation voting, but FairVote is a fan of ""ranked choice voting,"" a method that has been used in Ireland and, closer to home, Cambridge, Massachusetts, for decades. Under that system, voters rank-order several different candidates rather than choosing their single favorite. Here's an excellent video from Minnesota Public Radio explaining how it works: As FairVote explains, the goal of this approach is to ensure that all candidates who receive a certain share of the vote will be elected. Some countries have huge multi-member districts that elect dozens of legislators. Israel elects all 120 members of the Knesset in a single multi-member district that encompasses the entire country. This guarantees that even very small groups can elect a representative who reflects their interests, yet it also severs the connection between a legislator and a given region. In the United States, FairVote envisions multi-member districts that would send no more than five representatives to Congress--big enough to represent relatively small minorities, but not so big that they don't have a connection to concrete communities. In a district with three representatives, you'd need to win 25 percent of the vote plus 1 to get elected. In a district with five reps, you'd need to win 16.7 percent plus 1. Getting there is a bit complicated--it involves fractions. But the basic idea is that if there were a three-seat multi-member district in Texas in which 68 percent of the vote went to Republican candidates and 32 percent went to Democratic candidates, one of the scenarios FairVote offers in ""Monopoly Politics 2014 and the Fair Voting Solution,"" it would send two Republicans and one Democrat to Congress. Of course, fair representation voting won't do much good in states that send only one member to Congress. The good it would do everywhere else, however, is reason enough to justify the idea. It should be obvious why multi-member districts would appeal to Democrats, who really are disadvantaged by the status quo. But it should appeal to Republicans, too. Yes, it would deny the GOP an edge over Democrats in the short term. But at the same time, it would help stranded conservatives like myself, and it would guarantee that some political reversal of fortune wouldn't one day result in Republican underrepresentation. There is an even better reason to favor fair representation voting: It might fuel the rise of new political parties. Getting to 50 percent can be challenging for Greens or Libertarians or other minor-party candidates who are asking voters to make a leap of faith. Getting to 17 percent in a multi-member district is far more realistic. Imagine if Netroots Democrats or Tea Party Republicans made an impact not by launching primary challenges but by setting up shop as separate political entities. Instead of dragging the major parties to the left or to the right, they'd be able to compete with them on a level playing field. It'd be a bit like the startup world, where venture-backed entrepreneurs routinely take on entrenched incumbents. Don't think your local Democrats are liberal enough? Vote Netroots! Tired of GOP squishes? Back the Tea Party! Not everyone likes the idea of a multi-party system, I realize. There is a neat symmetry to two-party politics, and it is true that our big, lumbering parties are capable of change, albeit at a slow pace. Yet it's hard to deny that a two-party system is best understood as a zero-sum game, in which a victory for one party is seen as a defeat for the other. This makes meaningful cross-party cooperation vanishingly rare. A multi-party system, in contrast, is one in which your enemy on one issue might become your ally on another. Netrooters might fight Tea Partiers tooth and nail on the top marginal tax rate one day while working alongside them to curb crony capitalism the next. They might join with Democrats on one issue and Libertarians on the next. This ever-present need for coalition-building creates a powerful incentive to treat your political rivals with respect, even when you disagree with them. That would make for a much healthier political culture--and certainly a more interesting one."	Forget Gerrymandering. Here's What We Need to Fix to Ensure Truly Fair Elections.
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/senators_weighing_obama_s_airstrikes_against_isis_democrats_fear_trusting.html	"Twelve years ago, when the Bush administration needed Democrats to back a resolution authorizing war in Iraq, Sen. Bill Nelson signed up. The Florida Democrat was in his first term, with no real threat to his re-election--he ended up steamrolling Katherine Harris four years later. Still, he'd listened to the Bush administration's case for war, and it seemed plenty convincing. ""The threat posed by Iraq grows with each passing day,"" Nelson said on the floor of the Senate. ""And since Sept. 11, 2001, we cannot wait to protect ourselves against the threats of weapons of mass destruction, regimes hostile to the United States, and their links to terrorism."" History has not been kind to Nelson's prediction. By 2007, he was part of the stampede of Democrats who regretted their 2002 votes, loudly, into microphones. In 2011, as American troops left Iraq, Nelson fretted that ""you can start to see the influence of Iran in Iraq"" as a result of a misbegotten American war. Then came ISIS. On Aug. 19, after American airstrikes ended their control of the Mosul Dam, ISIS, also known as the Islamic State or ISIL, released a video of captured American journalist James Foley being beheaded by a thug with a British accent. Two weeks later, Nelson introduced legislation that could authorize more airstrikes, this time on Syria. On Tuesday, as Congress returned to work and waited for a presidential address on the crisis, Nelson told reporters that the president could expect any tools he asked for. ""I don't think there's any timetable on what the president can do to protect Americans,"" Nelson said. ""All you need to do is see the videos of the beheading, and then you're not worried about mission creep."" A small circle of reporters asked Nelson to explain. How far would he go? ""I will support whatever it takes in my judgment to go in there and knock these guys out,"" he said. ""All they need to do is see the videos of the beheadings, and there is no question in your mind that these guys will not stop until the black flag of ISIS is flying over the White House. They are a threat to America and Americans."" Would airstrikes make a ""hard vote"" for ""war-weary"" Democrats? ""It's not a hard vote for me,"" said Nelson. ""All they have to do is see the videos. Then it's not a hard vote."" The politics of this month's ISIS panic could not be more different than the politics of 2002. President George W. Bush's administration badly wanted to end Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, and described the push for it as the ""marketing campaign"" for a ""new product."" President Barack Obama's administration, which celebrated the departure of American troops from Iraq, has been waging an air war on ISIS but struggling for ways to explain it. The terror state has not struggled at all. Its propaganda and social media campaigns have gotten results. This week, a CNN poll asked if the group already has terrorists operating in the United States; 71 percent of Americans, with no earthly idea if this was true, assumed it was. That meant that Congress returned from a monthlong recess with a choice, informed by years of regret and doubt, with ISIS being hyped as an existential threat to America. Those in tight races, Republicans especially, were portraying ISIS as an imminent threat to America. When asked if he agreed with that, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake--who voted for the 2002 war as a congressman--argued that ""we've already had two beheadings, maybe more."" But the beheadings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff didn't happen in America. They happened in Iraq, site of countless ISIS murders. When pressed, Flake admitted that the 2002 Iraq experience raised doubts about the credibility of the people who'd argued for military action. ""You've got to go to more than just one source and glean what you can from our own intelligence sources, from our allies in the region,"" he said. ""You don't want to intervene just to carry somebody's water."" Senators who'd opposed the 2002 vote, all of them Democrats, had been trying to say this for years. ""We were 'strong' and 'tough' under Bush and Cheney,"" said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucused with the Democrats in the House, then the upper house. ""We made the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States. We don't want to do that again."" ""It's fear-mongering,"" Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin told the Huffington Post. ""It's what happened after 9/11. 'Oh my God, they've got these planes crashing. Now they're going to take over America.' That's nonsense. We overreacted to 9/11."" Sanders has talked about running a progressive campaign for president; Harkin is retiring this year. They were immune to the quickening panic about trouble in Iraq spreading to America, but if some colleagues shared their skepticism, few were as sanguine about the new villains. On Wednesday, Sen. John McCain (not the quietest of the hawks) asked Homeland Security Undersecretary Francis Taylor about rumors of ISIS trying to sneak across the border. ""There have been Twitter and social media exchanges among ISIL adherents across the globe speaking about that as a possibility,"" Taylor said. The point was that they weren't pulling it off and were dumb enough to raise the possibility in public. The point might have been lost, as the ISIS-on-the-border story had bubbled up on conservative media, and ACORN stinger James O'Keefe waged a stunt to prove that ISIS agents could carry Ebola into the United States from Canada. Maybe the panic is inevitable. The politicians who bucked the 2002 Iraq War vote hoped, at least, that a new intervention could be handled less disastrously. Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, who's also retiring this year, talked about the possibility of a military authorization--pending the president's Wednesday speech--as a chance to undo the damage of Iraq. ISIS was a more unpredictable and reckless force in the Middle East than the 2002 version of Saddam Hussein. Congress was more unified than it was then. Maybe a vote, eventually, would be good for the cause. ""Our military deserve it, and frankly, it'll help the president attract support of Arab and Muslim countries if they see strength and unity here, and not partisan and political division in the Congress,"" said Levin. ""ISIL should help unify the world, for God's sake, and unify the Muslim world to take on this poison in their body. This is an opportunity, where you've got a vicious, poisonous environment, to unify the world against them."" It sounded like Levin was imagining that a war on ISIS could recreate the unity felt briefly by the civilized world after 9/11. But it was difficult to forget the reason that unity collapsed. ""Those of us associated with the Bush administration bear the burden of having launched a war on false premises that then yielded disappointing results,"" wrote David Frum, the former Bush speechwriter, in a column for the Atlantic. ""It's a heavy responsibility, and one most of us have struggled with in our various ways. Not a day goes by that I don't think of it."""	How Many Democrats Will See Obama's War on ISIS as Hype?
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/scott_brown_and_jim_rubens_new_hampshire_gop_primary_battle_outside_super.html	"In little New Hampshire's big money U.S. Senate primary, Republican Jim Rubens should be an afterthought at best. This former New Hampshire state senator, after all, hasn't occupied elected office since the late 1990s. He then lost a bid for governor, and failed to win back his old state Senate seat in 2000. But when a quixotic, out-of-state super PAC with a million-plus dollars to burn suddenly backs you, the atmospherics change. ""I would not have a chance without the super PAC,"" Rubens acknowledged. ""Now I do."" Mayday PAC is, paradoxically, an anti-super-PAC super PAC that pumps serious cash into campaigns of candidates like Rubens who'd like to see super PACs disappear altogether. Prior to Mayday PAC's involvement, a poll by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center and television station WMUR-TV indicated four in five voters statewide had no opinion of Rubens, one way or another. ""This is exactly why we're in there--to effect change and change how he's doing,"" said Larry Lessig, the Harvard Law School professor who founded Mayday PAC: ""We're optimistic we're going to be effective."" To be sure, a Rubens victory today would be outrageous, even for a state known for its rebellious streak--voters memorably picked commentator Pat Buchanan over standard-bearing Sen. Bob Dole during the 1996 Republican presidential primary--during a year when a GOP luminary like House Majority Leader Eric Cantor fell in a primary to a little-known challenger. Scott Brown, the former senator from Massachusetts who lost his seat in 2012, is expected to win the New Hampshire's GOP primary. Funded by thousands of small-dollar donations, Mayday PAC's more than $1.6 million investment in Rubens ahead of Tuesday's primary nevertheless illustrates how a lone special interest group can scramble a critical Senate race in the post-Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission era of increasingly deregulated political money and campaign finance exotica, like ""dark money"" committees and ""mommy PACs."" And it's distracting Brown from a full, general election pivot toward Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the moneyed Democratic incumbent. That's hardly ideal for Republicans desperate for a New Hampshire victory in their bid to pick up six seats nationwide and control a Senate majority. In fact, Brown campaign manager Colin Reed this weekend fired a cease-and-desist letter to Lessig, accusing his super PAC of, among other misdeeds, ""hypocrisy,"" ""falsehoods,"" violating Harvard University's honor code, and propagating the ""flat-out lie"" that Brown was a lobbyist. It promised to leave ""all our legal options on the table."" In response, Lessig wrote on his blog, in quoting Dirty Harry: ""Go ahead. Make my day."" Brown campaign spokeswoman Elizabeth Guyton declined to comment, instead referring to a campaign press release that focuses on Shaheen, in part criticizing her for running a campaign of ""tightly-controlled events with limited interactions with the media or members of the public"" and relying on ""outside, third-party groups"" to buoy her candidacy. No matter for Democratic interest groups, which are reveling in the Republicans' intramural scrap and using it to sling millions of dollars worth of negative ads at Brown, even before the general election officially begins. Shaheen, although generally popular in a state that's both elected her governor and senator, is nonetheless dogged by President Barack Obama's unpopularity, and her backers are using all the time they have to buttress her re-election bid. Two groups have each already spent more than $1 million attacking Brown: liberal super PAC Senate Majority PAC and NextGen Climate Action Committee, a super PAC run by billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer. The League of Conservation Voters' election arm has spent almost $400,000 to do the same. And the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee just launched a multimillion-dollar ad blitz blasting Brown's record during his brief U.S. Senate stint. Such spending is part of nearly $6.5 million worth of overt candidate advocacy by political committees and nonprofits in New Hampshire's Senate race. Almost all of the organizations spending money--including the pro-Brown U.S. Chamber of Commerce and super PAC Ending Spending Action Fund, formed by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts--are based in states other than New Hampshire. Mayday PAC is headquartered in Austin, Texas. Shaheen's campaign itself, at last count Aug. 20, had nearly four times more cash on hand than Brown's campaign, $4.27 million to $1.19 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings. ""If Brown doesn't come out of the primary with a fairly resounding victory, that doesn't look good for him going forward,"" said Norma Love, who recently retired as the Associated Press' New Hampshire political reporter after more than three decades. ""There's a lot at stake for him Tuesday."" For voters in this state of about 1.32 million people--only eight U.S. states have a smaller population--the Senate spending spree translates into a deluge of messaging that rivals presidential election season, when New Hampshire hosts first-in-the-nation party primaries. Statewide, New Hampshire has but a single, network-affiliated television station in WMUR-TV. No matter: Granite Staters have seen nearly 4,500 U.S. Senate-related ads this election cycle through Aug. 25, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG, an ad tracking service. That number figures to be hundreds, if not thousands more by the time residents take to the polls Tuesday, particularly since pro-Rubens Mayday PAC has run all of its ads during the Republican primary's final days. News programs, perhaps not surprisingly, are the most popular advertising platforms among most large political groups, as well as the Brown and Shaheen campaigns. After that, light entertainment rules: Candidates and noncandidate groups have combined to air 179 ads on game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. That includes 24 from Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC that supports Democrats, and 23 from Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, which names candidates in the race but doesn't directly advocate for or against them--a practice that allows it to avoid disclosing its ad spending to the FEC. Americans for Prosperity may also use ""dark money"" to fuel its ads, since as a nonprofit, it isn't legally compelled to reveal its donors. Morning gabfest Live! With Kelly and Michael has attracted 175 ads in New Hampshire's Senate race, Jimmy Kimmel Live 149, and the Ellen DeGeneres Show 138. Ellen, it turns out, is an Americans for Prosperity favorite, with the group so far running 40 ads during the daytime gabfest--more than the Shaheen or Brown campaign or any other noncandidate group. New Hampshire's Senate race, with all its spending, could have been wildly different. It's a massive departure from 2012 re-election bid in Massachusetts, when Brown cast himself as a novel kind of campaign finance reformer. He signed a ""people's pledge"" pact with Democratic opponent Elizabeth Warren with the goal--largely successful--of shooing noncandidate groups from the race. No such pledge materialized between Brown and Shaheen, despite Shaheen's call in March for him to sign one commensurate with his 2012 pledge. Brown called Shaheen's ask ""self-serving,"" noting she was off on a fundraising trip in California. And national Republicans argued that liberal outside groups had already spent significant money in New Hampshire before Brown even declared his candidacy. The lack of a ""people's pledge,"" curiously, allowed campaign finance reform-touting Mayday PAC to become Rubens' political lifeline--however tenuous--and make political money one of the race's focal points alongside health care, taxes, jobs, and the economy. But the campaign's big-money turn isn't a boon for all candidates. Ask former U.S. Sen. Bob Smith, who's also competing in Tuesday's GOP primary. Despite serving New Hampshire in Congress for nearly two decades, including two terms in the U.S. Senate, his latest political comeback--he ran for U.S. Senate in Florida during 2004 and 2010--has floundered, his campaign cash starved and seemingly chaotic. It's certainly a mere shadow of the professionalized outfit backing him in 2002, when he lost his seat in a Republican primary to eventual Sen. John E. Sununu. For example, after Smith's campaign chided media outlets last week for ignoring a concert event it hosted--""the media was missed,"" said media adviser Di Lothrop--Smith and his campaign refused over several subsequent days to comment about the race. Super PACs and nonprofits are largely shunning Smith, too. Only a pair of Tea Party-aligned groups have combined to spend less than $29,000 to directly back the former lawmaker, doing so with online ads and some supportive phone calls. Compare that to Senate races in Kentucky and Mississippi, for example, where Tea Party groups shoveled millions into the ultimately losing primary bids by very conservative candidates. The manner in which politics is waged, even in a state like New Hampshire where voters put a premium on retail politicking, appears to have passed Smith by. ""This is the first Senate race ever where we've seen a significant amount of super PAC money, 'dark money,' all of the above,"" said Dante Scala, a University of New Hampshire political science professor. ""This is how it works now."" As far as Rubens is concerned, there's nothing wrong with using this system to point out the flaws in it. ""I appreciate the super PAC support,"" he said. ""It helps be show that this country's problems won't be solved until we replace our corrupted political money system.""

Forces From Everywhere but New Hampshire Are Spending Millions to Win the State's GOP Primary

Did you know he was a devoted gang member with an extensive juvenile record who routinely robbed convenience stores and committed acts of mayhem? And did you know that when Officer Darren Wilson shot Brown, he wasn't using unjustified force, he was defending his life? The 6-foot-4, 300-pound 18-year-old fractured Wilson's eye socket while reaching for his gun, and was killed while charging at Wilson to land another blow. If this sounds suspect--if it sounds almost unbelievable--then your head is in the right place. Nothing in this narrative is true. Racist innuendo aside, there's no evidence Brown was a violent gang member, nor is there evidence of any serious wrongdoing--as a juvenile, Brown was never convicted of a felony nor was he facing charges as an adult. And while Wilson was taken to the hospital after his encounter with Brown, he didn't suffer serious injuries--the fractured eye socket is a myth. But if you read websites like the Independent Journal Review, dive into far-right media, or explore the world of Darren Wilson support pages, you'll find plenty of people who buy the fantasy. They reject the mainstream picture of Brown: A typical teenager, struggling to carve an identity and a life out of his beliefs, actions, and missteps. In their minds Brown was a budding criminal, and Wilson a hero. Or, as one Wilson supporter said during a demonstration for the officer, ""We'll all see this in the end that it was a good shooting. You know, it was a good kill."" We know why the Brown family was quick to give a loving portrait of Michael. Like any parents in their situation, they wanted the world to see their son as they did--a decent boy who didn't deserve to die. The question is for the other side: Why attack Michael Brown's reputation? After all, if the goal is an objective look, there's no need to explore Brown or Wilson as individuals. Brown could have been Gandhi or he could have been the Unabomber; all that matters for the case is what happened in a few brief moments on the streets of Ferguson. At the same time, we shouldn't be surprised by attacks on Brown. We know from all kinds of crime--and sexual assault cases in particular--that people are quick to blame the victim. It's one reason sexual assault has such a poor reporting rate--many women (and men) don't want to deal with the attacks on their character. We also see it in the particular instance of young black men killed by white figures (police or otherwise) in ambiguous circumstances. In 1955, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam kidnapped and killed 14-year-old Emmett Till after he reportedly spoke to a white woman--Bryant's wife Carolyn--in their Money, Mississippi, grocery store. After the two were acquitted by an all-white, all-male jury, they told their story to Alabama novelist William Bradford Huie. In their (improbable) version of events, writes historian Philip Dray in At the Hands of Persons Unknown, Till was ""sassy and unrepentant."" ""He showed me the white gal's picture! Bragged of what he'd done to her,"" said Milam, ""I counted pictures of three white girls in his pocketbook before I burned it. What else could I do? No use lettin' him get no bigger!""

Over time, I've come to appreciate why my friends moved. The urban neighborhoods of my Brooklyn youth were a little rough around the edges, and they didn't offer growing families much in the way of elbow room. I couldn't fall asleep without the sweet sound of sirens blaring, but not everyone felt the same way. The suburbs have long been a welcome refuge for families looking for a safe, affordable place to live. But for many Americans, the suburbs have become a trap. This week, Radley Balko of the Washington Post vividly described the many ways bite-sized suburban municipalities in St. Louis County prey on poor people. Towns too small or too starved of sales tax revenue to sustain their own local governments stay afloat by having local law enforcement go trawling for trumped-up traffic violations, the fines for which can be cripplingly expensive, and which only grow more onerous as low-income residents fail to pay them. Those who can afford lawyers know how to massage a big fine into a smaller one. Those who can't dread their run-ins with local police, who often come across less like civic guardians and more like cash-thirsty pirates. The resentment and distrust that follows is, according to Balko, crucial for understanding the recent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. Could it be that the problems plaguing St. Louis County reflect a larger failure of fragmented local government? Would these problems go away if, say, St. Louis simply absorbed all of these petty fiefdoms? I doubt it. The deeper problem is that the low-density suburbs of single-family homes that are common in this part of Missouri, and indeed across the country, are fundamentally inhospitable to those who find themselves at the bottom of the economic ladder. You might be wondering why poor families are moving to the suburbs in large numbers--the number of suburban poor grew more than twice as quickly as the number of urban poor between 2000 and 2011--if they are such hard places for poor people to get ahead. Part of it is that as middle- and high-income households moved to the suburbs, the low-wage workers who look after their children had little choice but to follow. Then there is the fact that as America's most productive cities experience a revival, gentrification is displacing low-income families to outlying neighborhoods and towns. Before we can understand what makes some suburbs so miserable, we first have to understand what makes others succeed. The most successful suburban neighborhoods fall into two categories. First, there are the dense and walkable ones that, like the most successful urban neighborhoods, have town centers that give local residents easy access to retail and employment opportunities. These neighborhoods generally include a mix of single-family homes and apartment buildings, which allows for different kinds of families and adults at different stages of life to share in the same local amenities. The problem with these urban suburbs, as Christopher Leinberger recounts in his 2009 book The Option of Urbanism, is that there are so few of them, and this scarcity fuels the same kind of gentrification that is driving poor people out of successful cities. The other model for success can be found in sprawling suburban neighborhoods dominated by households with either the time or the resources to maintain single-family homes and to engage in civic life. As a general rule, the neighborhoods in this latter category don't allow for apartment buildings or townhomes on small lots. They implement stringent local land-use regulations that keep them exclusive, and they attract families that tenaciously defend the character of their neighborhoods. There are many differences between these two models. But the most important one is that denser suburbs can accommodate family diversity relatively well while sprawling suburbs simply can't. Living the low-density lifestyle requires that you either be rich in money or rich in time and skill. Think about it this way. The typical postwar suburb was built to meet the needs of two-parent, single-breadwinner families. They were full of single-family homes that were rarely built to last, and their chief amenity was privacy, which generally meant a decent-sized lawn. Maintaining these houses was a heroic endeavor, but the division of labor implied by two-parent, single-breadwinner families meant that it was not an impossible one. Indeed, the very fact that maintaining these homes was such a chore made them precious to their owners, for whom they were a store of wealth as well as a place to live. Last summer, Slate contributor Matt Feeney argued that Detroit, his hometown, had declined so dramatically because it was ""a virtual monoculture, residentially speaking--a city of detached, owner-occupied, single-family homes."" Feeney describes the many ways Detroit, which grew up in the age of the automobile, is unique. Yet many aspects of his diagnosis apply to many other American cities. Threats to property values were not taken lightly, a fact that helps illuminate why fights over court-ordered desegregation and demographic change more broadly proved so ferocious so often. Renters might react to demographic change with relative equanimity, knowing that even if it had negative consequences, it wouldn't endanger their biggest investment. Homeowners felt they couldn't afford not to panic. Balko describes an eerily similar dynamic in the St. Louis suburbs, with eerily similar results: round after round of white flight, each one of which leaves a suburban ghetto in its wake. Since the initial rise of the suburbs, families have changed. Married couples with children have fallen from 42.9 percent of all households in 1940 to 20.2 percent of all households in 2010, while married couples without children have fallen from 33.4 to 28.2 percent of all households. Single-parent families have also increased, of course, from 4.3 percent to 9.6 percent. The most dramatic change has been the steep increase in one-person households, from 7.8 to 26.7 percent of the total. Families have also been transformed by rising female labor force participation, with women now serving as the sole or primary wage earner in four in 10 U.S. households with children. In the years before the intelligence and creativity of women were being harnessed by employers, much of it had been devoted to keeping neighborhoods livable and safe. Underemployed men have not, suffice it to say, stepped up to fill this role. Viewed through this lens, the problem we face is clear: Much of our built environment still bears the imprint of the postwar era, despite the fact that the families that were characteristic of that era are no longer dominant. A single-family house built for a mother, a father, and a pair of kids is not a terribly attractive option for a single adult, nor is it affordable when we factor in the cost of upkeep. Such a house might be more appealing to a working single parent, who might welcome the space, yet he'd either have to carve out the time to maintain his little slice of heaven, or he'd have to earn enough to outsource the work of doing so. And then there is the small matter of affording an automobile, and the inevitable traffic fines that come with it. Late last month, Charles Marohn, an engineer and urban planner, wrote an essay on Ferguson that centered on, of all things, the bleakness of its many parking lots and the monotony of its buildings. One of Marohn's central arguments is that it is far easier to finance the maintenance of a street that serves, say, multistory buildings with retail shops on the ground floor and apartments above than it is to finance a cul-de-sac that serves a small handful of houses, as the former generates far more revenue. To be sure, if the cul-de-sac links together million-dollar homes in pristine shape, this problem is not a problem at all. If it instead serves families that struggle to maintain their homes, or houses that are abandoned, the problem can get ugly fast. Roads need upkeep. Upkeep costs money. If property or sales taxes aren't enough to pay for upkeep, you can take on debt, you can ask for money from the state or federal government, or, like cities across St. Louis County, you can find creative new ways to leech away cash from your most vulnerable citizens. There is no straightforward way out of this suburban trap. It certainly wouldn't hurt to welcome more housing development in expensive cities, or to discourage unsustainable development by at the very least not subsidizing it. But the first step toward solving this suburban crisis is recognizing that it is in fact a crisis. Just ask the people of St. Louis County."	How the Suburbs Got Poor
