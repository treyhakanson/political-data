In a momentary display of discipline, he read from a teleprompter with virtually no ad-libbing, avoiding digs at Bill Clinton's infidelity or conspiracy theories about Vince Foster's suicide. Standing in a low-ceilinged conference room bedecked with square chandeliers in the Trump SoHo, a lawsuit-plagued hotel and condo development, Trump spoke for 40 minutes without saying anything overtly sexist. Instead, he aimed straight at Clinton's most-serious weaknesses, describing her as a venal tool of the establishment. ""Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs and effectively let China completely rebuild itself,"" he said. ""In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!"" He added, ""She gets rich making you poor,"" and called her possibly ""the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency."" The point is not that this is true; as political analyst David Gergen said on CNN, the speech was slanderous. But the lies in the speech, many taken from Peter Schweizer's book Clinton Cash, were not obviously self-refuting. At one point, Trump said, citing Schweizer, ""Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation."" This has been debunked many times over, including by FactCheck.org. To explain why it's not true, though, you have to go into details about Clinton's role on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which approved the sale of a Canadian-based energy company with American mining stakes to Russia's nuclear energy agency. It's a very different sort of lie than the one Trump told at a meeting of evangelicals on Tuesday when he said there's ""nothing out there"" about Hillary Clinton's religion--in fact, her Methodism is extremely well-known even to her political enemies. Like all skillful demagoguery, Trump's speech on Wednesday interwove truth and falsehood into a plausible-seeming picture meant to reinforce listeners' underlying beliefs. In May, Morning Consult polled people with an unfavorable view of Hillary Clinton about why they didn't like her. Fifty-eight percent said she was too liberal, while 22 percent said she was too conservative. But 82 percent of Hillary-averse voters said she was corrupt, and 88 percent said she was untrustworthy. These are the beliefs that unite her foes across the political spectrum. It's why Trump, with his devious talent for derisive nicknames, was smart to dub her ""Crooked Hillary."" Some of the examples Trump chose to reinforce this caricature are true. Describing Clinton as ""a world-class liar,"" he said, ""Just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie. Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less."" One could quibble about whose exaggerations have been greater, but Clinton's Bosnia tale really was mostly made up, and it will likely haunt her throughout the campaign. Trump is clearly hoping to reach working-class whites in places like Ohio, where a recent poll shows him tied with Clinton. ""We'll never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place,"" he said. ""The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power, and in the money. That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement, so together we can fix the system for all Americans. This includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. Because it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy."" It was a direct appropriation of the rhetoric Sanders used to woo the white working class. When the speech was over, I spoke to Carl Paladino, Trump's New York co-chairman and frequent surrogate, who said that he expects the speech to mollify some of Trump's Republican critics. ""They can't come griping anymore,"" he said. ""He's on the teleprompter, and he's on message. It's a lot easier when you're scripted in your presentation."" Paladino then provided some of the extemporaneous insults missing from Trump's speech, deriding Republicans who've expressed concern about their party's nominee. ""The press is always going to find some of these screwballs,"" said Paladino. I asked if he considers House Speaker Paul Ryan a screwball. ""Absolutely he's a screwball,"" he replied. ""He doesn't understand his responsibility to the people. He wasn't elected by all the people. He was elected by some people up in Wisconsin and put into that office, and that office should have more dignity and understanding that when you have a candidate who's chosen by the people, you will support that candidate, unequivocally. Paul Ryan thinks he can pass judgment on the specifics of a Donald Trump. He can't pass judgment."" Maybe not, but for at least one morning Trump did his best not to terrify his own party, and it was terrifying to watch him succeed. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/donald_trump_s_invisible_campaign.html	"As of Monday morning, the Trump campaign doesn't have a manager. ""The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign,"" spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement to the press. ""The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future."" It's tempting to treat this like a genuine shock--a blow that could disrupt Trump's effort to win the presidency. But two things are true: First, Lewandoski has been a declining presence since Trump captured the nomination in May, increasingly overshadowed by campaign chairman Paul Manafort. And with Lewandowski gone, explained one Trump ally to Fox News, Manafort is ""totally in charge."" And the second thing? To suggest the Trump campaign is hurt by Lewandowski's departure is to assume a campaign exists. The truth is, there is no Donald Trump campaign. This isn't a matter of metaphysics; I mean this in a literal sense. Consider campaign staff. At this point in a presidential cycle, the presumptive nominees of both parties have begun to construct a field operation meant to identify supporters, train volunteers, and prepare for the tough work of bringing voters to the polls. By the time Mitt Romney entered June--after extinguishing Rick Santorum's challenge from the right--he had more than a dozen offices open in Ohio and at least 89 paid staffers for his national campaign. By November, Romney had opened nearly 300 offices nationwide and employed more than 400 people. Team Obama invested even more in offices and personnel, with nearly 800 field locations and over 900 paid staffers. How much staff has Donald Trump hired? At last count, the Trump campaign has roughly 30 staffers nationwide. By comparison, Team Clinton has hired 50 people in Ohio alone. Even if it's still early in the cycle, a typical campaign would have several senior staff members in place in most, if not all, contested states. Trump has close to none. And while the Republican National Committee has people on the ground in swing states and other vital areas, they're focused on the entire ticket. Trump needs dedicated, professional help and he doesn't have it. He seems to be waiting until July, at the earliest, to determine hiring and placement. What about advertising? Paid television is part and parcel of modern campaigning and can have real--albeit temporary--effects on the race. In their book The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election, political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck fnd that, all things equal, a candidate airing one additional ad per capita over an opponent gains an advantage of almost 1 extra point in public polling, compared with a market where candidates are at parity in advertising. Likewise, a candidate with two additional ads per capita gains two extra points compared with the baseline. But it's hard to sustain these advantages across time; eventually, the other side catches up. Which means that in the long term, these effects decay as neither side holds a durable advantage, and neither can shift the game through ads alone. Team Obama's $45 million ad buys in June 2012 was matched, in turn, by Team Romney's $38 million response. Any effect of the former was moderated and even canceled out by the latter. Trump may not have a ground game, but is he fighting on the airwaves, matching Clinton or even trying to harm her standing? Not at all. As of Sunday, Team Clinton has put more than $23 million into advertising across eight swing states: Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina, Iowa, and New Hampshire. (Pennsylvania's omission is curious.) Team Trump has nothing. Not a single dollar. Clinton is spending millions to rehabilitate her image and attack Trump, with nothing to deal with in the way of pushback. Exacerbating all of this, for Trump, is that he's broke: Trump has just $2.4 million in the campaign coffers. Put differently, Clinton's ad buy is nearly 10 times as large as what Trump has on hand for his entire operation. Trump could raise money, but reports say he's uninterested in calling donors and other contributors. If you follow enough election coverage, you'll notice a phrase from those inclined to read and absorb political science: ""Campaigns don't matter."" The idea is that the twists and turns of the horse race are less important than the broad ""fundamentals"" of an election year: unemployment, economic growth, foreign conflict, etc. What's key is the mechanism behind the slogan. It's not that campaigns are useless; it's that--in general--they're evenly matched, so they cancel each other out. When they aren't--Obama's ground game vs. Romney's, for instance--they don't. What happens when one side has a campaign and the other doesn't? When one side is mobilizing voters, contacting supporters, and persuading independents, and the other is sitting on its hands? Cable news has done a lot for Donald Trump, but it can't raise money or organize volunteers. What happens when it's September and Trump lacks the personnel or the cash to mount a credible fight against the Democratic Party? I don't know. No one knows, because it's never happened before. But if the polls are any indication, what happens is something like a catastrophic defeat for Trump and the rest of the Republican Party. And of all possible outcomes in this election, that's the most fitting. Trump built his career by talking and grifting his way into some facsimile of success, before losing it to his own arrogance and narcissism. If nothing else, a historic defeat in November will fit the pattern. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

There is a flurry of confusing reports. A death toll is announced, a shooter identified. And then, even before the crime scene is cleaned up, come the pleas for gun control. The urge is understandable. In the wake of the Orlando, Florida, shootings (as with San Bernardino, California, before that, and Umpqua Community College before that, and Charleston, South Carolina, before that), it's impossible to read about the victims, about the joint funeral planned for Juan Ramon Guerrero and his partner Drew Leinonen, and not feel a horrible combination of sadness and outrage and a wish to do something. But you already know how this will play out. Gun-control advocates and their allies in the media will attack the gun-rights crowd as cold-hearted, stubborn, and out of touch. They will complain that no new legislation will result from the tragedy, and they will be right. There are many reasons that this cycle repeats as it does. We live in a divided society where people cocoon with like-minded allies, and we've stopped listening to the other side. The NRA is powerful. We get distracted and move on to the next shiny thing. But one important point: The mainstream media lobbies hard for gun control, but it is very, very bad at gun journalism. It might be impossible ever to bridge the divide between the gun-control and gun-rights movements. But it's impossible to start a dialogue when you don't know what the hell you are talking about. Media stories in the wake of mass shootings typically feature a laundry list of mistakes that reflect their writers' inexperience with guns and gun culture. Some of them are small but telling: conflating automatic and semi-automatic weapons, assault rifle and assault weapon, caliber and gauge--all demonstrating a general lack of familiarity with firearms. Some of them are bigger. Like calling for ""common-sense gun control"" and ""universal background checks"" after instances in which a shooter purchased a gun legally and passed background checks. Or focusing on mass shootings involving assault weapons--and thereby ignoring statistics that show that far more people die from handguns. Considering that a quick online search should provide all the information journalists need to get this right, it's amazing that journalists don't know the difference between an assault rifle and an assault weapon. An assault rifle is a fully automatic weapon that can fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger, up to 950 rounds per minute. An assault weapon is a semi-automatic gun that can accept detachable magazines and has a pistol grip and an adjustable stock (to increase the gun's length).* The term assault weapon itself, of disputed origin, is a thorn in the side of gun enthusiasts, who point out that the differences between ""assault weapons"" and other semi-automatics are largely cosmetic and don't increase the gun's lethality. It's a little surprising that Mother Jones conflated the two in its Orlando coverage. The magazine tends to be scrupulously sober-minded about guns; its database of mass shootings is thorough and resists the urge to inflate fearmongering statistics. Less surprising, perhaps, are Rolling Stone's errors. The magazine's claim that it's easier to get an assault rifle than an abortion is particularly egregious, since assault rifles are regulated by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and require a lengthy permit process that is handled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Do you want an M16, the military version of the AR-15? Expect a wait of seven to eleven months. Perhaps out of increased frustration at the inability to pass new anti-gun legislation, some have called, sometimes sarcastically, for the Second Amendment to guarantee your right to bear a musket, which was a common weapon at the time of the amendment's ratification in the late 1700s. Muskets could fire single shots or a ""cluster"" shot with multiple projectiles, but they had to be reloaded after every firing. In the Washington Post this week, Eugene Robinson wrote, ""When the framers wrote of  'arms,' they were thinking about muskets and single-shot pistols. They could not have foreseen modern rifles or high-capacity magazines."" A few problems with this. First, gun enthusiasts will be only too happy to educate you on the existence of the Girandoni air rifle, which dates back to 1779, 12 years before the Second Amendment was ratified. It used compressed air, not gunpowder, and could hold 20 bullets at once. Lewis and Clark had one with them when Thomas Jefferson sent them out to explore the West. Second, we can argue all day about what the Framers--all now dead for 200 years or so--intended with the Second Amendment. But it seems disingenuous to argue that, in crafting a document that has largely served us well for more than 220 years, they couldn't imagine improvements in gun technology. Much ado has been made of the fact that initial reports out of Orlando said that the shooter used an AR-15-type rifle, whereas it has since been announced that he used a Sig Sauer MCX. This is less an indication of ignorance on the part of the media (for one thing, it is how Orlando police described the weapon) than an example of the confusion common in the immediate aftermath of a major breaking story. To someone who doesn't own a lot of guns, it's not a big deal. Like mixing up Coke and Pepsi, Toyota and Honda. Both rifles shoot .223-caliber ammunition and, as the Washington Post writes in a piece comparing the two, are designed to provide ""a highly portable, customizable, easy to operate and accurate rifle for the individual who possesses it."" I suspect that the conflation rankles gun-rights advocates because gun opponents have held up the AR-15 as the poster child of the gun violence problem and so use the term as a convenient shorthand. That gun writers crow when the media makes mistakes like this indicates how little regard there is for the media from the pro-gun community. There are several ways the media can remedy this situation. For starters, treat guns like any other beat (as the Guardian has done with Lois Beckett). Media outlets tend not to send sports writers to cover the Supreme Court or style writers to cover a murder. Ignorance undermines authority. If you want to report on guns, you need to understand the differences between various weapons and how they are used. Spend time at a shooting range and learn how to fire a gun. Be able to interview an NRA member without scorn or derision. News outlets make a lot of noise about diversity. They should apply a more holistic definition. Yes, the industry should strive for inclusiveness in gender and race and ethnicity. But it also needs more geographical, socioeconomic, and ideological diversity. Employ writers who, if not gun enthusiasts themselves, grew up in a place where hunting was a normal part of life. Provide a broader range of gun coverage. As long as the media sensationalizes mass shootings, statistics will not be on their side, and gun-rights supporters know this. Such events are so horrific that it makes it easy to appeal to people's emotions. But statistically, they are very rare. Exploiting these tragedies, calling semi-automatic rifles ""weapons of war"" and the ""weapon of choice"" for mass shooters is a conversation-ender with pro-gun types. It's much harder to write about the gun violence in inner cities, like Chicago. You're dealing with systemic problems far beyond guns. But ignoring the wider violence creates the impression that the media cares only about rifles and mass shootings. If the media wants to work toward actual solutions for gun violence, to do right by the people who are senselessly murdered, they need more than righteous indignation. They need to be better informed and more willing to engage honestly with their opponents. *Correction, June 21, 2016: This article originally misstated that assault weapons have foldable stocks to increase the gun's length. The stocks that are used to increase the gun's length are called adjustable or collapsible. (Return.) Read more from Slate on the Orlando nightclub shooting."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/muslim_assimilation_is_challenging_and_fraught_donald_trump_is_making_it.html	"Omar Mateen, the man responsible for the Orlando massacre, was an American born in Queens, New York. Nevertheless, he reportedly told his victims that he was acting in defense of his country, by which he meant Afghanistan. Despite having spent his entire life on American soil, Mateen evidently felt that Afghanistan was his homeland and that the U.S. military intervention in his parents' native country justified slaughtering dozens of civilians in a gay nightclub in Orlando. What should we make of the fact Mateen committed his crime not as an American but as an Afghan, and that he'd sworn allegiance to the Islamic State? Perhaps the answer is that we shouldn't make too much of it. Mateen is hardly representative of second-generation Muslims in America, the vast majority of whom would never dream of committing a terrorist attack. It is also true, however, that Mateen is not the first native-born lone-wolf Muslim terrorist to have claimed the lives of Americans in recent years. Syed Rizwan Farook, one half of the couple behind the killings in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. Nadir Soofi, one of the men behind the May 2015 attack in Garland, Texas, was born in Dallas. Given that Muslims make up no more than 1 percent of the U.S. population, and that young Muslim men have been overrepresented among the perpetrators of terror attacks, it is hardly surprising that many Americans view their Muslim countrymen with fear and anxiety. Like clockwork, Donald Trump has sought to stoke these fears for his own benefit. Shortly after the Orlando attack on Sunday, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee told Fox News' Sean Hannity that Muslims in America are unassimilable. ""It's almost, I wouldn't say it's nonexistent, but it gets to be pretty close. I'm talking about second and third generation,"" he said. ""For some reason there's no real assimilation."" Trump has been rightly chastised for claiming ""there's no real assimilation"" among second- and third-generation Muslims: In 2011, 63 percent of Muslim adults in the U.S. were immigrants, while only 15 percent belonged to the second generation. The rest belonged to the third generation and beyond, with many of these Muslims being converts from other faiths, including blacks with deep roots in the U.S. Virtually all second- and third-generation Muslims speak English, and their participation in civic life is not notably lacking. If we were to stick with a very narrow definition of what assimilation entails, we could safely dismiss Trump's remarks as bloviation. But let's put Trump's idiocy aside for a moment and consider assimilation in a deeper sense. Peter Skerry, a political scientist at Boston College who has devoted much of the past two decades to the study of Muslim American assimilation, has emphasized the central role of generational conflict in shaping Muslim communities. In ""Clash of Generations,"" an essay published in the Weekly Standard in the wake of the San Bernardino terror attack, Skerry detailed the different ways Muslim immigrants and their children struggle to find their place. For most Americans, assimilation is an unambiguous good. For most immigrants, however, it is a mixed blessing at best, as it means surrendering cherished aspects of one's native culture, and allowing ties to family and friends back home to attenuate. While the collapsing cost of communication and long-distance air travel has allowed immigrants to sustain ties to their homelands to a far greater degree, the demands of upward mobility in American life tend to cut against staying true to the old ways. For immigrants, the tradeoffs involved in assimilation are never easy and many, if not most, never fully reconcile themselves to the fact that they've left the old world behind. As Skerry explains, the experience of second-generation Muslims is quite different than that of their immigrant parents, and in some respects more difficult. ""They seldom have either the option or the desire to relocate to their parents' homelands; for them, home is here, in the United States,"" Skerry writes. ""But because this is the generation that rides the wave of assimilation, whether it wants to or not, this is also the generation that sometimes tries self-consciously to apply the brakes, even to reverse the process, in order to regain what many feel has been lost."" What might it mean to apply the brakes? It could mean something as simple as taking pride in one's ethnic heritage or choosing to marry within the fold. But that is not all it can mean. Throughout the Muslim world, traditional understandings of Islam, rooted in distinct ethnic cultures, have been challenged by the rise of a more globalized Salafi Islam, financed and promoted by Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf states. It is hard enough for tradition-minded Muslims to make the case for more tolerant--or, in the eyes of their detractors, more compromised--brands of Islam in Muslim-majority societies, where debates over what counts as Islam are fierce and often violent. It is harder still in the United States, where Muslim immigrants find themselves far away from traditional sources of familial and religious authority. To young second-generation Muslims, it's not at all obvious that one ought to practice Islam as it was practiced in Malaysia or Pakistan. Why wouldn't you instead choose the more authentic brand of Islam you encounter online, or via second-generation Muslim friends? Salafi Islam owes nothing to the forms of Islam that most Muslim immigrants carry with them. Rather, it is austere, pure, and more than a little transgressive. It resonates in particular with second-generation Muslims who see American society as plagued by racial injustice and who resent their parents for their pusillanimity in the face of this injustice. This brand of Islamic belief, which fuses religion with deep political anger against the status quo, does not always inspire violence, to be sure. It could lead a young second-generation Muslim to seek out a career in social justice, for instance, or to join a peaceful protest movement. Yet, just as some small number of young leftists joined terrorist groups like the Baader-Meinhof gang or the Weather Underground, a small number of young Muslims who adhere to a politicized, culture-free understanding of Islam eventually choose violence. It is not a coincidence that Salafi Islam has given rise to al-Qaida and ISIS. All of this is to say that Americans are right to fret about the crimes perpetrated by young men like Omar Mateen: Muslim assimilation in America really is fraught, and it's undeniably a hard problem to solve. This is one reason why I favor a more selective immigration policy--to help ensure we welcome only those who are best suited to flourish in a society like ours. But it is also undeniable that when Donald Trump declares Muslims are unassimilable, he almost certainly makes matters worse. Sweeping attacks on Muslims can deepen a sense of grievance that already exists. These rhetorical broadsides encourage Muslims to identify not as black or Asian American, or as Wisconsinites or Bernie Sanders enthusiasts, but as Muslims first and foremost. This sharpens the dividing line between Muslims and non-Muslims, and it can contribute to turning resentment into something worse. Read more from Slate on the Orlando nightclub shooting."	Muslim Assimilation Is Challenging and Fraught. Trump Is Making It Much, Much More Difficult.	['Sanders', 'Trump']	['gay']
4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/donald_trump_not_just_a_bigot_toward_muslims.html	"Donald Trump's latest call for a crackdown on Muslims isn't really about the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. It isn't about terrorism or even Islam. It's about Trump. The things he's saying about Muslims--that all of them are responsible for the crimes of some, that the good ones protect the bad ones, that they're foreign even if they were born here, that we should exclude them all to play it safe--are the same things he has said about blacks, Latinos, and other minorities. If we're going to speak frankly about the pathologies on display this week, we can't just talk about radical Islamic terrorism. We have to talk about Trump's bigotry. Trump portrays his vigilance against Muslims as a way to protect gays, women, Jews, and other Americans who might be targeted by jihadists. But his record shows the opposite. Again and again, he has appealed to prejudice, selecting as his villain whichever minority group best serves his advantage at the moment. Muslims are just his latest target. Consider the following arguments, which Trump has made in the past about other minorities and is now leveling against Muslims. 1. They're dangerous. Murder in the name of Islam is a big problem. But Trump overstates it, portraying all Muslims as pernicious radicals. He misrepresents poll data to imply that 99 percent of Muslim immigrants can't live peacefully with Americans. He says ""Islam hates us"" and demands a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" On Monday, he warned about immigrants ""from Muslim countries."" He claimed that Hillary Clinton ""wants a 500 percent increase in people coming in from Syria that are radical Islamists""--essentially equating refugees with radicals. This isn't the first time Trump has misrepresented crime statistics to vilify a minority. Three years ago, he tweeted that ""the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and [H]ispanics."" Trump didn't mention that the victims of these crimes, like victims of violence by Muslims, were overwhelmingly of the same ethnicity as the perpetrators. Last year, he retweeted a fabricated claim that 81 percent of white homicide victims were killed by blacks. In reality, 82 percent of white homicide victims were killed by whites. When Trump was asked about the discrepancy, he said his numbers came ""from sources that are very credible."" He shrugged, ""Am I gonna check every statistic?"" Trump has also made wild statements about crime by Mexican immigrants. Last year, in his presidential campaign announcement speech, he asserted: ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. ...They're sending people that have lots of problems. ... They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" He claimed that ""tremendous crime is coming across"" the border, that ""illegal immigrants pouring through the country"" were producing ""hundreds of thousands of people going to state and federal penitentiaries,"" and that this was driving U.S. crime numbers ""through the roof."" All of these claims were false, misleading, or unsupported. 2. Play it safe. Even if most Muslims are decent, Trump argues, we should bar them all, because you never know which ones might hurt us. That's his argument for a ban: We can't ""vet"" them, and we have ""no idea if they love us or hate us,"" so we'd better keep them out ""until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on."" This is the same argument Trump has made against immigrants from Mexico: that while ""some, I assume, are good people,"" others are rapists and drug mules, so we need a wall and mass deportations. Trump has also suggested, at campaign rallies, that Seventh-day Adventists and Cuban Americans can't be trusted. He phrased these insinuations artfully, saying things like, ""Seventh-day Adventist, I don't know about, I just don't know about,"" and, ""Not too many evangelicals come out of Cuba, OK? Just remember that."" But his words sent a clear signal to Republicans thinking about voting for Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, or Marco Rubio: These men belong to suspicious groups. Beware. 3. They don't police themselves. Trump routinely claims that Muslim neighbors and relatives knew in advance about the attacks in San Bernardino, California,  and Orlando but didn't warn the authorities. Fact-checkers have debunked these allegations, but Trump doesn't care. ""The Muslim community does not report people like this,"" he asserted in a CNN interview on Monday. He told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, ""The Muslims are the ones that see what's going on. The Muslims are the ones that have to report them. And if they don't report them, then there have to be consequences to them."" In a speech about the Orlando attack, Trump said these plot-hiding witnesses must be ""brought to justice."" But shielding lawbreakers isn't just a Muslim habit, according to Trump. It's also a Latino habit. A year ago, Trump retweeted an allegation that Jeb Bush ""has to like the Mexican illegals because of his wife."" Trump defended this allegation on the grounds that Bush's wife (who has been an American citizen for decades) was ""from Mexico."" Then Trump accused Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge in the Trump University fraud case, of using the case to hurt Trump and protect illegal immigrants because Curiel (who was born in the United States) was ""Mexican."" By Trump's logic, all people of Mexican descent are presumptively guilty of protecting ""illegals."" Trump has also castigated the nation's first black president for purportedly failing to control black crime. In 2014, during riots in Ferguson, Missouri, Trump tweeted that ""President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community."" Last year, after Freddie Gray's death, Trump jeered:  ""Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!"" If you're black, Mexican American, or Muslim, you're accountable for controlling your people. If you're white, you're not. 4. Ancestry is destiny. The shooter in Orlando was a natural-born U.S. citizen from an Afghan family. The male shooter in San Bernardino was a natural-born U.S. citizen from a Pakistani family. Trump uses these cases to suggest that all Americans of Muslim ancestry are security risks. Therefore, working backward, he argues that even Muslims who show no signs of radicalism must be kept out of the country, since we have no way ""to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children."" This policy--barring people from the United States based on possible crimes by their future grandchildren--would seem to bar all Muslims in perpetuity. And it's not the first time Trump has challenged the loyalty of American citizens based on ancestry. He says Curiel is inherently biased against him because Trump is ""very strong on the border"" and Curiel is ""of Mexican heritage."" Trump has also spent years challenging Obama's legitimacy on the grounds that Obama, who has a U.S. birth certificate, was secretly born in Kenya and might be a Muslim. This week, Trump again suggested that Obama was jeopardizing American security against radical Islam because ""he's got something else in mind."" Trump's objections to Middle Eastern immigrants go beyond security. In his speech on Monday, he argued that they cost too much money, undermine wages, and push their religion on Americans. ""They're trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is,"" he said. In an interview with Breitbart News Daily, Trump said the president should use the term radical Islamic terrorism ""just to build up the spirit in our country."" On Friday, before the Orlando attack, Trump told the Faith and Freedom Coalition that he would stem the influx of Muslim refugees and ""defend Christian Americans."" Trump's complaints about Muslims--they commit crimes, take jobs, protect lawbreakers, and infect the country with weird religion and foreign loyalties--aren't much different from his complaints about other minorities. It's nothing personal. He just has a penchant and talent for exploiting prejudice. ""Unless you're willing to discuss and talk about the real nature of the problem,"" Trump declared Wednesday in another anti-Muslim tirade, ""you're never going to solve the problem."" He's right. It's time to talk about the real nature of Trump's problem: He's a bigot."	Trump Talks About Muslims the Way He Talks About Other Minorities. See for Yourself.	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

With each new season comes another mass shooting, or perhaps a controversial police killing, and with each tragedy comes another White House statement of sorrow, anger, and resignation. On this issue, Obama has ceased to be a president and now acts as a Greek chorus of sorts, offering his words to the public and speaking for the millions of frustrated Americans who want Washington to do something about the shootings that mark the landscape like a spatter pattern. ""This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub,"" said Obama in a statement delivered Sunday. ""And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well."" Because Americans of all stripes are preoccupied with the White House, it's easy to treat this as a presidential failure--a lack of will from the White House. How can Obama pass a stimulus and health care reform, but can't get something as simple and popular as background checks? We saw executive action on climate and on immigration; why can't we see it on guns too? Why can't Obama act on policies that are more popular and just as dramatic as anything he's pursued in seven years at the head of the federal government? What, exactly, is the holdup? This is infinitely understandable. And at each address on gun violence, if you watch Obama carefully, you can see him grappling with the same questions. Why can't he do something? But this is a poor avenue for inquiry and the wrong focus for blame. Obama invested tremendous energy into passing new gun policies, pressing Congress on all sides in the wake of Sandy Hook. Republicans wouldn't budge. And in the absence of their support, the drive failed. The problem of stricter gun policy isn't the presidency. It isn't even Congress. It's the public, or at least, the part of the public that wants gun control. Our collective understanding of our politics is saturated in myth. We believe that we are rational (we are not), that we decide on issues not on personality (we do not), that we aren't rigid partisans to the core (for the most part, we are), and that politicians represent the public at large. The last idea looms large. It is routine, for politicians on both sides, to decry ""special interests"" as an imposition on the business of government. The proper politician, the honest one, speaks and acts only for ""the people,"" broadly (and vaguely) defined. But this is wrong, full stop. American government, from the ground up, is designed around those so-called special interests, from the immense power of Congress and individual legislators, to the two-party system, which aggregates countless goals and preferences into two overall choices. This isn't a perfect system, but it's based in sound thinking. The United States is an impossibly large country of people with competing, contradictory, and often antagonistic views and priorities. Ideas and policies that seem popular often aren't once you drill down to the details, or once they come in conflict with the values, ideals, and identities of an individual, of a family, of a community. The only way to make a country like this work, as a democracy at least, is to accommodate pluralism, encourage compromise, and limit the system's capacity for rapid change. What you lose in vigor and unified action you gain in lower stakes. Politics becomes a little less life and death. This arrangement privileges groups that can organize for their advantage. You can call them ""interests."" And they often work in concert and alliance with other interests that have similar or compatible goals. This is another way of saying that, in the American system, public opinion isn't enough. You also have to have organized actors who can maneuver and agitate at all levels, who can leverage informal and institutional networks to build and shape support among that public, or some of its constituent parts. And in turn, those actors have to have ties to politicians and parties--inherently sympathetic or not--who see some advantage in working for the same goals. (Politicians like to win, after all.) How this looks varies across time and place, but it is the general blueprint, either on the left or on the right, from conservation to the ongoing fight over affirmative action. It's been true as well for our most profound concerns, like slavery or women's suffrage. Or guns. The public supports universal background checks and tighter restrictions on certain kinds of weapons. But American government simply isn't designed to directly convert public opinion into policy. Instead, it's a playing field where the greatest advantage goes to the most organized and aggressive interests. Do everything on the clean government agenda--take money out of politics, break up megabanks and monopolies--and that fact is still true. And what is one of the most organized and aggressive interests in American politics? The gun-rights movement. Not only does it have an institutional representative in the form of the National Rifle Association and the NRA's most dedicated members--who use every lever of influence, from grassroots action to lobbying, to sway lawmakers at each level of government--but it also occupies an important place in the conservative ideological coalition. This was a product of both direct action (activists within the NRA who worked to align the organization with the Republican Party) and natural affinity. (The kinds of people who backed the NRA were also the kinds of people who voted for conservative Republicans.) The entire landscape of modern gun politics--from the Republican Party's commitment to expansive gun rights to the real reticence with which Democrats have largely approached the issue--is a testament to the incredible success of the collective gun rights movement, from individual voters and activists to gun manufacturers and institutional forces like the NRA. President Obama could barnstorm the country and denounce every Republican who opposes background checks, and it wouldn't change the extent to which the organized gun-rights movement has its fingers on the vital pressure points of American politics. There is no countervailing equivalent, at least not at the moment. For as much as Americans support stricter gun laws, we lack the kind of dedicated, organized effort that could translate that mood into policy. Sure, there have been moves by Michael Bloomberg to push gun control into the political mainstream, the first real attempt to create a structural counterpart to the gun lobby. But even that is anemic compared with what the NRA and its allies have at their disposal. So if you support efforts at gun control, don't look to the president. The answer is to replicate the efforts of the gun-rights movement, from fully aligning the Democratic Party on the side of gun control, to leveraging grassroots action, to pressuring lawmakers, to punishing politicians--left and right--who don't show the same commitment to restricting gun access. The president plays a part here--particularly in making gun control a Democratic Party priority again--but it's ultimately a modest one, an advocate's role. Major change in the American system is difficult. It took 30 years for a fringe right-wing vision of the Second Amendment--an individual right to bear arms--to become the dominant one, adopted by all sides and ratified by the Supreme Court. It will likely take just as long to reverse that status quo. The past few years of shootings and massacres have galvanized more and more Americans to take action and try to out-organize the gun-rights movement. If those efforts succeed, then this period, which feels like a nadir, doesn't have to be one. The only way to make anything happen in American politics--even when the issues are life and death, even when inaction costs lives--is through dedicated, concerted action. The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire in 1911 was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in American history, and it helped produce a cascade of progressive labor law in New York state. But only after ordinary people--through unions and other groups--mobilized to make it happen, winning allies among bureaucrats and social workers and politicos to the cause of reform. Death alone won't budge American institutions. Death and the right kind of agitation can be a different story. Read more from Slate on the Orlando nightclub shooting."

In a tweet posted Sunday afternoon, Trump gloated that he had been proved ""right on radical Islamic terrorism."" A few hours later, he repeated his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In a statement Sunday evening, Trump argued that 99 percent of Afghans were radical Islamists, that Middle Eastern migrants should be kept out of the United States, and that anyone who refused to ""say the words 'Radical Islam' "" in the hours after the Orlando massacre should be disqualified from the presidency. Trump is a fool. Analysts who see this atrocity as an act of radical Islamic terrorism--and who understand radicalism, Islam, and terrorism far better than Trump does--suspect it was inspired by a message from ISIS, issued three weeks ago. This elaborate statement, delivered by ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, urged ISIS sympathizers to attack civilians in Europe and the United States during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. It also clarified the group's propaganda and recruitment strategy. Trump's platform of banning Muslims, blocking migrants, and ruthlessly bombing ISIS-held territory fits this strategy perfectly. He's an ISIS stooge. The statement from ISIS, released on May 21, exhorts Muslims to ""terrorize"" non-Muslims everywhere and to make Ramadan ""a month of suffering."" But this plea comes from a position of weakness. The statement says ""the whole world has allied and rushed against us,"" launching ""20,000 airstrikes"" and killing several top ISIS leaders. It pledges, defiantly and expectantly, that ISIS won't quit no matter how much territory it loses. The worst peril, according to the statement, is emerging from within Islam: ""Evil scholars"" are using ""every form of media"" to issue ""fatwas against the mujahidin."" These scholars, the statement explains, are promoting moderate interpretations of Islamic mercy. They're denouncing terrorism and condemning ISIS fighters as pseudo-Islamic ""renegades."" They're instructing Muslims to renounce jihad and expel ISIS from their lands. For pages and pages, the statement goes on, lambasting these scholars and the damage they're doing to public opinion. Clearly, ISIS sees this as a central threat. To quash the threat, ISIS reasserts that ""there are only two armies, two camps, two trenches"": Muslims and infidels. There can be no integration, the statement argues--no attempt to "" 'make peace and mix' with those who hate the faith."" Muslims must follow ISIS: ""We are the People of the Quran."" The statement claims that the armies arrayed against ISIS ""wage war against us ... because we command the worship of Allah. ... This is our religion. For this alone, we fight the world and they fight us."" To prove that the forces arrayed against ISIS are anti-Islamic, and to justify terrorism in Europe and the United States, the statement presents three arguments. First, it says the West doesn't care about the thousands of Syrian Muslims slaughtered by Bashar al-Assad's regime. Contrary to our rhetoric about human rights, we've ignored Assad's:"	Trump's Response to Orlando Is Exactly What ISIS Wants	['Trump']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/the_awkward_spectacle_of_donald_trump_at_the_road_to_majority_conference.html	"On Friday afternoon, Donald Trump headlined the Road to Majority conference, the first big Republican event since he locked up the party's nomination. Jointly organized by the Faith and Freedom Coalition (Ralph Reed's successor to the Christian Coalition) and Concerned Women for America, the Road to Majority was meant to excite social conservatives for the upcoming election. It featured a lineup of big Republican names--Sen. Mitch McConnell, Carly Fiorina--and Christian-right activists, several of whom had previously worked to thwart Trump and who now had to fire up an audience for their perpetually off-message orange sybarite of a candidate. It was a degrading spectacle; I almost felt bad for them. Reed made a theological case for low expectations. ""Unlike a lot of our friends on the other side, we're not looking for a political messiah, because we already have a messiah,"" he said. ""We understand that perfection is not the measure that should be applied. ... Because in all of recorded history there has only been one perfect person, and he wasn't a candidate, and he wasn't a political figure. His name was Jesus Christ."" Others avoided talking about Trump at all. Speaking before Trump, Fiorina denounced Hillary Clinton--""Mrs. Clinton, newsflash, I'm a feminist and I'm not voting for you""--but didn't once mention the Republican candidate. She even seemed to subtly attack Trump and the Republicans who'd endorsed him. ""How we win matters,"" she said. ""Our faith tells us that victory at all costs is no victory at all. Our faith tells us that the ends do not justify every means. It's important for us to remember, as we wage this battle for the future of our nation, who are we. What do we stand for."" She also cited George Washington's warnings about political parties engendering blind factionalism and referenced a friendly conversation she'd had with Rosie O'Donnell, one of Trump's many nemeses. It was a bravura display of political passive-aggression. Trump was supposed to speak right after, but he was late. To kill time, organizers repeated a trailer for Dinesh D'Souza's forthcoming apocalyptic fantasia, Hillary's America. They'd already shown it a few hours earlier; its farcical bombast, aimed at those who find Michael Bay films too restrained and artful, would have been a perfect introduction for the Republican nominee. But Trump still wasn't there when the trailer had ended so Reed returned to the podium and filibustered about trans people in bathrooms, the Declaration of Independence, and learning as a child about the bravery of Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's tyranny. Finally, he ran out of things to say and ducked offstage, saying, ""Let me find out where Mr. Trump is."" A few minutes later, Trump arrived. He took a sheaf of notes out of his jacket pocket and seemed to stick closely to them. His speech was a series of disconnected talking points; you could have cut up the sentences and rearranged them at random, and it wouldn't have been any more or less coherent. Much of it was a characteristic appeal to white Christian identity politics. ""We will restore respect for people of faith who dutifully raise their children, follow our laws and rules, and we have to really take care of them,"" he said. Then, a few minutes later, ""We will respect and defend Christian Americans. Christian Americans."" His speech was interrupted four times by women, including Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin, who stood up shouting, ""Stop Trump! Stop hate! Refugees are welcome here!"" before being dragged away by security. A few in the crowd tried to start a chant of ""Trump! Trump!"" but it soon petered out. Then someone started shouting ""USA! USA!"" and many more joined in. Which isn't to say the audience wasn't with Trump; there were plenty of applause lines. ""I'm challenging Hillary Clinton today to replace her support for increased refugee admissions, we have to do it, for a new jobs program for our inner cities,"" said Trump. ""We have to take care of the people that are here."" The attendees loved it. Leave aside, for a moment, the foolish idea that admitting refugees and investing in jobs is a binary choice. The spectacle of self-proclaimed Christian conservatives cheering a foul-mouthed ex-casino owner for his pledge to turn away refugees tells you pretty much everything you need to know about what the religious right has become--or maybe what it always was."

But instead of waxing lyrical about the genius of Ryan's plans to revolutionize America's social safety net, Trump has spent the past several days lashing out at Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over the Trump University case. According to Trump, his support for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border means any judge of Mexican descent who is ""proud of his heritage"" would be biased against him. In an interview with John Dickerson of Face the Nation, Trump suggested a Muslim judge might also be too biased to deal with Trump-related litigation as he has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration. One wonders who's next. Are Filipino judges out of the question because Trump once refused to finish a heaping portion of chicken adobo? To his credit, Ryan was forthright in describing Trump's attacks on Curiel as ""the textbook definition of a racist comment."" But in the same breath, Ryan defended his decision to back the reality TV star on the grounds that conservatives were more likely to achieve their policy goals with Trump rather than Hillary Clinton in the Oval Office. One gets the sense that Ryan would rather eat broken glass than spend another minute defending his decision to support the candidacy of a man he genuinely seems to despise. Broken glass, alas, is not on the menu. As Ryan searches his soul, his most steadfast allies in the conservative movement, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, find themselves in a nightmarishly difficult position. Ryan is a Journal-style conservative through and through, and he is reportedly close to the Journal's chief ideologist, Paul Gigot. Throughout his career, Ryan has fought for the causes dearest to the newspaper's heart--namely tax cuts for the rich, open borders, and a hawkish foreign policy. The fact that Trump has won the GOP nomination by bashing elites and immigrants and calling for an ""America First"" foreign policy is, for Ryan and the Journal alike, an unmitigated disaster. What exactly is the Journal doing to rescue its greatest champion? Are they urging him to get behind Hillary Clinton on the grounds that she's pro-immigration and more of an internationalist than Trump? Not quite. Sensing that a beleaguered Ryan was in need of bucking up, the WSJ editorial page defended the House speaker's endorsement of Trump. Without naming names, the Journal takes ""conservative journalists"" and ""Beltway grandees"" to task for arguing that Ryan has sullied his good name. Among other things, the editorial accuses these anti-Trump conservatives of aiding and abetting Democrats in their efforts to destroy the Republican Party: ""Do they really expect a House Speaker to deny support to the GOP nominee, making the Trump-Ryan division a running story through November? There's nothing like a bloody Republican civil war to dampen turnout and produce an election rout for the other side."" This is an argument one often hears from those who insist Republicans must unite behind Trump--that to do otherwise is politically imprudent. But the Journal's case for Ryan doesn't actually make much sense. The Journal blames the rise of Trump not on the fact that the conservative agenda championed by Ryan is not all that popular with rank-and-file conservatives. Rather, it claims that ""[m]any of the most devout Never-Trumpers"" are themselves to blame because they ""have spent years fanning grassroots hostility against immigration and Mexicans."" According to the Journal, Trump would never have darkened the GOP's door with his anti-immigration rhetoric had these dastardly right-wingers allowed Ryan to broker a deal with President Obama that would have increased immigration levels. The Journal deserves credit for offering such a daringly original take. Unfortunately, it does not bear even a passing resemblance to reality. First, it is worth noting that many of the most devout Never Trumpers are in fact open-borders Journal devotees, people who believe all conservatives who want to deport unauthorized immigrants are incorrigible racists. Second, it strains credulity to argue anti-immigration sentiment among Republicans was manufactured by the pundit class. Most Republicans are strongly opposed to the kind of immigration reform championed by the Journal. One survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in September, when Trump's victory was far from assured, found only 7 percent of Republicans said they'd favor an increase in immigration levels. A far larger share of the GOP electorate--67 percent--favored decreasing immigration levels. It should hardly come as a surprise that the battle for the GOP nomination came down to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the GOP candidates who were in line with the 67 percent of Republican voters who favored decreasing immigration levels, and not one of the many also-rans who came closer to the Journal's view. Despite these very clear numbers, the Journal maintains that conservative pundits are responsible for the fact that Ryan failed to cut a deal with President Obama that would have substantially increased immigration levels. I dare say this overestimates the influence of conservative pundits. Lest we forget, in 2014, Eric Cantor, the very bright, immigration-friendly House majority leader who was by all accounts well-liked by Beltway grandees, met with a shocking defeat at the hands of an obscure economist named Dave Brat, not least because Brat took a stridently restrictionist stance. Does the Journal believe congressional Republicans who backed an immigration deal--a deal opposed by large majorities of Republicans in their districts--could have somehow magically avoided anti-immigration primary challengers? One suspects that this threat did far more to discipline congressional Republicans than pundit bloviation on either side of the issue, the Journal's very much included. So no, there is very little reason to believe anti-immigration conservative pundits are smooth-talking svengalis who've somehow hypnotized Republicans into opposing big immigration increases. If anything, it would be closer to the mark to say many Never-Trump conservative pundits--people like David Frum of the Atlantic and Ross Douthat of the New York Times --have embraced more restrictionist views because their gut instincts are to sympathize with working-class conservatives. If the Journal really wants to understand the rise of Trump, they'd do well to look closer to home. For years, congressional Republicans, Ryan foremost among them, have championed a Wall Street Journal-approved policy agenda that grass-roots Republicans have found doesn't address their concerns. The RAND Presidential Election Panel Survey found that 51 percent of GOP primary voters favored increasing taxes on households earning over $200,000 a year. While this is hardly an overwhelming majority, it's striking that hardly any Republican candidates bothered trying to appeal to this rather large GOP constituency. The Wall Street Journal has long called on Republicans to oppose tax increases on affluent voters. Indeed, for decades, the Journal has insisted the GOP make tax cuts for high earners a centerpiece of its economic agenda, despite the fact that support for this position is neither broad nor deep. Leaving aside the merits of the case for tax cuts, the federal income tax is now far more progressive than it was when Ronald Reagan first came to office. Relatively few voters, including relatively few Republican voters, consider tax cuts a particularly high policy priority, as Megan McArdle of Bloomberg View observed back in January. ""There is simply no way to make federal tax cuts add up to a winning strategy in this day and age,"" she wrote. ""It's great for the donor base and the think tanks. But it's going to fall on deaf ears among the voters, who just don't care that much."" The political advice the Wall Street Journal is giving Paul Ryan and his Republican allies is transparently absurd. Nevertheless, one can't help but sympathize with the Journal. In the Journal's ideal world, the GOP would largely abandon social conservatism and instead offer tax cuts for the rich, open borders, and deep cuts in programs like Social Security and Medicare. There is no longer any doubt that this generation of Republican voters has thoroughly repudiated the newspaper's worldview. That's obviously pretty distressing. But the Journal doesn't support these policies because they are popular among Republicans or the public at large. Anyone with even a casual familiarity with American politics would know that simply isn't so. Rather, the Journal takes these positions because they believe them to be intellectually and morally compelling. That's fair enough. What the Journal should do, then, is give up on offering political advice and get on with making the intellectual and moral case for welcoming more poor immigrants to America while denying them food stamps and subsidized medical care.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/why_can_t_republicans_distance_themselves_from_donald_trump.html	"For the past week, Donald Trump has used his national platform as a presidential candidate to strafe the judge hearing a class-action lawsuit against his now-defunct Trump University, which critics have pilloried for manipulating and exploiting low-income and struggling workers. The centerpiece of Trump's attack--itself unprecedented, given our tradition of an independent judiciary--is the judge's background. The jurist, Gonzalo Curiel, is of Mexican descent. To Trump, this makes him a ""hater"" who is reacting to the ""the wall"" he intends to build. In truth, it's hard to be surprised by Trump's attack on Judge Curiel. His brand is racism, and anti-Hispanic racism in particular. Still, the unvarnished ugliness of this attack was enough to force a response from Republican leaders who, thus far, have excused their nominee's rhetoric about nonwhites, immigrants, and Muslim Americans. ""This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made, and I think it's inexcusable,"" said Newt Gingrich. ""Look, I don't condone the comments. And we can press on to another topic,"" said Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""I think it's wrong. He needs to stop saying it,"" said Marco Rubio. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had words for Trump. ""I couldn't disagree more with a statement like that,"" he said on Meet the Press this past Sunday. Judging from this rhetoric, you might think that Republicans were ready to abandon Trump full stop as a dangerous liability. But you would be wrong. McConnell, for example, pushed back against the idea that there's something untoward about the ""party of Lincoln circling wagons around a racist,"" as put by conservative blogger Erick Erickson. ""I think the party of Lincoln wants to win the White House. And the right-of-center world needs to respect the fact that the primary voters have spoken,"" said McConnell. House Speaker Paul Ryan condemned Trump and all but endorsed him in the same statement. ""I disavow these comments--I regret those comments that he made,"" Ryan said, calling them ""the textbook definition of a racist comment."" But, he said, that doesn't mean he believes that ""Hillary Clinton is the answer."" ""I believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than with her,"" Ryan explained. There are countless examples of this behavior, of Republican leaders slamming Trump one moment and embracing him the next. What is going on? Why is it so difficult for Republicans to condemn Trump without also qualifying and essentially negating their condemnation? My colleague Will Saletan blames it on a crude will to power. ""In the end, it's about power and priorities. In today's GOP, it's more important to keep Merrick Garland off the Supreme Court than it is to protect the country from a president who would ban Muslims,"" he writes. There's definitely the drive to win, but I think there's something else. Something more primal than even power. They're afraid. On Monday, the Clinton campaign released an ad that was made up entirely of statements from other Republicans on Trump. It was brutal, illustrating the extent to which Trump alienates his own allies and supporters. And with this week's statements about Trump's bigotry, you should expect more of the same, with another Clinton ad showcasing another set of Republicans condemning Trump for another set of racist, sexist, and otherwise contemptible statements. Each time a Republican disavows his endorsement of Trump or urges other Republicans to take the off-ramp from the Trump effort, a Democratic super PAC gets another few seconds to use in another ad against the GOP nominee. On the other end, Democrats are simply using Trump against vulnerable Republicans regardless of what they say or do. In Ohio, for instance, Democrat Ted Strickland is doing everything he can to tie incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman to Trump and his statements. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is pulling the same trick, in an effort to shrink any distance between Republican incumbents and the nominee. Embattled Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, facing a tough challenge this November from Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, is so shook that he abruptly changed course on his endorsement. ""Given my military experience, Donald Trump does not have the temperament to command our military or our nuclear arsenal,"" he tweeted. Republicans, from the top of the ticket to the bottom of the ballot, are caught in a bind. If they don't say anything to counter or condemn Trump's rhetoric, they are complicit in the Trump candidacy. If they say anything, they become fodder for Democratic efforts against their party. The only alternative is to try to walk the line of criticism without disavowal. But as we see with Paul Ryan--who was savaged by both mainstream and conservative press for looking past Trump's racism even as he bemoans it--that's almost impossible. In the same way that fear of a third-party candidacy drove Republicans to craft and embrace a ""pledge"" that did nothing but tie their fortunes to Trump, fear--of backlash from pro-Trump Republican voters, of attacks from Democrats, of opprobrium and contempt from everyone else--is driving them to hedge and hesitate in the most craven way possible. Fear is the mind-killer, and Trump has scrambled their ability to think clearly about their dilemma. Not that there's any way out, short of leaving the GOP. Deep problems with the process aside, the Republican Party has elected to nominate Trump for president. He is the standard-bearer, and there's no escaping him. Not now, at least. Republicans' fortunes are tied to his, and if (or when) he collapses in the fall, they will, too. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/the_democratic_nomination_process_is_fine.html	"On Monday night, the Associated Press broke news. Tallying its survey of Democratic superdelegates--the cadre of party members and elected officials who help select the nominee--the AP found that Hillary Clinton had met the threshold needed for nomination. Regardless of Tuesday's outcomes in California, New Jersey, and elsewhere, Clinton will be the Democratic Party's nominee for president and the first woman to win a major party nomination. Team Clinton was restrained at the announcement, telling an audience in California that ""we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment, but we still have work to do. ... We have six elections tomorrow, and we're going to fight hard for every single vote, especially right here in California."" Team Sanders, understandably, was defiant. ""It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgement, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee's clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of super delegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,"" said campaign spokesman Michael Briggs in a statement. The reactions fit the campaigns' respective attitudes toward the primary. Team Clinton wants to avoid any sense that her win was unfair or illegitimate, while Team Sanders has criticized the process as suspect and, at worst, deeply unfair to his candidacy. ""What is really dumb is that you have closed primaries, like in New York state, where 3 million people who were not Democrats or Republicans could not participate,"" said Sanders in a recent interview with CBS News' John Dickerson. ""You have a situation where over 400 superdelegates came on board Clinton's campaign before anybody else was in the race, eight months before the first vote was cast."" To this point, Sanders has offered a few reforms for the Democratic primary process, aimed at smoothing the path for future ideological candidates like himself. ""In those states where it's applicable,"" he said, ""we need same-day registration, we need open primaries."" This is echoed elsewhere, from supporters who see closed primaries and superdelegates as obstacles to a candidacy like Sanders', to surrogates who slam the Democratic National Committee as an unfair lever for the Democratic ""establishment."" And in general, this primary season has convinced a number of observers that the Democratic Party's process for selecting a presidential nominee is broken and ripe for reform. I'm skeptical. To say that the process is ""broken"" presupposes both an idea of what it's supposed to do in the first place and a general consensus that it didn't accomplish the goal. We have the former: The aim of the Democratic primary process is for the party to choose a nominee who is acceptable to all of its parts, from dedicated supporters and casual voters to elites and activists, and who could plausibly lead the party to victory in the general election. But a close look at the conversation over the nomination process shows that we don't have much of the latter--there's no consensus over the efficacy of the process. Instead, we have an argument from the losing candidate and his backers that borders on special pleading. To wit, Sanders' supporters say the process is flawed because it harmed their candidate in critical ways: Closed primaries kept out pro-Sanders independents; superdelegates gave his opponent an appearance of inevitability; and the order of the calendar gave her an early advantage. The problem is that these aren't flaws in the process so much as they are contingent disadvantages. Yes, Bernie Sanders flailed with stalwart Democratic voters, lacked elite party support, and couldn't win in the South. But it's a trivial task to imagine a candidate who could have done some combination of three, or pulled a hat trick, full stop. (In fact, we have one: Barack Obama.) That Sanders was a poor fit for some aspects of the Democratic primary doesn't mean those parts were bad. To make that call, we have to see if these parts are out of alignment with our stated goal. They aren't. Well before Clinton announced her bid for the White House, she held broad support across the Democratic Party. And going into the general election, she's the clear favorite, with a modest but growing lead over her likely opponent, Donald Trump. It's possible that--per his recent argument--Sanders is the better choice for the fall, but that doesn't make Clinton a bad or unacceptable one. If there's a stronger case for reform beyond ""my preferred candidate lost,"" it's that the processes of the Democratic Party aren't especially democratic, that, together, caucuses, closed primaries, and superdelegates either preclude participation or actively subvert the ""will of the people."" This isn't wrong. Caucuses, which require long hours from participants, are notoriously inhospitable to voters with tough schedules or attachments. Closed primaries and strict registration deadlines are designed to remove independent voters from consideration. And in theory, superdelegates could overturn the decision of voters. (For weeks, in fact, Sanders was asking them to do just that.) These are real problems and dangers in the primary process as it stands. But there are virtues, too. Closed primaries force candidates to appeal directly to loyal Democratic voters in the same way that open ones force them to win over moderates and independents. Given the degree to which this is a party selection process, that's not only fair--it's desirable. Likewise, caucuses are a proving ground for the organizational capabilities of the candidates, as well as an opportunity both for smaller constituencies to make their mark on the process and for underdog candidates to pick up momentum. Barack Obama couldn't have made ground without winning the Iowa caucus, and this year's Sanders insurgency was fueled by grass-roots activity as channeled through caucuses. They aren't the most democratic method for selecting delegates, but they serve a vital purpose nonetheless. The same goes for superdelegates, who represent important party stakeholders and elected officials. They force candidates--who are vying to lead the party--to take another constituency into account. Yes, the fact that they always back the pledged delegate winner undermines the extent to which they're ""unbound"" (as we saw in 2008, when Clinton superdelegates switched sides to bring Obama to the threshold after he finished the contest with a lead). But this year's Republican presidential contest is a testament to the value of an anchor in the case of a candidate who violates core party principles; an emergency brake, to use in potentially catastrophic situations like the rise of a Trump-style figure. That the process may benefit from ""undemocratic"" elements gets to a larger point. Majoritarian procedures are a necessary part of democracy, but they're not synonymous with it. And most democratic systems--including our own--are a blend of majoritarian, nonmajoritarian, and even countermajoritarian elements that translate, temper, or otherwise channel the behavior and choices of majorities. What determines if the entire system is democratic is whether it's rule-bound, transparent, and ultimately accountable to the public. That description fits the Democratic nomination process, and insofar as it doesn't, only minor tweaks are needed. State parties--which control most on-the-ground election procedures--need to devise and follow common standards for registration, party-switching, and caucus participation (in states that use caucuses). If you need to register with the party to participate, it should be easy and straightforward (what happened ahead of the New York primary, for example, is unacceptable). Actual delegate selection--as opposed to allocation--should be as public as possible. And it might be time to restrict superdelegate status to elected officials, so that they can be held directly accountable by their voters. Again, these are just small changes. Taken as a whole--and with its goals in mind--the Democratic primary process is fine. It could be better, but there's no question it gets the job done. And Hillary Clinton, regardless of how you feel about her and her candidacy, is a case in point. To the large majority of the Democratic Party--stalwart voters, elected officials, liberals and moderates--she is acceptable, even preferable. Bernie Sanders' problem wasn't the process. It was that, among Democrats, he just wasn't as popular as his rival. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."	Quit Complaining. The Democratic Nomination Process Worked Fine.

Duke--who beat a field of Republicans, and all but one Democrat, in the 1991 race for governor of Louisiana--praised Trump for saying ""what I said almost 25 years ago."" When CNN's Jake Tapper invited Trump to repudiate Duke and the KKK, Trump begged off, saying he needed more information. That prompted a rebuke from House Speaker Paul Ryan. ""If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games,"" Ryan demanded. ""They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on people's prejudices."" Three months later, Trump has done what Duke did, and more. By tapping popular anger and exploiting fear of Cuban Americans, Mexican Americans, blacks, and Seventh-day Adventists, Trump has beaten a field of Republicans. If he can overcome one last Democratic candidate, he'll be president of the United States. Rather than turn away from Duke's politics, Trump has moved closer to them. He has repeatedly accused Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge who is hearing a fraud case against Trump University, of bias and unfitness because Curiel--who was born in Indiana--is ""Mexican."" This weekend, Trump added that a Muslim judge might be similarly incapable of treating him fairly. Meanwhile, Trump repeated his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In short, Trump is preying on prejudice and building a movement on bigotry. By the standard Ryan laid down in March, Republican leaders should reject Trump. Instead, they're coming up with evasions and games. Here's a list of their excuses for supporting the nominee. 1. It's not racism. This week, as Trump escalated his rhetoric against Curiel, many Republicans were asked whether the attacks were racist. Some refused to answer. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah insisted Trump ""doesn't have a prejudiced bone in his body."" Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee stiff-armed the question: ""Look, I don't condone the comments. And we can press on to another topic."" Gov. Rick Scott of Florida retreated to generalities: ""I can't say that I would say the same thing any other candidate says.""

But under the radar in North Carolina, a very different politician than Hillary Clinton is fighting her own battle against an ideological challenger in a race that almost acts as a microcosm for all the problems and dysfunctions of the Republican Party--the same ones that propelled Donald Trump to its presidential nomination. When Renee Ellmers entered Congress in 2011, she was the hero. One of dozens of conservative Republicans elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, she made national news as a vocal opponent of the proposed mosque at Ground Zero and won support from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as one of her ""Mama Grizzlies."" Ellmers campaigned as a hard-right conservative and for the most part, she's acted as one, building a solid conservative voting record in her three terms as representative for North Carolina's second congressional district. Unlike many of her Tea Party peers, however, Ellmers seems to think government should function on the day-to-day. A close ally to former House Speaker John Boehner, she backed both debt ceiling increases (in 2011 and 2013) and was a skeptic of the 2013 shutdown, eventually supporting the deal that reopened the government, preserving the Affordable Care Act against right-wing demands. Aligning herself with constituents and Republican leadership, she backed a limited immigration proposal that gave ""earned legal work status"" to some number of unauthorized immigrants. She voted to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which supports thousands of jobs in her district (and is opposed by conservative libertarians), and removed a provision from an anti-abortion bill that would have required rape survivors to report a rape to police in order to get an abortion after 20 weeks. None of this is liberal--it's the record of a typical conservative Republican. But it's enough to make her a target for conservative activists. Now, Ellmers is the villain, a stand-in for the ""corrupt"" Republican establishment. And thanks to an unusual mid-decade redistricting, she has to vie for her seat against Republican Rep. George Holding, who now sits in the same district. Also running is Greg Bannon, a physician and twice-unsuccessful candidate for the GOP Senate nomination. Holding is the new conservative favorite with an endorsement from the Susan B. Anthony List--an anti-abortion group that typically backs Republican women--and tacit support from the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, which is running ads against Ellmers. Those aren't the only conservative groups that have jumped into the fray against Ellmers. For funding the government, lifting the debt ceiling, and working with Republican leaders in Congress, the Conservative Review--founded by radio host and author Mark Levin--gave her a ""liberty score"" of F, for failing. The anti-tax Club for Growth says it will ""actively oppose"" Ellmers in the primary for ""clearly betraying the conservative values of her constituents."" ""Since so many of the voters in NC-02 are new to the district, CFG Action wants to be sure they know that Renee Ellmers is a big-government liberal,"" said president David McIntosh in a May statement. None of this--conservative voters and conservative groups turning against a conservative Republican for insufficient hostility to government--is new, but it takes on new resonance in the Age of Trump. This relentless drive for ideological purity, itself tied to a broad prohibition against compromise with anyone outside a narrowly defined tribe of fellow travelers, has done nothing but paralyze the Republican Party's ability to accomplish anything from the routine maintenance of government to larger policy goals. And it's produced figures like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who treat functional government as a bona fide betrayal of conservative values. It has also produced deep frustration among GOP voters, who in six years have elected successive waves of conservative lawmakers to little avail. Promises of grand changes--We'll repeal Obamacare, defend the border, and defund Planned Parenthood!--crash on the rocks of constitutional reality as the Republican Congress runs headfirst into the president's veto pen. Conservatives like Cruz explain this away through attacks on Republicans like Ellmers, blasting them for betraying GOP voters. And then in walks Trump: The GOP nominee appeals because he offers something different than the usual solution of electing more Republicans. He vows to steamroll over (presumably illegitimate) opposition. His promise to make ""deals"" is as much a rejection of Republican leaders as it is Obama. Trump voters want someone ""strong"" to break through Washington gridlock and deliver on past promises. And that's what he says he'll do. Trump, it's worth saying, is Ellmers' prime ally in her re-election bid: He endorsed her over the weekend, calling her a ""fighter."" ""I need her help in Washington so we can work together to defeat ISIS, secure our border, and bring back jobs and frankly, so many other things,"" said Trump. ""And Renee knows how to do it. She gets it. And together, we will make America great again."" It's not so much that Ellmers is close to Trump, who has no ideology or any particular system of belief outside of the will for power. But there's an irony in the fact that the product of the GOP's drive for purity is endorsing a candidate set to be a victim of that same drive. Unfortunately for Ellmers, her right flank is fully mobilized against her--in a Republican primary, that's enough to lose. And if she does, it will reverberate throughout the GOP landscape, a warning to any conservative lawmaker who decides they were elected to accomplish something and serve their constituents, not act as a mindless vote for ideology.  Which makes this relatively low-key primary in North Carolina extremely relevant to national politics. More than most, Ellmers' fight for re-election is illustrative of major trends in the Republican Party; trends that led to a succession of needless standoffs over routine government funding; trends that sacrificed conservative policy victories for affective rage against Obama; and trends that have culminated in the most dysfunctional and ill-prepared nominee to ever grace the presidential stage. If the stakes weren't so high, it would be a little funny. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/how_should_america_resist_a_fascist.html	"After Donald Trump claimed the Republican presidential nomination, neoconservative scholar Robert Kagan wrote an essay for the Washington Post that made a simple but provocative claim: Trump, now a stone's throw from the White House, was a vector for fascism. That, in running a campaign of threat and intimidation--against political adversaries, against foreign countries, against nonwhites and religious minorities--Trump had opened the door to the worst passions and darkest urges of American society. ""This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes,"" wrote Kagan, ""but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac 'tapping into' popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party--out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear--falling into line behind him."" Kagan didn't address it but his piece raised an important question, perhaps the important question of this election: If Trump is a vector for fascism--if he is a fascist, full stop--then what do we do about it? The history of the 20th century is, among many other things, a testament to the danger of popular authoritarianism and how it can overwhelm the better angels of a nation's character to pursue its resentments with murderous efficiency. That history is why, in the face of Trump, the targets of his rage have organized against him. So far, this movement against Trump is a democratic one that utilizes U.S. laws and institutions to mount a defense against a man who threatens them, from his attacks on the idea of an impartial judiciary to his tolerance for violence and support for a herrenvolk vision of American life. On the grass-roots level, Muslim and Latino activists are working to naturalize immigrants and register them for the ballot, while civil rights groups are fighting voter restrictions that may keep them from the polls. Students and other young people are protesting Trump events to demonstrate their stance against his rhetoric and aims. On an institutional level, the Democratic Party is planning a massive campaign against his candidacy, and the press is beginning to scrutinize his life and beliefs in serious ways. Trump may have overcome the Republican Party (or at least successfully exploited its core weakness) but the rest of America's democratic system--our institutions of self-governance, from politics to civil society--has mobilized in response to Trump's illiberalism. But is it enough? Trump doesn't just promise conservative policy--he isn't a typical Republican presidential nominee whose views may offend liberals but don't pose a threat to basic American institutions. His contempt for political norms, his attraction to violence, his bid to be Strongman of the United States of America all constitute a deadly threat to American democracy and an existential threat to Americans in Trump's crosshairs. If we are living in an extraordinary moment, is it time for extraordinary action? Which brings us to Thursday's events in San Jose, California, where a group of anti-Trump protesters turned to violence against Trump supporters. Most of the anti-Trump action was peaceful, if aggressive. But some members crossed over into attacking attendees at the Trump rally. One supporter was pelted with eggs and water bottles, while others were punched and assaulted. Eventually, police moved in and stopped the scuffle, which left several people injured. On Twitter, vocal members of the online left pushed against people (like myself) who criticized the violence. ""Let's be clear: It's never a shame to storm the barricades set up around a fascist,"" wrote Emmett Rensin, an editor at Vox. He continued: ""If Trump comes to your town, start a riot."" (Vox later suspended him.) ""Journalists with big platforms called Trump a literal fascist on the rise for months. How did you expect people to react to that?"" wrote Freddie DeBoer, a left-wing writer with a wide following on Twitter. He continued, ""It's very simple. If this is the beginning of American fascism, real organized political violence is called for. If it's not, it's not."" There is a flash of truth in this response. However wrongheaded their methods, the protesters are correct in their estimation of the election's stakes. And this kind of extra-democratic political violence (as opposed to wars and revolutions) has been used in service of basic rights and liberties, as we've seen in the movements for abolition, workers' rights, and civil rights. But there's a vital difference between the disorganized street fighting in San Jose and confrontations like the Battle of Blair Mountain in the West Virginia of the early 20th century. The latter was defensive action against armed anti-union opponents as much as it was a proactive use of force. The same is true for anti-slavery violence, which--as Abraham Lincoln starkly noted in his Second Inaugural--was defensive violence against the blood of the lash and the bondsman. Compare that with the fighting on Thursday. Those Trump supporters weren't members of an armed Trump militia, or shock troops of a reactionary force, or a band of vigilantes. They weren't an armed or active threat to anyone. And even if they hold odious political beliefs, it's their right as Americans to assemble peacefully in support of them. It may be the duty of the public at large to beat Trump supporters at the ballot box, but backing the real estate mogul doesn't mean they've forfeited their status as citizens. It doesn't mean they've opened themselves up to physical attack. But there's a deeper problem. To attack someone because of their political beliefs is to embrace the logic of authoritarianism. To cite intentions and not actions as justification for violence is to embrace the logic of even worse beliefs and actors. We have to get them before we get us isn't ""direct action""; it's mobocracy. And it runs counter to the liberal democratic ideal--the thing we're defending in the first place. Again, this isn't a question of protest. Protest is a vital part of democratic life. It isn't a question of resistance; everyone is entitled to stand against attack. This is a question of aggression. Donald Trump is an authoritarian, but the United States in 2016 isn't Weimar Germany. Our democracy has deep roots and our institutions are sturdy, if aging. We don't have private paramilitaries in the streets or an established order with a blind eye to reactionary violence. There are times when political violence is effective, even permissible. Now is not one of those times. Americans--and those on the left, in particular--have every tool needed to stop Trump. We can use those tools, which show every sign of working. Or we can choose the other option, the one that clears the path to genuine bloodshed. But here's why we shouldn't: The simple truth is that reaction feeds on disorder. And when there are legitimate means to stop Trump, you're just as likely to cause a backlash in favor of his effort by forsaking them to attack his supporters. (At the risk of tripping Godwin's law, German Communist violence against ultra-right targets in the 1932 elections didn't stop Hitler and his enablers as much as it emboldened and enabled them.) If anything, Trump wants violent attacks on his supporters. Don't give them to him. Which is to say that, yes, we can open the box labeled violence, but consider this: There's little guarantee we'll be able to close it and almost none that we'll prevail in the end.

It read ""Hillary for Prison 2016."" A line looped around vast portions of the sprawling casino--thousands of people, in all, hoping to see Donald Trump speak. ""I got this on Infowars.com. I love this shirt,"" Khait said. ""There's so many people walking by saying, 'I love this shirt, I love this shirt, give me a high five.' "" At this moment a middle-aged black woman stopped to compliment Khait on her shirt. ""Yay, Hillary!"" ""For prison,"" Khait explained gently. ""Oh, you want her in prison?"" the woman asked. ""She's a criminal,"" Khait said. This proved to be something of a motif at Trump's event in Vegas on Saturday. The idea that the woman favored to take the White House in November belongs in prison was endorsed heartily by supporters and introductory speakers alike and was hinted at by the candidate himself. It wasn't an argument so much as a mood, and it was general across the room. Our colloquy continued. ""He's an idiot,"" the woman was saying of Trump. ""He's crazy."" Khait: ""Google 'Clinton Foundation.' No, no, just Google 'Clinton Foundation.' They take like $25 million from Saudi Arabia and places that kill ... "" Woman: ""Why would you want a president that talks the way he talks? Why?"" Khait: ""He says it like it is, though."" Woman: ""No, he doesn't say it like it is. He says it like an idiot."" Khait was unmoved. She described again what she wanted the woman to search for on Google. ""She's such an advocate for women's rights and gay rights and all that stuff? She just took $25 million from Saudi Arabia. She takes so much outside foreign money to the Clinton Foundation,"" Khait said. ""She doesn't have American people's mentality in mind. She has foreign country's mentality because she got paid so much money."" America, this is our discourse. Our discourse is a half-celebrity in an Infowars T-shirt, making an argumentum ad search engine about Clinton's treason. We can call this a symptom of the Trump candidacy, this habit of criminalizing the GOP's main political adversaries, but all Trump did was take the animal impulses of his party and put them in the shop window. It's not so hard to imagine a world in which the ""Hillary for Prison"" memes were a major theme of a different nominee's candidacy--Ted Cruz's, say, or Marco Rubio's. It's true that, as Khait notes, Bill and Hillary's Clinton Foundation did take between $10 million and $25 million from Saudi Arabia and millions more from other regimes and political actors that oppress the rights of women, gays, and religious minorities. Trump has demanded that the foundation return the money. Whether or not this was an actual conflict of interest when Clinton served as secretary of state, it certainly contributes to a general sense that the Clintons are too enmeshed with too many wicked people to be clean themselves. Here at the Trump rally it means more than that: It is reason to throw Clinton behind bars. To be a Trump supporter is to enter an unending psychodrama in which the country is alive with sedition. Khait grew up liberal and voted for Obama in 2008, but now she agrees when she hears Trump say that Obama might have ""something else in mind"" when it comes to his purported failure to prevent terrorism. ""This is going to sound extreme: Either he's blackmailed with something or he has an ulterior motive,"" she said. ""I don't know what [the ulterior motives] are, but to be honest with you I happen to agree with Trump on this that he's a terrible leader and he's not keeping our country safe and there's something else there. I have a strong feeling that this guy is not a friend of America."" She also said that Clinton and Obama had ""a lot to gain by having these attacks happen"" and cited their pro-gun control stances. Khait, who was born in Russia and immigrated with her parents 23 years ago, also adamantly supports Trump's immigration policies, including his Muslim ban, even though she said she favors certain legal immigration. ""There's a lot of safe and peaceful immigrants,"" she said. ""For example Russia. Peaceful. ... Italians. Germans."" (Khait's official Survivor profile lists her pet peeves as ""[a]rrogance, ignorance and when someone picks on someone less fortunate."") It was Mitt Romney, now one of Trump's leading opponents in the GOP, who actively sought Trump's endorsement in 2012 despite his vocal views that Obama was a foreign-born usurper of the White House. The 2012 Republican nominee even hosted a Vegas fundraiser with Trump on the same day Trump doubled down on the birtherism. And the talking point that helped torpedo Rubio's 2016 presidential bid--""He knows exactly what he's doing""--is just a gentler variation on Khait's idea that Obama is intentionally trying to destroy America from within. The Republicans' 2008 nominee, Sen. John McCain, recently said that Obama was ""directly responsible"" for the Orlando killings, another light spin on the theme that he is expressly allowing Americans to be killed. And you can look no further than the hyperpartisan folderol that was the House Select Committee on Benghazi's humiliating 11-hour grilling of Clinton, the intent of which was to depict her as a negligent criminal who has undermined the security of America. Republicans have been working from this hymn book since at least the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Wayne Allyn Root, one of Trump's introductory speakers in Vegas, was a huge hit with the crowd when he said that Obama was bringing in immigrants who wanted to hurt America and promised that Trump would prosecute both him and Clinton. Trump will ""stop the madness of purposefully importing Syrian migrants and Muslim refugees into our country,"" Root said to massive applause. He cited a notoriously shaky survey that said that 51 percent of Muslims in the U.S. support Sharia and argued that ""liberal lawyers and Muslim sympathizers"" were setting current U.S. anti-terrorism policy. Continuing to list the things he said Trump would do as president, Root arrived at ""the big one""--prosecutions of Clinton and Obama:"	Donald Trump Has Taken a Longtime Psychosis of the GOP Base and Amplified It	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	['gay']

He is the most unpopular candidate in the race, and is among the most unpopular people in American politics, period. This was predictable. The same outrageousness and prejudice that won him crowds and votes in a crowded Republican presidential primary are poison to most Americans. Trump hasn't changed, but his environment has. What makes this worse for the Republican Party is the real estate mogul's disdain for traditional campaigning and disinterest in any of the things it takes to win an election, or even to stay competitive. He doesn't want to contact donors, or hire a field staff, or run advertisements, or collect data, or even campaign in swing states. Trump's main concern is doing television and holding rallies, a bizarre fixation if his goal is the White House. But that assumes he wants to sit in the Oval Office. Some have begun to wonder if Trump even wants the presidency. What if the Republican Party's nominee has some other goal in mind? ""Trump is indeed considering creating his own media business, built on the audience that has supported him thus far in his bid to become the next president of the United States,"" reports Sarah Ellison for Vanity Fair, drawing from an unnamed source who says that Trump wants to ""figure out if he can monetize"" his newfound stature. It makes sense. Trump is a master of self-aggrandizement. He rode it to the GOP's presidential nomination, and now he intends to ride it to something more immediately lucrative than leading the country--a cable news network, centered on his image and his message. Or at least that's the theory. I have no doubt that this has been discussed, but there's not enough evidence to say that a cable network was the plan or the endgame all along for Trump 2016. Trump has flirted with running for president enough over the past 20 years to suggest that he's serious--that he believes he could be president of the United States. His refusal to do what it takes to win an election has less to do with some ulterior motive and more to do with his arrogance and narcissism. Whatever the case, whatever happens in November, the bracing thought arrived with the Vanity Fair story that Trump is here to stay. It is no small thing to win a major party nomination. Since the GOP's founding in 1854, just 26 men have held the title of Republican Party presidential nominee. Seventeen of them became president. Assuming he leaves the Cleveland convention with the nomination intact, Trump will enter an exclusive club of Americans regardless of what happens in November. If he wins, he'll be president-elect of the United States. And if he loses, he'll be a bona fide leader of the GOP, a man who represents a sizable chunk of the party's base--the revanchist minority demanding a return to the old order, where a certain kind of American (white and male) was the presumptive, predominant voice in national life. Think about what that means in practice. To win a nomination is to win a certain amount of deference and public influence, even after the election. As the GOP's choice in 2012, Mitt Romney can still command cameras and attention. He gives endorsements, provides counsel, and has a network of relationships that shape and influence the party. In every way that matters, Mitt Romney is a national leader. Trump isn't Romney and he isn't running Romney's campaign. If he loses, there's a decent chance he'll lose big, in a way that jeopardizes the GOP's congressional majority. He'll walk away from November a pariah, disdained by professional Republicans and hated by lawmakers, activists, and others invested in maintaining a strong and durable party. But that doesn't mean he won't have a voice in the larger conversation. He'll still speak for millions of alienated, disaffected Americans. He'll still channel their anger at the nation's rapid cultural and political changes. He'll still have the star power and resources to carve out a spot in the public eye, with willing allies and accomplices. He'll still matter as a symbol for the ugliest, most destructive impulses in American life. If in 2017, Americans are met with another Orlando or another San Bernardino, Trump will likely be there, ready to criticize, condemn, and tout his ""solutions"" to the difficult problem of lone-wolf terrorism. The terrible truth is that this is not the end of Trump's influence. At minimum, he has reopened the space for overt prejudice in national life, giving license to white nationalists, anti-Semites, and other noxious elements in American politics. And worse, he's given them a template for success, of a kind. It's too much to say that Trump, should he lose in November, will emerge from 2016 a kingmaker. There is every reason to belief he will linger as an inspiration to others who can polish his message of white reaction into something a little less abrasive, a little more respectable.

But what was Trump like between takes, when the cameras were off but the crew was watching? Slate reached out to find people who'd worked on The Apprentice during Trump's tenure. Most people we contacted declined to talk, citing nondisclosure agreements they'd signed as a condition of their employment on the show. But three were willing to speak--as long as we didn't use their names. And one spoke to us on the record. What do they recall about Trump's on-set behavior? It's a lot like his campaign behavior.

Ted Cruz had left the race for president and Republican leaders were coming around to Trump's candidacy, dutifully endorsing the party's presumptive nominee. Prominent Trump skeptics were holding their tongues, and the most visible Republican lawmaker in the country--House Speaker Paul Ryan--was in talks with Trump about the party's agenda for the fall. The real estate mogul still had ground to cover in the polls, but in that moment, if you squinted, he looked like a candidate who could win. Then came Gonzalo Curiel. A federal judge, Curiel had certified a class-action lawsuit against Trump's now-defunct for-profit school, Trump University. In May, he granted a request--from the Washington Post--to release Trump University documents to the public. The subsequent coverage was deadly. In response, Trump went on the offense, with a racist attack on Curiel's impartiality. The same Republican leaders who endorsed him weeks earlier now balked at his rhetoric. Some withdrew their endorsements. Any momentum Trump had was gone, wasted in a matter of days. Earlier today, the Washington Post and ABC News released their latest national poll of the presidential race, conducted last week, from the peak of the Curiel affair to the immediate aftermath of the massacre in Orlando. The numbers for Hillary Clinton aren't great. The numbers for Donald Trump are unprecedented and catastrophic. Seventy percent of registered voters have an unfavorable view of Trump (including 88 percent of nonwhites), divided between 14 percent who are ""somewhat unfavorable"" and a whopping 56 percent who are ""strongly unfavorable."" For comparison's sake, Clinton's total unfavorable rating is 55 percent. New polls from Bloomberg and NBC News show Clinton with a 12-point and a 7-point lead, respectively. A presidential nominee with this standing doesn't just lose in the general election; he brings his party down with him, wiping out an entire generation of leaders in one fell swoop. If Trump remains this unpopular through the fall--and if third-party candidates like Gary Johnson and Jill Stein don't make substantial traction--he could cost Republicans control of the Senate and perhaps even the House. Politicians, and the parties they build, want to win. And they'll do anything it takes to reach that goal. But there are limits to this, imposed by interest groups, activists, intellectual leaders, and voters. Trump is a direct threat to the GOP's ability to hold onto national power. Worse, there's no indication he has the capacity to change. If there's anything consistent in Trump's politics, it's nativism and racial prejudice, from his tirades against Japan in the 1980s and public attacks on the ""Central Park Five,"" to his ""birtherism"" during President Obama's first term and his present-day condemnation of immigrants, Muslims, and Hispanics. Judging from his past behavior, Trump will only get worse. Already, he's running with the conspiracy theory that President Obama is in league with ISIS and other terrorist groups. Trump's popularity is low. It can get lower. By the time we reach the Republican National Convention, Trump might be a zombie candidate: lifeless but still shambling forward, consumed by his most animal impulses. So what do Republicans do? What could they do? At this late stage, the only alternative left is the party's nuclear option--ignoring its primary voters and dumping Trump from the ticket in a hail-Mary attempt to save its congressional majority. For some conservatives, this is the obvious choice. ""[T]here is not a single 'bound' delegate to the Republican National Convention,"" notes David French, a staff writer for the National Review who briefly flirted with a third-party candidacy against Trump. ""Not one delegate is required to vote for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, or any other individual who 'won' votes in the primary process. Each delegate will have to make his or her own choice."" There's a reason we say ""presumptive nominee"" in reference to the winner in a presidential nomination fight: The status isn't official until delegates ratify it at the convention. Our political norms and intuitions (the person with the most votes wins) are such that in the era of modern presidential elections, the presumptive nominee has always been the official one, but that doesn't have to be the case. The rules of the Republican convention don't exist in advance. They are crafted by the rules committee before the convention meets. If it wanted to, a majority of that committee could change the rules of the nomination process, unbinding delegates from their respective candidates and allowing the party to choose a different nominee. As procedure, it's straightforward. As politics, it's dangerous. The only way this happens is if Republican leaders sign onto the effort. And if they do, they will have voted to throw the convention--and the GOP itself--into complete chaos, opening the door to a massive backlash from Republican primary voters, who cast ballots with the expectation that the party would respect their choice. It's a huge gamble that could (and likely would) destroy the career of anyone who touched it. Which means it probably won't happen. If it's not going to dump Trump, then the most the party can do is distance itself as much as possible. And it's already happening. On Tuesday, top Republicans like Paul Ryan and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker condemned Trump for his response to the Orlando shooting. ""I do not think a Muslim ban is in our country's interest,"" said Ryan, who a week ago was lamenting the ""textbook"" racism of Trump's comments about Curiel. ""I do not think it is reflective of our principles, not just as a party but as a country."" Between now and November, there's a good chance we'll see something almost unprecedented in modern American politics: a world where the elected officials and elites of a political party are either indifferent to the fate of their party's nominee or outright antagonistic to him. Where Republican lawmakers disavow their endorsements, where Republican office seekers obscure their ties, where the whole firmament of Republican electoral politics--operatives, activists, fundraisers--take leave for the season to let Trump flail on his own.

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/donald_trump_declares_war_on_american_muslims.html	"On Monday, Donald Trump declared war on American Muslims. In a brief address at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire--laden with falsehoods--the real estate mogul, who now stands as the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United States, issued a warning to the millions of Americans who claim Islam as their faith. ""They have to work with us,"" said Trump of American Muslims. ""They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad. They know it. And they have to do it, and they have to do it forthwith."" He kept on with this, asserting without evidence that Muslim Americans are intentionally hiding terrorists from law enforcement. ""They have to work with us. They know what's going on. They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn't turn them in. And you know what? We had death and destruction."" For Trump, there is no distinction between ordinary Muslims and Islamist terrorists. All are potential threats who demand heightened scrutiny. ""The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here,"" he said, emphasizing his view that Muslims are an inherent threat to U.S security, regardless of origin or citizenship, and misleading his audience about the flow and scope of Syrian refugees to the United States. (Trump says there is a ""tremendous flow."" From October to May, just 2,805 were admitted into the country.) Under his leadership, the federal government would keep Muslims from American borders, screening solely on the basis of religious belief. It would monitor mosques and any gathering of Muslim Americans as a matter of course. And it would punish Muslims who didn't cooperate with his administration. ""[W]hen people know what's going on and they don't tell us, and we have an attack, and people die, these people have to have consequences. Big consequences."" We are so used to partisan combat and cacophony that it's easy to treat this as just another speech from another nominee. Overheated, yes, but part of the same game. CNN's Wolf Blitzer called it a ""strong statement,"" as if it were any other piece of political rhetoric. It wasn't. With his call against Muslim Americans, Trump has given one of the most openly xenophobic speeches in modern American politics. And with his call to restrict, monitor, and harass American Muslims, he's echoing the kind of rhetoric that leads inevitably to tragedy and atrocity. It's unclear what, if anything, Donald Trump believes about the world. But Monday's speech leaves no doubt that his campaign is a bona fide threat to the Enlightenment values that sustain American democracy. To ""make America great again,"" Trump will jettison our hard-fought commitments to pluralism and religious tolerance in favor of a world governed by a kind of Blood and Soil nationalism, where even the sitting president is suspect on the basis of his heritage. The same Trump who accused Barack Obama of falsifying his birth certificate now says that the president ""continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people."" There's every reason to think that this won't move votes or support to Trump's column. Since Monday, Trump has faced criticism on all sides, from the journalists who have little time for his untruths, to his rival--Hillary Clinton--who dedicated a speech to debunking Trump's claims and attacking his politics of Muslim persecution, to Obama himself, who angrily denounced Trump's rhetoric as a threat to American ""pluralism"" and an assist to ISIS and other groups who thrive on the notion that theirs is a war for Islamic civilization. Still, with this election, we've entered truly dangerous territory. On the ballot for president of the United States is a man who would use the power of the office to hound an entire group of Americans, who would curtail press freedom and potentially go after his perceived enemies. And these aren't larks or asides for the Republican nominee. They are the substance of his campaign. All evidence says voters will reject that pitch. But until it actually happens, I can't blame anyone for going through this election with both eyes vigilant and always open to the possibility that, come next year, we might have to live with a President Donald Trump.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/will_donald_trump_s_swaggering_self_aggrandizing_response_to_the_orlando.html	"On Sunday, as news trickled in from Orlando, Florida--where a man who pledged allegiance to ISIS murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub before he was killed in a standoff with police--our presumptive presidential nominees took to Twitter to make their initial statements. This was Hillary Clinton's--a traditional response, forgoing the immediate politics for a simple statement of empathy. Then there was Donald Trump's. He continued along this line, mixing concern with his message, with far more of the latter than the former. This was followed by a call for President Obama to leave office. In short order, Trump had taken a terrible tragedy--among the worst in American history--and made it an excuse to stunt for his fans. For those inclined to hate everything Trump stands for, this self-aggrandizing, insensitive preening was an awful look. But given his relentless focus on security and ""strength,"" could these attacks actually help his cause vis-a-vis a fearful electorate that wants safety? Intuition says yes: Trump promises a domineering swagger that he will deploy against all of America's enemies, foreign and domestic. In a crisis like this one, many Americans might want that attitude--a primal posture against the world at large. Just look at the results from the Republican presidential primaries, where the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino were clear boosts to Trump, who called for a ban on Muslim entry to the United States, and parlayed the fear and anger of Republican voters into greater support. The general electorate is much larger and more diverse than the Republican base but it holds some of the same emotions that propelled Trump forward in the primary. According to Gallup, 50 percent of Americans prefer Trump on terrorism and national security, compared to 46 percent for Hillary Clinton. Likewise, there's research to show that terrorist attacks prompt the kinds of attitudes that benefit aggressive, bellicose candidates like Trump. ""[W]hen terrorist threat is pronounced,"" write political scientists Jennifer Merolla and Elizabeth Zechmeister for the Washington Post, ""individuals become less trusting of others, even their own neighbors. They express less favorable attitudes toward immigrants. In particular, they become less supportive of the rights of Arab and Muslim Americans."" Generally speaking, they continue, ""we find that terrorist threat advantages Republicans more than Democrats, in part because Republicans are traditionally perceived as better able to handle issues related to national defense."" Most ominously for Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans, Merolla and Zechmeister conducted a study in 2005 which found that ""evaluations of Hillary Clinton decreased when terrorism was made salient."" All of this, it seems, bodes well for a candidate who has renewed his calls for restrictions on and surveillance of American Muslims, as well as his stumping for aggressive military action. ""We have to be very strong in terms of looking at the mosques,"" Trump said during a Monday morning appearance on Fox and Friends. He then added, with regards to foreign operations, that we ""have to really increase the bombing."" But as much as they support our intuition that terrorism boosts the appeal of candidates like Donald Trump, Merolla and Zechmeister also complicate it. Republicans are viewed as more confident in the context of terrorism, but the effect is greatest when they have ""relevant national security experience."" Trump's aggressive rhetoric stands in stark contrast to his thin resume and the broad sense that he lacks the disposition to serve in the Oval Office. In a May survey from CBS News and the New York Times, for example, 70 percent of registered voters said Trump lacked the ""right kind of temperament"" to be president. Trump was able to overcome these sorts of doubts about his suitability for office in the Republican primary. But that was an unusual and dysfunctional environment, where Trump could succeed with minority support against a crowded field. It's not clear how he will fare where there's a binary choice and where the ""temperament"" question becomes much more important, especially when prominent Republicans have raised it in opposition to his White House bid. And while the Clinton of 2005 lost marks in the context of terrorism, the Clinton of 2015 gained them. By 50 percent to 42 percent, more Americans said they trusted the former secretary of state vs. Trump to handle the threat of terrorism, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in the aftermath of the Paris attacks--at a time when Americans named terrorism the biggest problem in the United States. A second Post poll, conducted in March, found an even starker divide: A whopping 61 percent of Americans said they trusted Clinton to tackle an international crisis, compared to just 32 percent for Trump. And 54 percent said they had faith in Clinton to deal with terrorism, versus 40 percent for the real estate mogul. The same hawkish policies that drove Democratic opposition to her candidacy in the primary, may--in the post-Orlando world--help her win over a larger public that wants action against real and potential threats. As analysis goes, all of this is unsatisfying. There's strong evidence on both sides of this question, and how you view things depends on your lens and aperture. The Orlando attacks may rejuvenate a flagging Trump effort or they might strengthen Clinton's confident campaign. But Orlando does, at least, provide a stable ground for speculation. For as much as Trump is aided by the ""R"" next to his name, he's also harmed by his affect and lack of experience. By provoking a backlash with his initial comments--thus emphasizing his worst qualities--it's possible that Trump has handicapped his ability to turn a ""natural"" advantage into tangible support. On the same score, Clinton's hawkishness and measured but aggressive response may mitigate any disadvantage based in gender and party ID. One final point. We should not ignore what a pro-Trump response means. The Republican nominee's narcissism in the face of tragedy might be offensive but his demagoguery is dangerous. Trump wants to use today's distress and panic to turn the heat up on millions of loyal, law-abiding Americans--treating them as threats, not allies. Will the voting public succumb to this fear or will it remember the plea of one of its most consequential representatives, who at a time of truly existential crisis, urged his fellow citizens to embrace the better angels of their nature?

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/donald_trump_will_unite_democrats_behind_hillary_clinton.html	"""We know that brother Trump is a narcissistic neofascist!"" Cornel West told a crowd of Bernie Sanders supporters here in Washington on Thursday, hanging onto the last syllable for crowd-riling effect. ""And don't let corporate media convince you that simply because you're not crazy about the milquetoast neoliberal sister Hillary that something's wrong with you!"" The public intellectual and prized Sanders supporter was helping to introduce the senator at his first D.C. rally since his fatally poor showing in Tuesday's primaries. A couple thousand or so turned out in a parking lot of RFK Stadium--another institution that few would have bet would still be standing in June 2016--to Feel the Bern one last time before the Democratic Party's final nominating contest of the cycle. It sounded like West, who serves on the party's platform committee along with his fellow introducer, Native American activist Deborah Parker, was giving Sanders supporters reason to resist falling in line behind the presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton. Parker herself noted how ""difficult"" the past few days had been for her, explaining how she's ""had to go into my hotel room and just hold on, just really hold on."" ""I do believe in prayer, so I had to pray that that good spirit inside of me comes out because I was angry,"" she added But resistance wasn't West's aim. While he wouldn't be so milquetoast neoliberal as to demand Sanders supporters rush to Clinton's side in the fall, he did, in his own way, make clear the choice that lay before everyone. ""But we know the difference between a neoliberal and a neofascist,"" he continued, ""so you make your own decision! And I'm simply here to say that I love brother Bernie Sanders, whatever he decides, but I'm a free man, and you're a free man and woman: Make your decision based on your love for poor and working people!"" If an academic firebrand like West can morally justify making a lesser-of-two-evils vote between a ""neoliberal and a neofascist""--which, barring some heighten-the-contradictions logical switcheroo, would be a vote for the milquetoast neoliberal--then just about anyone probably can. As Hillary tries to rally Sanders supporters behind her campaign for the general election, there will always be the stray shirt-burner. But what's going to ultimately unite the party is what was always going to unite the party: Donald Trump. It's not just a fear of Trump, either. It can also be a sense of glee--a glee that's fully bloomed this week--over the prospect of thrashing him for the next few months. Democrats went through a few rough weeks after Trump locked up the Republican nomination at a time when the Clinton and Sanders camps seemed further apart than ever. The winds have switched this week, as Clinton lined up the delegates needed to ensure her nomination and Trump flailed in a pool of racism that few could defend. The state of the race as determined by ephemeral news cycles will bob up and down from time to time, but this week's events seemed to reaffirm its basic landscape: Trump is the underdog, and Democrats are going to have the time of their lives knocking the crap out of him. The giddiness to get on with the obliteration process has been palpable over the past 24 hours. President Obama endorsed Clinton in a cheery video released Thursday afternoon. The New York Times reported earlier in the week that Obama is ""eager to hit the stump"" for Clinton, as he will do on Wednesday, and ""is particularly enthusiastic, aides said, about taking on [Trump]."" It's been awhile since a sitting president was popular enough to actively campaign for his replacement. It's been awhile since a sitting president both felt and could openly express such withering disrespect for a man who might replace him. Vice President Joe Biden also expressed his support for Clinton at the convention of the American Constitution Society on Thursday, and also called the presumptive Republican nominee a deplorable racist. ""I find Donald Trump's conduct in this regard reprehensible,"" he said of Trump's attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, ""evidenced by the bipartisan condemnation of the action for what it is: a dangerous attack on a vital pillar of democracy, the independent judiciary, by threats of intimidation and undercutting the legitimacy of a judge by suggesting that because of his heritage he is incapable of being fair."""" ""In addition to this,"" he continued, ""it is racist."" And then there's Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She's been abusing Trump on the regular for a while and continued that Thursday at the same event where Biden spoke, saying, ""Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself."" After delivering the speech, she rushed over to the Washington studio of MSNBC to endorse Clinton in a live interview. The difference between Warren's past pugnacious attacks and these is that now she will be speaking directly on behalf of Clinton. This is good for Clinton. The best way to stop Donald Trump is to hit him and hit him and hit him to the point that it seems like cruel overkill, and then hit him some more, and then, when he starts crying, to begin really hitting him. Every Democrat is going to want to participate in this, despite what misgivings some may have about the milquetoast neoliberal. Sanders is obviously going through some stuff right now. He knows it's over. His Thursday rally speech went nowhere near attacking Clinton, as these sorts of events did when he still felt it was a competition. Even the most hardened Clinton loyalist would've felt compelled to empathize in the setting. There he was before what may have been his last rally, rattling through the planks of his policy agenda and feeding off the energy of his crowd. This has been his daily life for the past year. How is any human being able to withdraw from this without feeling extraordinary pain? Maybe he doesn't have to. He can still speak at rallies and still talk about the issues of importance to him, just not on behalf of his own candidacy. And he can still go after Donald Trump, too, something even a serious-minded revolutionary can't resist. ""If you didn't know, Donald Trump, among his many other extraordinary attributes, is an incredibly brilliant scientist,"" Sanders said to laughs and jeers at his rally. ""He doesn't like to brag because he's a modest guy. And he has studied climate change for decades. And after exhaustive study, he has come to the conclusion that climate change is a hoax."" Standing immediately in front of Sanders, behind a security gate, was a woman holding a sign throughout his speech reading, ""DON'T QUIT BERNIE."" She was laughing, too. Thrashing Trump is easy, fun, and--now that there are real stakes--thrilling, and morally necessary. Stopping Trump gives purpose to life, and life to a divided party.

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/leftists_for_trump_what_is_to_be_done_about_these_insufferable_nihilists.html	"Last month, the left-wing writer Freddie de Boer tweeted his desire to see a ""liberal Democrat writer in the media ... write a piece making a good faith effort to consider liberal attacks on the left."" The challenge stuck in my mind, because I'm aware of my own antipathy to many types of left-wing affect, and I often feel guilty about it and wonder if it's a rationalization for my own smug complacency. (Liberals, unlike leftists, are given to neurotic questioning of their own motives.) After all, I would like to see America move toward Scandinavian-style social democracy, and that's not going to happen without serious left-wing agitation. Why, then, does the left--that is, people who want revolution rather than reform--regularly infuriate me? I'm willing to stipulate that part of it is that leftists make me feel bad about my own bougie accommodation to the status quo. Another part, though, is that I recoil from a personality type--not uncommon in radical movements--that treats politics as a realm in which to enact revenge on society for its own alienation and to claim a starring role in history. That is, people like Christopher Ketcham. On Wednesday, Ketcham published a piece in the Daily Beast titled ""Anarchists For Trump--Let the Empire Burn."" Ketcham, who writes that he donated hundreds of dollars to Bernie Sanders, now plans to support Donald Trump in the general election. ""What's needed now in American politics is consternation, confusion, dissension, disorder, chaos--and crisis, with possible resolution--and a Trump presidency is the best chance for this true progress,"" he writes.  ""This is a politics of arson. I'd rather see the empire burn to the ground under Trump, opening up at least the possibility of radical change, than cruise on autopilot under Clinton."" This is a more forceful rendition of the argument that Susan Sarandon floated on MSNBC in March, when she said, ""Some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in, things will really explode."" It's a jejune version of the Bolshevik slogan ""The worse, the better,"" which meant that deteriorating social conditions would radicalize the populace and empower the left. A few seconds' reflection is enough to realize that this isn't how American politics work. When the right is in power, the political center of gravity moves right as well. Bill Clinton's hated style of triangulation was a reaction to eight years of Ronald Reagan followed by four of George H.W. Bush, a period in which liberalism came to be seen as a massive electoral liability. During George W. Bush's administration, the most visible left-wing counterweight was the Netroots, which was basically a movement of centrist Democrats. The left flourishes when Democrats are in power, raising people's political expectations. The Bernie Sanders movement is possible because, for young people, the notion of a liberal, urbane black president is a starting point rather than a miracle. Ketcham is, naturally, blithely uninterested in reckoning with the human cost of the political apocalypse he fantasizes about. There's not a word in his piece about the immigrants who would be rounded up and put into detention camps under Trump's plan, or the people of color who would be terrorized by a total breakdown in the norms that make even an imperfect multiethnic democracy possible. This is not surprising. What is surprising is that Ketcham, as well as the likeminded people he quotes, are so forthright about seeing politics purely in terms of personal catharsis. He cites an ""editor of a major progressive website"" who is a covert Trump supporter, and who says, ""To the extent that voting for president matters at all, it is merely to give a certain secret pleasure to the voter in the privacy of the booth."" You get the sense, reading the piece, that Ketcham thinks he's shocking the bourgeoisie by opening a window into a nihilist demimonde. ""Travelling across the country, I keep meeting people who voted for Sanders in the primaries but mutter under cover of night and a few drinks that they'll vote for Trump in November,"" he writes. ""Friends out in the wildlands of the intermountain West, hard gun-toting anarchist redneck Amy Goodman progressives, say so. Big-city journalists, too. I suspect that the left-contrarian, anti-Hillary, pro-Trump arsonist crowd is larger and wider-spread than the cubicled creatures in the Clinton campaign have accounted for."" I have no idea if this is true. But insofar as it is, it confirms every stereotype that supercilious liberals have about self-styled radicals. I suspect that is why the Daily Beast published Ketcham's piece in the first place. (Well, that and the clicks.) I'm not interested in berating people who feel this way into changing their votes. Clinton can win without mobilizing the armed anarchist listeners of Democracy Now! People who believe that it would be ""clarifying"" if the ""republic degenerates into tyranny,"" as Ketcham does, probably should pull the lever for Trump; they are his natural constituency. I know these cosplay revolutionaries, to paraphrase Dave Weigel, don't represent the real left. They're certainly not the heroic people organizing fast-food workers or agitating to head off climate cataclysm. But a softer version of Ketcham's sentiment is out there among the Bernie-or-Bust crowd; in March, the Guardian heard from 500 Sanders supporters who were considering voting for Trump over Clinton. It's there, too, in the people on the left who are furious about the prospect of Elizabeth Warren joining Clinton's ticket. Increasingly, a vocal part of the left is marked by its contempt for liberalism. The feeling is often mutual. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Leftists for Trump: What Is to Be Done About These Insufferable Nihilists?	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Warren']	[]
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/how_the_democrats_can_get_bernie_to_stand_down.html	"The wishful thinking among Democratic Party leaders is that Bernie Sanders has come to terms with his loss and is just scouring the map for an appropriate exit ramp. This is what, say, President Obama would like to hear when the two meet on Thursday. The other possibility, which Washington politicos struggle to grasp because it involves a politician actually meaning what he's been saying in public, is that Sanders is serious about spending the remainder of the pre-convention period arguing his case against Hillary Clinton to superdelegates in a doomed attempt at persuasion that postpones, or eliminates, the intraparty healing process. If Sanders does intend to continue pursuing the nomination in such an abrasive way--falsely building up hope among his most die-hard supporters up to and through a convention clash in Philadelphia--party leaders are going to have to reach him in another way beyond hectoring. Pointing to the numbers won't work for the simple reason that if they haven't already, they're never going to. Worse, there's reason to believe Sanders only interprets such number-pointing as condescending and disrespectful to what he's built, which makes him more inclined to continue his path toward mutually assured destruction. Telling Sanders he's lost and needs to go away wouldn't do the trick--no matter how many times it's said. So the way to get him out of the picture would be to show how exiting the race is really his only means of ""winning"" in the sense of translating his campaign and its aspirations into something more enduring. A much-discussed Politico postmortem published Tuesday night paints an ugly portrait of Sanders as the insecure and dangerously stubborn impetus behind some of his campaign's most aggressive and divisive tactics. There is no Rasputin-like aide teaching the noble people's champion the dark arts; Sanders, if Politico is to be believed, was the one pushing his staff into the more aggressive posture: ""Sanders is himself filled with resentment, on edge, feeling like he gets no respect--all while holding on in his head to the enticing but remote chance that Clinton may be indicted before the convention."" The Politico piece can't be treated as unvarnished truth: Though it has on-the-record quotes from certain principals, you can never be sure who leaked (and thus framed) the most odious bits and for what reason. That's more a criticism of the genre. This piece in particular, though, doesn't seem to acknowledge that Sanders might have real policy objections with the mainstream Democratic Party, and that his main concern is those objections will disappear from popular conversation the minute he drops out of the picture. Sure, maybe the relative closeness of the race made him power-hungry in a way that it would just about any human in his position, and that led to some unflattering moments. Sanders ""likes that he's been in front of almost a million people since the campaign started,"" Politico writes. ""But he knows that as soon as the campaign's done, the crowds will start thinning, and he's not going to get on television anymore."" This is written in a way that portrays Sanders' quest as purely vain. It could be--could be!--that Sanders is less worried about his beautiful mug appearing on television each day and more worried about whether the ideas he introduced to the Democratic debate will vanish once he's gone. The best approach for those trying to talk him down--a group that's expanding to include some of his top surrogates--is not to keep badgering him about how he lost, and needs to concede, and then campaign unconditionally for Hillary Clinton. This will only fuel resentment that he's not being treated respectfully. Instead, the first question President Obama and others should ask Sanders while meeting him is: What can we do to help ensure your movement doesn't disappear? The Sanders camp has already been fighting over the Democratic platform, the drafters of which held their first meeting Wednesday in Washington. That's part of it. But Sanders is no dupe, and knows that the platform will just be sealed and crated off to some vast warehouse Raiders of the Lost Ark style if there's no organization left to actualize the policies he fought to include in it. Obama could offer to do everything in his power--not as president, but as a popular and well-connected Democrat--to help set up Sanders with a permanent infrastructure for his movement, an Organizing for America-type pressure group. (One that, unlike Organizing for America, wouldn't have to subordinate its pressure activities to the political prerogatives of the Oval Office.) Or something else? Be creative! Democrats see Sanders as a stubborn pest at this point, but they can't just wish him away. They might as well give empathy a go. Sanders has won more than 10 million votes, is too old to run again, and is worried that everything he fought for--and everything that attracted the next generation of voters--will be forgotten as Clinton tacks rightward. That's the level where he needs to be met. Dropping out right now is a win for Clinton and a loss for himself. Staying in through the convention and refusing to concede would be a loss for Clinton and a loss for himself. There's no reason some arrangement can't be struck to make this a win-win, with Clinton unifying the party and Sanders' movement securing the future.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/among_the_deadenders_of_bernieworld.html	"SANTA MONICA, Calif.--Around 10:30 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a triumphant Hillary Clinton offered her defeated Democratic presidential primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders an olive branch. ""Let there be no mistake: Sen. Sanders, his campaign, and the vigorous debates that we've had about how to raise incomes, reduce inequality, and increase upward mobility have been very good for the Democratic Party and for America,"" she told the crowd of supporters at Brooklyn's Navy Yard as she celebrated becoming the first woman to head a major party ticket in American history. Three hours later and roughly 2,500 miles away, out came Sanders himself, introduced to a crowd of a few thousand supporters at the Barker Hangar as ""the next president of the United States."" To roaring applause, he promised to ""take our fight"" to the July Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. He closed his speech with the mantra ""the struggle continues."" What he meant by this promise was unclear. I think I know what some of his dead-enders heard, however. ""Without all this rigging he would have won already,"" said Heather Kim, a schoolteacher and member of a Koreans for Sanders California group. ""We all know, she's stolen the vote, her and the media,"" Linda Bassett chimed in. When confronted with the sheer unlikelihood of fraud being perpetrated on that scale and with the margin of victory, which had climbed to about 3.5 million votes by the end of the night, the women remained credulous. ""I don't put it past them,"" Bassett said. ""When it goes to be counted, they've got all those computerized machines. We know that there's algorithms."" A third member of this crew--all in their late 50s or early 60s--concurred. ""I was there in 2004 in Ohio, I know the shit they pull,"" Margie Hoyt said, seeming to nod to accusations of vote machine tampering by Republicans during that election. The trio spoke in this way, in what we will call the Trumpish vague, all sinister they and techno-conspiracies, and they were not alone among the supporters I spoke with. The view hasn't exactly been discouraged by the candidate, who likes to describe the process by which he's lost the nomination as ""rigged."" Kim cited a popular theory that the exit polls were off by suspiciously wide margins in several states, which to her indicated foul play. The Nation has repeatedly picked apart this view but it still has significant cachet in Bernieworld, and has even been endorsed by top celebrity surrogate Tim Robbins. Rachel Brookhart, a 25-year-old server whom I'd met earlier in the day while she was volunteering at a Sanders headquarters in East Los Angeles, said she believed the election had been stolen. ""It seems that there's been a lot of voter disenfranchisement and maybe some unsavory numbers,"" she told me. Brookhart cited the 125,000 voters who were purged in New York. This was a disgrace, but there is no evidence that Clinton benefited from it or was responsible for it. Brookhart also complained of the Associated Press' decision to call the race for Clinton on Monday, saying that's what inspired her to get out and volunteer. She wants Sanders either to be given the nomination or to run as an independent, a sentiment echoed by most of the Sanders supporters I spoke with--and she would never vote for Clinton. ""I honestly believe a President Clinton would be more destructive than a President Trump,"" she said. I heard this a lot among diehard Bernie supporters in the campaign's last days: Donald Trump is a madman, a bigot, a lunatic who is not fit for the presidency, but he wouldn't be as bad as Hillary Clinton. They also say they wouldn't support her even if Sanders endorsed Clinton, which they don't expect he'll do because he's a man of ""authenticity."" (Maybe all the accusations of election theft, including implications from the candidate himself, play some role in this view.) ""People will say 'vote for Hillary to defeat Trump' and to me they're both trash,"" Angel Villasenor, a 32-year-old Latino man who actually supported Clinton in the 2008 primary, told me as he entered the Sanders event. As for Trump: ""I think he's a terrible person, a terrible human being, I don't support him at all,"" he said. But he's probably not that dangerous. ""It has no legs, it's just nonsense,"" Villasenor said of Trump's xenophobic anti-Mexican rhetoric and policy proposals. ""He's using that as a platform to get all those racist folks behind him."" ""I am hoping that somehow Bernie will run on a third-party ticket. If not, I will vote for [perennial Green Party candidate] Jill Stein,"" said Troy Corley, a 57-year-old small business owner. ""I absolutely will not vote for Hillary Clinton."" Even those who are considering voting for the lesser of two evils are doing so very reluctantly. ""The other two are shit and shinola, you can't tell the difference,"" 63-year-old Richard Grossman told me, without specifying who was which. He also said that his Jewish-Hungarian ancestry made him especially fearful of Trump and his extremist supporters. But vote for Clinton? ""I don't think I would,"" he said. ""But I've not 100 percent made up my mind, because to me the most important thing is to keep the white supremacy vote out of the White House."" Clinton even lay at the center of Bernie supporters' affection for their candidate. Why do they like Sanders so much? ""Because he's the only person that has a plan to do a change in this country and he's not a corrupt lying criminal like the other one [Hillary],"" said Christina Norton, a 37-year-old nurse who had flown in from Boston to attend the event. Her friend Margaret Alsop twisted herself in knots attempting to justify the idea that Sanders should use the superdelegate system, which she wants to eliminate, to secure the nomination. She did this because her views about Clinton are so strong. ""I think Hillary's a warmonger,"" she said. Again, this makes for a poor contrast between Clinton and Trump: ""I think he as a person is absolutely vile. I think as a politician she is absolutely the worst."" She continued, ""I think he would do less harm than he is projected to if he were the president. I don't support him at all and I think it would be absolutely disgraceful if he were to get into office, but I think he's full of shit. ... I don't think he would do half the corruption that Hillary would do."" Maybe it's unfair to blame Sanders for his supporters' extreme dislike of Clinton. But those dark feelings have hardened in the past couple months as Sanders' odds have slipped away, and he has insisted that he was losing because of a rigged process and media bias, not because the minority voters that make up a large share of the Democratic Party prefer his opponent by wide margins. When I spoke to Sanders supporters at a Los Angeles event in March, the vast majority of them said they would be able to support Clinton in a hypothetical matchup with Donald Trump. At Tuesday's event, the opposite was true. This actually tracks with polling: Between March and May, the percentage of Sanders supporters who said they planned to vote for Trump in a Washington Post poll climbed from 9 percent to 20 percent. Similarly, the number of Sanders supporters who would commit to voting for Clinton in a YouGov poll shrank from 63 percent to 50 percent between April and May. Trump clearly sees an opportunity in all this. ""To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of superdelegates,"" Trump said in his own speech Tuesday night, ""We welcome you with open arms."" He was talking to people very much like Margie Hoyt, who fumes at the thought that she might be asked to cast a ballot for the former secretary of state. Bernie is ""my vote and they're not taking [it] from me in November,"" she said. Hoyt then dropped into a whisper: ""I will not vote for that bitch. She isn't getting my vote for nothing.""

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/twitter_commentary_about_the_democratic_primaries.html	Hillary Clinton finally earned enough delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination on Monday night. Well, sort of; as Bernie Sanders was quick to point out, that assumes that a bunch of superdelegates won't change their minds between now and the convention, and in great enough numbers to make up for his deficit in regular delegates. In any case, the primary marches on: Tuesday, the two candidates compete for delegates across six states. The big contest is California, with 475 pledged delegates up for grabs--more than the other states combined. A loss there for Clinton, who once led the state by 9 points, would be an embarrassment at the very moment she's tying a bow on her nomination. Pundits and politicos will be watching closely as results come in. Below are their live tweets, drawn from a list of top accounts curated by Slate.

What Twitter Pundits Have to Say About Tonight's Democratic Primaries	['Sanders', 'Clinton']	[]
26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/bernie_s_time_to_concede_has_finally_arrived.html	Pundits, pols, and Democratic voters have spent the past couple of months debating when Sen. Bernie Sanders should drop out, or arguing that he should have already. But Sanders didn't just have a right to stay in the Democratic primary race until the end of the schedule. He had an obligation to. He owed it those millions of voters and the millions of donors who contributed more than $200 million to his bid to compete until he was mathematically eliminated. Though the Associated Press's tally showed Clinton hitting the overall number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination Monday night following a mini-burst of superdelegates, Sanders still had an argument for continuing, so long as she hadn't reached a majority of pledged delegates. After Tuesday night's primaries, however, that excuse will run out, and his arguments for holding out will be depleted. He doesn't have to drop out right away. He can wait until after Washington D.C. votes on June 14. He can rest for a couple of days back home in Vermont. But then it will be time to face the reality set Tuesday. At some point this evening, Sanders will be mathematically eliminated according to the metric that all small-d democrats believe should determine a nominee: among pledged delegates, of which Hillary Clinton will clinch a majority regardless of whether she narrowly wins or narrowly loses California and everywhere else (Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota to be exact). If the Sanders campaign--which is reportedly torn between camps--chooses to follow an aggressive path after he loses the pledged-delegate race and continues fighting into the convention to sway superdelegates to his side, he won't just come off as a heel. He will fail, spectacularly, endangering both his legacy and Clinton's chances in November. The question over the past couple of months, and one that picked up in intensity after the Nevada state convention chaos in May, has been whether Sanders' continued presence in the race well after it became exceedingly likely he would lose the nomination was seriously harming the party's ability to win in November. The answer to this question was no, it was not. Sanders has made barbed comments about Clinton and some sharp critiques of the primary rules overall, even as his window closed. These things do not matter. The debate over whether Clinton was nastier when she was losing in 2008 than Sanders is in 2016 is a subjective one that can't be neatly adjudicated, so we won't bother to answer it. Let's just say that the tenor at the end of neither campaign was or is especially uplifting. But none of that mattered in November of 2008, because once Clinton had conceded she did everything she could to rally her supporters to Barack Obama's side. So if the late-stage nastiness of a primary fight doesn't really matter in the end, it's worth focusing on what good Sanders has done by staying in the race: bringing new, young voters into the process, accumulating more delegates to leave a forward-looking imprint in the party platform, and using the homing beam of presidential media attention to pressure DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz into having fewer terrible political positions. The lasting damage that so many have fretted about will only come if Sanders officially loses the pledged-delegate count and refuses to accept the results heading into the Philadelphia convention. If there were any way that withholding his concession could translate into his nomination, Sanders would owe it to his supporters to continue. But there is no way. The Sanders campaign's more aggressive faction, to which Sanders himself may be party, argues that the polls showing Sanders outperforms Clinton in a head-to-head matchup against Donald Trump make it a sort of fiduciary responsibility of superdelegates, as custodians of the Democratic Party, to give the nomination to Sanders. This won't happen, and it shouldn't. It won't happen because (a) Sanders will have lost the pledged-delegate race, comfortably, and (b) the party officials who make up the superdelegation do not particularly care for Sanders. It's the first part that matters more. Even if Sanders did have a warm, glowing relationship with Democratic Party bigwigs, it would destroy the party if they were to side with him over the pledged-delegate winner. The undemocratic nature of superdelegates is what led the Sanders campaign, correctly, to rail against their existence early in the process, before the campaign recognized that flipping superdelegates was its only remaining shot at the nomination. It's not going to happen, it shouldn't, and in the fantasy world where it did, Sanders would win the nomination by directly damaging the democratic ideals on which he campaigned. But what about the specter of a Clinton indictment? Isn't the possibility that the FBI throws the book at Hillary Clinton between now and the late-July convention a reason to keep his campaign alive? No. There are few federal crimes that I'm aware of, at least, that at the point of indictment penalize the perp by taking away some number of pledged delegates to a party's convention. If Clinton is indicted and then superdelegates do show an interest in overturning the will of the voters--a doubly impossible scenario to imagine--then it will be a whole new game, and Sanders can unsuspend his campaign. That's just the thing: In the scenario of a meteor hitting the Democratic Party, it won't matter whether his campaign was active or idle at the moment of impact. Just as the onus will be on Sanders to concede sooner rather than later, so too will it be Clinton's duty to make concessions of her own. Though Clinton has argued that she conceded to Obama without conditions in 2008, that's not entirely true: The Obama campaign and its allies worked to retire her campaign debt for years. The Clinton campaign has the opportunity and the responsibility to extend its own peace offering to Sanders. He has already earned slots for several of his top supporters on the platform drafting committee. Clinton's team should go further and agree ahead of time to several of the planks about which he cares most deeply. If Sanders wants rule changes to future primary processes, Clinton should urge the Democratic National Committee to create a study commission on which his supporters will be represented. Let him speak whenever the hell he wants at the convention. Whatever. However frisky things got in the last month, none of it will matter if Sanders concedes to the first female major-party presidential nominee once primary voters are finished voting. He owed it to his supporters in each state to keep fighting as long as he had an outside chance. After Tuesday's primaries he will no longer have that outside chance. The only reasons he would have for not conceding are delusion or malice. Such a post-campaign campaign would alter his legacy in a way that he'd definitely come to regret.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/libertarians_are_blowing_a_huge_opportunity_in_2016.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. The Libertarian Party's nominating convention, held last weekend in Orlando, Florida, was typical of its gatherings. One of its more popular presidential candidates, software magnate John McAfee, is wanted for questioning by the police in Belize as a ""person of interest"" in connection with his neighbor's murder. Another candidate, who goes by the name of Vermin Supreme, wore a rubber boot on his head while explaining his platform of time travel, self-defense against zombies, and free ponies for all. It is all good fun, if observed from a safe distance. But, unlike in previous elections, the Libertarians do not have to be a total joke this time around--they have an unprecedented opportunity to play an actual role. Republicans with any moral sense are desperate for a supportable alternative to Donald Trump. Libertarianism, the political philosophy of rugged individualism, ought to hold a natural appeal to tolerant, anti-statist, free-trade conservatives who deplore the turn taken by the party of Abraham Lincoln toward racial prejudice, authoritarianism, and mercantilism. Libertarians also happen to have crucial infrastructure in place for the ""never Trump"" crowd: probable ballot placement in all 50 states, alongside Democrats and Republicans. In Orlando, the Libertarians ended up nominating the most mainstream candidates on offer: former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson for president and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld for vice president. Both are affable, reasonable-seeming politicians with governing experience. Yet the party is poised to remain entirely marginal this year. Why can it not harness the Jeffersonian instinct for individual liberty, even in a year when the leading parties have put forward the most disliked nominees in memory? The problem starts, of course, with the Libertarians themselves--a Halloween parade of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and conspiracy nuts of every permutation. These eccentrics regard their party not as an expanding tent but as a private playground for diffuse forms of self-expression. People who devote their greatest passion to the cause of legalizing drugs, challenging the age of consent, and removing limitations on the ownership of fully automatic weaponry are not really in the business of attracting a broader following. As a political party, the Libertarians have always been more party than political. Beyond the adolescent antics, their difficulty is at the level of ideas. Today's Libertarians are not so much extreme left or extreme right as they are lost in the clouds of utopian anarchism. Their platform calls for the abolition of government-funded schools and state-sanctioned marriage. During their nominating debate, delegates booed Johnson for endorsing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Like academic Marxists, who are their sisters under the skin, libertarians are far more interested in an ideal world than in the one where ordinary humans live. They regard the failure of policies they support, such as the self-regulation of financial markets in the 2008 crisis, as evidence that government still managed to play some corrupting role. When facts come into conflict with theory, they reject the facts. The failure of any libertarian state to ever actually exist anywhere in the world supports their faith that it would all work only if it could be tried. To a country beset by rising inequality, stagnant wages and the hollowing out of the middle class, libertarians have literally nothing to say. And in a way the party is right to mistrust supporters who have compromised their principles by moving into mainstream politics. David Koch, the party's nominee for vice president in 1980, has become with his brother Charles the American face of oligarchy. For the Koch brothers, libertarianism became a convenient guise for the economic interests of their family oil and gas conglomerate. Though the Kochs are thus far staying aloof from Trump, they have been generous patrons of climate-change denial and moralizing evangelical Republicans. A somewhat different style of libertarianism flourishes in Silicon Valley, where it meets the feeling of the rich and immature that Washington should leave them alone. The leading exemplar of this set is Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and a Trump delegate to the Republican convention. Thiel contends that extending the franchise to women in the 1920s destroyed American capitalism. He helped found the Seasteading Institute, an organization devoted to creating a law-free floating community in the middle of the ocean. More recently, Thiel has been exposed as the financier of a libel suit against Gawker Media that threatens the free press. In practice, wherever libertarianism has moved beyond the defense of sexual perversity and antisocial behavior, it has revealed itself as a mask for self-
interest and the abuse of economic power. This is a shame, because an intellectually coherent alternative to the Republican party, grounded in the principled restraint of classical liberalism, has never been more wanted.

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/donald_trump_is_a_serial_exploiter_of_prejudice.html	"On Thursday, Donald Trump said that Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge hearing a fraud case against Trump, is biased because Curiel belongs to an association of Latino lawyers and is ""of Mexican heritage."" According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump explained: ""I'm building a wall. It's an inherent conflict of interest."" From this interview and other statements during the campaign, we have a clear portrait of Trump's thinking about minorities. It extends beyond Latinos to blacks, Muslims, and other groups. Trump isn't an incorrigible bigot. He's an incorrigible user of bigotry. This is no longer deniable. Republican leaders who support Trump--Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Speaker Paul Ryan--should explain why they accept this conduct in their presidential nominee. In December, Trump issued a statement calling for a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" Ryan, McConnell, and Priebus disagreed. But Trump stood by his demand, and in the past few weeks, all three men have endorsed him. Barring people from the United States based on religion does not disqualify you from the support of the GOP leadership. Ryan, McConnell, and Priebus pretended that the Muslim ban was an aberration. But in the past year, it has become clear that Trump takes the same view of Latinos. He doesn't hate all of them. He's happy to say he loves them and pose with a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo. He turns on them only if they get in his way. If you run against Trump, or if you refuse to dismiss a fraud suit against him, Trump will use your ethnicity against you. He will tell white people that you're not to be trusted, because you're Latino. Trump has now done this six times. He said that Jeb Bush ""has to like the Mexican illegals because of his wife,"" because she's ""from Mexico."" He warned Iowans not to vote for Sen. Ted Cruz because ""not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba."" Two weeks later, Trump made an almost identical statement about people of Cuban descent. He said Curiel was conspiring against him because ""I'm very, very strong on the border"" and Curiel is ""Spanish."" A week ago, Trump said Curiel was biased and ""Mexican."" Trump's spokeswoman explained how the judge's ethnicity and his alleged bias were supposedly connected. Trump's apologists in the conservative media have tried to dress up his beef with the judge as a complaint about illegal immigrants or membership in a political organization. But in his interview with the Journal, Trump tossed that cloak aside. If you're ""of Mexican heritage,"" says Trump, you have ""an inherent conflict of interest"" in judging him. It doesn't matter which organizations you join or whom you give scholarships to. Your ethnicity is prima facie grounds for suspicion. Trump will try to clean up this incident, as he has after previous slurs, by saying he employs Hispanics, has Muslim friends, sells apartments to Asians, or has ""a great relationship with the blacks."" But what makes him unfit for the presidency isn't that he hates everyone of a particular race, ethnicity, or religion. It's that he has no compunction about using race, ethnicity, or religion for advantage. If you rule his way, he'll be pals and share a taco bowl. If you don't, he'll go after your heritage. If you're not Muslim or Latino, don't delude yourself that Trump wouldn't do the same to you. He's an equal-opportunity demagogue. He'll find something he can use. He'll tell people you're a Seventh-day Adventist. He'll make fun of your disability. Or he'll go after your race. That's what happened to Barack Obama. When Trump turned on Obama, the president's color was just another angle of opportunity. Kwanzaa; the riots in Ferguson, Missouri; the ""thugs"" in Baltimore--everything racial became a weapon against ""our great African American President"" and his lack of ""control"" over ""the African American community."" This is the man Ryan, McConnell, Priebus, and other Republicans have endorsed for president. Banning Muslims, smearing Latinos, blaming blacks, mocking disabilities--none of it is disqualifying in today's GOP. Days after Trump and his spokeswoman denounced the ""Mexican"" judge, Ryan endorsed him anyway. The speaker said of Trump: ""On the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement."" If you belong to a minority--any minority--that tells you all you need to know.
