Onward to Nevada and South Carolina, where there exist nonwhite humans who may be less prone to daft revolutionary schemes. One quick hiccup to the plan, though: What if Clinton loses the Nevada caucuses, too? She shouldn't. She has courted the state's powerful labor unions (though its Local 226, which represents much of the Las Vegas Strip, is remaining neutral), which are extremely well-organized. She has the secretary of labor himself, Tom Perez, campaigning for her in the state. Her organization was in the state well before Sanders' was, and its reach extends to towns far beyond the two hubs of Las Vegas and Reno. And yes, Nevada is not a 90-some percentage white state, as the first two delegate-awarding states were, and Clinton performs best among the party's black and Latino base. Nevada is 76 percent white, according to the census, and only 52 percente non-Hispanic white. New Hampshire, by contrast, is 91 percent non-Hispanic white. The 76 percent white figure is one that, if you felt like it, could be rounded up to 80 percent for shorthand. This is what Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon appears to have done this week--or at least this is the most generous explanation we can conceive for why he started dropping the ""80 percent"" figure around. (He would not respond to a request for comment about where he got that figure.) ""There's an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucus in Nevada. But it's still a state that is 80 percent white voters,"" he told MSNBC's Chuck Todd on Tuesday. Is it now? In the 2008 presidential general election, 69 percent of voters were white. In the 2012 general, that figure was down to 64 percent. Already, we're far away from 80 percent. Now let's consider what the voting breakdown is like in Nevada's Democratic caucuses. The 2008 entrance polls for its caucuses were 65 percent white, 15 percent Latino, 15 percent black, and 3 percent Asian. And Nevada, like most of the country, hasn't gotten any whiter in the past 8 years. So why the dickens would he say incorrectly that Nevada's voters are 80 percent white in a state that's sparsely polled but when it is polled shows her well into the clear? This has been considered her ""Western firewall"" for some time. Is it still? It could be that the Clinton team does still expect to win Nevada but is trying to portray it as an open contest so it can pretend to be shocked when it wins and ride a ""comeback"" narrative from there. (Politics is so stupid.) Or the Clinton team is lowering expectations--eh, it's just a bunch of silly white people out there in Nevada, you know how they can be--because it really does see in its internal polling a close contest. We will presumably see more polling data coming out of Nevada soon. As with most caucus states, the polling can be inaccurate because of the convoluted process in which organization is so critical. One recent poll we do have, that I'm going to write about with some extreme caveats, does indeed show a Clinton-Sanders tie in Nevada at 45 percent apiece. Now look: It was commissioned by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication that exists largely to terrorize Hillary Clinton. The poll was conducted by TargetPoint Consulting, a conservative firm stocked with Republican operatives whose clients in 2012 included Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, Mitt Romney's super PAC, and Karl Rove's super PAC. This is either a solid poll or it's a well-conducted effort to stoke the ""Clinton in disarray!"" narrative swirling around the Clinton campaign following New Hampshire. We will know more soon. But it wouldn't be surprising if this firewall is crumbling, or whatever it is that firewalls do when they stop being firewalls. Clinton's campaign also has been spending this week trying to turn the public's attention toward the March contests. ""Whereas the electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire are largely rural/suburban and predominantly white,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in a staff memo ""obtained"" by PBS the day of the New Hampshire primary, ""the March states better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation--including large populations of voters who live in big cities and small towns, and voters with a much broader range of races and religions."" The delegate-rich states Mook lays out as key to the nomination include ""Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Illinois, and Florida."" He's absolutely correct. But if Sanders starts eating well into her lead among black and Latino voters--something we'd hardly bet on but can't rule out--we'll soon be hearing about how Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Illinois, and Florida, too, are just the home states of Whitey McWhitesalot, and the true test for the nomination will be in June's California primary or on the convention floor."

Bernie Sanders text: Bernie Sanders hates President Obama and everything he stands for. Speaking of making subtext text: May we talk about why Hillary Clinton either hugged Obama, or tried to pummel Sanders with Obama, so much Thursday night? As the South Carolina primary looms? This was the most she's invoked Obama since, well, the Jan. 17 debate in South Carolina itself. It's really something. I am right now listening to the CNN post-debate commentary, and analyst Gloria Borger is describing this tactic as one the Clinton campaign considers ""helpful for South Carolina."" Oh? What she's trying to say is: The Clinton campaign is talking so much about how great Obama is, and how mean Sanders is to Obama, because there are a lot of black voters in South Carolina. It is the most amusingly obvious campaign tactic since, say, Wednesday morning, when Sanders for whatever reason decided to meet with Al Sharpton in Harlem the day after the New Hampshire primary. Clinton wrapped herself in Obama's glory Thursday night at nearly the same pace that Bernie Sanders mentions Wall Street on any night. What do you have to say about your super PAC with flashy billionaire donors, Secretary Clinton? So did President Obama, and he's the best. On the unfeasibility of Bernie Sanders' health care plan: ""Why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment, namely the Affordable Care Act, is because I know how hard it was to get that done."" On how she would improve race relations in a way that Obama was unable to: ""Well, I am just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama, we have seen a lot of advances. The Affordable Care Act has helped more African-Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of."" On her call to send back unaccompanied migrant children detained at the border: ""The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border."" On her foreign policy decision-making ability: ""Sen. Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience to become secretary of state."" Which brings us to the grand finale near the end of the debate, right after Hillary chose Nelson Mandela as the leader who would most influence her foreign policy:"	Why Hillary All of a Sudden Can't Stop Talking About Her Buddy Obama	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Nelson', 'Obama']	[]

Bernie Sanders a chance to capitalize on the momentum from his landslide victory in this week's New Hampshire primary. It will also offer Hillary Clinton an opportunity to right her campaign heading into more favorable terrain in the Nevada caucus and South Carolina primary. The stakes will be high for the Democratic Party--but also for Republicans, who will have to craft their own general election campaign to suit whomever the opponent ends up being. So both sides will have interesting things to say about the PBS debate. Below are live tweets from top pundits and politicos. On the left, you'll see the liberal tweets.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/john_kasich_isn_t_as_moderate_as_many_democrats_and_republicans_think.html	"Gov. John Kasich is billed as the most moderate candidate in the 2016 Republican presidential field. Why? It doesn't have much to do with his economic policy proposals, which are a plain-vanilla conservative blend of spending cuts, deregulation, and massive tax cuts predominantly favoring the wealthy. Toss in a dash of supply-side magic powder and you supposedly have a balanced budget, the rousing policy issue that Kasich, who helped balance the budget as a congressman in the '90s, has pegged as central to his candidacy. Kasich, as he laid it out in one of his final New Hampshire town halls Monday before his second-place finish, calls for ""no more federal regulations outside of health and safety for one year,"" and promises to task his vice president with ""unraveling the regulatory morass in this country."" He wants to compress the tax code to three brackets with a top marginal rate of 28 percent, down from the current 39.6 percent. He would lower the long-term capital gains rate back to 15 percent, lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, and eliminate the estate tax. He would cut Social Security. He would freeze nondefense discretionary spending, bump up defense spending (while targeting Pentagon waste), and block-grant federal food stamp and Medicaid programs to the states. All of this, he says in Mitt Romney-esque language, is to inspire the ""job creators"" to do their thing. Kasich is also strictly pro-life and once tried to crush unions in Ohio, though he did seem to cool down when voters overruled him in a referendum. So what makes Kasich, once a welfare-cutting chief lieutenant in the Gingrich revolution, a ""moderate"" this cycle? Eh, a couple of high-profile policy issues. He supports a path for legalization for undocumented immigrants. He also accepted the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion in Ohio with moralistic language that conservatives interpreted as a hostility against them: ""Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter,"" he famously said in 2013, ""he's probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer."" It should be reiterated that the discretionary spending cuts and block-granting of programs for the poor that he proposes would amount to a disaster for the poor. But hey, one time in 2013 he said we should be nice to the poor, so there you go. Moderate! Supporting a path to legalization (not citizenship) and not rushing to blast all poor people into outer space should not be enough to make him liberals' favorite Republican candidate, though there's a low bar there. A policy apostasy or two aside, Kasich, also a former Fox News host and Lehman Brothers banker, is a fairly uniform conservative. What makes him stand out is what makes so many other so-called moderate heretics, such as ex-House Speaker John Boehner or Sen. Lindsey Graham or Sen. John McCain, stand out in the Republican Party of 2016: He's a tactical realist who understands the limits of governance--and thus, how to govern. ""You can't get any really big thing done if you just have one party,"" Kasich said while answering a question about his Social Security reform plan on Monday. ""We have to have some form of bipartisanship. You've got to have some people in the other party say, 'OK.' And in the course of it, you're going to have to talk to them about some of the things they want. You can't give away the store. There's a few places [I'll] have to give. That's life! I mean, where is it that we don't give? I don't know why we think politics is the only place where the answer is no, no, no, no, no."" You will not find many candidates who will admit this, which is to say ""admit"" that they would govern in the way the United States government is designed to operate. Kasich doesn't paint the apocalyptic portrait of American politics or the state of the world that, say, Sen. Ted Cruz or every other candidate does. He's saying that he knows how to do what needs to be done, but in order to achieve it you're going to have to cut some deals with Democrats. It's this combination of mild demeanor and procedural realpolitik that makes Kasich the nefarious ""moderate"" who understands what it means to govern and thus is actively despised by the conservative base. Unless the filibuster is torn down completely, any Republican who becomes president will have to operate this way. Kasich is a filthy rotten moderate RINO for admitting it.

Bush edged out John Kerry in 2004--a vote result that prompted one British paper to ask, ""How can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB?""--a theory formed to explain how Bush, with the fetid albatross of the Iraq War dangling from his neck, won: He's the ""guy you'd want to have a beer with."" A Zogby/Williams poll that fall had indeed found that 57 percent of undecided voters would rather drink with Bush than with Kerry. Left-wing pundits who were baffled that Bush had been awarded a second term seized on this as the only possible explanation for his appeal. Over time, ""guy you'd want to have a beer with"" became the agreed-upon narrative of Bush's campaign wins. Uptight Al Gore and pinot-sipping John Kerry just weren't desirable barstool neighbors, the now-cemented conventional wisdom holds, while Bush could sell himself as someone whom you'd like to sip a Coors adjacent to. As things in Iraq kept going south, lefties like Bill Maher and Elizabeth Edwards invoked the beer thing as a cautionary tale, tsk-tsking America for thinking it was a good idea to choose the leader of the free world on that basis. The drinking-beer-in-candidate's-vicinity rationale had cropped up here and there before 2000, but ever since W. it's been a key indicator--used to predict or explain all sorts of election results. I haven't seen a ton of data this cycle on the beer question. But an online poll back in November, conducted by NBC News and Survey Monkey, asked registered voters which Republican presidential candidate they'd ""most want to have a drink with."" Donald Trump won with 16 percent. Ben Carson got 11 percent. Marco Rubio came in tied with Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie for a distant third, way down at 4 percent. I don't want to put an inordinate amount of stock in one online poll. Or, for that matter, in a reductive theory about election psychology. But it does occur to me that, for a certain swath of voters, there has never been and perhaps never will be a candidate you'd be more eager to have a beer with than Donald Trump. What other presidential hopeful seems so up for anything? So full of ribald stories and high-gloss gossip? So unguarded and unpredictable? What other candidate calls his opponent a ""pussy"" on camera and then just owns it? Dude seems like he'd be fun after you got a couple shots in him. Of course, Trump doesn't drink. Neither did W. The want-to-have-a-beer-with metric is metaphorical in nature. It's more a measure of the voter's own id and imagination than of the candidate's likely behavior if thrown into a prolonged, casual social interaction with an unknown citizen. (A 2005 story in the Onion was titled ""Long-Awaited Beer With Bush Really Awkward, Voter Reports."" Noting the poll numbers on the beer question, the story envisions W. tippling an O'Doul's with a blue-collar Pennsylvanian and failing to connect on any level.) Still, knocking one back with a candidate appears to be an activity voters like to ponder. Consider this January message thread on the conservative Internet forum Free Republic, in which ""Freepers"" discuss whether America would prefer to have a beer with Trump or Ted Cruz.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/the_gop_establishment_s_candidates_will_not_perform_well_against_donald.html	"A week ago, the Republican establishment thought it had found a savior. Sen. Marco Rubio, fresh from his third-place finish in Iowa, had momentum and was doing well in general-election polls. Mainstream Republicans were ready to coalesce behind him. The prospect of having to nominate Sen. Ted Cruz or Donald Trump--who finished first and second in Iowa, respectively--seemed to be receding. New Hampshire dashed these hopes. Trump won big, and Rubio fell to fifth place. The Florida senator trailed two other mainstream candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Rubio even lost to Cruz, who came in third despite investing only $500,000 in an inhospitable state. That result, combined with the terrain ahead, spells big trouble for the GOP. Polls in South Carolina, which votes next on Feb. 20, make a strong case that Trump and Cruz will finish first and second, shutting out Rubio and Bush again. The Trump-Cruz stranglehold on the nomination is tightening. In the past month, three public surveys have examined the race in South Carolina. All three were taken between Jan. 15 and Jan. 23: a CBS News/YouGov survey, a Marist poll for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, and an OpinionSavvy poll for the Augusta Chronicle. In all three polls, Trump led by a wide margin, and Cruz came in second. The average result was 36 percent for Trump, 20 percent for Cruz, 13 percent for Rubio, and 10 percent for Bush. Kasich barely registered at 2 percent. The Chronicle poll tested a scenario similar to where we are now: a five-man field of Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Bush, and Ben Carson. Given those options, 32 percent of South Carolina Republicans chose Trump, 18 percent chose Cruz, 13 percent chose Bush, and 11 percent chose Rubio. If you're a Republican who dreads a Trump or Cruz nomination, that's only the beginning of the bad news. Let's start with a constituency that wasn't much of a factor in New Hampshire: evangelicals. In the New Hampshire Republican exit polls, Cruz won the votes of 23 percent of white evangelicals. That wasn't as good as Trump's 27 percent, but it handily beat Rubio's 13 percent, Bush's 11 percent, and Kasich's 11 percent. What held Cruz back was that in New Hampshire, white evangelicals comprised only 23 percent of the Republican vote. In the South, that will change. The NBC poll found that white evangelicals comprised 51 percent of South Carolina's Republican electorate. Cruz did just as well among them as he did in New Hampshire, winning 24 percent of their votes, compared with Rubio's 12 percent and Bush's 8 percent. Kasich scored a zero. In the CBS poll, the numbers were even better for Cruz: 65 percent of Republican primary voters in South Carolina identified themselves as evangelical, and 26 percent of them supported Cruz, thrashing Rubio's 10 percent, Bush's 9 percent, and Kasich's 1 percent. In short, Cruz proved on Tuesday that he can rack up double-digit margins over Bush, Rubio, and Kasich among a constituency that's going to represent more than one-half of the Republican vote on Feb. 20. Cruz also proved he can win big on the right. In New Hampshire, he did much better among very conservative voters, winning 23 percent of their votes, than he did among somewhat conservative voters, winning only 9 percent of their votes. That discrepancy hurt him because in New Hampshire the number of Republican voters who called themselves somewhat conservative was 50 percent higher than the number who called themselves very conservative. In South Carolina, the balance could be quite different. In the Chronicle survey, the share of Republican voters who called themselves very conservative matched the share who called themselves somewhat conservative: 35 percent. Cruz trounced his mainstream opponents among very conservative voters, winning 29 percent of their votes, compared with 9 percent apiece for Bush and Rubio. In the CBS poll, which used slightly different ideological categories, Cruz beat Rubio and Bush among conservatives (22 percent to Rubio's 10 percent and Bush's 6 percent), and he walloped them among very conservative voters (35 percent to Rubio's 10 percent and Bush's 9 percent). Again, Kasich barely registered. As the primaries move south, Cruz is more in tune with the Republican electorate than Bush, Rubio, and Kasich are. The CBS poll, for instance, asked South Carolina Republicans whether certain candidates would be too extreme, too moderate, or about right for them. Cruz outscored both Trump and Rubio on this measure: 63 percent said he was about right, while only 53 percent said the same of Rubio and only 50 percent said the same of Trump. Thirty-six percent said Rubio was too moderate. Only 16 percent said the same about Cruz. In New Hampshire, Rubio pitched himself as the universal second choice, the natural repository for voters who had soured on or lost faith in other candidates. Exit polls validated his claim. When Republican voters were asked which candidates would satisfy them if nominated, Rubio outscored his opponents: He satisfied 57 percent of voters, while Trump satisfied only 50 percent and Cruz satisfied only 37 percent. But that appeal wasn't enough to boost Rubio above Cruz, much less above Trump. And in South Carolina, Rubio can't make the same argument, because Cruz, not Rubio, is the natural repository. The CBS poll asked South Carolina Republicans which candidates they could consider supporting. Cruz led the field: 60 percent were willing to vote for him, while 40 percent weren't. Forty-three percent said they wouldn't consider Rubio, 44 percent ruled out Carson, 52 percent ruled out Trump, 68 percent ruled out Bush, and 81 percent ruled out Kasich. In the NBC poll, Cruz was easily the top second choice of Trump supporters, winning 35 percent of their votes, compared with Rubio's 13 percent and Bush's 11 percent. Cruz was also the top second choice of Rubio voters, drawing 26 percent of their votes, compared with Trump's 18 percent and Bush's 10 percent. Rubio often says he's the candidate best able to unite the party. In South Carolina, that's just not true. New Hampshire could have made things a lot easier for the establishment. If Rubio had done well, or had at least beaten Bush, donors and voters might have abandoned Bush and coalesced around Rubio. The NBC poll shows that this would have helped Rubio significantly: Among Bush's voters in South Carolina, 22 percent said their second choice was Rubio. Only 16 percent said their second choice was Cruz, and other candidates--Trump, Kasich, and Chris Christie--stood to inherit only 11 percent of Bush's voters apiece. But with Bush and Kasich still in the race, Rubio is hard pressed to gain ground on Cruz. Rubio has other problems, too. In the CBS poll, 70 percent of South Carolina Republicans said Trump was consistent in what he stood for. Sixty-eight percent said the same of Cruz. Only 54 percent said this was true of Rubio. And when they were asked whether Rubio ""understands how you and people like you feel right now,"" only 65 percent said he did. Trump and Cruz outscored him on that question, earning affirmative answers from 77 percent and 74 percent, respectively. If Trump and Cruz finish first and second in South Carolina, that will be the third straight contest in which they've outpolled Rubio and Bush. Donors and party leaders, desperate to stop a Trump or Cruz nomination, will scramble for an alternative. But the list of alternatives will narrow in the cruelest way. There will be one candidate who can stop Trump, and another who can stop Cruz. Their names, respectively, will be Ted Cruz and Donald Trump."

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/marco_rubio_collapsed_in_gop_s_new_hampshire_primary.html	"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire--The Rubio collapse was real. And for the first time Tuesday night, Marco Rubio admitted it. ""I know many people are disappointed. I'm disappointed with tonight,"" he said at his primary night rally in Manchester. ""You have to understand something: Our disappointment tonight is not on you. It's on me. I did not do well on Saturday night, but listen to this: That will never happen again."" Only a few days ago Rubio appeared poised to run away with the second leg of his ""3-2-1"" strategy, or perhaps even make a run for a wounded Donald Trump and begin with a ""3-1"" start. Either a first- or a significant second-place finish would have cleared the ""establishment lane"" of competitors such as Gov. Chris Christie; Gov. John Kasich; and, after another state or two of aimless money-burning, Jeb Bush. Natural nominating forces would have pushed Rubio--with the most room to grow and the most support within the party--to the top in the long term. And then, during Saturday night's debate, he was discovered to have been a replicant all along. He ""melted,"" as Christie put it. As of late Tuesday night, Rubio was in a three-way battle for third place with Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz--and technically sitting in fifth place as of this writing. The early atmosphere at Rubio's event in Manchester's Radisson Hotel--a frustratingly crowded hub of political media activity during the New Hampshire primary--was indeed mired in puzzlement. There was near silence as the two Fox News screens on display called New Hampshire for Trump. Things pepped up a bit when Fox announced that Christie, who's been hammering Rubio ruthlessly the past week, would finish in sixth place. An even louder series of cheers broke when Fox called Sen. Bernie Sanders the victor in the Democratic contest. But even as the bad news was rolling in, his supporters weren't taking to the sort of despair that, say, Bush supporters would had he finished beneath Rubio, that Kasich supporters would had he finished anywhere below second, or that Christie supporters are taking right now. And that's because still, even after the debate malfunction, Rubio is still perceived as the strongest of the four. ""By no means do I think this will impede his prospects going forward,"" said Ben Markowitz, a Harvard student who came up to canvass for Rubio during the closing stretch. ""In the South, someone like John Kasich--he has no organization there. He went all-in here. Only now he has to start building an organization."" What about Jeb? ""What about him? 'Please clap.' He's going to do a lot of asking. I don't think he's going anywhere."" And he's pleased that Christie, Rubio's tormentor, is now facing the exit: ""I'm not going to complain about that."" Others were mystified at how quickly Rubio's good fortune reverted, almost from a matter-of-fact perspective. ""It doesn't clarify the race at all, not at all,"" said Dwayne, who wouldn't give his last name, of Dunbarton, New Hampshire. ""The people who I expected to be dropping out after the race are actually doing far better than I expected. Should be interesting to watch."" And Leslie Mason of Manchester thought it was ""unfair"" the way Rubio's debate repetition was portrayed: ""The thing about repeating the talking points, I think he didn't feel that they really understood the point: that Obama was fundamentally trying to change the fabric of the nation."" She still held out hope that Rubio could return as more results trickled in but didn't think it was a fatal blow if he didn't. The modestly priced bar at the event mitigated whatever disappointment existed, but you still didn't get the sense that they feel their guy is toast. And a lot of that has to do with Markowitz's read of the race. Kasich had a surprise second-place finish, but it still took him more than 100 town halls and a near-total dumping of limited resources in one favorable state to lose to Trump by roughly 20 points. The same goes for Bush--booed loudly by the Rubio crowd when his Tuesday night speech aired--who hustled nearly as hard to finish several percentage points behind in the low teens. Bush, unlike Kasich, has the organization to compete in South Carolina and beyond; like Kasich, he still represents a brand of center-right conservatism that the majority of the party has shown no sign it wants this cycle. This idea--that only Rubio has the necessary cross-party appeal and resources to emerge from the establishment lane, bad debate or not--is what may account for his supporters' ability to take Tuesday's loss in stride and move South. The class of donors and operatives who so hoped that Rubio would wrap things up Tuesday night may be disappointed but have no reason to consider this the last battle. As Rubio said in his speech, ""We did not wind up where we wanted to be, but that does not change where we're going to be at the end of the fight."" This theory assumes, though, that Rubio occupies a naturally large space that neither Bush nor Kasich is capable of filling. The part about no one being able to fill it besides Rubio may be true. But what if New Hampshire was a sign that voters do consider Rubio a lightweight, and his space just evaporates? Or Bush continues to bleed votes from Rubio eternally? Cruz and Trump have won the first two nominating states. History dictates that one of them will be the nominee, and they're the favorites heading into South Carolina. With the very notable exception of Newt Gingrich in 2012, South Carolina always picks the Republican nominee. The party doesn't just need to settle on an establishment nominee around whom to rally--it needs that person to be a great candidate with a strong campaign to pull off what would be a history-defying comeback against Trump or Cruz. Rubio was eyed as the only candidate of the four who could fill that role. What if he can't? See more of Slate's GOP primary coverage."

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/hillary_clinton_is_losing_young_voters_to_bernie_sanders.html	"That Democrats have a generational split in their presidential primary isn't a surprise. Young Democrats flocked to Barack Obama in 2008, to Howard Dean in 2004, to Bill Clinton in 1992, and in one of the most famous examples, to George McGovern in 1972. What's different about this primary is the size of the gulf between young Democrats and the rest of the party. Eighty-four percent of voters between 17 and 29 backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucus, and in the latest New Hampshire polls, he leads Clinton by an almost 9-to-1 margin. Despite the many, many takes on ""millennial"" disenchantment with Clinton, the why of her weakness isn't as obvious as it seems. The big, obvious problem is that in Iowa and New Hampshire we have a narrow sample of young people to choose from. Between the two states, we are looking at a distinctive group of young, white, largely college-educated liberals whose left-turn is both surprising--in its speed and intensity--and predictable given events (the shock of the Great Recession) and the usual divides in the Democratic Party. (In her youth, for example, Hillary Clinton was fighting the ""establishment"" from the trenches of the McGovern campaign.) Because we don't know what young black and Latino voters believe about the contest between Sanders and Clinton--so far, there's little polling from either South Carolina or Nevada--it's hard to make firm electoral conclusions about Clinton's weakness and Sanders' strength, although it is clear that we are witnessing a real ideological shift in the Democratic Party that will play out in the next 20 years. With that said, we can still glean insight from the divide, and try to pinpoint--in particular--the source of Clinton's weakness. And to that point, I asked around. For young participants in presidential politics, what was the problem with Hillary Rodham Clinton? What was so off-putting? Speaking to students attending a Clinton event at Manchester Community College, the big answer was Wall Street. ""I'm concerned with her talks with Goldman Sachs--the big money that is behind her,"" said Sarah Kocher, who was there with a group from Hofstra University in New York. By contrast, she admired Sanders' stance against ""the big money and the banks."" ""Bernie is very honest,"" she said. ""I think a lot of us are starting to realize that Hillary is just part of the establishment,"" said Kate, another student from the same group, whose only hesitation on Sanders was his ability to deliver on his promises. Another group of students--who had come out of curiosity--sounded a similar note. ""I get the impression from Hillary that as soon as she gets in office ... she wouldn't be an effective president,"" said Michael Hathaway, ""and if she was effective, it wouldn't be for me, it would be for her banker friends who were giving her millions of dollars."" Sitting next to Michael was Lexis, who had less to say about Clinton's ties to Wall Street, and more to say about her campaign appeals. ""I have a very large problem with the fact that a very large part of her campaign is riding on the fact that she's a woman, and expects people like me--women--to vote for her,"" she said. She continued: ""All I have heard so far is 'I'm a woman vote for me, because we need a woman president.' We'll have plenty of time in the future for women to run, for qualified, worthy women to run. We need to get over this concept of immediate gratification that's driving this campaign."" What's striking in all of this is how visceral the dislike is, especially since Hillary--while important--isn't a central figure in the story of American politics since the end of the George W. Bush administration. She backed the corporate-friendly policies that young Democrats are rebelling against, but she isn't responsible for them. I don't have an explanation here, but I have a theory. It's obvious that the left turn among young voters is a product of the Great Recession. For Americans who left high school or finished college in 2008, 2009 and 2010 (I'm part of this group, for the record), the economy was a wasteland, with little opportunity and tremendous competition. Young people--and especially college graduates--were promised a pathway into the middle-class and received, instead, a dead end. Clinton isn't responsible for this state of affairs, but she comes out of a governing class that played a large and important part in letting it happen. And while she has moved to the left to accommodate the concerns of younger voters, she's still tainted by her history. That this is complicated--that it interacts with her gender in important ways--is almost irrelevant, as evidenced by the resistence to her gendered appeals. What matters is that to these young voters Hillary Clinton was on the wrong side when it mattered. And that Bernie Sanders, as flawed as he might be, wasn't.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/what_the_rubiobot_gaffe_really_reveals_about_marco_rubio.html	"There's an unspoken premise behind the delighted glee that has greeted Marco Rubio's meltdown at last weekend's debate. When his critics call him a robot--or when they chide him for reciting talking points--they are making a nasty implication: His words are not his own. Off in the distance, some unseen machinator is feeding him his lines. Which, of course, raises the question: Whose words are they? The discussion of Rubio's glitches doesn't usually land on this question. To many of his critics, the essential takeaway is that Rubio lacks intelligence, or at the very least the ability to think on his feet. The rote repetition proves he lacks the intellectual nimbleness to be president. This accusation strikes me as unfair. Anyone who has watched Rubio in town hall meetings can see his gift for clever, improvised asides and his genuine policy fluidity. Every politician subjected to endless debates and campaign events must rely on stock paragraphs. John McCain, who received lavish praise for his spontaneity, unloaded the same canned jokes and anecdotes and proscriptions over and over and over. There's not much evidence to suggest that Rubio has an unusual political genius, but there's nothing that proves that he's any less smart than the competition either. The accusation that he's someone else's puppet is more substantial. It's a question that has shadowed his whole career--and it's not surprising that it's come into focus just now. The Republican establishment was poised to close ranks around Rubio after his stronger than expected finish in Iowa. The comfort lobbyists and backroom operators were beginning to show with him created an air of suspicion among conservative voters, which a skillful debater like Christie could exploit. Why are party elders and Fox News commentators so confident in him? After all, Rubio is a former poster boy of the Tea Party who endorsed the populist Mike Huckabee in 2008 and has staked out an extreme position on abortion--why, exactly, is the establishment so confident he'll do their biding? Their enthusiasm could merely suggest desperation for a viable challenger to Trump and Cruz. Or it could betray that the GOP sachems know something voters don't. Perhaps they know that Rubio will be the type of lapdog to whom you can feed talking points and, more worrisome, dictate policy. This image of Rubio as a cipher is at once an unjust caricature and a pretty accurate summation of his career. Since Rubio's earliest days in law school, Republican big wigs have swooned whenever he opens his mouth. They saw his silver tongue and charm, as well as a demographic dreamboat: the ambitious son of Cuban immigrants, who worked his way up from modest means in Florida, the state on which presidential elections turn. Rubio came on the scene as California Gov. Pete Wilson and his anti-immigrant crusade were crashing the Republican Party's share of the Latino vote. It was the very moment that George W. Bush and his mangled Spanish were making a concerted effort to undo that damage. Rubio was an irresistible figure, quickly marked for bigger things. At every stage of his career, powerful benefactors--including Jeb Bush--pushed Rubio forward. It's how he became the youngest speaker of the Florida house. And it's the reason that strategists began imagining a Rubio presidential bid nearly as soon as he arrived in Washington. None of this distinguishes him from other bright young things in every state capital of America. Yet Rubio's ascent came with several clouds that he's never been able to escape. The first is ideological. His rapid-fire transformations on immigration--from Tea Party to Chuck Schumer's fellow gangster and back again--suggest that he lacks core beliefs. They create an impression of a man vulnerable to manipulation--without principles and courage, the very sort who would bend his views to those of his masters. Then there's the matter of Rubio's finances. As he freely admits, they are a mess. He's been saddled with debt, unable to cover the costs of family birthday parties and renovations to his home. (When he left the Florida state house in 2008, he had a net worth of $8,351.) The dire state of his bank accounts has made him reliant on benefactors. He needed the Florida GOP's American Express card to help him bridge his expenses. And more glaringly, he's relied on an old auto dealer called Norman Braman. Ever since Rubio entered politics, Braman has showered him with donations, hundreds of thousands of dollars of assistance, by the New York Times' estimation. He even gave Rubio's wife a job as an adviser to his family foundation. Back in 2008, Braman predicted that Rubio would be the first Hispanic president. Seeing that happen in 2016, he told the Times recently, is ""part of my legacy."" Rubio, meanwhile, has shoveled public money to causes dear to Braman, including a cancer research center bearing his name. Another accusation--or perhaps compliment--dogs Rubio: that he is the Republican Obama. On one level, this is true. They both arrived in the Senate as young, fresh saviors of their party. And their youth and uncluttered records made them blank slates onto which enthusiasts could inscribe their hopes. It allowed them to capture the imaginations of disparate groups, each able to project their conflicting visions onto the men.  But there's a big difference between the two--and Rubio's debate glitch distilled it. Obama carried a confidence that suggested core convictions and deep thinking about how he might lead. Rubio has convictions, too; some of these have led him to positions that are several terrifying clicks to the right of mainstream conservatism. But his stammering and repetition suggest that he's not so certain about what he believes, that his smooth exterior might just be someone else's creation."

Ted Cruz has found a new wedge issue in the Republican presidential race: excluding women from the draft. Currently, young men, but not young women, are required to register for the draft. That policy has been in question since December, when the military opened all its positions, including combat roles, to women. Last week, prodded by a Democratic senator, leaders of the armed forces testified that in view of the December announcement, it's logical to register women for the Selective Service. In Saturday's Republican presidential debate, ABC's Martha Raddatz asked Sen. Marco Rubio whether women should have to register. Rubio said yes:	Ted Cruz Wants to Protect Our Daughters	['Rubio', 'Cruz']	[]
10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/marco_rubio_s_campaign_pitch_to_reassure_new_hampshire_voters.html	"NASHUA, New Hampshire--""For a brief fleeting moment I was a Rubio supporter,"" said an older man named Bob in the parking lot of Nashua Community College in Nashua, New Hampshire, ""But that debate last night really put the nail in the coffin for me."" Gov. John Kasich had just held a modest town hall at the school, and Bob was holding a bundle of lawn signs for the Ohio governor, a new convert to the Kasich message of balanced budgets and conservative reform. Sen. Marco Rubio, as we know, had a terrible Saturday. He didn't just stumble, he sowed doubt in his ability to perform at the highest levels of American politics, bolstering critics who blast the young Florida senator as callow, shallow, and without a core. The question is how many other Granite State Republicans share Bob's concern for the candidate who last week looked liked the one most likely to unite establishment voters. At a stop in Londonderry on Sunday--just a short drive from the Manchester Regional Airport--Rubio went to work reassuring New Hampshire voters. In a rally held in the gym of the local high school, Rubio didn't shy away from his robotic repetition of talking points at Saturday night's debate. Instead, he leaned into his point, declaring that yes, Barack Obama ""knows what he's doing."" ""The next four years are going to be worse than the last seven if Bernie Sanders gets elected,"" said Rubio, emphasizing the point. At this point, the audience clapped and someone shouted ""feel the Bern!"" Rubio responded. ""You like the Bern? Well the Bern's a socialist. I don't want to be a socialist country. You want to be socialist? Move to Scandinavia. Move to Venezuela. There's like 80 socialist countries in the world--move to a socialist country. We want to be America."" From there, Rubio went into a version of his stump speech, promising conservative solutions, blasting Democrats, and tying it to his biography, to his father, and to his notion of the things that make America unique. ""What makes us special are the millions of people who aren't rich, who are just working hard and sacrificing so they can be happy and give their kids a chance to do all the things they never could,"" he said. ""We are special because that's been possible here, and very rare everywhere else. And whether or not we remain special will be determined by whether or not that's still true."" From here, Rubio moved from quiet to loud, and made his final jab at the other side. ""If we stay on the road we are on now; if we stay on the road Barack Obama has put us on; if we stay on the road Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton want to keep us on, we will lose that. The American dream will be lost. We will still be a rich and powerful country, but we will not be special anymore."" This riff, in its way, is a testament to Obama's success. Unlike 2012, when Mitt Romney and other GOP candidates could slam the White House for unemployment and sluggish wages, the economy in the second term of the Obama administration has been on a steady upswing. Unemployment is falling, wages are growing, and the problems--like low and declining labor force participation--don't lend themselves to easy soundbytes. In the face of this stronger, improving economy, an economic pitch won't work. And so Rubio doesn't make it. Instead, he sets his sights on other concerns. His pitch has less to do with your pocketbook, and more to do with your safety. (""How can the world be growing more dangerous, but our military weaker?"") It has less to do with your job or your boss, and more to do with what you believe about your country. For Rubio backers, this is why he's their top choice, even after Saturday's debate or the questions about his experience and fitness for the Oval Office. ""I think some of the people who have the most experience haven't really done anything,"" said Vanessa, a local who was there with her son. ""I think sometimes you need fresh ideas; someone who hasn't been corrupted by the people around them."" ""You're not going to find the perfect candidate,"" said Joe, who came to see Rubio from Massachusetts. ""You have to look at what you align mostly with."" He wasn't too concerned about Rubio's debate performance, given the quality of his answers on foreign policy in the latter part of Saturday's debate. ""His answers on national security--I don't think he's matched up there."" It is a truism that every political rally for every politician is filled with people who truly believe their candidate will beat the odds and win the election. Last week, at an event for Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in Iowa, I spoke with a voter who came from Nebraska to see the governor and work for his campaign. He was convinced that Iowa voters would back Huckabee, and that Huckabee would make it to the top. Rubio has these supporters, too. The difference is there's still a chance. And don't forget: Despite Saturday's performance, Rubio is talented. No, he doesn't relish attention like Sen. Ted Cruz, command policy like Jeb Bush, or simply dominate a room like Christie. But his jokes come easy. He looks earnest. He seems sincere. That last point is important. On the question of American exceptionalism and national greatness, he has the devotion of a true believer, and he wants you to feel it, too. And so he talks fast and paces around the small stage, never quite stopping, not as if he's in a hurry to leave but as if he's in a hurry to convert you. To make you a soldier in the war, as he sees it, for America's soul. In a more conventional year, this could have sparkled. As it stands, it falls short. While Rubio wants to fight a kind of spiritual battle, his chief rival in New Hampshire, Donald Trump, wants to fight an actual battle against actual enemies. Whether it's Muslims or immigrants or police protesters, Trump offers a litany of living, breathing targets--scapegoats for national problems, vessels for anger and resentment. Against that, it's hard to see how Rubio prevails."

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/jeb_bush_may_actually_have_a_shot_at_the_republican_nomination.html	"BEDFORD, New Hampshire--George W. Bush never really suffered for his sins. But his kid brother sure has. The demise of Jeb Bush has been a source of immeasurable pleasure for, well, nearly everyone. His campaign is a nine-figure boondoggle that suckered cronies from Greenwich and Dallas into investing in a can't-miss-opportunity. That grating WASP aura of entitlement he wore melted nearly instantly with a choice piece of hectoring about his paucity of energy. Pundits took so much pleasure in Jeb Bush's plummet that they couldn't imagine it could ever be reversed. With his few remaining breaths as a candidate, however, Bush may have a path out from his debacle, an actual shot at the nomination. For months, he tried and failed to crush Sen. Marco Rubio. But he wielded the hatchet like a man who would rather be sailing. What he needed was a wingman. Last night, Gov. Chris Christie, with his bully's instinct for weakness, baited the golden boy into choking--thereby, relieving Bush of all the throbbing pressure to stage a miraculous New Hampshire comeback. Nobody--not the media, not the GOP establishment--can now consider Rubio a fait accompli. Republicans can see the fear in Rubio's eyes, and it has panicked them, confirming all their nagging anxieties. There was a reason that the party has resisted its urge to fully rally around the perfect paper candidate. As Republicans scrounge for their center-right tribune, they will find themselves coming full circle. Christie has no cash and no organization beyond New Hampshire. Kasich is out-of-synch with his party; his moderation won't play outside a few suburban pockets. Which only leaves one. The Republican establishment was on the brink of immolating Bush for wasting its money and cutting such a pathetic figure. But donors will hold off cashiering Bush, even if he finishes in the middle of the New Hampshire pack. Unlike his center-right rivals, he has the war chest and organization to sustain a national campaign. And despite the base's apparently conflicted feelings about his family's dynasty, Bush is the best ideological fit for his party. He hasn't transgressed any of its core concerns, never flip-flopped on the social issue or deviated from its devotion to the free-market faith. Bush has bought himself more time, at precisely the moment that he's corrected his candidacy. Watching him in New Hampshire, it's possible to see a candidate who has stopped overthinking things, who has learned to be something resembling himself. This is supposedly the year of authenticity--every fourth year, as it turns out, the voters have a unique craving for authentic politicians. By the measure of this strange fixation, Bush may be the most authentic of the pack--patrician, goofy, a little flummoxed. Seeing Bush press his case on the trail in New Hampshire, I was stunned by how he seemed high-energy, forceful, and confident. For the first few months of the campaign, Jeb seemed to be reliving his father's political weaknesses. He lacked a common touch. Just as his father was a prudent Yankee pretending to be an ideological Texan, Jeb ran from his background. Or rather, he could never quite figure out how to navigate the burden of his family's name and his brother's presidency. Bush has now embraced the fact that he's a scion. Although he's kept his brother on the ranch, he brought his mother to the stump. In town hall meetings, he has begun to comfortably celebrate his brood. ""The Bush thing, people need to get over it,"" he told a crowd in Bedford, in an extended riff about his love for his family. Even the phrasing of that willful claim of indifference echoed one of his father's idiosyncratic rhetorical tropes (""the vision thing""). Like his dad and grandfather, his presentation oozes with a New England prep school sense of noblesse oblige, talk of ""servitude"" and ""purpose."" At the beginning of the campaign, Bush was pretzeled by questions about foreign policy. He couldn't decide if the Iraq War was the right call. James Baker was an advisor, and then he wasn't. But as his campaign hit bottom, he jettisoned all his reticence and has gone full hawk. He claims that it's unfair to lump him in as a member of the ""warmongering crowd,"" while calling for war with ISIS. It's true that he doesn't talk about carpet bombing. ""We don't need to carpet-bomb anymore. We have very good precision weapons,"" he likes to say. But on pretty much every issue, he's tracked the McCain-Graham line on foreign policy, so much so that Sen. Lindsey Graham endorsed him and reprised his old role as campaign sidekick. Strangely, it's Trump who has helped Bush find himself. When Trump started belittling him, Jeb reverted to Bush form. He couldn't understand how anyone could question his noble pursuit of public service. In the face of Trump's attacks, he looked hurt and stunned. But Bush has embraced Trump-bashing as a moral calling. He gets quite braggadocious when describing how he, and he alone, has the backbone to stand up to the bully. And his attacks on Trump do have a certain swagger now. ""I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but the guy needs therapy,"" he blared on Saturday. Thanks to Trump, Bush has a sense of mission. It's given him a psychic basis for believing in the moral purpose of his campaign, beyond a quixotic attempt to reclaim a family heirloom or to prove himself to his father. Judging from the chatter among reporters at the back of Jeb's events, the media wants nothing more than to proclaim his return from the dead. Against the odds, and despite his many months as a punch line, Bush has earned the right to rise. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	Is Jeb Bush Rising?

After finishing a close third in the Iowa caucuses, there are early indications that the Florida senator is gaining ground among GOP primary voters nationally. One survey, from Public Policy Polling, found that although Donald Trump still leads with the support of 25 percent of Republican voters, Rubio is now tied with Ted Cruz at 21 percent. Better still, PPP finds that it is Rubio who would benefit most if other candidates drop out. He leads in hypothetical head-to-head matchups with both Trump and Cruz, and he's also narrowly ahead in a three-way race. He's often accused of running a tightly scripted, ultra-cautious campaign, but it looks as though Rubio's strategy is being vindicated. Of course, polls are just snapshots, and there is no guarantee that Rubio won't stumble in the weeks and months to come. The New Hampshire primary is fraught with danger for Rubio, largely because Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and John Kasich are so desperate to do him harm. Right to Rise, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, has spent millions deriding him as an unprincipled political weather vane. Christie has been even more aggressive over the past few days, mocking Rubio as ""the boy in the bubble"" and portraying him as an extremist on abortion, previewing an attack that Democrats are certain to use if he emerges as the GOP nominee. Liberal commentators like Dana Milbank of the Washington Post have been no less disdainful, seeing Rubio's refusal to mix it up with Trump as a sign of cowardice rather than a marker of discipline and a desire to remain focused on his own more optimistic message. Are Rubio's critics right? Is he a chameleon, someone who will abandon his convictions in pursuit of his political ambitions? That's a bit harsh, but there's some truth to the notion that Rubio has a knack for being all things to all people. It's Rubio's chameleonlike nature that makes him the Republican candidate who's best positioned to win a general election and to meaningfully advance conservative objectives once in office. The irony is that it's also what makes Rubio so vulnerable in the Republican primaries. Rubio first emerged on the national scene in 2010 as the conservative challenger to Charlie Crist for a Florida Senate seat. Opposing a popular Republican governor was a bold move, and throughout his Senate campaign, Rubio took Crist to task for failing to adhere to conservative principles by, for example, embracing President Obama's fiscal stimulus law. Backed by the burgeoning Tea Party movement, many assumed that Rubio was a man of the hard right. But while other Tea Party conservatives were quick to condemn the president as an un-American socialist, Rubio took a gentler approach, as Mark Leibovich of the New York Times observed at the time. ""[F]or the most part,"" Leibovich wrote, ""Rubio's rhetoric is not harsh or personal against the president--less so than I would have expected given his firebrand following."" And when Leibovich asked him about his growing celebrity in conservative circles, Rubio demurred, explaining that he was ""not a fan of personality-based politics,"" which he found ""very third worldish."" Rubio told Leibovich that ""[p]eople who pin their trust and faith in a person are bound to be disappointed."" He referred to himself as ""just a messenger for a set of ideas."" What's so special about a Tea Party conservative defining himself as a messenger? To understand Rubio, one must appreciate that he sees himself not simply as an ideological vessel but as an evangelizer, a politician who wants to win converts to conservatism. In one of the more uplifting passages of the speech he delivered right after the Iowa caucuses, Rubio promised ""to take our message to the people who are struggling paycheck to paycheck [and] to the students living under the burden of student loan."" These are the very same voters who rejected Mitt Romney and John McCain in large numbers. Now, Rubio wants to enlist them in the conservative cause. This is by far the most compelling argument for the Rubio campaign--that unlike most of his rivals for the GOP nomination, he knows how to sell conservatism to nonconservatives. It doesn't hurt that Rubio is a convert himself, a liberal firebrand as a youth who once marched in union picket lines with his father. Quite unusually for a Republican presidential candidate, Rubio also cut his teeth in local politics in a lower-middle-class, overwhelmingly Latino suburb of one of America's biggest cities. Earlier in his career, Rubio contemplated running for mayor of Miami-Dade, a job that requires a deep understanding of nitty-gritty issues like how to pick up the trash and what to do about potholes. Urban politics are anti-ideological almost by nature, and the fact that Rubio had to win over voters in this context speaks well of his ability to square circles. While pushing his 100 Innovative Ideas initiative, a grab bag of proposals for improving Florida's government that he dreamed up while serving in the state Legislature, Rubio offered the following thoughts:"	The Tea Party Backed Marco Rubio.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/hillary_takes_on_bernie_s_worldview_at_the_pbs_debate.html	"It's taking time, but Hillary Clinton is inching toward a theme. ""I am not a single-issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country,"" she said at the close of the Democratic debate in Milwaukee. ""I think we have to overcome and break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers. That's what I want to take on."" Unlike so much of her rhetoric, which hedges and qualifies and tries to place policies in context, this was clear and full-throated. It matches Bernie Sanders' intensity without mimicking his message, and more importantly for Clinton and her backers, it stands as an anti-Sanders argument that could actually work. For the past month, Clinton has struggled to find a message against Sanders that doesn't alienate his backers or estrange her from the Democratic left. She tried to hit him on single-payer health insurance, calling it an attack on the Affordable Care Act. That failed. She tried to question his integrity on campaign donations. That failed. She slammed him as conservative on guns. That failed. Now, she says he's a weak ally of President Obama. It's still early, but if the pattern holds, that will fail too. The other choice, when you can't stop a rival, is to co-opt him. But there, Clinton is limited by her disposition and experience. She's an incrementalist with the ""battle scars"" from fights over health care and other Democratic priorities. And she spent the formative years of her political career at the center of national politics at the same time that Democrats were facing a powerful and advancing conservative movement. The result is that she's risk-averse, inclined to fight for small gains instead of big accomplishments. For incrementalists, there are no moral victories in politics, and you don't gain anything by losing big. You just lose energy and allies. That's probably why Clinton won't take the obvious route and endorse the ""public option"" in health care reform. Doing so would blunt Sanders' rhetoric on ""Medicare for all"" and show voters how Clinton would get to universal health coverage from the Affordable Care Act. But barring a Democratic Congress, the public option is dead on arrival. And Clinton isn't going to endorse something that doesn't have a chance. Here, in her closing statement, is the alternative to imitating Bernie or tweaking him on specifics, the latter of which she did for most of this debate. Rather than contest Sanders on policy or fealty to the Democratic mainstream, she directly addressed his worldview--not with an attack, but with a critique. Yes, she says, she agrees that there's too much money in politics and that Wall Street should be punished and controlled. But she also sees beyond these problems to other ills, and she believes they have to be addressed on their own terms. ""Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You're right,"" she said. ""But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay."" Clinton doesn't attack Sanders in those lines, but she's not subtle either. She paints the Vermont senator as too blinded by his focus to see or understand the unique problems faced by different minority and underprivileged groups, as evidenced by his clear discomfort with topics outside of income inequality. (You could call what Clinton is doing an ""intersectional critique,"" though her advisers would probably not use that term.). She zeroes in on Sanders' great strength--his incredible consistency--and makes it a liability. Whether this works is an open question. Clinton has her own, deep-seated problems that threaten her ability to win, from her history with Wall Street to her judgment on foreign policy to her ties to the worst policymaking of the Bill Clinton administration. But, after weeks of floundering against Sanders, there's a real chance she's found her footing. Which is to say that Hillary Clinton is visibly improving in the face of a vigorous challenge. If she wins the nomination, and captures the White House, there's a good chance she'll have Sanders to thank for making her fight for a win, instead of walking to the finish line.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/hillary_clinton_needs_a_positive_message_for_black_voters.html	"As soon as the polls closed in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton was aiming for the next two contests--Nevada and South Carolina. These are the ""firewalls,"" states where Team Clinton will--in its telling--stop the Bern before it runs too hot. ""We've built first-rate organizations in each state and we feel very good about our prospects for success,"" reads a memo from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that details a strategy focused on the March primaries, which--he writes--""better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation."" Nevada is next on the nomination calendar, but the Clinton campaign is downplaying its significance. ""It's still a state that is 80 percent white voters,"" said spokesman Brian Fallon to NBC's Chuck Todd, inflating the state's white electorate by 15 percentage points. "" ... There's a lot of reasons [Sanders] should do well."" Clinton's team is looking ahead to (and resting its future on) South Carolina. ""Without question, she'll be able to win South Carolina, with a broad base of support,"" said state House Minority Leader J. Todd Rutherford on a Wednesday conference call with reporters. As assertions go, this isn't outrageous. There are facts in her favor. She retains support from a bevy of black politicians, including the Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee, which gave its endorsement on Thursday, including a tough statement from Rep. John Lewis of Georgia. ""I never saw him,"" he said in a comment on Sen. Bernie Sanders' work in the civil rights movement decades ago. ""I never met him."" Clinton herself traveled to Flint, Michigan, to meet with families affected by the water crisis, and on Friday and Saturday, she (with Bill Clinton) will travel to South Carolina to campaign and meet with black leaders and black communities. Clinton's big advantage in South Carolina isn't just the number of black voters; it's the shape of the state's black electorate. Here black voters skew older. This isn't to say they're more conservative as much as it is to say they remember the Clinton administration and in particular the positive notes that tend to linger in memory. To these voters, ""Clinton"" stands for rising incomes, lower unemployment, and relative peace. Even with the tumult of the 2008 primary, Bill and Hillary Clinton's grasp of and respect for black culture still resonates. As for present politics, black voters in South Carolina--and black voters writ large--still back President Obama by huge numbers. Clinton's vocal allegiance to the president (as well as Sanders' criticism) will play an important part in setting the stage for voting. With this said, Sanders doesn't lack for advantages, too. His appeal to younger voters also extends--in more limited fashion--to young black voters (available polling shows an almost even split between Clinton and Sanders among young blacks). These young voters are also questioning Clinton's record, drawing from the policies of the 1990s to question her commitment to their issues and concerns. At one rally for Clinton at South Carolina State University, reports NPR, black students questioned campaign surrogate Angela Bassett on the 1994 crime bill and 1996 welfare reform, policies that fell hardest on black Americans. Indeed, on that score, Sanders is helped by backing from high-profile Clinton critics such as Michelle Alexander--who penned a strong brief against Hillary Clinton in the Nation, drawing from her work in The New Jim Crow--and Atlantic writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who says he plans to vote for Sanders, although he doesn't endorse the Vermont senator or identify as a ""supporter."" Sanders is also using his huge store of resources to hire staff, advertise, and leverage his massive New Hampshire win into a genuine upset in South Carolina. But more than backers or resources, Sanders has the advantage of a strong, clear, adaptable, and positive message. Yes, black voters like and admire Barack Obama, but that doesn't mean they aren't open to a different approach, nor does it mean they aren't dissatisfied with aspects of the Obama presidency. Even with the progress of the Obama administration, black Americans still face deep and entrenched unemployment, poverty, and incarceration. With a pitch that includes action on black youth unemployment, Sanders could make ground against Clinton. Clinton, in other words, shouldn't take her support for granted. If she wants to ensure a win, she also needs to bring a clear and positive message to the campaign. Which, in fact, is part of her broader problem. Instead of a singular message, Clinton brings a hodgepodge of appeals to different groups and interests in the Democratic Party. If this primary were a transactional fight between two establishment politicians, Clinton's approach would work. Instead, this is a struggle between a transactional politician and an inspirational one. Her interest-based approach--I will fight for you--doesn't work, and attacks on Sanders for his idealism fall short too. (Bashing Sanders as ""absent"" from the black community may fall short as well.) South Carolina, as such, is an opportunity for Clinton to recalibrate and try to appeal to the aspirational. This doesn't mean aping Sanders' rhetoric; it means forging a single frame for her policies, and emphasizing those--like universal child care--that speak to the core of her run for president. Sanders has changed the game, and now Clinton needs to play it. The good news for Clinton is she's already stepped in this direction. ""When people anywhere in America are held back by injustice, that demands action,"" she said at the end of her New Hampshire concession speech on Tuesday. ""That is why I believe so strongly that we have to keep up with every fiber of our being the argument for, the campaign for human rights. Human rights as women's rights, human rights as gay rights, human rights as worker rights, human rights as voting rights, human rights across the board for every single American. Now that is who I am. That is what I've always done."" Clinton, it seems, knows what she needs to do. Now, with nine days before the next contest, we'll see if she does it.

Part of this is a quirk of biography. Like a lot of native New Yorkers around my age, I find his outer-borough accent so comfortingly familiar that I can't help but smile whenever I hear his voice, even when he's saying something outrageously offensive. To a certain kind of smart, scrappy, lower-middle-class New York youth in the '80s and '90s, Trump was the living embodiment of gaudy success--a kind of mash-up of Santa Claus, Scrooge McDuck, and Vito Corleone. When I was a kid, it was not at all uncommon to hear friends and classmates declare that they wanted to be Donald Trump when they grew up. They didn't want to be real estate developers or casino magnates. They literally wanted to be Trump, which seems doubly strange in hindsight, as so few of the kids I have in mind were white. But nostalgia isn't the only reason I can't hate Trump. The deeper explanation for my ambivalence is that he is speaking for millions of Americans who've lost faith in the political process. Trump's victory in the New Hampshire GOP primary was broad and decisive. He fared well among Republican primary voters across the ideological, religious, and class spectrum. As Ron Brownstein has observed, however, ""[Trump's] appeal notably lagged among both evangelicals and better-educated Republicans."" Elsewhere, in an analysis of the Iowa counties in which the various Republican counties fared best, Patrick Ruffini found a striking contrast between the counties that went for Rubio and for Trump. While the counties that went for Rubio tended to have a higher number of households with incomes greater than $200,000, more new home construction, and more adults with post-graduate degrees, the counties that went for Trump tended to have higher rates of unemployment and a higher share of adults who identify as Scots-Irish, or simply as ""American."" This fits neatly with Nate Cohn's analysis of the Trump coalition, which he finds is concentrated in counties across the country with a low proportion of college-educated adults. Trump is strongest not in the metropolitan corners of America, where he's spent most of his life. Rather, his strongholds are the mostly overlooked sections of the South, Appalachia, and the rural and semi-rural North. Why is Trump doing so much better among non-college-educated, secular voters than among churchgoers and the college-educated? One possibility is that the Republicans who look to Rubio, Bush, and other mainstream candidates are broadly satisfied with the direction of American life. They're more likely to believe that their lives have been enriched by immigrant labor, and to feel more insulated from global economic competition. The religiously devout can be found in every social class, but those who are part of strong religious communities have a source of spiritual and emotional support that their secular counterparts often lack. Many have been struck by the overwhelming whiteness of Trump's campaign, not least the small number of self-identified ""white nationalists"" who've rallied around his campaign. I would argue that the Trump coalition illustrates how whiteness as a category is so expansive as to be almost meaningless. The Scots-Irish or ""American"" whites who see Trump as their champion are profoundly different from the metropolitan whites who dominate the upper echelons of U.S. society--so much so that the convention of lumping them together as ""white"" detracts far more from our understanding of how they fit into our society than it adds to it. J.D. Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy, a forthcoming book on the place of Appalachian whites in modern America, estimates that roughly one-quarter of whites belong to the Scots-Irish tribe that has embraced Trump. If we were to separate out these Americans as a race or ethnicity unto themselves, Vance writes, we would finds rates of poverty and substance abuse that would shock our national conscience. But we don't generally collect detailed statistics on the Scots-Irish. We don't have a clear sense of how their labor force participation or disability rates compare to those of other Americans, including other white Americans. And so their experiences and their collective traumas blend into whiteness, where they can be safely ignored. Whites are privileged, after all. None of this is to suggest that Donald Trump deserves the support of those who are putting so much faith in him. It's fair to question his judgment, his temperament, and his understanding of what an executive can and can't do in a constitutional republic. I certainly do. But there is a reason Trump's message is resonating with working-class white voters while the messages of other Republican candidates are not. His supporters believe that Trump will fight for them, and they have no such confidence in his GOP rivals. The voters flocking to Trump believe that they've been lied to and betrayed by conventional politicians, and that he is offering them the unvarnished truth. When Barack Obama first emerged on the political scene, he excited voters who saw in him a reflection of their own experiences. His mixed ancestry, his upbringing as the son of an intellectually curious and at times very poor single mother, and his experience of upward mobility through higher education--all of these experiences resonated with Americans who'd had similar journeys, and who felt validated by Obama's narrative. Trump and Obama are almost as different as one American can be from another. Nevertheless, Trump has built a gut-level connection that is no less formidable, and with an entirely different set of Americans. Obama famously swore off the conventional route to wealth and achievement, having chosen to work as a community organizer rather than climb the professional ranks. Trump would never have renounced earthly rewards in the same way. What Trump did was reject the upper-class culture of restraint. Whereas those who inherit great wealth typically shrink from proclaiming the bottomlessness of their appetites, Trump openly describes himself as ""a very greedy person."" That's something Mitt Romney, another product of privilege, would never say in a million years. Trump's avariciousness reads as authenticity, and so he's somehow more believable when he declares himself a convert to public-spiritedness, as when he insists that he wants to harness his greed for good--that he wants ""to be so greedy for our country,"" as he said at a presidential debate in January. Trump is a traitor to his class, who rails against hedge funders and the executives of drug companies for manipulating the political process to enrich themselves at the expense of ordinary Americans. These are the very same people you'd expect Trump to dine with at Mar-a-Lago, and here he is declaring war on them. The fact that his tax plan would ""be a huge windfall for private equity and hedge funds,"" in the words of Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, is almost immaterial to the people who support him. There is something strange and compelling about seeing a billionaire declare war on his own kind. Contrast Trump with the runner-up in the New Hampshire primary, John Kasich. Kasich has at least as much of a claim to speaking for the Scots-Irish whites who have been central to Trump's success. Though he's of eastern European descent, Kasich grew up in working-class western Pennsylvania, where he lived among the descendants of Appalachians who fled rural poverty for jobs in the region's booming industrial cities. Yet Kasich seems incapable of playing the role of class traitor. Before becoming governor of Ohio, Kasich had parlayed his political renown into a job as a managing director at Lehman Brothers, a storied bank that went down in flames when the 2008 financial crisis hit. Kasich is an admirable figure in many respects, and he's forgotten more about the workings of government than Donald Trump will ever know. Yet in the eyes of many Trump supporters, Kasich is the more compromised figure, as Trump has been quick to own up to his gleeful participation in political corruption. Imagine how dangerous Trump would be if he were more disciplined and focused, and if he had serious prescriptions for how to make the global economy work for Americans in the bottom two-thirds of the income distribution. For now, however, Trump is on a mission of destruction: He is demonstrating the weakness of the Republican donor class, which has barely dented him over months of campaigning, and he is forcing orthodox conservatives to question the agenda they've been advancing for decades as they see rank-and-file GOP voters reject it in large numbers. I hate Trump far less than I hate the Republicans who've paved his way. And if Trump goes down in flames, as I still believe he will, the Republican Party must never forget the Rust Belt Americans he's inspired--because if they do, there will be another Trump waiting in the wings."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/marco_rubio_shouldn_t_blame_chris_christie_for_his_new_hampshire_collapse.html	"Gov. Chris Christie, in his only significant contribution to the 2016 presidential race, thumped Sen. Marco Rubio in New Hampshire and significantly complicated his supposed glide path to the nomination. I personally consider this hilarious, but others disagree. There may well be a sense among Rubio well-wishers that Christie, having allegedly blown the 2012 election for Mitt Romney with his embrace of President Obama, has now blown the 2016 election by taking out the party's most electable candidate. Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer has called Christie's debate thrashing of Rubio a ""suicide attack"" that boxed Rubio out of New Hampshire. Indeed, the proper political term is ""murder-suicide,"" and Christie pulled it off magnificently. Give the man some credit--this was a feat. He took down Rubio, went nowhere himself, safeguarded Trump's lead, and allowed Gov. John Kasich, whose campaign doesn't seem structured to exist much longer, to take the coveted second-place finish. Was Christie a secret Democratic operative sent to complete an intricate sabotage mission? We've heard stranger. To say that Rubio is now finished! would be as foolish as saying he had the nomination in his back pocket following a third-place finish in Iowa. Rubio's admission Tuesday night that the loss was his fault--that he had a poor debate, and that it will never happen again--was an attempt to cordon off the defeat as an isolated event. Now that Christie is out of the race, it is true that a New Jersey governor will never demolish him in a debate again. But Rubio and his supporters who may despise Christie, or blame him for blowing the party's best hope for November, should treat what happened as a growing experience. Winning presidential nominations is not easy, and paths to the nomination rarely fall into one's lap. That it looked after Iowa that the nomination would fall into Rubio's lap should have been a telltale sign that the forces of cosmic balance were about to screw him. Sen. Ted Cruz's Iowa win didn't seem to be translating into a noticeable bounce; perhaps he was, despite his more ample resources, just another factional Iowa winner like Rick Santorum or Mike Huckabee who couldn't navigate his way to a majority. The theory that Donald Trump wouldn't be able to convert his polling support into hard votes also seemed to be playing out after Iowa. Meanwhile, late voters in Iowa broke for Rubio, and New Hampshire appeared to be following suit. Each were signs that ""the rules"" were reasserting themselves, and that the broadly acceptable candidate with the most endorsements from party officials would begin to ascend as voters got ""serious."" So much for that. The only part of this sunny theory that still holds up is that voters--at least the ones who would consider voting for someone like Rubio--are getting serious. And their serious determination is that Rubio needs a lot of work. If you can't handle one week with everyone punching at you, how are you going to handle, say, a general election? Christie helpfully reminded Rubio that he cannot dawdle around with third-place finishes and expect the party to naturally funnel his way in mid-March. He cannot begin ignoring his Republican rivals and training his eye on the general election yet. He still has to fend off Jeb Bush and Kasich on one side and Cruz on the other. He has to take more questions. He has to de-robotify his presentation, or at least tweak his internal programming to present a more relatable exterior to the humans he seeks to court. He has to expect that he will lose rather than win. One reason not to write off Rubio is that he has taken a pounding like this before and lived to tell about it. He was written off following his work on comprehensive immigration reform. Though it may not have been the most noble move to back away from the bill he co-authored, doing so allowed him to repair his relationship with conservatives to the point that he now enjoys strong favorability ratings and room to grow. If he could come back from that drawn-out episode, he can come back from this poor showing. But no one's going to hand him anything. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."

It feels awful--like there's more to come, and more to endure. That was the mood at Hillary Clinton's primary night ""party"" at Southern New Hampshire University on Tuesday, where a modest crowd of supporters gathered in the school's athletic complex to celebrate Clinton, even as she fell far short of Bernie Sanders in the state's primary. Clinton's supporters, who barely filled the room, cheered for the former secretary of state, her husband, and her daughter. But the excitement you see with a winning, confident campaign just wasn't there. What was there, on the other hand, was a kind of resolve, and a kind of hope. ""You know, I've been supporting Hillary for a long time--eight years ago, I was with her,"" said Mary Jane, an older woman from the area. ""And I know Hillary, and it's like she says. She's been knocked down, but she'll get up, and she'll keep fighting, and that's the way I feel too."" Another supporter, Connie, wasn't from New Hampshire--she flew down from Alaska to canvass for Clinton--but she was also sure Clinton would prevail. ""I think she's got the smarts, she's got the strength, she's got the experience, and she's who we need,"" she said. As for Bernie? ""He reminds me of when I was in college, from '69 to '72, and idealistic. I don't think Bernie ever lost that. But I think most of us have gone through life and figured out that we have to make lots of compromises and we have to find practical solutions."" This was the refrain from all the women I spoke to. Yes, Clinton took a knock. A hard one. But she would return to the ring and win, because she was the most qualified and most competent candidate in the race. The problem is that, for a critical number of Democrats--both in New Hampshire and throughout the country--this isn't what counts, or at least, it's not enough. They want Bernie's idealism, his integrity, and his urgency. For them, Clinton's experience doesn't make up for her incrementalism, her occasional eagerness for compromise, and her willingness to go with the political winds if that's what it takes to survive the storm. To these voters, she's an irreducibly flawed vessel for the party. Clinton, for her part, is doing what she can to speak to the distrust among younger voters. Not by condemning or condescending but by acknowledging her weakness and pledging to move forward. ""I know I have some work to do, particularly with young people,"" she said to an audience both disappointed in the results and thrilled to be in her presence. ""But I will repeat again what I have said this week: Even if they are not supporting me now, I support them. Because I know I've had a blessed life, but I also know what it's like to stumble and fall. And so many people across America know that feeling. And we've learned that it's not whether you get knocked down that matters, it's whether you get back up."" Tuesday's defeat was grim, but it is important to remember that Iowa and New Hampshire are not the Democratic Party. In particlar, the voters who backed Sanders are younger, whiter, and far more liberal than the typical Democrat. From now forward, the question of the Democratic primary is whether this cohort is a harbinger of a shift in the Democratic Party writ large, or if it's sui generis, the product of attitudes, experiences, and expectations that aren't shared among the rest of the party's voters. There are signs the latter is true. According to a January poll from ABC News and the Washington Post, 62 percent of nonwhite Democrats and 58 percent of Democrats over 50 say that Hillary Clinton would be most likely to bring change to Washington, D.C., and the nation at large. And this is important: In the next two contests--Nevada and South Carolina--black and Latino Democrats will hold huge sway over the outcomes. New Hampshire, in other words, is just the beginning. Sanders is a formidable candidate, but he has a new, even larger challenge than winning in the opening states of the Democratic primary. He has to expand his message to potentially skeptical groups with concerns that aren't always tied to economic inequality. And as for Hillary Clinton? She and her campaign are prepared for a long, hard slog. ""Here's what we're going to do,"" she said to her supporters, ""We're going to take this campaign to the entire country. We're going to fight for every vote, in every state. We're going to fight for real solutions that make a real difference in people's lives."" It's a subtle dig at Sanders--one based in her claim that she's a ""progressive who gets things done."" It landed with the crowd. But Clinton needs more than her crowd to win the nomination."

Speaking at Manchester's Verizon Wireless Arena, Donald Trump was wondering why Sen. Ted Cruz would not give a full-throated endorsement of waterboarding during Saturday's debate. A woman from the crowd offered an unsolicited but intriguing suggestion. ""She just said a terrible thing,"" Trump said. ""Shout it out, because I don't want to say it."" She did, but still not everyone could hear it. Trump giggled to himself in a ""Should we do this? Sure, let's do this"" sort of way. ""You're not allowed to say it, and I never expect to hear that from you again,"" he said in his faux-admonishing tone. ""She said, 'He's a pussy.' "" Sen. John McCain won the 2008 New Hampshire primary by essentially living in the state and doing town hall after town hall after town hall, well after people had given up on him. Mitt Romney won in 2012 by literally living in both New Hampshire and the adjacent state to which many southern New Hampshirites commute. Trump is expected to win in 2016 by ditching the state's retail politics in favor of large, vulgar, off-the-cuff rallies during which, we now know, he may well call a rival a ""pussy."" Toast yourselves, Granite State. It was the climax of a celebratory evening with fans who are unlike the New Hampshire primary voters of legend. If you visit another Republican candidate's event, you're likely to find loads of undecided voters still ""shopping around"" before making a final decision. Trump's voters, meanwhile, are already committed to Trump. Randy Miller of Manchester, for example, didn't really consider any other candidate, because no other top-tier candidate has the specific set of traits that drew him to the real estate mogul. ""I like that he's not a politician,"" Miller said. ""I like that he's a businessman. I feel like the country right now has a lot of debt, I feel like the U.S. government's the biggest business in the world, and Trump's a good businessman--he's proven that time and time again."" Trump did not get into many specifics about his plan to restructure the United States' sovereign debt. But he did offer a couple of suggestions that reinforce why he's so unconventionally popular, by touching on issues that elite Republican presidential candidates tend to ignore. Take the high cost of prescription drugs, something that everyone obviously hates but that Republican elites rarely emphasize. Trump spoke at length about how he would use the federal government's negotiating power to drive down the cost of drugs--something you'll hear quite often during Democratic primaries but less so during Republican ones. Trump mentioned a ""really great doctor"" he was speaking with recently who said--translated into Trumpspeak--""You know, with the medical and with the drugs, the United States, the largest purchaser, they don't negotiate price."" Trump told this truly terrific doctor, ""You have to be kidding,"" and the doctor said, ""I don't know why."" Well, Trump knows. ""Because the drug companies have an unbelievable lobby. These guys that run for office that are on my left and right, they're all taken care of by the drug companies. And they're not going to put out competitive bidding."" This is just an incredibly popular thing to say that has the added benefit of not being untrue. Trump doesn't care about how a proposal to use the federal government to squeeze private industry might cause concern with movement conservatives. It's something that working-class Republican voters who don't think in ideological abstractions like, and it fits neatly within Trump's ""dealmaker"" brand. Trump also went on to say that the reason he gets booed at debates is because establishment donors to the other candidates get all the tickets and pack the audience. Maybe. It's also worth noting that Trump, in a week's time, has gone from saying that second place in Iowa was an acceptable result, to questioning the results, to now flat-out saying, ""I did win Iowa."" His theory is that he had more votes ""when you add in the Carson votes,"" a statement that makes no sense but for which he was cheered anyway. He's learned to play the stupid but necessary ""expectations game,"" too, and now says that it ""doesn't matter"" whether he wins New Hampshire or not. Of course, it does, as he knows. Blowing Iowa and then blowing New Hampshire would send a strong signal that Trump is blowing--or already has blown--his campaign for president. But Trump on Monday excised the usual segment of his program where he brags about poll results for several minutes. Instead, he just celebrated what he had built, brought his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka onstage to say a few words, and offered an endearingly macabre pep talk for supporters on a snowy night with slippery roads. ""I don't really care if you get hurt or not, but I want you to last until tomorrow,"" he told everyone. ""If you're going to get hurt and you're going to drive like a maniac, do it tomorrow after you vote. And I promise I will come and visit you in the hospital."""

Marco Rubio's short circuiting on the Saturday before New Hampshire's primary has given a renewed glimmer of hope to those candidates who've staked their entire bids on doing well in the nation's first primary on Tuesday. Even at this late date the state's many center-right voters remain unbound. Republican Party operatives, looking toward potential general-election matchups, had hoped those voters would have flocked to Rubio en masse by now, but no dice. If Gov. Chris Christie or Gov. John Kasich is to survive beyond New Hampshire, they'll need as many of those votes as they can get. And both men are hustling very hard to get them. ""I don't know what I'm doing yet, I can't believe it,"" said Ann Tosca of Hudson before attending a town hall with Christie in Hudson on Monday. ""I always know what I'm doing, and I like the rallying. I've never not known this [close to the vote]."" Tosca saw Rubio on Sunday but is still considering Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. In fact, she was ""all set for Rubio"" as the weekend started, but by Sunday night had changed her mind and now thinks she's ""headed for Christie."" It was Rubio's debate performance that unsettled her, and all she wanted to hear from Christie before committing to him was a promise that he wouldn't take away her Social Security. Mark Wymmer of Windham, who's between Bush and Carly Fiorina but came out to see Christie anyway, also isn't sold on the establishment's dreamboat. ""[Rubio]'s a fine candidate, but he's just too junior,"" Wymmer said. ""I think if he comes around next time, in the next election, I might take a better look at him. But I think he's way too junior right now."" ""We had Obama, and [Rubio]'s another 'yes we can' sort of thing,"" said Dennis Butterfield, also of Windham, who came to see Gov. John Kasich's 105th New Hampshire town hall Monday at Windham's Searles Chapel. ""So many of them are saying, 'yes we can,' just like Obama, and I'm not buying it."" The suspicion that Rubio may be a lightweight is one that Christie, especially, enjoys fanning. He fanned it all last week, calling Rubio the ""boy in the bubble."" He fanned it during Saturday night's debate, with great success. And now he definitely won't stop fanning it in ""the final 34 hours,"" as he said at his first Monday morning town hall. Christie told all the undecided voters in attendance how grateful he was that so many of them waited until Saturday night before making up their minds. ""I think you saw Saturday night that when the lights get really bright,"" Christie said, ""and they were really bright Saturday night--13 and a half million people watching on television, big crowd in that assembly room, and the media of the United States all watching--you either shine, or you melt. We cannot afford to have a president who melts."" Christie and Kasich have run similarly resource-constrained campaigns. The strategy is to just do as many town halls as possible in New Hampshire and hope that the rewards eventually come, as they did for Sen. John McCain in 2008. For either of them, those rewards would likely have to come as a second- or maybe third-place finish to justify their airfare to South Carolina for next week's primary. (There's also plenty of pressure on Jeb Bush, but he seems determined to march onto South Carolina no matter what, brother in tow.) Kasich and Christie even share a similar ""brand,"" as the straight-shooting experienced governors who will take a billion of your questions to show off all their masterful skills and unrivaled, hard-earned knowledge of how things work. But they're not entirely similar. Each likes to interact and joke with their audiences, though Christie's ""joking"" famously veers towards a strain of Jerseyan ball-breaking. It either works for you or it doesn't; some find it entertaining in the moment but aren't prepared to commit to this sort of character as their national executive for an extended period of time. There's also the sense that Christie, though presenting himself as authenticity manifest, is almost performing a highly workshopped version of the character ""Chris Christie."" He knows you're coming to see the Chris Christie Authenticity Show, and he's prepared his mannerisms and body language accordingly, which doesn't end up reading as so authentic. Kasich really is unrehearsed. He just grabs the microphone and tells a story about a store or a car he saw on the way over, and how that reminded him of one time when he was in grade school or whatever, and then he recognizes that he has gotten sidetracked and tells people to raise their hands for questions. He dispatches with questions quickly. He doesn't use them as jumping-off points for one of his prepared ""riffs,"" as Christie does, and he's not afraid to tell people that their beloved reforms aren't politically possible. When someone in Windham on Monday asked him whether he would impose term limits on Congress, for example--something most presidential candidates usually respond to with a passionately affirmative response--Kasich said, ""if you think Congress is going to pass [term limits for itself], you and I are gonna walk out this door and we are going to flap our arms and we are going to fly all the way to Boston, OK? It ain't gonna happen."" Kasich is doing reasonably well in New Hampshire. But will it be enough? There's an impression out there of Kasich as the race's Squishy Moderate that he needs to dispatch, even in moderate-friendly New Hampshire. One woman, for example, told him that though he ""seem[s] to be really nice,"" how would he beat Hillary? ""When the fists start flying, you need someone who's going to get a little ... dirty."" ""A little dirty, huh?"" Kasich said, to laughs. ""Let's think about that for a while."" He added, several times for emphasis, that he's ""a nice guy, but you don't want to mess with me."" Kasich conceded that he gets ""criticized"" for the squish reputation, because he really does believe that bipartisanship is the only means of solving big problems even if his credentials are legitimately conservative. That shockingly moderate understanding of ... how the U.S. political system is designed, really ... has apparently given some people the completely wrong impression of his political beliefs. One younger woman at the town hall told the candidate that she is choosing between him, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders. ""So my question,"" she said, ""is why should I vote for you in the Democratic primary?"" Christie and Kasich are trying to win New Hampshire votes one-by-one, whereas Rubio has spent considerably less time here and doesn't revel in the joy of hourlong question-and-answer periods. They're keeping tabs, too. Kasich told the woman who thought he was a Democrat that she should call him and tell him how she voted after the primary. ""If you don't vote for me,"" he quickly corrected himself, ""maybe you shouldn't call. I might cry."" Christie, who has more ground to make up, did win a couple of votes during Monday morning's program. One of them was, in the end, Ann Tosca, who had the opportunity to ask Christie her question about Social Security and found his answer satisfactory--even though Christie's plan involves both raising the retirement age and means-testing benefits. He won her vote the old-fashioned way: by getting on one knee in front of where she was seated to answer her. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/how_ted_cruz_turned_naked_careerism_into_a_winning_campaign_strategy.html	"SALEM, New Hampshire--The essence of Ted Cruz can be found in his tennis game. To put it mildly, he isn't a natural, except at firing shots into the fence surrounding the court. He came to the sport late in life--and only then with a very specific goal in mind. As he prepared to clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, he studied the ways he could get on his boss' good side. He understood that he would only get close to the chief if he shared his passion for tennis. So in the months before his clerkship, Cruz paid for lessons that he hoped would make him a passable doubles partner, a perpetual necessity for Rehnquist. By all accounts, you would rather have Cruz on the opposite side of the court, a fact that quickly dawned on Rehnquist. ""Ted,"" he would scold, "" you do know the point of the game is to win, don't you?"" We have a name for this sort of behavior--it's called careerism. And it's the reason that so many people in Washington despise Ted Cruz. He is always angling for the next thing, methodically seeking out patrons and nakedly pandering to them. Ted Cruz's careerism was so heavy-handed that it often failed. His campaign to win a top job in the George W. Bush administration notoriously backfired, despite his constantly volunteering to prep the candidate for debates and his ferocious service to the Florida recount legal brigade. Instead of a job, he earned mockery. Bush liked to call him ""Theodore,"" not his proper name and a moniker that Cruz despised. According to Politico, Bush has told donors, ""I just don't like the guy."" Such rank careerism doesn't make for a particularly good presidential candidate. But it does make for a good presidential campaign. Let's set aside the unctuousness of Ted Cruz for a moment, to marvel at his tactical genius. If Ted Cruz persists in this race, it won't be because of his personality. It will be because his careerism has trained him to strategize brilliantly. Careerists quickly identify who will help advance their interests, then assiduously attempt to win these people over, without regard to how others perceive their efforts. They have an ability to visualize how systems work; they can see the levers and gears of power that are either invisible or uninteresting to the rest of us. You can see this gift in Cruz's ground game. His campaign has mastered the art of microtargeting. Though he poses as an ideologue, Cruz thinks about the electorate as a series of distinct piles of votes, each of which can be won over with carefully tested rhetorical pandering and narrowly tailored outreach. Of course, every campaign does its share of microtargeting--well, maybe not Trump's, which doesn't believe in spending on campaign infrastructure. But few have leaned on the tactic as heavily and aggressively as Cruz's. This reliance was evident at a rally here. Everyone knows about Cruz's following among evangelicals, a natural base for the son of a preacher. That's why it was so bracing to witness the preamble for this event. Like all Republican rallies, it began with the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. But the woman who stood up to deliver the incantation was not the person you'd expect. She described herself to the crowd as an agnostic. ""I have a lesbian friend in Kentucky,"" she added. It was just the beginning of a not-so-subtle effort to play to the secular wing of hardcore conservatism, a fairly robust group in New Hampshire. There's another way to describe this coterie of godless wingnuts--they were Ron Paul voters, now in play after Rand Paul's exit from the race last week. The Cruz event continued with a video montage of Ron Paul supporters testifying to the sanctity of the Constitution and the virtues of the liberty movement. It seemed an aimless series of homage to a retired politician, until the voters gushingly announced that they saw Cruz as Paul's natural heir. After the video, one of Paul's supporters, a buff dude with a hip-length braided ponytail, stood up and announced his conversion to Cruz. Like everything about Cruz, this effort has its share of chutzpah. He's wrapped himself in Paul's mantle, even as Paul has denounced him as ""owned by Goldman Sachs."" Bloomberg Politics' Sasha Issenberg has done a terrific job reporting on Cruz's microtargeting efforts. The campaign has invested in psychographic research and polling that parses the electorate into the most fractional components. Cruz, for instance, discovered that there were 60 caucusgoers in Iowa whose votes could be swayed by their hostility to the state's ban on fireworks. With this research in hand, he staked out a bold position on fireworks deregulation and used phone banks and social media to make sure those 60 voters knew it. Cruz is building a campaign to win by the thinnest of margins. His analysts model the precise number of votes that he needs to eke out victory, then set about devising a narrow strategy that will allow him to grind to that number. Cruz's campaign likes to boast about the cleverness behind his ascent, giving reporters ample access to interviews with its data scientists and analytics mavens. And in Cruz's case, even this bragging is good politics. Hardly anybody, probably not even Cruz himself, believes that he can win on the basis of his persona. Potential Cruz voters need some reason to believe that they are backing someone who is more than a protest candidate. His tactical genius--based on a sheaf of psychographic data and a taste for vulgar pandering--becomes a reason to believe that he can advance in the contest. So Cruz manages to advance despite being the guy who works on his forehand for the sake of face time with the boss. There's a pretty clear limit to Cruz's approach, however. At some point, as the contest becomes less crowded, he'll need to win tallies of votes that exceed the capacity of microtargeting and coalition-cobbling. His careerism, his scorched-earth path to self-glory, will likely fail, as it did with his effort to get a sweet post in the Bush administration. Still, Cruz will fail with a certain genius that deserves our disdain, and grudging admiration."	How Ted Cruz Turned Naked Careerism Into a Winning Campaign Strategy	['Paul', 'Cruz']	[]
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/02/bernie_sanders_grassroots_revolution_isn_t_interested_in_barack_obama_s.html	"The students of Concord High School had just finished a week of exams but remained in school for an afternoon assembly. The New Hampshire school's guest speaker was 74-year-old Sen. Bernie Sanders. Rather than groaning about having to stick around for another couple of hours, though, the students were elated. ""It's so funny, we've been bringing some candidates in throughout the year, and everyone's really excited and been asking good questions and having a great time,"" said Chrigus Boezeman, a social studies teacher doubling effectively as Sanders' hype man on this Friday in January, a few weeks before the New Hampshire primary. ""And everyone's saying to me, 'Mr. Boezeman, gosh, it's really great that you're having all of these candidates come in. But ... do you think Mr. Sanders can come in?' "" The students, who were about to get the candidate they'd wanted to see for months, whooped with approval, breaking out into periodic chants of ""BER-NIE, BER-NIE!"" while they waited. A high school student body is never the most voter-rich crowd to address on a cramped two-day swing through a crucial primary state. But for Sanders, whose campaign message rests on expanding voters' realm of the possible in an age of frustratingly static politics, the opportunity to mold impressionable young minds was too good to pass up. These are the same sort of minds that then-Sen. Barack Obama, the last candidate to successfully inspire voters to look beyond the stale politics of the day and imagine something better, captivated in 2008. ""People sometimes think, and the media picks up on this: Well, Washington's very bitter, very dysfunctional, and the reason is Democrats and Republicans can't get along,"" Sanders told the assembled students. ""That is not the issue at all."" ""It's not a question of personalities,"" he continued. ""It is a question of philosophy. Some of my colleagues believe that we should cut, or end, Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. That government should not be involved in those areas. That, essentially, as a nation, we are out there on our own. Others believe that as American citizens that we are entitled to rights."" He mentioned, as just one example, ""the right of Colleen""--a Concord High School student who had told Sanders that she's facing the prospect of $80,000 in college debt even though she has ""never gotten a B in [her] life""--""and millions of other young people to get a college education if they have the ability to do so, regardless of the income of their family."" Or the right to have health care ""because they are human beings."" The students met this with rapturous applause. But how would he, as another student went on to ask him, ""compromise with the Republicans in the Congress to make those things happen?"" Sanders first mentioned the list of bills he has worked with Republicans to pass, namely the Veterans Affairs reform bill he successfully marshaled through Congress alongside Sen. John McCain. He ticked off these accomplishments in a flat, perfunctory manner--the practical items his advisers insist he list before returning to the theoretical battlefield he prefers. ""But there is a more important question,"" he continued, ""and that is that the Congress must begin to do the work that the American middle class and working families want them to do, rather than just do the bidding of wealthy campaign contributors."" Sanders is aware of the impracticability of his policy platform in today's political environment. ""If I am sitting down negotiating with, say, the speaker of the House, a Republican,"" he gave as an example, ""and 80 percent of young people don't vote, and 50 or 60 percent of the American people don't vote, and I say, 'You know what? I think we should make public colleges and universities tuition free, and I think we should pay for that based on a tax on Wall Street speculation,' he will look me in the eye and say, 'Are you kidding? Not in a million years.' "" Like Sen. Barack Obama--the ""change"" candidate who preceded him--Sanders is riding a wave of energy among young people. Sanders holds a national 2-to-1 advantage against Hillary Clinton in support among voters under 45 years old, according to a New York Times/CBS poll in January, and he won voters age 17 to 29 by 70 percentage points in the Iowa caucuses. Like Obama, he's soared not just by virtue of his specific policy proposals, but also by offering a theory for how to bust through the fundamental problem: the seemingly intractable gridlock of a broken political system that, when it does work, only works on behalf of the wealthy. And like Obama, Sanders' rival is Clinton, a scarred veteran who takes politics-as-trench-warfare as a given and considers candidacies that promise to shift politics toward a sunnier, post-polarization paradigm to be fundamentally naive. ""But if, on that very day, as an example,"" he continued, ""a million young people march in on Washington to say exactly what Colleen said a few moments ago, that all of our young people who have the ability deserve to get a college education regardless of the income of their families, suddenly, that gentleman will look out the window and say, 'Well, Mr. President, let's sit down and talk about how we can address this serious problem.' "" Sanders, who on the trail is far more savvy than his caricature as a blunt, screeching old leftist, picked the right issue from his platform to connect with high school students. They cheered. But Bernie Sanders is not Barack Obama. Sanders' theory for fixing the broken political system is post-Obama, taking into consideration Obama's failure while posing a new answer. Sanders doesn't talk about bringing the two sides together through the sheer force of his fetching personality. He doesn't really speak of Democrats and Republicans as the two sides. He campaigns on a promise to turn the whole thing upside down, to create a grassroots ""political revolution"" that will give him the mandate to bring working- and middle-class people together to overwhelm the ""billionaire class"" into submission. He doesn't want to heal, he wants to upend--and his voters, even after witnessing all of Obama's failures to bring the country together in his own way, love Bernie for it. * * * Obama's theory of change in 2008 was not as ludicrous at the time as it seems in retrospect. But it did fail. The junior senator from Illinois blamed much of the dysfunction that materialized under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush on a partisan ""bickering"" that had taken on a life of its own, to everyone's detriment. ""We have come to be consumed by a 24-hour, slash-and-burn, negative-ad, bickering, small-minded politics that does not move us forward,"" he said in late December 2006, shortly before announcing his candidacy. ""Sometimes one side is up and the other side is down. But there's no sense that they are coming together in a common-sense, practical, non-ideological way to solve the problems that we face."" The solution to that, as his campaign message of ""hope and change"" over the next two years implied, was the election of Barack Obama: a post-partisan figure who would empathetically and judiciously take into consideration all points of view to determine a way of moving forward on which all sides could agree. His election would signal to entrenched partisan actors that playtime was over. ""I want us to rediscover our bonds to each other and to get out of this constant petty bickering that's come to characterize our politics,"" he said in a characteristic interview with Rolling Stone in mid-2008. There was reason to believe in 2008 that on policy grounds, political differences were relatively bridgeable, and a compelling figure like Obama could get Democrats and Republicans in a room to ice the deal. Both President George W. Bush and Obama's Republican general election opponent, Sen. John McCain, by then accepted the science of anthropogenic climate change and supported plans to combat it--McCain perhaps a bit more seriously than Bush. Both Democrats and Republicans were warming to tackling universal health care reform for the first time since President Bill Clinton's first term. Both McCain and Obama stated their desire to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, something that even the Bush administration had considered near its end before leaving it to its successor. When President Obama took office, he made the overtures. During his first major legislative effort as president, the ""stimulus,"" he visited Capitol Hill to meet privately with House Republicans, where he offered to throw more tax cuts into the package to secure their votes. He tasked a bipartisan gang of senators, whose Republican members at first seemed willing partners, with drafting compromise health care reform legislation. He did the same on climate change legislation. What Obama underestimated was how viciously the GOP would snap from a governing party to an opposition party. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell instructed his body to use the filibuster to block as many of Obama's major legislative gains as possible--and, once Democrats secured 60 votes in the Senate, to keep Republican ""fingerprints"" off of whatever knotty legislating the supermajority worked toward. Though Obama offered the stimulus with more tax cuts than Democrats advised, and approached both health care and climate change legislation from centrist, market-oriented perspectives, congressional Republicans refused to bite. When voters rewarded Republicans in the 2010 congressional elections with a landslide--in no small part due to the fact that the disaffected young voters in Obama's coalition didn't turn out to vote--that was the whole ball game. ""Bickering"" won. Since the 2010 elections, it's required a Herculean effort simply to keep the government open, let alone move any significant bipartisan reform legislation. Among the 11th-hour tax and spending deals that the Obama administration has gone on to make with the Republicans, and which few people on either side really seem to like, was a 2010 lame-duck session deal that temporarily extended tax breaks for the rich. The agreement reauthorized the 2001 Bush marginal tax cuts for the top two income brackets while raising the estate tax exemption to a historically high $5 million. Liberals were furious at the Obama administration for welching on one of the president's top campaign promises: letting the 10-year, budget-busting Bush tax cuts for the wealthy sunset on schedule. Sanders, then still in his first term, took to the Senate floor to lambast the agreement for more than 81/2 hours. ""The Speech,"" as it would come to be known (and published as a stand-alone book under that title), went beyond the mere exercise of calling out President Obama for selling out liberals. Sanders conceded that ""maybe"" Obama was right when he argued that this was the best deal that he could have struck with the Republicans. And that was the problem: that this was the best anyone could hope for in a fundamentally corrupted political process that exists to serve the wealthy and powerful interests. It was the process that needed to be changed, then, and it needed to be done from the bottom up--not by simply installing a new figure atop the system, who would be constricted in the same way, serving the same set of interests. ""It is important to put the agreement the president struck with Republicans in a broader context,"" he said. ""We can't just look at the agreement unto itself. We have to look at it within the context of what is going on in the country today, both economically and politically. I think I speak for millions of Americans: There is a war going on in this country. ""I am talking about a war being waged by some of the wealthiest and most powerful people against working families, against the disappearing and shrinking middle class of our country,"" he continued. ""The billionaires of America are on the warpath. They want more and more and more."" He described the government's inability to serve the interest of broad swaths of the country on a far deeper level than Democratic and Republican legislators consuming themselves with partisan ""bickering."" He didn't really concern himself with partisanship much at all--as an independent senator who caucused with Democrats might not. He reoriented the battlefield from one that was left versus right to one that was the wealthy versus the working and middle classes. Like Obama, he imagined there was a large, cross-partisan consensus for certain changes; unlike Obama, he portrayed the obstacle to realizing this consensus as not lawmakers' own petty gamesmanship, but as an aggressive ""billionaire class"" waging warfare from the top down. * * * Most Democratic and Republican political operatives consider Sanders an unelectable gadfly who would hand the White House to Republicans if he were the Democratic nominee for president. But there is one classic campaigners' trait that the professionals admire, to the point of wonder, in Sanders: his ability to stay ""on message."" Sanders' campaign message is nearly identical to the message he explained at length in his 2010 speech--except now he has even more eye-popping income inequality and campaign finance statistics to work with. The way he frames his candidacy now, in a way that is intended to differentiate himself from Clinton, is as a break from the ""establishment politics and establishment economics"" that are no match for the ""crisis"" facing the country. ""I'm running for president of the United States not because I think my Democratic opponents are terrible human beings--that they're not smart or they're not concerned,"" he said at the beginning of a speech before college students at South New Hampshire University on Jan. 21. ""I'm running for president because I think it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics."" By establishment politics, he means the practice of electing representatives to the White House or Congress who, no matter how personally talented they are, become overwhelmed by the strength of existing, wealthy special interests. In other words, a political system that expects change to occur from the top down. By establishment economics, he means a consensus that relies too much on outsourcing economic prerogatives to the private sector without maximizing the strength of the federal government to arrive at a more just distribution of wealth. The political fix, per Sanders' thinking, gives way to the economic fix. Chief on that list of political fixes is reining in a campaign finance system run amok following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010. ""Do you know who the Koch brothers are, guys?"" Sanders, playing professor again at SNHU, asked the youthful crowd. ""The Koch brothers are the second wealthiest family in America ... they are an extreme right-wing family that wants to not cut Social Security--they want to end Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. They want to abolish the concept of the minimum wage. They want to end all campaign finance regulations so billionaires can give money directly to candidates, making them their own employees. ""Do you think you beat them just by electing a president?"" he continued. ""We need a mass movement of people who stand up and fight back, and that's what this campaign is about."" According to Bernie, if you weaken the grip that the ""billionaire class"" holds on presidential and congressional candidates, and if ordinary people both show up to vote and advocate tirelessly for their beliefs, then that's how you break the stalemate in Washington. There isn't much space in this pitch for the usual fare about ushering congressional Republicans and Democrats into a room to ""roll up their sleeves"" and hash out a deal. Once the political terrain is shifted, these actors will necessarily find themselves in the room rushing to work on the people's behalf, so magnificent will be the working- and middle-class pressure on them to act. Sanders' theory implies that once the masses have banded together to overpower the political prowess of billionaires, corporate interests, and ""establishment economics,"" what they will demand is a series of leftist reforms like single-payer health care, free public higher education, a federally mandated living wage, breaking up the too-big-to-fail banks, and a shift away from a hydrocarbon-based energy system. But it does not entertain the idea that once the palace has been raided and billionaires are sent fleeing, a significant chunk of working and middle-class people might still disagree with his policy proposals. ""We know what has to be done [on climate change], and now's the time to do it,"" he said at SNHU in response, sort of, to a question about the gas leak at the Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility in California. ""We have got to break our dependency on fossil fuels."" In an effort to ""connect the dots,"" he asked the crowd how the ""corrupt campaign finance system"" relates to the lack of action of climate change, or the refusal to turn away from fossil fuels. ""A lot of the Republican candidates are funded by the oil industry?"" someone offered. ""Exactly,"" Sanders said approvingly. ""It's not very hard to understand."" The campaign donations don't hurt. But is it the whole story? People--yes, including many working and middle-class people--enjoy cheap fossil fuels, even if they're aware that it's poor for the environment. And the oil and gas industry is a major employer: Consider the 2.7 percent unemployment rate for December in North Dakota, the postcard state for the fracking boom. If congressmen or senators representing North Dakota--or any of the other states enjoying great wealth from the presence of oil, gas, or other fossil fuels under their feet--are looking at a bill to move away from those sources of energy, their opposition isn't entirely the product of a peek at their campaign coffers. It's about maintaining and creating working and middle-class jobs for the people they represent, however myopically. For all the control that billionaires and corporate special interests do exert on the political system, the largest special interest is still millions and millions of people who like the securities that they do have and reject the root-and-branch changes a candidate like Sanders proposes. As Obama's example has shown, a candidate can promise systemic change, but if the theory for achieving it isn't airtight--and it rarely is--the disappointment of unmet expectations can be crushing to those who allow themselves to be captivated. That appeal to caution and realism is even more central to Sanders' chief Democratic rival now than it was Obama's chief Democratic rival in 2008. Hillary Clinton has limited patience for opponents who speak in terms of political sea changes. She would have hoped that Obama's inability to bring about a paradigm shift away from gridlocked politics would resign voters to a candidate who's only ever promised the grind. But here we are again. Clinton accepts straightforwardly that the battle in the country is between Democrats and Republicans who believe in different things. There is no realignment coming. You cannot disappear powerful special interests, but you can manage them. The important thing is to elect a Democrat--namely, Clinton. Sanders spends little time talking about Democrats, Republicans, or even himself. He speaks in broad, start-from-scratch terms about, say, ""creating an economy"" that works better than the current one. Clinton speaks of building on what's already been built over the past seven years and keeping the White House out of Republicans' hands. Sanders' economic history of the last 25 years is simple and straightforward: The rich and powerful have gotten richer and more powerful at the expense of everyone else. Clinton's pitch is that the economy has either been good or bad depending on which party was in control of the presidency. ""[Bill Clinton] inherited a recession,"" Clinton said at a Jan. 22 town hall in Manchester, New Hampshire, to a standing-room crowd. ""He inherited a quadrupling of our debt in the prior 12 years. ... At the end of eight years, we had 23 million new jobs, but most importantly, incomes went up for everybody."" ""Well, unfortunately, along came George W. Bush,"" she continued. Boo! ""We had a balanced budget and a surplus. We had an economy that had created rising incomes. And they want back to the same old stuff: cut taxes on the wealthy, get out of the way of corporations ... and you know what happened: the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression."" Obama had ""done nothing to create the mess he inherited, but it was up to him to fix it,"" she said. ""And I don't think he gets the credit he deserves."" Obama himself, who once envisioned entering the presidency with a mandate for broad change that would translate into a ""big bang"" of bipartisan legislation on health care, climate change, and financial reform, appears to have gravitated to Clinton's view of eternal partisan struggle. ""The truth is,"" Obama told Politico in a recent interview, ""in 2007 and 2008, sometimes my supporters and my staff, I think, got too huffy about what were legitimate questions she was raising"" about his vision. Obama used to mock what he perceived to be the Clintonian focus on small-ball measures like school uniforms after their own top legislative items were stymied in 1994. Now he'd be lucky to move forward on something anywhere near as sweeping and comprehensive. * * * Bernie Sanders abhors those who look at politics as ""stagnant."" ""There was once a time not so many years ago,"" he told the students of Concord High School, ""where people felt that someone, because the color of their skin was different than mine, that person should not have the right to vote. ... It took a very, very long time, and a whole lot of people to say, 'That is wrong.' It took a change of consciousness."" ""So the first point I want to make to you,"" Sanders leaned in, ""and I want you to be thinking about it, is: How does change come?"" What powers Sanders and his campaign, even after Obama's failure to move the country to a sounder political system, is a sense that what's happening now is untenable. Both in terms of an economy killing all but the rich, and a political system of such dysfunction that its constitutional design has been called into review. If there is a bipartisan strand of thinking that's caught fire this cycle, it's the idea that promises of bipartisan cooperation from the top down are the most unrealistic promises of all. Though the two parties are so gapingly far apart on policy that they're not even addressing the same policy questions--one party feels that climate change is the greatest threat to world peace and security today, for example; the other is either agnostic or outright hostile to its very existence--their most surprisingly successful candidates are addressing the same structural question of tenability. Sen. Ted Cruz offers a near mirror image of Sanders' theory of change, promising to bludgeon the establishment ""Washington cartel"" into submission by appealing to the vast grassroots movement he's sought to build. Donald Trump speaks of ""dealmaking,"" but his vision has less to do with ushering bipartisan cooperation than with him wielding his own personal strength against the ""losers"" who oversee the current, broken system. Pundits, operatives, and other in-the-know types expected more prosaic candidates like Clinton and Jeb Bush to coast to their respective nominations as voters, having witnessed what awaits a president-elect who promised an epochal shift, settled for a more realistic view of the political process. But voters have resigned themselves to a competing realism: that a greater level of political audacity is in order, because what we have right now isn't working. Sanders' proposed solution is a long shot, and it is not without its arguable premises. But the fact that he's the one who's most up-front about its difficulty is what gives his supporters the impression that his campaign is one worth joining. What Sanders knows, though, is that his own election or defeat in this primary cycle is a minor part in the movement he's trying to create that needs to last for years and not just to spike during election seasons. That means insisting that people continue to think of big changes in their politics, not small ones--even if they've been burned before."

For Dan Quayle in the 1988 presidential election, it was a brief comparison with John F. Kennedy. For Howard Dean in the 2004 Democratic primary, it was ""the scream."" For Rick Perry in the 2012 Republican primary, it was ""oops."" These weren't the worst mistakes ever made, but they were emblematic of each candidate's weakness--flubs that reinforced critiques from rivals and the media. Dean screamed just as pundits questioned his temperament for the White House, while Perry stuttered in the face of uncertainty about his intelligence. Sen. Marco Rubio is a gifted politician and talented communicator. But he's faced a repeated attack in his six years on the national stage--that his smooth charisma conceals a man of little substance. That, on a fundamental level, he's not ready for the Oval Office. And on Saturday night, Rubio gave substance to the charge in a remarkable exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at the eighth Republican presidential debate. It began with a question. The moderators asked Rubio to list accomplishments in his record that have prepared him for the presidency. Rubio cited work on foreign policy and issues such as veterans affairs before moving to well-worn rhetoric meant to counter these experience questions by tweaking a popular conservative notion about Barack Obama. ""Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing,"" he said. ""He knows exactly what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world."" And in this implicit analogy, Rubio is the Republican Barack Obama who will make a ""systematic effort"" to make America unique again. ""When I'm president of the United States,"" he continued, ""we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world, and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world."" It's a good line, designed for applause. But this time, Rubio had pushback, in the form of Christie. Behind in national polls and struggling for air in a crowded field, Christie has focused on his experience--as an executive--to make the case to New Hampshire voters and Republicans nationwide. And against Rubio's disdain for experience, he scoffed. ""You have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable,"" Christie said. ""You just simply haven't. And the fact is--when you talk about the Hezbollah sanctions act that you list as one of your accomplishments, you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership. That's truancy."" He finished with a swipe. ""I like Marco Rubio, and he's a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States."" In this debate, the candidates could respond to one another, and Rubio countered with a swipe at Christie's record on fiscal management, accusing the governor of worsening New Jersey's debt problem. And then he did something strange. He slipped back into his line about Obama. ""But I would add this,"" Rubio said. ""Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world,"" ending in the same place he had finished just a few minutes earlier. Immediately, Christie pounced, locking eyes with the camera as he slammed Rubio for the strange repetition. ""You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this--this is what Washington, D.C., does,"" said Christie. ""The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information, and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him."" He continued, moving from a body slam to a pile drive. ""See, Marco, the thing is this: When you're president of the United States, when you are a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state's history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what I've done. None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United State Senate."" Rubio tried to respond. He tried to jab Christie for his absence from New Jersey from the storm. But his hits wouldn't land. He was too flustered. At this point, Rubio could have ended the exchange with silence. Instead, he went back to his talking points. He repeated himself about Obama. ""Here's the bottom line,"" he said, like a program trapped in an infinite loop. ""This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not ... "" Christie cut him off. ""There it is! There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody."" The fight was over. Rubio was shook. Later in the night, Rubio would fall into that rhetoric again, unable to break from his stump speech. Eventually, aided with questions on foreign policy, Rubio recovered. But even with a strong finish, it's hard to say he ended in a good place. Rubio didn't just embarrass himself; he undermined the core argument for his campaign--that we overrate experience and underrate vision and resolve. And worse, it was on video: a short clip to show on news networks or cut into a negative advertisement. ""Rubio's repeat"" will have a long life on daytime cable and late night comedy, an awkward, brutal, cringeworthy display of political failure. Rubio needed a win on Saturday. He needed to show Republicans that Iowa wasn't a fluke, that he could consolidate support and charge ahead of Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz. Instead, at best, he gave a mixed performance, with good answers overshadowed by one of the most uncomfortable moments of the entire Republican debate season. It's far too much to say that it will cost him the nomination. But it could push him down the ladder in New Hampshire and create renewed chaos in the nomination fight, as candidates such as Jeb Bush, Christie, and Gov. John Kasich rise, and Trump--largely unscathed--holds his spot on top. See more of Slate's GOP primary coverage."

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/chris_christie_won_saturday_s_gop_debate.html	"Chris Christie stepped onto the ABC News stage in New Hampshire with only one goal: Hit Sen. Marco Rubio early and often. The New Jersey governor did just that on Saturday, remaining on message from beginning to end. His performance is unlikely to be enough to change his fate when Granite State Republicans head to the polls on Tuesday, but on this night at least he did the most to help himself of anyone on the national stage. Christie set the tone early during his first clash with Rubio, who appeared uncharacteristically flustered during what was his weakest debate performance at a time when he needed his strongest. Asked to defend himself from criticism that he doesn't have the experience needed to be president--a question that Rubio should have known was coming--the Florida senator instead trained his fire on President Obama. ""Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing,"" Rubio said after making passing reference to his own time in the Senate and the Florida House. Christie seized on the non sequitur. ""Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give, or what kind of bill can I drop?"" Christie said. ""Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me. It's a different experience."" The New Jersey Republican then made his implicit criticism of Rubio explicit, addressing his rival directly. ""You have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable,"" he said. ""You just simply haven't."" Christie appeared to come out on top of that exchange, but any doubt quickly disappeared when Rubio inexplicably opted to defend himself by repeating a portion of his previous response almost verbatim: ""Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing."" Christie, again, was ready:"	Chris Christie Won Saturday's GOP Debate	['Rubio', 'Christie', 'Obama']	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/mitt_romney_shouldn_t_endorse_marco_rubio_yet.html	"It doesn't take many mental contortions to figure out whom Mitt Romney would support in a three-way race between Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Sen. Marco Rubio. Obviously he would support none of them, because Romney is waiting for the three to end up in a deadlocked convention from which Romney emerges the consensus nominee. Just kidding, sort of. The dude wants to endorse Rubio, and it's only a matter of time. How about this weekend? Romney convincingly won the New Hampshire primary in 2012 and owns a proper gentleman's lakeside estate in Wolfeboro. He remains popular in the state and could give Rubio, already rising in New Hampshire and elsewhere, the surge he needs to overtake Trump--and effectively put Trump to bed for good. Romney supposedly had no plans to endorse prior to the New Hampshire primary but opened himself to a last-minute change of mind after witnessing Rubio's strong Iowa performance. He has since been crunching the numbers to determine whether his endorsement would shift enough votes to push Rubio over the top. ""Romney,"" CNN reports, ""has a trademark reaction to such talk: Is there data to support the argument that Rubio is in play to defeat Trump in New Hampshire?"" Well? There's more data to support that possibility than there was, say, a few days ago. Rubio is rising and Trump is dipping, but not quite enough to put a scare in Trump, yet. (Let us insert here the standard disclaimer that all polls are cheap and New Hampshire has lots of ornery voters who like to make snap decisions just to mess with people.) Rubio is most generously about 10 percentage points off of Trump's pace. In other words, Rubio is just close enough to make this decision agonizing for a worrywart like Romney. So why not just live a little and go for it? As CNN, which could be completely wrong, frames it, Romney ""would put his personal prestige on the line and disappoint his other friends in the field."" As far as the ""other friends in the field,"" whatever. They won't be around much longer. And is Jeb Bush still a ""friend,"" after he boxed Romney out of the race around this time last year? One imagines it would be quite fun to slap Bush like this to commemorate the anniversary. As far as his ""personal prestige,"" well, Romney's been through worse and can deal. The more interesting question is the risk a Romney endorsement this weekend poses for Rubio, the one who's actually trying to win a presidential nomination. CNN reports that Rubio wants the endorsement before New Hampshire and is trying to convince Romney. But is the young man too rash in his solicitations? Say Romney endorses Rubio but it's not enough to close the New Hampshire gap, and Trump wins. Oh my God, can't you hear it? Rubio brought in this loser, Romney, who choked in the last election, and what does he do, he chokes again. Choke, choke, choke--sad! We don't need choking losers like Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, the boy. There's also a question of how overtly Rubio wants to be dubbed the ""establishment candidate."" He would like the establishment to line up behind him in a series of senatorial and gubernatorial endorsements and large donations. But does he really need a move so heavy-handed as Romney, the previous Republican nominee, behind him before even the second state has had the chance to vote? If it looks too much like party leaders are trying to shove Rubio through the process this early on, this helps both Trump and Cruz as the contest moves through the South. They can each credibly argue that the party, after only two weeks of voting, has already begun writing the ""amnesty bill"" that they intend to put on Rubio's Oval Office desk for signature. The important thing for Rubio is that he doesn't need Romney's endorsement right now. The race is trending in his direction. He's soon going to be flush with the donors and supporters of several candidates who drop out. Cruz is stalling, and Trump has little room to grow. The longer the campaign goes on, the more favorable the terrain is to him. If there's a time when an avalanche of party actors should publicly come his way in an effort to wrap this thing up, it should be prior to Florida and the other winner-take-all states that come in mid-March. For now, there's no need to tinker with something that's already working."	Why It's Too Soon for Mitt Romney to Endorse Marco Rubio	['Rubio', 'Romney', 'Cruz', 'Trump']	[]
29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/bernie_versus_hillary_is_good_for_democrats.html	"Substantively, it's hard to say there was much new in Thursday's Democratic presidential debate, other than the timing (a weekday!) and the format, which--with the departure of former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley--pit Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton against each other one-on-one. Both candidates made their core pitches and seemed to be targeting their core constituencies. For Sanders, it's the call for a ""political revolution"" against a political system that, he argues, is a playground for corrupt, plutocratic interests and their allies in government. The only way to improve life for the majority of Americans, Sanders believes, is through a radical overhaul of public policy, from single-payer health insurance to free college and campaign finance reform. For Clinton, it's a more modest agenda of defending past progressive accomplishment and implementing incremental new programs. As president, Clinton would seek to protect the gains of Barack Obama and push on areas where progress or consensus is possible. And her agenda, like Sanders', reflects this basic, reformist orientation to the world. If there was anything novel in the debate, it was the degree to which the first segments were devoted to an almost arcane fight over ideology. Both Clinton and Sanders fought for the label of progressive, continuing a dispute that began on Monday, the same day that Clinton edged out Sanders by the narrowest of margins in the Iowa caucus. In this argument, the candidates got aggressive, with Clinton in particular making direct hits on Sanders in a way that surpassed previous exchanges. ""I'm not making promises I cannot keep,"" she declared, more than implying that her opponent would not be able to keep his. Later, she disputed Sanders' definition of progressive and told him that ""I don't think it was progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times."" That burst of fireworks aside, however, it's hard to say this debate was anything other than substantive, with Clinton and Sanders clashing on real and serious ideological differences around everything from the role and influence of money in politics to the national security and foreign policy priorities of the next president. Yes, there were the typical questions about ""electability,"" and no, there weren't questions on reproductive health or climate change--key interests for millions of Democratic voters. But on the main, anyone who watched the debate had a chance to see two politicians and public servants argue for their vision of the country and its future. This was a real contrast to the Republican debates, which tend to focus less on policy and more on dominance displays (Trump versus Bush, for example) and outright aggression (Cruz on carpet bombing). Which is to say that, if you're a Democrat, it is an actual shame that the party hasn't held more of these debates. A regular series of primetime showdowns between the candidates would provide an incredible contrast between the two parties, and showcase the Democratic candidates at their absolute best. It's not that quantity of debates is dispositive--if Democrats lose this election, it won't be because they didn't argue enough in public--but that not having more might be a missed opportunity to show the best face of the party to interested Americans, as well as win positive attention for each of the contenders. Democratic leaders should take note: Next time there's a primary, schedule more debates. You won't regret it. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."
