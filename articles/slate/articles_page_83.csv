The lead attorney on the voter ID case for Pennsylvania's ACLU chapter was trying to demonstrate the gap between his numbers of potentially screwed-over voters and the state's evidence of potential fraud. ""The scale's a little bit like this,"" said Walczak, in a central New Jersey accent that grew thicker as he spoke. ""I don't think my arms can stretch far enough."" The commonwealth's attorneys, who'd sat through seven days of these arguments, didn't react to the theatrics. They watched Walczak speak for nearly two hours, playing two video clips, appealing to the spirit of 1776, and laying out specifically why Pennsylvania couldn't implement voter ID right away. Pathos was their enemy. Their 800-pound ally: Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, the 2008 Supreme Court decision that saved Indiana's voter ID law. Senior Deputy Attorney General Patrick Cawley closed the state's argument by quoting that 6-3 decision, written by John Paul Stevens. ""The petitioners may make an emotional appeal that may play well to the cameras and to those untrained in the law,"" said Cawley. ""Pennsylvania law, however, does not support their request for primary injunction."" Put yourself in Cawley's position. The petitioners who want to block the state's new voter ID law produced 14 witnesses. All of them will have some degree of trouble voting if the law survives. These witnesses have been shopped out to TV shows and newspapers--an A1 New York Times story!--to portray Pennsylvania's law as uniquely cruel. But there's Supreme Court precedent that appears to back you up. So Cawley attempted to puncture the witnesses, one by one, and attack the very premise that a law had to go if it would affect a minority of Pennsylvanians. Joyce Block, the 89-year-old from Bucks County, got an ID and ""seems only to complain that she had to make a second trip to PennDOT (the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) and ask her state senator to intervene."" Asher Mirel, a man who used to be a woman, had proven that his old ID still got him where he needed to go. Viviette Applewhite, the 93-year-old who made it into that New York Times front page story, knew her Social Security number, so she could get an absentee ballot. ""An equal protection challenge to a neutral, facially non-discriminatory election statute cannot be supported by claims that certain individuals will bear a special burden under the law,"" said Cawley. ""There will always be those people."" But why did the petitioners scour the state for stories of people who might not be able to vote? Put 14 of them in a room, and sure, you can explain how each of them could adapt to the new law. The petitioners' point was that there might be hundreds of thousands of people with sob stories or wrong IDs, and that this state--no state--could fix their problems by the end of October. Walczak imagined a confused voter arriving at the polls: ""Whaddya mean, ID? Why would I need ID? I've voted here for 50 years! You know me, we play golf together! What if somebody comes and say, here's my ID, and they're told, 'Sorry, there's no expiration date here, that's not valid under the law.' "" How many voters might fall into the Ignorance Trap? Great question. When the controversy began, Secretary of the Commonwealth Carol Aichele guesstimated that 99 percent of voters would breeze through the polls. In July, the state admitted that 758,000-odd Pennsylvanians lacked current ID from PennDOT--so actually only 90.8 percent of voters were absolutely taken care of. The remaining voters might have combinations of ID--college ID cards, Social Security cards, birth certificates. But how many of them would get stuck in the system? There were 71 PennDot offices, but 13 of them were only open one day a week. Nine Pennsylvania counties have no PennDot office at all. The Crawford decision addressed a somewhat similar situation. Walczak focused on the differences. The Supreme Court found that provisional ballots could take care of voters who lacked ID. But a Pennsylvanian who voted that way would have only six days to get a valid ID and prove his identity. In Crawford, Stevens found that ""the elderly in Indiana are able to vote absentee without presenting photo identification."" In Pennsylvania, though, voters have to offer some proof that they've earned absentee ballots--for example, that sickness or travel prevents them from voting that day. And even then, asked Walczak, why force so many people into the absentee system? Why bet on the provisional ballot system? Why do all of this in one election cycle, when in Georgia, voter ID was phased in over two years, with four times as many locations for obtaining the right cards? The reason, said Cawley, was the specter of voter fraud. The day before he had made this argument to Prof. Lorraine Minnite, author of The Myth of Voter Fraud. He informed her that Heritage Foundation Fellow Hans von Spakovsky worried about fraud; she said von Spakovsky's work was unscholarly claptrap. He wondered how widespread fraud was; she showed a chart that indicated that there were 183,344 fraud charges of any kind in fiscal year 2006. Of those, only 60 of them were charges of voter fraud. Cawley dealt with this by dismissing it. He repeated von Spakovsky's arguments and pointed out that another expert witness, professor Matthew Baretto, worked with the anti-voter-ID Brennan Center and the Hispanic turnout group Latino Decisions. How to explain the low voter fraud numbers? Perhaps voter fraud didn't make it to the top of prosecutors' to-do lists. ""When it comes to voter fraud, there's no blood on the sidewalk,"" he said. ""There are no vulnerable victims to show to a jury."" But if there weren't any victims, who were those 14 people testifying about the horrors of the law? ""Your honor,"" said Walczak, ""we're dealing here with the right to vote. If these people aren't able to vote in November, no amount of money will replace that. There are no do-overs. This is a one-shot deal. You've got to get it right. This is clearly irreparable harm."""	Why Pennsylvania Doesn't Understand All the Fuss About Voter ID
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/07/mitt_romney_visited_poland_on_the_third_leg_of_his_trip_overseas_.html	"The 2012 presidential election pits Mitt Romney against the 2009 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. You'd forgotten about that, hadn't you? The Obama campaign site makes no mention whatsoever of the Nobel. The president never talks about being in the company of Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi and Yasser Arafat. Obama was a rare Nobel winner who engendered an immediate are-you-serious reaction from a former winner. ""So soon?"" said former Polish President Lech Walesa, venting less than an hour after Obama won. ""Too early. He has no contribution thus far. He is still at an early stage."" Every American conservative had the same reaction. Finally. Here's a real European hero who sees through Obama. Four months later, Walesa flew to Illinois and endorsed a Polish-American Republican candidate for governor, calling his Tea Party-flavored campaign ""the new Solidarnosc."" Later in 2010, he warned that Obama's United States was ""getting weak"" economically and ""no longer leading politically or morally."" And then, this year, Walesa pointedly declined a meeting with the president. Why? ""It would only amount to a photo opportunity."" The Walesa drama helps to explain the role Poland plays in the anti-Obama argument. Conservatives see how Obama treats Israel, Britain, and Poland, and they see evidence of his deep-seated mistrust of the West. ""Our visit to Poland,"" said Romney foreign policy adviser Lanhee Chen to reporters last week, ""comes at the gracious invitation of former President Lech Walesa."" Hint, hint. The real-time policy reasons for the trip are few, but resonant. On Sept. 17, 2009, a month before the Nobel Committee's announcement, the Obama administration put the kibosh on a planned missile defense shield over Eastern Europe. It was interpreted, there and here, as a sop to Russia. But what a sop! In history, Sept, 17 happened to be the day that the Soviets promised to ""take all measures to extricate the Polish people from the unfortunate war into which they were dragged by their unwise leaders"" and send tanks over the border. ""The idea that we should renounce,"" said Charles Krauthammer, ""on the 70th anniversary of the Russian invasion of Poland, a security agreement that we had with Poland [because] of Russian objections is scandalously, indescribably amateurish."" Conservatives here and in Poland have looked at every subsequent Obama administration move as a sell-out. Scrapping the missile shield was ""a unilateral concession to the Russian government,"" after the Poles had ""courageously"" agreed to set it up, according to Romney. ""There's no question that Obama has rattled some of our allies, like Poland, by talking about the flexibility he'd have in his second term on issues like missile defense,"" Sen. Jon Cornyn, R-Texas, told me last week. ""I expect that'll be part of the larger discussion leading up to November."" But Romney hasn't said he'd restart the missile shield, and leadership in other countries who'd been part of the plan have moved on, so there's got to be more to this. In May, the president issued a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom to the Warsaw Ghetto resistance hero Jan Karski. ""Resistance fighters told him that Jews were being murdered on a massive scale,"" said Obama, ""and smuggled him into the Warsaw Ghetto and a 'Polish death camp' to see for himself."" Poland's conservative-leaning government got understandably miffed about the ""death camp"" thing. Even after the White House walked it back, Prime Minister Donald Tusk demanded more. ""When someone says 'Polish death camps,' "" he said, ""it is as if there were no Nazis, no German responsibility, as if there were no Hitler."" And what sort of American doesn't respect Poland? In the conservative history of the Cold War, Poles played an outsize role in defeating the Soviets because of their faith. Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II formed a trinity; the politicians couldn't have been as successful if the pope hadn't stoked new religious and patriotic fervor with his 1979 trip back home. In 2010, famed Catholic convert Newt Gingrich produced and toured a documentary about John Paul II's visit, Nine Days That Shook the World.  He later told the New York Times of his fear that ""the crisis of European civilization as militant, government-imposed secularism undermines and weakens Christianity."" More than half of Poles still attend church every week, the highest rate in Europe. They're righteous in a way that other Europeans aren't. ""I think Poles are very unhappy with the Obama administration,"" Gingrich told me on Monday, during a pro-Romney campaign stop in northern Virginia. ""They feel very, very much left in the lurch."" Are they, though? The Polish political class is, and has been, more aligned with American conservatives than with the American left. When John Kerry left Poland out of the ""coalition of the willing,"" and George W. Bush chided him, people noticed. But Poles themselves aren't turning on Obama. According to a Pew poll released last month--i.e.,   after the ""death camp"" flub--69 percent of Poles approve of the United States. That was higher than it was during any point in the presidency of George W. Bush, and only down 5 points from the highs of 2009. What about Polish-Americans? They're swing voters. Like Rebecca Kaplan pointed out this week, there are plenty of Ohio and Pennsylvania voters with consonant-laden names who want Poland to join the visa waiver program. But Romney didn't need to promise anything to win over Lech Walesa. Today, at their grip-and-grab session, Walesa announced his side in the international culture wars. ""Governor Romney, get your success,"" said Walesa. ""Be successful!"""	Why Romney and the GOP Love Poland
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/07/both_barack_obama_s_and_mitt_romney_s_campaigns_are_looking_to_secure_as_many_early_votes_as_possible_long_before_election_day_.html	"Mitt Romney's Las Vegas field office was buzzing last week. The candidate wasn't there, but his white and blue campaign bus was. Volunteers who had worked a shift calling on voters or knocking on doors in the brutal heat were rewarded with a tour. They stood among the black leather banquettes in the back where the candidate rides and read the love note he left his wife on Valentine's Day. Back in the offices, Romney and Republican Party staffers shared windowless rooms working under color-coded maps of the state. Hovering over the entire operation was a poster in the lobby that greeted everyone. It simply read ""92."" That's not the number of days until Election Day. That's the countdown until voting starts in Nevada. Today it reads 85, which is 18 days before Election Day. By the time the big day rolls around--Nov. 6--almost 70 percent of Nevada voters are likely to have marked their ballot. In 2008, only a third of the roughly 130 million nationwide ballots were early or absentee, but that number is expected to increase in this election in the 32 states where it will be allowed. Nevada is one of several early-voting battleground states along with North Carolina, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida, and Colorado. So many people vote early in those key states, it's possible that the election outcome could be determined before anyone steps into a voting booth. That's why the Romney offices in Nevada are so busy and why in contested states the pace of advertising and outreach seems like it is at October levels. As my colleague Sasha Issenberg writes in his wonderful forthcoming book, The Victory Lab, candidates and political parties started paying more attention to the science of campaigning after the election of 2000. That close race proved that when the outcome is tight, every little bit helps. So campaign strategists dropped the folk wisdom and started paying attention to the eggheads to learn whether a house visit, a phone call, or a piece of direct mail is more effective in identifying and turning out voters, or whether all three can be just as effective if deployed at different times and in different ways. Early voting is a scientist's playground for experimenting with these techniques because it offers so many days to try them out, perfect them, observe them, and adapt them if necessary. If you're hunting for one day, you want to perfect your shot. If you're hunting over three weeks, you can change your position, try different rifles, wait for the weather to change, and shoot like a sniper. Campaigns spend years putting together lists of their voters, identifying who they are, and noting what issues motivate them and, in some cases, what methods are most successful in getting them to vote. When early voting starts, most states release a daily list of who has voted. Campaigns can check these lists against their party lists. They don't know how a person voted, but because they've usually been in contact with the voter--or they identified them at an all-night Romney rally--they can make a pretty good guess. At the start of the early voting, Democrats in Ohio might ask the president to visit to encourage the base to bank their votes. Or, a campaign might hold a rally and give preferential seating to those who wear an ""I voted"" sticker. A surrogate might rally near polling places, an update on the ""knock and drag"" technique. When Sarah Palin did this in Nevada in 2010 she helped goose the local vote.[CAL1]  Once the most reliable voters are in the system, a subsequent candidate visit can be targeted at less-ideological swing voters. Or, campaigns can know when to stop working a state and spend time in another. ""In 2008, I knew that Obama had won the election a week before,"" says Michael McDonald, a George Mason professor who has studied voter-mobilization techniques and used the same analysis the campaigns did. ""We took a look at the early vote in Colorado. and it was implausible that McCain could come back."" (Obama officials hated this speculation because they worried it would suppress early turnout.) As the daily vote tallies come in, campaigns know where to tailor their efforts: knocking on more doors in this neighborhood, sending a piece of direct mail about equal pay for women to that one, or just making people feel guilty. When we were by here last week, you said you'd vote. Some campaigns use a subtle form of coercion; they promise to stop calling and sending mail if people will just vote. One of the benefits of all of these techniques is that it helps a campaign feel in control of its own destiny. A lot of campaign work can feel disconnected, but if you can measure your list against the number of people who have voted, you know you're getting somewhere. In some cases, this work could also be psychological make-work, wasting resources that could be used more productively. But campaigns have convinced themselves in the past few elections that they can squeeze enough new votes using certain techniques that it can make a difference. The Mitt Romney campaign worked the early vote so diligently ahead of the Florida Republican primary that it built the crucial firewall it needed against the advancing Newt Gingrich. Banking votes early may change what used to be known as the October surprise--the late election phenomenon that favors one candidate. In the 2000 election, news broke just days before the election that George W. Bush had been arrested for driving while under the influence. His strategists say they saw a sharp drop-off in evangelical voters who would otherwise have been predisposed to voting for Bush. If those votes had been banked, the voters couldn't have jumped ship. This could be an argument for dishing your dirt on your opponent early, before he has his supporters locked in. Of course doing that gives your opponent time to recover, too. On the other hand, if elections are close and each side turns out their base and locks in their vote, that could leave a small, highly persuadable group of swing voters remaining. They might be more susceptible to late-game tremors. If early voting becomes more common, it may also change the way candidates in other races in the state have to behave. If the candidate at the top of the ticket is banking votes at the start of the early-vote period, do you spend resources trying to ride that wave? If you do, you might not have money left to make a final push when you need it most. Say, for example, on Election Day."	Could This Year's Election Be Over Before It Starts?

His mission: convince them that $700 billion of automatic defense spending cuts, put in place by 2011's debt limit deal, had to be overturned. His audience, judging by the bursts of applause, was awfully receptive. As they left, they paused to tell reporters just how convincing Cheney had been. ""One thing that the vice president pointed out,"" said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., ""was when you make these cuts across the board in the way that sequestration does, it's not only the impact on today, it will make a long-term impact on the Defense Department."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., translated Cheney's argument that defense spending is ""not a spigot you can turn on and turn off, that you need to keep money flowing in a predictable way so you can plan for the next war.""* There was only a small path between the senators, their scrums, and the exits. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., found that path and called an elevator. Only one reporter noticed him and started asking for details from inside the Cheney seminar. ""It was a private meeting,"" said Paul. ""I'm not going to talk about it."" The reporter tried again. ""Right, again, it was a private meeting."" In the few seconds before the elevator arrived, you could read between the lines. Paul, unlike most of his peers, was not going along with Cheney. On Thursday, the freshman senator met with a small group of reporters and foreign policy analysts to explain himself further. ""Most people in our conference,"" said Paul, ""are on the side [that thinks] that they need to do anything now to avoid the military sequester. I think there is a little bit of irony in that most of them voted for the military sequester. I didn't vote for it. They all voted to raise the debt ceiling with a military sequester, and now they're all basically caterwauling about it."" The sequester was basically designed for caterwaulers. In order to extend the debt limit through to 2013, most Republicans and Democrats eventually agreed to $1.4 trillion of ""triggered"" cuts--sequesters. Half of the money would be taken out of domestic discretionary spending over 10 years; half would be taken from the defense budget over 10 years, a slash of around 8 percent. ""It was designed to be painful,"" explained Sen. Harry Reid, so that the ""supercommittee"" would cut even more from the budget, in targeted ways. That would have pre-empted the sequester. But the supercommittee failed and Congress--largely Republicans--started testing out ways of saving a defense budget that reached $608 billion this year. In May, the Republican House narrowly passed a ""sequester replacement"" that shunted all the cuts over to the discretionary side. ""They seem to say, 'Well, we are for certain revisions to make the military more efficient,' "" said Paul. ""I'm of the belief that nothing around you will ever be efficient unless the top line number is lower. So, they don't like what they call sequester. To me, that means that the top line number is lower, and if you really believe in savings in the military budget or else you'd have to find the savings, you'd be forced to find the savings. If they could offset it with true one-to-one spending cuts somewhere else, I might consider supporting that. If it's like most of the games they play around here--they give us cuts over 10 years to pay for something over one year--I'm not going to vote for that, because really, we're going back on what we promised the American people during that whole battle was that we're going to be more fiscally responsible."" Paul didn't take a position on the Ryan ""sequester replacement."" That plan won't make it through the Senate, anyway. But he disagreed with it in spirit. ""Conservatives defend military spending,"" he said. ""Liberals defend domestic spending. The idea [is] that both sides get together and compromises and we reduce all spending ... and right now, and really for the last 50 years, we've done the opposite. Our compromise has always been: We raise military spending and we raise domestic welfare spending. So when people say we're not compromising, they're missing it completely. We're compromising all the time to spend more money."" What about the Cheney argument? The former vice president is really only the most famous, most political person making it. The same day he toured the hill, Lockheed's president made the same pitch. How are the politicians of 2012 supposed to know what the military will need for future conflicts? ""I think you do need to plan ahead,"" said Paul. ""Start planning in advance, but that doesn't mean it can only be done with X dollars."" That hasn't been proven to him. ""Look at [the idea of] auditing the Pentagon. They've been talking about having an audit for 30 years probably. They've now said it's coming in 2017. And my guess is that in 2016 it's going to be 2024, in 2023 they'll tell us it's going to be 2030. But I bet you if we said next year you've got to meet this sequester, maybe then all of a sudden they'll say 'Well why don't we jettison some of the crap here we're doing we don't need?' They'll never do it unless their top line number is ever reduced."" The debt limit passed without Paul's vote. He's threatened to filibuster deals that appalled him before, then decided against it. If and when Republicans try and jam back the defense money, they are not counting on Paul's support. He knows that. ""There are people who say, 'oh, we will do this if we're ever in charge. We're going to do it in a much more streamline fashion.' Well. We've been in charge. And it never changed when we were in charge."" Correction, July 23, 2012: This article originally misspelled Lindsey Graham's first name. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Will Rand Paul Wage a Stealth Campaign Against Defense Spending?

It was on July 13, late evening, the president gave an unusually unteleprompted speech at Fire Station No. 1 in Roanoke, Va. and riffed that ""if you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own."" No news outlet led with that part of his speech. According to The Roanoke Times, Obama framed the election ""as a choice between boosting the middle class or helping the rich."" Local ABC-13 reported that Obama was fed up with gridlock and Republican economics. But conservative bloggers and tweeters found a different lede. On July 14, a conservative North Carolina activist named Erik Soderstrom put up a 12-second clip that made it sound like Obama gave business owners no credit for building anything. On July 15, a Sunday, the video-aggregating blog the Right Scoop put up a long video of the key Obama lines. On July 16, the RNC's ""rapid response"" team finally released a clip of the Obama riff, and Fox News started running stories. And that evening, 72 hours after the speech, the Romney campaign alerted reporters to the fact that Fox News commentator Brit Hume found the Obama speech revealing. Maybe the timing--Friday-Saturday-Sunday--explained the delay. But Romney surrogates appeared on Sunday talk shows, wringing their hands about the candidate's tax returns, when they could have picked up the new Obama quote and bludgeoned Democrats. The conservative media took the lead on this one. They found a classic Kinsley gaffe, sure, but a new kind of Kinsley gaffe. Call it a magic word gaffe--a statement that reveals not what a politician believes, but what you already feared, in your bone marrow, that a politician believes. Democrats still can't understand why Obama's speech is supposed to offend anyone. Republicans know that he's a closet socialist, and that this sentiment only comes out when his energy is flagging. Brit Hume explained this first and best. ""It is fair to say that we know more tonight than we ever have about the president's view of business and the economy,"" he said. More than we ever have? ""His assertion over the weekend that 'if you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen' explains nearly everything. He wasn't talking about God. He was talking about government."" This makes no sense to Democrats. When hasn't Obama said this? In his 2008 nomination speech, for example, then-candidate Obama talked endlessly about safety nets letting ""someone with a good idea ... take a risk and start a new business"" without having to ""choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child."" The Washington Examiner's Conn Carroll points out that Obama's Roanoke speech merely ""made a long-standing and fundamental liberal argument in an unappealing way."" The Washington Post's Greg Sargent argues that Mitt Romney, who does not plan to dismantle the Small Business Administration or the Department of Education, concedes some of the argument. But the Romney campaign has located sad-eyed businessmen who think Obama literally does not think they build anything. A viral column by John Kass (10,000+ Facebook shares), describes an Obama who ""stands there at the front of the mob, in his shirt sleeves, swinging that government hammer, exhorting the crowd to use its votes and take what it wants."" Like Lenin, like Marx, like Big Brother, he wants to raise the marginal tax rate on income over $250,000. The magic word gaffe wasn't invented this week. Liberals in the George W. Bush era--many of whom doubted that he would beat Al Gore--did pioneering work. From time to time, Bush would joke that ""a dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier"" than the American political system. (I think that's true, although you'd lose a lot of ad revenue from biennial elections.) That comment appears in millions of unexpected Internet hot zones, because for a certain kind of Bush critic, it sounded true, even when Bush failed to become president-for-life. After 9/11, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer chastened Bill Maher for saying that Mohammed Atta et al were not cowards. ""There are reminders to all Americans that they need to watch what they say,"" said Fleischer. Gore Vidal quickly turned that into Fleischer telling the press ""you better watch what you say,"" proof of mounting threats to free speech from the Bush regime. A normal gaffe is usually discovered by the ""mainstream"" press, or by a rival campaign, in real time. Think about the Obama campaign hounding John McCain on his ""the fundamentals of the economy are sound"" as Lehman collapsed. Think about ""the private sector is doing fine"" becoming proof, for Romney, that Obama saw no problems in the private sector. The magic word gaffe takes more digging, because the media that mostly covers campaigns aren't primed to hear what partisans hear. Barack Obama's presidency has been full of these moments. If you watched Glenn Beck during his Fox News years, you got endless exposure (more than 100 episodes of it, according to Lexis-Nexis) to an Oct. 30, 2008 quote from an Obama rally in Columbia, Mo. ""We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America,"" said the candidate. Hang on--fundamentally transform? Obama seemed to be talking about his policy agenda (""you can turn the page on policies that put greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street""), because these came off like magic words. ""Barack Obama has said he wants to fundamentally transform this country,"" said Beck in September 2009. ""Boy, I don't. I would like to work on some of the things we kind of stink at."" By 2011, when Beck sat down with Rick Santorum, the secret meaning of ""fundamentally"" had become the accepted meaning. ""He wanted to change America,"" said Santorum. ""Fundamentally transform,"" Beck corrected. ""Fundamental change in America,"" said the candidate. ""And guess what? He is doing it."" The president had revealed how radical his agenda was; the media betrayed us by not warning us. Conservatives like Santorum and Sarah Palin hear these magic words right away. Mitt Romney doesn't. It's a minor but important reason why conservatives still hardly trust him. How can he run against Obama if he says the Fundamental Transformer is a ""good man?"" Doesn't he get that this election is about radicalism versus the possible eradication of freedom? This week, they got him to listen."	"How ""You Didn't Build That"" Became Obama's Newest Gaffe"

Job creation is anemic, voters think the country is going in the wrong direction, and the president has been unable to convince them otherwise. So, the path is clear: Destroy your opponent and pander to your base. Obama Wan Kenobi, it's your only hope. This has been obvious for months. It was clear, at the very least, from the president's campaign kick-off back in May. What's new is that Mitt Romney's campaign is trying to make something of it. In a recent series of ads and television appearances, the Republican challenger argues that the president has discarded the high-minded principles of his 2008 campaign to keep the White House at any cost. Obama promised to lift the nation above petty sniping and political game-playing, and now he's doing exactly what he decried. The latest Romney ad called ""Hope and Change?"" starts with CBS's Bob Schieffer asking David Axelrod, ""What ever happened to hope and change?"" Do people really care about the niceties of campaigning? They don't like politicians. They expect them to say one thing and do another. Why would they be surprised when one of them is behaving exactly as they'd expect--especially when the other candidate is doing the same thing as well? The Romney campaign is hoping that Barack Obama is a special case. In 2008, Barack Obama was supposed to be different. He ran his campaign on the promise that he could elevate the process. That was the key point in his larger campaign of hope. Polls at the time showed that people thought the American Dream of prosperity was no longer available to their kids. They bet on an inexperienced, one-term senator largely because he offered hope and a plausible case for change. Plus, he wasn't just talking about hope; as the first African-American president, he was a walking testament to the idea that the country could move forward. What's the opposite of hope? Disappointment. Focusing on Obama's change in tone is just an inroad to access people's deeper disappointments. Romney advisers say that in focus groups, attendees regularly talk about how the president let them down. That Obama has turned out to be just another politician is the most symbolic disappointment that amplifies a broader disappointment in Obama's inability to improve the economy. Another new Romney ad (which may not be true) touches on a similar theme, arguing that the candidate who promised to rid Washington of political insiders is giving his donors special access. ""The question shouldn't be: 'Are you better off?' "" says a Romney adviser. ""The question should be: 'Did you think you would be better off?' "" When the car repair bill is double what you were quoted, you're disappointed. When the auto-repair shop made such a big deal about how cheap it would be, the bill is a gut punch. This is also the theme of the creepy American Crossroads ad in which the president appears to have been in office a lot longer than three years. Whether this Romney strategy works depends on whether any swing voter continues to value Obama's original hope-and-change message. Some never bought it in the first place. In 2008, Obama was willing to tear down his opponents if necessary. He ran more negative ads than any candidate in history. This pragmatic group of voters may have enjoyed the talk of uplift the same way they might enjoy jokes at the start of a speech: fun to listen to but not the main thing. Moving on from George Bush was the main thing. Others who did buy the hope-and-change message the last time may have come to an accommodation with how it played out. Maybe they think it's a shame, but it's a mild disappointment they're willing to overlook. (In Obama's campaign launch video, this kind of voter is named Ed and he lives in North Carolina.) The final group thinks Obama's tougher side is an asset. Because the president faces opponents who will not meet him halfway, there's no reason to continue to try to play nice. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that his primary job was defeating Barack Obama. This helps illustrate to voters who might care about fair dealing--otherwise why would Obama's message have resonated in 2008--that the president wasn't engaged with opponents who were interested in even maintaining the old niceties about cooperation. How much disappointment a voter might feel also depends on how low Obama sinks. It's clear that his campaign's claims about Mitt Romney's outsourcing record at Bain are lower than the Sunday School standard, but they're higher than the Willie Horton standard. They are lower than the Idealized Obama standard (outlined in his book The Audacity of Hope and his 2004 Democratic Convention speech), but they aren't necessarily lower than the current Depressing Campaign Baseline. It is fair game for Obama to look at what Romney has said and match it against what he has done. Romney has said he will protect jobs from going overseas. Did he do that in the private sector? He has asked us to look at his expertise from those years in considering whether he has the skills and worldview required to fix the economy. It shouldn't surprise him that the Obama campaign is looking. For a person seeking to undermine Romney's claim that his business career gives him special experience, there's plenty in the record to exploit. There's no particular evidence that suggests he has a special understanding about employees, the human cost of creative destruction, or the struggles of the middle class. He has at various times asserted that he has special insight, but he has never really made the case. Various news articles suggest his expertise was specialized and put a premium on making money rather than protecting workers. That is what's in Romney's record. The Obama team, in trying to make claims about Bain after Romney left to work on the Olympics in February 1999 is going beyond the useful record, which is just fishing. They've made a charge for which there's no proof, been slapped by the fact-checkers, and they've continued on anyway. The author of The Audacity of Hope would have no problem comparing Mitt Romney's private sector decisions about outsourcing to his public statements. But that Obama would want you to be able to actually prove that Romney made such decisions. So far the Obama 2012 campaign has no evidence that Romney made any substantive decisions--about outsourcing or anything else--after February 1999, when the bulk of the outsourcing took place. This line of attack is not aimed at figuring out whether Romney's past practices reveal what type of president he would make. It's an effort to discredit him. With no actual evidence to support the claim, the Obama campaign has shifted its argument. This is about taking responsibility, they say. Romney's names were on several forms. He was chairman, CEO, president, and sole owner. Therefore, he bears responsibility, but he won't accept it. The buck stops with him. This argument is both important and unconvincing. On the one hand, obviously it's necessary for leaders to take responsibility. A president, for example, cannot make excuse after excuse for why things didn't turn out the way he said they would. (Recovery summer!) This is why Republicans criticize Obama for blaming earthquakes, instability in Europe, and the ATM for the lack of a genuine economic recovery. You're the president: Own it and fix it. But whether a person deserves the credit or blame that comes with responsibility requires some reasonable expectation that they have responsibility and a reasonable evaluation of the reach of his domain. A president can't control Europe, which is why Obama is not loony to use the global economy to explain why the U.S. economy is not improving. Mitt Romney had no effective control over the company and so his inner feelings about outsourcing can't be determined from decisions he didn't make. The Obama team goes from unconvincing to nutty when it suggests that because Romney was still getting paid by Bain, he provided tacit assent to the decisions the firm was making. This should not be a game the Obama team would want to play, for fear of opening all kinds of sticky questions. Was Obama providing tacit assent when he maintained an acquaintance with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers? Was the president providing tacit assent when he sat in the pews listening to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's incendiary sermons? No and no. The political point of the Obama team's attacks is to use a legitimate question to pry. Once you've gotten the press to treat your question as legitimate, even if there's no evidence of the initial claim, you can pick apart answers, continue to question, and generally create unstable air to cause your opponent turbulence. Romney has fallen for this tactic so well, my fear of flying makes it impossible to extend the metaphor without getting motion sickness. What's incredible is that the attacks are coming on these questions. This was Romney's chosen narrative--that he has special business skills, expertise, and acumen. So it is odd that he and his team seem so flat-footed. Stranger still is that this is not his junior varsity season. He already had several clashes on this exact turf with his Republican opponents in the primaries. That was supposed to make him all the more ready for this highly predictable attack. If Romney continues to stumble, it doesn't just help the Obama campaign in the daily news cycle. It helps rehabilitate the Obama reputation: if Romney self-destructs, the Republican candidate will get blamed for it and President Obama can just put the whoopee cushion back in the drawer. Mitt Romney does not want to have a full and frank discussion about the nature of post-Bain business arrangements because, even if it absolves him of any outsourcing decisions, his financial dealings will make him seem exotic and extremely unlike regular Americans. The same is true of his highly minimalist standard on releasing his tax returns. This truth has led those speaking for the campaign on these issues to seem rigid and uncomfortable. Their discomfort makes them seem like they're hiding something or at least not telling the full story. In that environment, when a new fact does emerge, it can seem revelatory, even if it merely adds detail and doesn't advance the story. But Romney suffers in a bigger way that has nothing to do with the current discussion of outsourcing: He's never really offered a story to voters about how his career as a successful businessman will be good for us. Romney just asserts that he knows how the economy works and moves on. Sit down with most small-business owners and it won't take long before you hear a story about how they bent over backward to save an employee's job or structured their health plan to make it easier on them. You never hear Romney tell those stories. Maybe he can't. Perhaps he is not that kind of businessperson. There is the one famous Romney story about helping his employee find his lost daughter. Amazing, but he might need a story that doesn't suggest one heroic act for a good friend as much as something more sustained. Perhaps at the Republican convention Romney will reintroduce himself to Americans and take control of the story of his business career. Or, perhaps the Bain outsourcing stories will fade away in the coming weeks when Romney announces his vice presidential choice. That will take the pressure off Romney, but it will also rob his campaign of fresh examples of how Obama's attacks are yet another broken promise from four years ago. Given what a tangled mess these questions have become for Romney, that's a trade-off he'll no doubt be happy to take."	Does It Bother Anyone That Obama Is Playing Dirty?

I'm referring to a micro-trend from 2010, one that ended up helping Romney by osmosis. During the midterms, the GOP's hunt for pitchfork-wieldin', paycheck-signin' citizen politicians was a source of endless pride and helpful stories. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the happy warrior who led their recruiting in the House, would imitate the soft drawl of Stephen Fischer--""a gospel-singin' farmer from Frog Jump, Tennessee""--and describe how he convinced regular-guy physician Scott DesJarlais to shave his goatee and run for Congress. Four members of the GOP's freshman class in the House were car salesman, who could talk themselves hoarse about the Big Brother-ism of ""cash for clunkers."" Conservative writers liked this story, too. George Will described Ron Johnson, a plastics manufacturer from Oshkosh, Wis., who jumped into politics after a couple of Tea Party speeches, as ""what the Tea Party looks like,"" a man who ""has worn jeans and running shoes to his office,"" who was so earthly that his wife had to pick out brown shoes for him. He wasn't just an Ayn Rand reader. He could be an Atlas Shrugged character--Hank Rearden, or Francisco D'Anconia, or a less-talkative John Galt. This year, we are low on Hank Reardens. Look at the map of states Republicans need to conquer if they want to take the Senate. One of their chosen candidates, Pennsylvania's Tom Smith, is a bona fide Tea Partier and coal magnate, but he's down by 19 points. If you go by David Catanese's reliable list of races, five top candidates--Virginia's George Allen, Montana's Denny Rehberg, North Dakota's Rick Berg, New Mexico's Heather Wilson, and Florida's Connie Mack IV--have current or expired congressional ID pins. And there's more! Ohio's Josh Mandel, 34, a Marine Corps Reserves vet (you can tell by the camo in all of his ads), has never worked in the private sector. The Tea Party hero of the cycle so far, Indiana's giant-slayer Richard Mourdock, is the state's treasurer. The next hero on deck, Texas's Ted Cruz, was an attorney for the federal government and the state of Texas. Behold, more evidence of one of the great 2012 trends--the gentling and education of the GOP primary voter. In Indiana, Tea Party activists realized that they needed to coalesce behind one candidate to beat Lugar, so they did. In Washington, the permanent conservative establishment realized how risky it was to let untested first-termers win primaries. There's more vetting now; there are fewer amateurs surging ahead. The next month will test the pros. On Aug. 7, Missouri Republicans will decide whether to let businessman John Brunner grab their Senate nomination, instead of a state treasurer or a member of Congress. One week later, Wisconsin Republicans will get a choice between former Gov. Tommy Thompson, former Rep. Mark Neumann, the president of the state Senate ... and Eric Hovde, a high-fiving hedge fund manager worth at least $50 million. And on Aug. 28, Arizona Republicans get a chance to ditch Rep. Jeff Flake for Tim Cardon, another businessman who's never run for anything. Each of these races is competitive. Polling suggests that the novices will make it more competitive--better for the Democrats. And the choosiest conservative groups are backing the guys who've already served in politics and who've already been vetted. Sen. Jim DeMint, whose Senate Conservatives Fund got behind a number of 2010 losers, has resolutely backed Wisconsin's Neumann. He and Rand Paul--an ophthalmologist before he got to the Senate--cut video for the state GOP convention to sell the guy who'd served from 1993 to 1999. ""Mark Neumann was one of the first conservatives I'd heard about,"" said DeMint. ""When he was in Congress in the 1990s, he was a legend!"" ""Every Republican is not created equal,"" said Paul. ""Many Republicans are for a balanced budget, but few Republicans will have the courage to propose and vote for a balanced budget."" That's what you hear from all the groups that back Neumann--the Club for Growth, Citizens United. Why take a chance on a capitalist who hasn't ever had to cast tough votes? This is awfully tough on the capitalists. Robert Blaha spent $700,000 of his own money against Colorado Rep. Doug Lamborn. What was his beef? ""We have 9.2 percent unemployment in this area,"" Blaha told me, ""and Lamborn hasn't done anything to fix that. He hasn't sponsored a single successful bill."" The Club for Growth, which had boosted Lamborn to Congress in the first place, helped rescue him. That the ""permanent political class"" came out didn't surprise Blaha. The loss, coming after that great wave of amateurs--that sort of surprised him. ""Had I run in 2010, would I have won? I think I might have."" On Friday, the Club for Growth ran its first Wisconsin TV ad. It's a concise double-barreled shot at Hovde and Thompson, pronouncing the rich guy ""worse"" than the former HHS because he once talked about raising taxes and he donated $500 to little-loved former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. (Hovde has said he'd ""like his money back"" for that and his spokesman Sean Lansing theorized that the donation was ""likely the result of a business relationship."" But Friday's other Wisconsin news was a new endorsement--of Hovde, by the PAC of Dick Armey's group FreedomWorks. They made the call after e-mailing their membership in the state--around 22,000 conservatives--based on Friedrich von Hayek's principle that ""knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place"" helps make the best decisions. The activists broke big for Hovde. ""Neumann I thought would be more popular,"" said  FreedomWorks' Max Pappas. ""But I think they're tired of retreads. I've been hearing this from Wisconsin guys since the fall, you know--we want someone else like Ron Johnson."""	Is the Tea Party Selling Out?
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/07/mitt_romney_was_booed_when_he_addressed_the_naacp_.html	"Mitt Romney was booed. It was a good day for Mitt Romney. When the Republican nominee told the NAACP that he was committed to eliminating Obamacare, audience members shouted out. The negative reception might have been momentarily jarring to the candidate, but the moment had a political upside. It offered a chance for a candidate criticized for his malleability to look principled in the face of opposition. That might not have mattered to the audience in the auditorium, but as Romney advisers explain, this speech was not just aimed at the people sitting in their seats or African American voters in general. Like Romney's contentious visit to the largely African-American school in West Philadelphia weeks ago, this speech was aimed at rounding out Romney's image. ""I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president,"" he said. Hearing this, swing voters might think Gov. Romney has a bigger heart than those mean Democratic ads claiming he sent jobs overseas. At the very least the speech, and the negative reaction it provoked, replaced the outsourcing of American jobs as the political topic of the day. That may be the biggest political benefit of all of Mitt Romney's NAACP speech: He changed the conversation. In an election that is so close, both campaigns seem less concerned about the substance of their argument than that the argument take place on favorable turf. On issues from health care to charges and counter-charges about outsourcing, both Romney and Obama are willing to endure boos, howls from fact-checkers, and even some cries of hypocrisy if it will keep the argument on the topics that do them the most political good. Romney was also applauded by the NAACP audience, as his supporters were quick to point out. True, but it's in their candidate's interest to get booed and to have that booing reported. Quiet golf clapping and even sustained applause would rob Romney of explaining how steadfast he is going to be in the interviews that followed. It would weaken the Daniel in the Lion's Den story. Big deal Daniel, the lion's just purred at you. This is why, when candidate Obama in 2008 told of being grumbled at by auto executives for his position on auto emissions, he left out the part about how they gave him a standing ovation at the end of the speech. The boos are particularly helpful in building ties with conservatives who prize constancy in the face of opposition among all political attributes and who have specific concerns about Romney's commitment to repealing the president's health care plan. It should be noted that the appearance of bravery is distinct from actual bravery. This was not a Sister Soulja moment, named for Bill Clinton's comments at a conference sponsored by the Rainbow Coalition criticizing a popular rap artist for contributing to the coarsening of the culture. Jeb Bush talking about his party's strict views on immigration is the closest thing to a popular GOP official challenging his base. In this case, Romney was telling leaders of a community disproportionately lacking quality health care that legislation expanding the system is a bad thing. Romney asked the audience to see his heart, but after so quickly dismissing this policy that has deep consequences for the African-American community he offered no alternative health care vision or hint that he understood the depth of the need that Obamacare--as flawed as it may be--was trying to meet. (When Romney later suggested those who had booed simply wanted more ""free stuff,"" that probably made it harder to see his heart.) Gov. Romney was also willing to endure a few uncomfortable moments when he recently declared that the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act was a tax. That statement contradicted a senior aide who had labeled it a penalty and contradicted Romney's position as governor of Massachusetts. But it put him in sync with GOP Congressional leaders accusing President Obama of advocating a new tax. As one Republican official argued, the Romney campaign was happy to have an extended debate about the tax issue, even if it momentarily touched on Romney's possible lack of conviction, because all voters would hear was a debate about taxes. Any time the debate is about taxes, argue strategists for both parties, it's a good argument for the Republican candidate. Voters just tend to trust Republicans to give them lower taxes, which they'd prefer. Also, for Romney his pitch to independent voters who don't like the law is that if he's elected the tax will disappear. If Obama stays, it won't. President Obama is also willing to take his own hits to keep the argument on his turf. His campaign is running a variety of ads charging Romney with outsourcing jobs while the head of Bain Capital. A variety of fact-checking organizations have called the president on it, giving him the most negative ratings possible, challenging his assertions, and saying his campaign can't back up its claims. Yet, the ads are still running. The Obama campaign is convinced the TV attacks are working because any conversation about outsourcing is one Democrats think they are going to win. The idea is unpopular and voters are likely to believe that the candidate who sells himself as a business guy and whose firm sometimes shuttered factories was the one involved in outsourcing. When Mitt Romney retaliates that Obama is the ""outsourcer-in-chief,"" it's not likely to be that effective because voters are not predisposed to believe that of President Obama. (In addition to the fact that the charge is pretty weak.) The Obama campaign is also running an ad making a claim about Romney's position on abortion that is wafer-thin, as Time's Michael Scherer demonstrates. But a fight about women's reproductive issues is a fight Democrats are happy to have; it is more than worth enduring a few boos from the crowd. Though the president makes it sound like he is the overwhelming victim of negative ads, that's not so. President Obama is a long way from the 2008 candidate who used to inveigh against political game playing. Though, even at the time, Obama was willing to say one thing and do another, and his campaign ran more negative ads than any in history. This is further confirmation of an essential truth both campaigns have embraced about fact checking: The upside from a strong distortion is better than the downside from the hall monitors. If you're not getting four Pinocchios or a pants-on-fire, you're not doing it right. Let them boo--as long as the message gets through."	Why Romney Welcomed the NAACP's Boos

The service it provides, in 13 cities (14 if you count the Hamptons as separate from New York), makes life easier for reasonably affluent people. You download a smartphone app, call a luxury sedan to your doorstep, and pay double the rate of a taxi. When Time's Andrew Ferguson needed a framing device for his story about the capital's young elites, he came up with ""Uber-Washington."" I've never actually used Uber. Saying that is not saying, ""I enjoy D.C. cabs."" Nobody says that. Few cabs in this city take credit cards. Many of them give blank paper slips in lieu of receipts, which seems like unofficial discrimination against people who file expense reports. If you've ever arrived at Union Station or Reagan National Airport in the late evening, you'd settle for some of that--if you could find a cab. Yes, sure, I've enjoyed watching Lincoln Navigators pull up to dive bars and reveal a cargo of scruffy twentysomethings. But I've been rooting for Uber because the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia taxi regime is atrocious, and atrocious service-providers sometimes get scared straight by competition. That theory was tested on Monday. The city's Taxicab Commission despises Uber, makes a strong case that it's illegal, and has conducted several stings against it. So the San Francisco-based company had been negotiating with D.C. councilwoman Mary Cheh--who represents the most wealthy, least black ward in the city--to settle the legal questions in a comprehensive taxi reform bill. Cheh's bill would drag taxis into the latter part of the 20st century, with mandatory credit-card swipers, GPS tracking, and uniform lights. (In D.C., it's not unheard of to try and flag down a cab with its light on and then notice that there's already a passenger inside.) As far as Cheh could tell, she had solved Uber's problems. Her amendment legalized the service, and mandated that ""minimum fare for sedan-class vehicles shall be five times the drop rate for taxicabs."" The luxury service was safe--right up until 3 p.m. yesterday, when the Uber website alerted users to the D.C. council's plan, informing them that a five-times-the-cab-price rule would effectively stop the rollout of a new, low-cost UberX service. The Internet--the favorite hangout of Uber-Washington--brimmed with white-hot anger. National tech sites piled on. ""Uber cannot catch a break in Washington, DC,"" reported TechCrunch. The names and emails of D.C. councilmembers were posted on Uber's site, on Facebook, on Change.org. As far as Uber-Washington could tell, the Jell-O-brained D.C. council was going to do the bidding of cab companies and kill a great service. On Tuesday morning, I climbed aboard the gentrifier's preferred mode of transportation--the lightweight bicycle--and pedaled downhill to the John A. Wilson Building, where Uber's fate would be decided.* No yuppies or Uber-ers had made it down. The sidewalk was occupied by more than a hundred cab drivers, hoisting signs of identical size and font with alternating slogans. ""Bill 19-630 Is Approval of Apartheid."" ""Why Does the City Council Want to Destroy Taxidrivers' Livelihood?"" ""Don't Forget the Elections Are Coming Up Soon."" Uber had to fail. ""They take away our business,"" said Abdulwahab Abdulwahab, a Yemeni-American who has been driving a cab for 28 years. If the city let Uber operate without more regulations, it would hurt him. If the city forced him to put a GPS in his car, that would hurt him, too, by centralizing something he preferred to keep independent. The first fight was easier to win, as long as Uber was forced to choke down the price hike. Larry Frankel, the lion-maned chairman of the Dominion of Cab Drivers, worked through the crowd explaining the stakes. ""Uber can't have this pass,"" he told Abdulwahab. ""If this passes, it'll be the second urban area to undo [Uber]. The suggestion came from Las Vegas. What they did was raise the price to $40, minimum. Instead, what Cheh did was raise it five times."" This was almost true. In Las Vegas, Uber got classified as a livery business. The city already had laws about the minimum rates for those businesses, and--almost as importantly--the city didn't have all of the same problems with cabs. Only around a third of D.C. cabs have credit-card machines. D.C. cabs can't pick up passengers from the airports in Virginia. They're protected, in other words, by bad laws.* Cheh had thought she was fixing that, but she'd been blindsided. Before the meeting, unbeknownst to most of the protesters outside, Cheh buckled and withdrew her Uber amendment. ""I'd talked to Uber many, many times,"" she told reporters. She'd found out about the ""save Uber"" campaign when an aide saw it online and alerted her. ""What I will do is introduce legislation when we're back in September,"" said Cheh with a shrug. ""We have this recess in July and August, and that could be interesting. Right now, they're operating illegally. That's how the Taxicab Commission was treating them. We were trying to exempt them from regulation and let them operate."" Taxi drivers, many of them African immigrants with halting English, filed into the council room, not far from Taxicab Commission's glowering chairman Ron Linton. They watched the Uber amendment be withdrawn. Not what they wanted--the price rule would have been nice--but at least Uber wasn't getting a special favor. And right then Jack Evans, a councilman from another largely white ward, asked to read his own amendment. He'd introduced it alongside Tommy Wells, David Catania, and Michael Brown--the latter two at-large members of the council, the former two both white. Evans wanted to add language so that ""a business that uses a mobile phone application to provide service shall be exempt from regulation."" That would have been a get-out-of-jail-free card for Uber. The cabbies bristled and groaned. Now, finally, the councilmembers who represented the less white parts of D.C. could take their whacks. Marion Barry, the former mayor who now represents the city's poorest, most black ward, asked the council to think of the people behind the wheels. ""What this company is doing is having a great dent on D.C. taxi drivers,"" Barry intoned, with maximum pathos. ""They have no retirement, no benefits, no health care."" He'd met with some of the drivers outside, and he felt their pain. ""I'm a friend of the taxi industry. They've been political friends of mine. They're outraged."" Over to Vincent Orange, the black council at-large member who'd also rallied protesters outside. ""I'm pretty appalled,"" he said.* ""Someone's in California, he didn't like the bill that was cut out with Councilmember Cheh, and then all of a sudden, all these emails came in, but he's not from the District of Columbia! I don't know who this person is."" Cheh had actually been negotiating with the D.C. branch of Uber, but the ""California"" point was packed with meaning. Orange didn't think his colleagues were thinking of real Washingtonians. But that didn't fly. The other councilmember who represents the poorer parts of D.C., east of the Anacostia River, is Yvette Alexander. She didn't back the Uber waiver, necessarily. But she understood why she was hearing so much from constituents about a pricey, snobby service. ""Uber does come east of the river without hesitation,"" said Alexander. ""When somebody calls Uber, they are there. For the fact that Uber does come out, I really do support them. For the members of the taxicab industry that is in this chamber, you really need to take note."" That didn't quiet down the ""nay"" votes. The Uber amendment, in whatever form, was going to be withdrawn. The council was going to keep the status quo, with Uber operating in the shadow of the law, as it voted to put more demands on cabs. But the pro-Uber caucus used its opportunity to explain why low standards and stupid regulations had made this business model vulnerable. ""We should be embracing more of this technology,"" said Catania. ""If regulation meant high quality service at a good value, then D.C. would have the best service in the nation. The fact that people are willing to pay more for Uber should tell you something."" Correction, July 10, 2012: This article originally misstated the name of the John A. Wilson Building, as well as the title of D.C. councilmember Vincent Orange. The article also incorrectly stated that D.C. cabs cannot take passengers to Virginia airports."	How D.C.'s Corrupt Taxicab Cartel Lived To See Another Day 
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/07/florida_looks_ready_to_repeat_many_of_the_same_mistakes_in_how_it_conducts_its_elections.html	"Shortly before the 2000 election, Michael Obregon contacted the Miami-Dade Office of the Supervisor of Elections. Heads up: He had a new address in the city. Where should he go to cast his vote? ""I received a letter,"" remembers Obregon, ""one page, saying I wasn't eligible to vote because I had a felony on my record."" He takes out the letter--he keeps it in a manila envelope labeled ""Vote Problem""--and reads the warning: ""The court system has notified the elections department that you are ineligible to vote. Pursuant to statute 98.093, we have removed your name from the voter registration record. You may contact the office of executive clemency."" The problem: Obregon hadn't committed a felony. Someone had apparently stolen the Bennigan's bartender's identity, opened some accounts, and gotten busted. That information churned into the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which alerted the Florida Department of State, which passed the information on to the local supervisor's office, which kicked the nonfelonious Obregon off the rolls. ""I had to send my fingerprints in,"" says Obregon, ""so I went to the police station, they took them, they sent them in. I got back a copy of my criminal record. It said, 'There is no felony here.' "" Thus began a mission to convince state bureaucrats in Tallahassee that he deserved the vote. It's an ongoing mission. Twelve years later, Obregon still isn't on the rolls. As Obregon gives me more details and read from more paperwork, I grow progressively dumbfounded. Millions of people choose not to vote or forget come Election Day. But how do you let a state's bureaucracy bounce you around for 12 years? Eventually, even if the various state agencies change their numbers or blow you off, don't you try to go above them? ""I could probably try harder,"" says Obregon, ""but I just get discouraged."" Here's the paradox of the new voter ID crackdown, of the 38 states that have debated or passed legislation that puts more demands on voters. The new laws--and in Florida, new executive campaigns--ask voters to show driver's licenses at the polls, or prove their eligibility with birth certificates, or prove that they've never had a felony, or prove that they are citizens of the United States. Doing that involves navigating your state's bureaucracies. Those bureaucracies have been shrunk or frozen by years of belt-tightening. They rely on data from other cost-cutting organs of the state. Imagine giving some endomorphic amateur athlete a low-calorie diet and limited access to a gym. He's training for a mile-long fun run, so there's no pressure. All of a sudden, you panic about the threat of Sprinting Fraud or something, and you inform the runner of his new task: Run a timed 3.5-mile circuit, tomorrow. Florida, stereotypically enough, demonstrates some of the problems. Obregon was caught up in a notorious purge of felons based on a list so flawed that perhaps 20,000 people were disenfranchised by accident. Legislators, disturbed by fraud in a 1997 Miami mayoral race, hired the now-defunct Database Technologies to compile its list. Atlanta-based ChoicePoint bought DBT before the 2000 election, so it fell to them to explain--in front of courts and special civil rights committees--how it got screwed up so badly. ""Once DBT created a list of potential felons, using loose standards, it was handed to election commissioners,"" explains former ChoicePoint spokesman James Lee. ""That was where the system broke down. Some commissioners did the work. Some set them aside. Some took the lists at face value and said, 'Well, they developed this, and they're experts, so they must be right.' "" Florida, compelled by the Help America Vote Act, spent the next decade trying to avoid another DBT-style bungle. And then came Gov. Rick Scott. He'd once been listed (mistakenly) as dead, shrugged, and cast a provisional ballot, assured that his vote would count. (HAVA created provisional ballots for people who show up at the polls, aren't on the registration list, and can prove that the state got it wrong. Floridians cast 35,365 of them in the 2008 election, and slightly more than half got counted.) Early in his term, Scott asked his secretary of state, Kurt Browning, how they could make sure noncitizens didn't cast votes. Browning put the state elections division to work on compiling a loose list of noncitizens, using the databases available to them--transportation, law enforcement, and so forth. When he left office in January, the state was still whittling down a list of 25,000 bogus voters, which he knew included false positives. And then, according to Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo, Browning's replacement got spooked by a local news report on felon voters. In April, the state sent out a pared-down list of 2,700 potential noncitizens. After that, a circus: World War II veterans holding press conferences to explain how they were cheated and three federal lawsuits that have ended, for now, in what Pasco County Elections Supervisor Brian Corley calls ""limbo."" ""We sent out certified letters to the 13 people on our list,"" he remembers. ""They said, basically: Hey, the state of Florida thinks you may not be citizen. Of the 13 people, we only reached four. Two of them were not happy and faxed us their birth certificates. Two of them weren't citizens. Which leaves nine people in limbo."" If anyone has figured out how to navigate the noncitizen voter problem, he has not revealed the trick. James O'Keefe, the conservative investigative journalist, has dispatched his Project Veritas reporters to multiple swing states (and D.C.) to prove that anyone can steal a voter's identity if the state doesn't ask for ID. In North Carolina, O'Keefe used jury pool lists to find noncitizens and show how they could sneak into the polls. But the lists were flawed, and two of the supposed noncitizens in the video turned out to be naturalized, eligible voters. ""Citizens can indicate they are a noncitizen on those forms to get out of jury service,"" explains O'Keefe. ""You pull the records of all registered voters and cross-tabulate the lists. Many of the people who claim they are noncitizens perjure themselves--as was the case with one of the individuals in our film."" And the records are incomplete. ""Some counties destroy the original jury refusals, leaving you only with data you can't verify."" It's difficult to prove that noncitizens are on the rolls, and it's not like there's proof that these voters are skewing elections. ""I don't think there's a huge running to the polls of noncitizens,"" says Corley. ""The last thing you want to do in that situation is draw attention to yourself."" But if you want a new law that the government is seriously ill-equipped to enforce, look to Mississippi. In order to get a free voter ID card there, you need to supply a birth certificate. Some women, with new married names, are unable to use birth certificates to prove their identity. If they lack copies of their birth certificates, they need to apply for them with--of course--some kind of ID card. And here's the irony. Michael Obregon, who can't vote, has a passport. He got his first one ""as a kid."" He renewed it ""a couple of years ago."" Getting a passport means showing the State Department proof of identity and sending them $165. The passport system wasn't concocted in a hurry due to a legislative-media panic. It doesn't require multiple state agencies to work in concert, quickly and seamlessly. And so you get attrition, you get paranoia, and you don't get any closer to a voter-checking system that works. ""I don't know if I trust the whole system, you know?"" says Obregon. ""I mean, how hard did they check to see if my civil rights were being taken away?"""	Has Florida Learned Anything About How To Hold an Election?

Was he attempting to preserve the integrity and reputation of the court? Was he somehow bullied or intimidated by liberals, the president, or powerful Democratic interests? Was he--perish the thought--attempting to apply the law to the best of his ability? Fueling the speculation over the court's unexpected decision was CBS' Jan Crawford's report last week that Roberts may have been against the ACA before he was for it--that he likely switched his vote at the last minute to rescue, rather than strike down, the individual mandate, which stipulates that all Americans buy health insurance or pay a penalty/tax/what-will-you. Roberts, according to an anonymous leak, was poised to side with the four conservative justices when he turned ""wobbly."" Weeks earlier, at a reunion event at Princeton, Ramesh Ponnuru, perhaps referring to the same source, echoed: ""There seem to have been some second thoughts. Not on the part of Justice Kennedy, but on the part of Chief Justice Roberts, who seems to be going a little bit wobbly."" Since then, ""wobbly"" has fastened itself to the chief justice like a barnacle of GOP resentment. ""Wobbly Roberts. It rolls right off the tongue,"" wrote blogger Pawpaw: ""The simple Google string, John Roberts Wobbly, returns 163,000 results, and this is just Monday morning. That's your legacy, sir."" ""Roberts Wobbles and Falls Down,"" taunted another site. Even the mainstream media has picked up the epithet: The Washington Post's Charles Lane refers ironically to ""that wobbly John Roberts,"" and the word also surfaces, with respect to Roberts, in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Post, the New York Times, and others. But the ""wobbly"" paper trail stretches back at least to May, when Michael McGough wrote a story entitled ""Conservatives worry Roberts will 'go wobbly' on 'Obamacare.' "" In the piece, published as wonks across the country speculated about the possible fallout from the Supreme Court oral arguments, McGough challenged a notion put forth by Kathleen Parker, George Will, and the Wall Street Journal's opinion editors--that the left was strong-arming the chief justice by threatening to tar him as a judicial activist if he tore down Obama's signature law. (Parker and company were responding in part to a Jeffrey Rosen article in The New Republic that suggested a 5-4 vote against the ACA would enter history books as ""an irredeemable failure."" And they cited similar ""unsubtle intimations"" from Sen. Patrick Leahy on the Senate floor.) What is this ""wobbly?"" It seems part of a narrative produced by conservatives and decried by liberals, one in which the upright but susceptible Roberts succumbs to pressure from the left in a moment of tragic weakness. That tale, meanwhile, is a consolation prize for folks that fervently hoped--even expected--the Supreme Court to fragment along party lines and deliver Republicans the victory. Conveniently, it casts Democrats as a bunch of unprincipled thugs defiling our government systems. In another sense, ""wobbly"" is our signal that Roberts, politician or no, committed the cardinal sin of politics last week: He changed his mind. Before wobbly we had ""Etch-a-Sketch"" and before that we had ""flip-flopper."" They carry slightly different connotations, but each boils down to the same pith. Once you're elected or appointed to public office, your opinions are no longer your own. They become the property of your political party; altering them without permission is the worst form of betrayal; the free to-and-fro of an agile, independent intellect is suddenly a liability. We tend to assume that every time a public official changes his mind, it's because he never really believed his original talking points. Either that or his earlier views hold firm, but he has opted to play-act for political advantage. (Romney has criticized Roberts' decision. One would think that, if anyone had sympathy for a public official who changed his mind, it would be the erstwhile architect of Massachusetts' health care mandate.) Take the reaction to President Obama's endorsement of gay marriage. Many pundits found it almost impossible to imagine that POTUS' stance had truly, organically evolved over the years--even if those years were notable for bringing homosexuality more into the mainstream. This distrust of ideological adaptiveness wasn't always the norm. In fact, a healthy appreciation for mental flexibility dates back to the fifth century B.C., when the historian Thucydides, setting down a funeral oration by Athenian statesman Pericles, wrote that the city-state profited from its citizens' ability to adjust their ideas to the times. ""I say that Athens is the school of Hellas, and that the individual Athenian in his own person seems to have the power of adapting himself to the most varied forms of action with the utmost versatility and grace,"" Thucydides reports that Pericles claimed. Rather than iron-clad convictions, Athenians cultivated open minds. And successful politicians have often switched paths mid-career. The young Ronald Reagan identified as a liberal Democrat, not to mention a Hollywood heartthrob. Tony Blair went through a Tory phase before landing solidly in the Labour camp. Sens. Arlen Specter and Joe Lieberman strayed from the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively, to pursue more individualized platforms. Meanwhile, in 2012, ""wobbly"" is the new meme that's emerged to indict Roberts for thinking one thing and then, a little later and upon more reflection, thinking another. The chief justice has wandered into the territory of the American political bogeyman--that spineless (often effete or out-of-touch) flibbertigibbet who doesn't stand for anything. (It's no coincidence that, faced with the prospect of flip-flopper Kerry in 2004, the country re-elected a man known for ""staying the course."") One problem is that wobbly, which suggests ""small uncontrollable bodily movements,"" banishes the possibility that changing one's mind can be moral, tactical--even noble. It implies some sort of built-in deficiency that prevents one from standing up straight. But I prefer to think of the wobbling of a compass needle just before it locks into the right position. It would be a shame if the flip-flopping bugbear loomed so large over American politics that our public officials didn't feel safe revising their old opinions into even better ones. Because, if Roberts did change his mind, so what? Why shouldn't he be open to persuasion? Why shouldn't a Supreme Court justice consider an issue from all 360 degrees, confident in his life tenure and his unaccountability to the world outside the courtroom? As foolish as it is to encourage judges to hide from potentially convincing arguments in the papers, on the news, in the mouths of friends or foes, it's even more insulting to imply that they can't withstand the gales of public opinion. ""Give [Roberts] some credit for knowing his own mind,"" chided McGough in May. And, as may be the case, for changing it."	"Why There Is Nothing Wrong With Going ""Wobbly."""

Like, for instance ... well ... hmm. We're billed as the land of the free, but we're actually 47th in press freedom according to Reporters Without Borders, behind Botswana and El Salvador. We're 10th in economic freedom, according to the Heritage Foundation--not bad, but not quite on the level of Canada or Mauritius. We're 51st in math and science education, according to the World Economic Forum. We spend by far the most on health care, but can't crack the top 20 in life expectancy. And while we remain the richest country in terms of gross domestic product, we're anywhere from sixth to 19th in per-capita income, depending on how you count. (Plus, no one expects us to hold off China for long when it comes to GDP.) So what do we lead the world in? If you believe Will McAvoy, the news anchor on Aaron Sorkin's The Newsroom, the United States is tops in just three things: ""number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending."" Actually, McAvoy is forgetting a litany of other horrible metrics in which the United States ranks first. There's also obesity, divorce, illegal drug use, pornography, student loan debt--the list goes on. But come on--don't we lead the world in anything we can be proud of? Indeed, we do! To celebrate July 4, here is a list of some rather obvious, some surprising, and some genuinely inspiring achievements that put the ""exceptional"" in ""American exceptionalism."" Cheese. No one churns out pressed milk curds like we do. (Well, unless you count the European Union's 27 members as a single entity--but let's not.) Here's to you, Wisconsin. And while we're on the subject of agriculture: The United States dominates the global standings in both beef and corn production as well. Olympic medals. We're tops among men and women, in summer and winter. Foreign aid. The United States gives the most overall for both development and humanitarian purposes. Sure, Norway gives more per capita. But we have more a lot more capitas. Billionaires. We may no longer have the world's richest person--that's Mexico's Carlos Slim--but we still have 11 of the top 20, from Gates to Buffett to Sheldon Adelson. And we have more than 400 billionaires total, suggesting that even when the United States is no longer the richest country, it will remain the best country in which to get rich. Roads. Our highways and byways sport some potholes, but we still have a lot more miles paved than any other country. Good thing, because we also own the most cars. And sticking with infrastructure, we no longer have any of the world's five tallest buildings, but we do top the list in innovative building design, according to a recent study in KPMG. Whatever that means, we'll take it! CO2 emission reductions. No, this statistic does not come from some parallel universe in which Al Gore defeated George W. Bush. According to the International Energy Agency, the United States' economic slowdown and natural gas boom have combined to make it the world's largest reducer of carbon emissions since 2006, cutting 7.7 percent. Who needs the Kyoto Protocol when we've got fracking? Patents. Americans aren't actually filing the most patents per year anymore--that honor goes to China, followed by Japan. But more patents are filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office than anywhere else, with nonresidents now making up about half of the total. Worker productivity. Norway's workers contribute more productivity per hour, but they also take more vacations, according to a 2008 report. On a per-year basis, our sweat and sleeplessness pay off--for our employers, anyway. Research universities. Starting with Harvard, MIT, and Yale, the United States has 13 of the top 20 in U.S. News' global rankings. Rollercoasters. With 658 coasters, some 40 of which loop the loop, the United States leads China in both quantity and quality. Marine protected areas. The United States has more than 225 areas under protection. Is that better than just having one or two gigantic areas under protection? Perhaps not for the fish, but if nothing else, it reflects a serious effort to balance the interests of conservation and commerce. Cats and dogs. Americans own millions more of both than the residents of any other country. Second-place Brazil has fewer than half as many dogs. Legal immigrants. A whopping 35.5 million as of 2005. Our immigration system may be broken, but it's not as broken as a lot of other countries' immigration systems. Generosity. What American decline? The United States jumped from fifth place to first in the U.K.-based Charity Aid Foundation's latest World Giving Index, which grades countries on three metrics: volunteering, helping strangers, and donating money. Patriotism. Even if the facts don't always bear us out, we're still convinced that our country is tops. In a World Values Survey, 77 percent of Americans reported being ""very proud of their nationality,"" more than any other country polled. Well, technically, we were tied for first with Ireland. And the survey in question is from the 1990s. But how else could you explain all those people still singing along with Lee Greenwood every Fourth of July? Media. We have the most newspapers, radios, television broadcast stations, and hours of television watched per day. Oops, maybe that last one isn't so inspiring. But hey, it's a holiday. Go ahead and enjoy the fireworks on your boob tube. In the land of the 47th-most-free, no one's going to stop you. Thanks to Natasha Geiling for research assistance."

In the wake of the Affordable Care Act ruling, the Obama administration and the Mitt Romney campaign have agreed to define the same taxlike object not as a tax but as a penalty. This rare act of bipartisan agreement likely denies Romney a potent tax argument against the president, but that may be wise since the argument can be used against Romney, too. Chief Justice Roberts saved the Affordable Care Act by finding that its individual mandate was constitutional under Congress' power to tax. ""Hurray!,"" said White House aides, but also: Don't you dare call it a tax. The enforcement mechanism that pushes people to buy insurance should be called a penalty. It only acts as a tax on those who don't buy insurance. That's likely to be only 1 percent of the public, so it shouldn't be considered a tax. Republican leaders reacted to this line of reasoning: Nuts to that. Even if the distinction between penalty and tax were legally valid enough to convince a majority of five justices, the argument could never survive in the political arena. If John Roberts conveyed legitimacy of the law by upholding it, then surely he conveyed the same legitimacy upon the idea that the Affordable Care Act was a secret tax increase, despite the president's insistence to the contrary (here, here, and here). Republican super PACs such as American Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity launched million-dollar campaigns hitting Obama on the tax. ""Now it's official: Obama increased taxes on struggling families,"" one ad says. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, arguing that the president's health care law was one long string of deceptions, said that the court's decision about taxation was: ... powerful confirmation of what may have been the biggest deception of all. For years, the President and his Democrat allies in Congress have sworn up and down that failing to comply with the individual mandate did not result in a tax on individuals or families. And the reason was obvious: if Americans knew that failure to comply resulted in a tax hike, it never would have passed. And the President wouldn't be able to claim his health care bill didn't raise taxes on the middle class, as he did, again, and again, and again. Well, yesterday the court blew the President's cover. It narrowly upheld this law on one basis only: that the penalty associated with the individual mandate is a tax. On Sunday, the clever McConnell offered one more strategic benefit to the tax interpretation. Since Roberts had upheld the law on tax grounds, it meant that repealing the dreaded individual mandate would be easier. Under Senate rules for reconciliation, only 51 votes are required to pass a vote if it has budgetary impact. A mere penalty would not have such impact and require 60 votes. But now that Roberts had ruled, the lower threshold to overturning the legislation could now be used. The president's opponents were helped in the early rounds because White House aides had worked themselves into contortions trying to argue that the concept of taxation that had saved the law did not apply to the law once it had been saved. Schrodinger's Tax: It is both a tax and not a tax. Mitt Romney's campaign aides said the president was now in a box. He had to decide whether the individual mandate was a constitutional tax or an unconstitutional penalty. If the president were to cop to the tax, he'd embrace the big-taxing-liberal label. Cop to the penalty label, and he invalidates his own law. The problem with this reasoning was Mitt Romney's advocacy for his health care law in Massachusetts. That law relies on a mechanism to enforce the individual mandate similar to the one in Obama's law. If a Massachusetts resident cannot prove on his tax forms that he has insurance, and is not eligible for a subsidy, he pays a higher tax rate. Gov. Romney doesn't talk about his health care law a lot now, but it was once considered his signature legislative accomplishment. When he talked about it, he repeatedly referred to this enforcement mechanism as a tax, not as a penalty. (See, for example, here, here, here, and here). He boasted about this tax because in his view, it was in keeping with a fundamental Republican notion about personal behavior. "" Using tax penalties, as we did, or tax credits, as others have proposed, encourages ""free riders"" to take responsibility for themselves rather than pass their medical costs on to others."" If Mitch McConnell was right and Barack Obama was a sneaky promulgator of tax hikes, then Mitt Romney was an unapologetic tax raiser. On Monday, Romney's top adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, changed the definition of Romney's Massachusetts plan. Though Romney had repeatedly called his Massachusetts provision a tax, Fehrnstrom was now calling it a penalty. With the move, the idea that such labels were interchangeable became less laughable. Obama aides seemed a little silly when they used search and replace to swap penalty for tax, but then Romney's man stepped in and performed the exact opposite switcheroo. GOP leaders have long suggested that once a thing had been called a tax, it must forever be known as such. But their party nominee was proving it was possible for one person to call a thing a tax and another to call the same thing a penalty. In Mitt Romney's case, the two opinions were being held by the same person: Mitt Romney. That significantly undermined the political argument. Though Romney's past gums up the politics a bit for Republicans, as a legal matter he is still on firm ground. Romney can still argue that he was justified in imposing a tax, I mean penalty, because he had that authority as a governor. The Massachusetts courts found that in the only significant challenge to Romney's 2006 law. It focused on this penalty, I mean tax, and the courts threw it out, ruling it was allowed under the state's ""police power"" to put such laws in place Alas, you can imagine why it might be politically difficult for Romney to turn this legal support for his position into a winning boast on the campaign trail: I passed a penalty to ensure the individual mandate using police power! Still, states are allowed such broad power under the 10th Amendment. A president and Congress don't have that kind of latitude to tell people what to do. Unless, of course, you think of it as a tax."

The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision upholding Obama's Affordable Care Act led to rejoicing on the left and fiery, petty, and glum denunciations on the right. On Thursday, we saw conservatives pass through eight stages of grief. The first: denial. A representative example came courtesy of freshman Sen. Rand Paul, who said in a statement: ""Just because a couple people on the Supreme Court declare something to be 'constitutional' does not make it so. The whole thing remains unconstitutional.""* Sarah Palin's Facebook page opened a window onto the reverse psychology and delusional chest-thumping stage. ""Thank you, SCOTUS. This Obamacare ruling fires up the troops as America's eyes are opened! Thank God,"" the former vice presidential candidate posted. The politically grief-stricken are also sometimes known to exhibit melodramatic rage. In a private House GOP meeting, Indiana Rep. Mike Pence outrageously compared the SCOTUS verdict to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, reports Politico. Also in the rage and melodrama category: Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli tweeted, ""This is a dark day for the American people, the Constitution, and the rule of law. This is a dark day for American liberty."" And Ben Shapiro of Breitbart added: ""This is the greatest destruction of individual liberty since Dred Scott. This is the end of America as we know it. No exaggeration."" Meanwhile, Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia found himself in the anguished stream of metaphors stage. ""Chief Justice Roberts once said that the Supreme Court's job is to apply the law--'to call balls and strikes, not to pitch or bat,' "" the congressman opined in a statement. ""He couldn't have been more right in saying so, and he couldn't have been more wrong by choosing to circumvent the Constitution this morning. Even worse, I fear that the High Court has opened Pandora's box."" In Washington, self-promotion is a normal, inevitable part of the grieving process. ""Stand with House Republicans and our fight for #FullRepeal #4jobs. Show your support by supporting my campaign: http://bit.ly/Qsmp39,"" tweeted John Boehner this afternoon. With his tweet--""With #Obamacare ruling, I feel like I just lost two great friends: America and Justice Roberts""--Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston invented a new stage: petulance. Then there's speculation and play. ""Did Chief Justice Roberts vote the way he did because of bath salts?"" joked the New York Daily News' Josh Greenman, taking pleasure in the conservative defeat. And finally, resignation. ""Swore I wouldn't do it, but I just gave Mitt Romney a donation,"" tweeted Erick Erickson, editor-in-chief of RedState.com. ""Thanks John Roberts. Sigh."" Correction, June 28, 2012: This piece originally misidentified Rand Paul as a member of the House of Representatives. He is a senator. (Return.)"

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/08/pennsylvania_officials_struggle_to_explain_how_the_state_s_new_voter_id_law_would_actually_work_.html	"HARRISBURG, Pa.--For the last six business days, on the third floor of the shiny new Pennsylvania Judicial Center, government witnesses and attorneys have waged a daily competition. Who can give the least-convincing defense of the state's voter ID law? Who gets to utter the killer quote that makes the petitioners' case in Applewhite v. Pennsylvania? It should be tough to bungle. The new law, passed by state Republican legislators last year, is backed by at least 58 percent of voters. That's after months of gut-punch headlines--""Justice Department Investigates Pennsylvania Voter ID Law,"" ""Why Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Will Create Chaos on Election Day,"" and ""Pennsylvania Admits There's No In-Person Voter Fraud."" And that last headline wasn't even true. On July 25, the start of hearings on a possible injunction against the law, a lawyer from the attorney general's office had to explain that the state had merely decided to bracket voter-fraud stories and leave them out of the trial. ""That is not a concession ... that voter fraud has not happened,"" said Deputy Attorney General Patrick Cawley. ""It is a recognition that the legal standard governing these proceedings simply does not require the legislature to have proof of such incidents in order to enact a voter ID law."" Got that? The state is not trying to warm Sean Hannity's heart with angry talk about ACORN. It's only trying to defend how the new ID law has been implemented and to prove that it meets equal-protection standards. And the state is not quite getting there. Cawley's opening statement set that tone. When, he asked, was it ever unreasonable to demand ID? ""Boarding a plane, conducting financial transactions, and entering government buildings without a photo ID is virtually unthinkable in 2012,"" he said. ""You walk around this very city at lunch time and you see photo IDs dangling around people's necks or clipped to their belts."" But there's a difference between an ID for work and an ID requirement at the polls. Easy-swipe access to the office doesn't affect the ""privileges or immunities of citizens."" Access to the vote does. The anti-ID coalition in Pennsylvania--the local NAACP, the League of Women Voters, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia--has been calling witnesses who can't get IDs for picayune reasons or witnesses who can prove the state is making people pay $13.50 for ID cards when those cards should be free. During the hearings, the lawyers not currently arguing the case sit in benches behind the counsel's table and pass notes to ensure that nothing goes unasked. The government's witnesses and attorneys don't have armadas behind them. Not in the courtroom, anyway. Instead, they gamely argue the facts of the law then get trapped in logic holes, as presiding Judge Robert Simpson looks on, poker-faced. On Monday, the petitioners managed to drag David Burgess, deputy secretary for planning and service delivery, into a discussion of mismatched state voter databases. Attorney Marian Schneider got Burgess to count up all of the discrepancies, voter by voter, without context. ""Adding these three numbers together,"" she said, ""the 758,000 that you publicly disclosed don't match, plus the 130,000 that did not actually match, plus the 574,000 whose ID is expired and won't be valid for voting today--adding all three of those together equals 1,463,758?"" ""That's correct,"" said Burgess. ""So your analysis shows that there's 1,463,758 voters who don't have an ID that is valid for voting, is that right?"" ""Today, correct,"" said Burgess, agreeing to a higher possible number of disqualified voters than the state has ever contemplated. The state's attorneys steered the ship around, getting Burgess to explain that the discrepancies were ""primarily [due to] differences in the names"" on various lists. But the petitioners had proven that the people who would enforce the law are still struggling with how to discuss its specifics. That story repeated itself on Tuesday when the petitioners got to quiz the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Carol Aichele. Aichele was no naif. She arrived in Harrisburg in January 2011 as a new member of Gov. Tom Corbett's Republican administration. Her husband, Steve, became the state's new general counsel and later Corbett's chief of staff. She took command of the state's voting systems. David Gersch, a Washington-based attorney who's gotten to handle several of the most important witnesses, was able to rattle her anyway. Gersch's strategy: Rope Aichele into a discussion of minute details of the voter ID regulations until she fell out of her comfort zone. He started with questions about some relaxed ID standards for elderly people in assisted living. ""The law doesn't restrict issue of these forms of ID,"" he said, hinting at a question. ""I've not looked at the law specifically,"" said Aichele. ""It was my understanding that residents of the care facilities were allowed to get these kind of IDs. ""You believe that the law says ..."" started Gersch. ""I don't know what the law says,"" said Aichele. ""Well, the law says whatever the law says,"" shrugged Gersch. Again and again, Gersch pushed Aichele into a back-and-forth of trivial details, which inevitably led to her admission that she didn't know every cranny of the law. He displayed an email to curious voters from Aichele's ""special assistant"" Megan Sweeney, and Aichele disputed that she actually had a special assistant. ""We don't have titles in the state government,"" she said. ""I think her title is, officially, executive assistant."" It isn't. Gersch sparred with Aichele for 45-odd minutes, coaxing a few more bored-sounding answers to hypothetical questions, only once earning an objection for ""hearsay."" The state only took a third as much time with Aichele, mostly to get her on record describing how the law wouldn't cause confusion at the polls. ""Do poll workers generally know how to spell your name and find it in the poll book quickly?"" asked Cawley. ""No,"" laughed Aichele. ""Do you expect that having to use your driver's license will facilitate that process?"" asked Cawley. It would, said Aichele, but the whole discussion was orthogonal to the argument the petitioners had been making. The state kept getting stuck in those kinds of discussions. Joanne Tosti-Vasey, a former state leader of the National Organization for Women, claimed that she had proved the uselessness of the law by voting with a state lobbyist ID--not a state employee ID, as the law seemed to ask for in a section about what government IDs were included in the safe list. The petitioners and Cawley fell into a lengthy discussion, with documentation, of what includes meant. ""I really get the point,"" said Judge Simpson. The hearing ended early. There would be no more witnesses for the state and only a few more witnesses for petitioners. I used the bonus time to meet up with a local Republican strategist who'd been following the hearings as close as everybody else and had a low opinion of them. The theory: Any decision in the Commonwealth Court would be appealed to the state Supreme Court. Why play your aces when you've got a higher-stakes game coming up? Why not just let the anti-ID crowd put on a parade of sad witnesses for the media? It's a reassuring theory. If you want to save the voter ID law, you don't want to think that Round 1 of Applewhite v. Pennsylvania is the best you can do."

Dinesh D'Souza, the star and narrator of 2016: Obama's America, is telling the brief, encyclopedia-entry version of the president's life. The camera zooms over a map like one of the travel scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark--Kenya, Indonesia, Hawaii. ""On August 4, 1961,"" says D'Souza, ""Barack Obama II is born in the Kapiolani Medical Center in Honolulu. His birth is recorded in two local newspapers."" When I hear that line, my head instinctively swivels to my right, where WorldNetDaily Editor-in-Chief Joseph Farah is sitting. His website has run hundreds of stories about Barack Obama's citizenship and birth documents. WND books published Where's the Birth Certificate?, which unfortunately was published right after the president released the long-form version of the record. You can still buy ""Where's the REAL Birth Certificate?"" merch at the WND store. And now here's a movie with a $2.5 million budget that's made more than $80,000 in a four-theater run that tosses all the birther theories aside. Farah abides. He doesn't walk out. The movie is really too good to get pedantic about. There are no conspiracy theories about Obama's birth, religion, Social Security number, passport, or college transcript. Instead, there is a deep dive into Barack Obama's known Communist associates, his late father's avowed socialism, and his mother's radicalism. The first and last stories are backed up with quotes from Dreams From My Father. ""That's Dinesh,"" says co-producer Doug Sain. ""He walks on solid ground."" Let's go with ""mostly solid."" D'Souza's documentary is based largely on his book The Roots of Obama's Rage, which itself grew out of D'Souza's Forbes cover story, one of the most influential of the decade. Obama, according to D'Souza, was an anti-colonialist. ""He adopted his father's position that capitalism and free markets are code words for economic plunder,"" wrote D'Souza. ""Obama grew to perceive the rich as an oppressive class, a kind of neocolonial power within America."" Newt Gingrich recommended the theory to reporters--technically speaking, to Robert Costa and me. David Koch repeated it to a sympathetic Matthew Continetti. The theory was Swiss-cheesed with logic holes. D'Souza found great significance in how Obama ""demonizes his predecessor and his opponent,"" as if only anti-colonialists did this. D'Souza insisted that Obama using the Gulf oil spill crisis to call BP ""British Petroleum"" is Anglophobia, revealed! But Obama didn't call BP ""British Petroleum."" None of this makes it into 2016. We're taught the controversy, with a montage of D'Souza defending his thesis in front of hostile interviewers. (There's a sort of George Romero irony to these scenes, as D'Souza is filleted on shows like Countdown and Parker/Spitzer. They're gone. He's still here.) We're shown just how deeply D'Souza researched this--shot of him thumbing through Dreams before boarding an Indonesian scooter, learning to hula in Hawaii, delivering three goats to buy an interview with Obama's paternal grandmother Sarah. She turns him down. There is no Michael Moore-style waiting in the weeds to ambush a source. But there's plenty of the Moore style. D'Souza is sold to us as a smart, patriotic innocent abroad, who just wants to piece a mystery together. Almost every clue fits the puzzle. An old associate of Obama Sr. says the son and the father are basically the same. (Dad dreamed of 100 percent taxation; Junior dreams of a top marginal rate of 39.6 percent.) D'Souza asks one of Ann Dunham's professors if Obama's mother had taught the son to idolize his father. ""I hadn't thought of that!"" she says. ""I think you're right."" D'Souza walks the grounds of Obama's high school, where they teach ""oppression studies, if you will."" You don't travel that far without scoring some points. D'Souza gives considerable screen time to Paul Kengor, a (recent) scholar of Obama's teenage mentor Frank Marshall Davis. Kengor's bang-on right: Davis was an avowed Communist, and the media of 2008 didn't care. Still, the Davis story is complicated. Becoming a Soviet dupe, as Davis did, meant something for midcentury African-Americans that it doesn't mean today. Obama never pretended not to know Davis, or pretended that he was some Rockefeller Republican, or turned him into a composite character. He appears in Dreams as ""Frank,"" a ""dashiki-wearing"" friend talking ""black power."" This is a movie, sure, and you can't lard it up with every little detail, but D'Souza's question-begging and omissions lead him to oversell what he's got. Early on in the drama, D'Souza proffers this list of Obama's ""really unusual decisions, decisions you would never see a typical Democrat make."" He's edited out some of the clunkers from his book. This is the top-shelf vino. Returning a bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom. Let's give him that.

Backing ""Argentina, not Britain, in the dispute over the Falkland Islands."" Obama slipped this year and called the Falklands the ""Malvinas,"" Argentina's name for the islands. But the administration is neutral on the question, expecting a referendum to re-affirm the islanders' association with the United Kingdom, and Obama's not the first American president to stay neutral on this.

Delaying the Keystone pipeline while giving ""billions of dollars in taxpayer money"" to Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico to drill. This was a decision made by Bush-appointed members of the Export-Import Bank, not by Obama. Lowering NASA's horizon to ""reconciling with Muslims."" Our evidence is a pander-rific interview NASA administrator Charles Bolden gave to al Jazeera. ""Using force"" against ""what he calls genocide"" in Libya, but not to stop ""even greater genocide"" in Syria. Be a sport and give him this one, too, but the ""force"" in Libya consisted of a no-fly zone; the Syria situation is evolving. Dropping ""America's ally Hosni Mubarak,"" but failing to support the ""green revolution"" in Iran. Obama didn't intervene in either case, and his administration didn't call for Mubarak to step down. Making no ""meaningful"" moves against Iran's nuclear weapons programs while ""reducing stockpiles in America."" It's the most terrifying accusation in the movie. We see Obama sign the new START and cut our warhead count from 5,000 to 2,500. We see a world map where America's nuke count drops to zero as its enemies build and build. (Almost tied for scariness: A scene in which the Middle East unites into a swollen Caliphate, surrounded by thorns.) ""A world without nuclear weapons?"" scoffs D'Souza. ""Dreamy idea."" It sure is. Ask any anti-colonial black liberation theologian, from Ronald Reagan to John McCain. Give D'Souza some credit: He lets the audience see when he's caught up short. There's none of that teeth-grinding, aren't-I-smart-didn't-I-getcha interviewing that you catch in a doc like Inside Job. D'Souza's biggest journalistic coup is an interview with George Hussein Obama, one of the president's Kenyan cousins, momentarily famous in 2008 when it was revealed that he lived in poverty. The Other Obama, it turns out, thinks that colonialists should have stayed in Kenya longer than they did. ""Do you really believe that?"" asks D'Souza. ""It's true,"" says George Obama. ""They would have developed us. Instead, we were fighting over nothing!"" Alas, D'Souza wants George Obama to be angry over how his famous cousin has treated him. He hasn't been his brother's keeper, has he? ""Go ask him,"" says George Obama. ""He's got other issues to deal with."" ""He's too busy helping the world?"" asked D'Souza. ""Yeah,"" says the cousin, not really interested in badmouthing the president. ""He's taking care of me. I'm part of the world."" That's it for cousin George. On to a re-enactment of the young Obama kneeling and bawling in front of his father's grave. If you're serious about re-arranging facts, hire a few actors."

The results might make it into a newspaper's op-ed page, or National Review's blog. Most of the ruminations made it into his book, No Apology, which he encouraged nosy voters to buy if they wanted to mind-meld with him. ""I spent almost nine months writing it,"" Romney said at one of his first town halls in 2011. ""A ghost writer ... came back with the first chapter, I read it and said, 'This'll never do.' And so I sat down and did the research and did it myself. So you've got me in there. The English isn't that great, but the thoughts are in there."" Not too many people bothered to check. Romney's op-eds got maybe a fraction of the attention lavished on Sarah Palin's Facebook wall posts. No Apology hit No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list, but with two ""daggers"" indicating bulk orders--and Palin didn't need that. The next time No Apology got written up, it was for tweaks to the paperback version that nudged Romney's domestic policies closer to the Tea Party. My point: Mitt Romney wrote thousands of words about foreign policy before he started farming this stuff out to surrogates. When he starts speaking in Europe and Israel this week, he's going to build on a coherent, confident, and supremely aggressive philosophy of American supremacy. Rogue states are mere months away from acquiring nukes. The president is either defending America rhetorically or he's hurting the cause of freedom. The Romney criticism-campaign started in April, with a National Review blog post shaming Obama for not being angry about a speech delivered by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. ""The words spoken by the leader of the free world can expand the frontiers of freedom or shrink them,"" wrote Romney. ""When Ronald Reagan called on Gorbachev to 'tear down this wall,' a surge of confidence rose that would ultimately breach the bounds of the evil empire."" Obama had reverse-engineered Reagan, and said that America sometimes ""dictated"" to other nations. ""No, America has sacrificed to free other nations from dictators."" (Romney liked that line so much that he used it twice.) When Obama failed to talk tough, he told activists ""in China, in Tibet, in Sudan, in Burma"" that America lacked ""resolve."" If the Sudanese or Burmese resistance were truly disappointed in Obama's speeches, they got over it. Burma held sham elections in 2010, then real elections two years later, which led to a National League for Democracy landslide and the reopening of U.S.-Burma diplomacy. South Sudan won independence in 2011, shortly after Tunisia, Egypt, and (eventually) Libya dispensed with its dictators. Giving Obama's rhetoric the credit for that--well, that would be ridiculous. Romney was just arguing that the rhetoric would spook people into staying oppressed. The ""Obama should talk more like Reagan"" critique appears again and again in Romney's foreign policy oeuvre. It's a theme, not a policy. Romney never accepts talk as a policy. ""It is time to apply comprehensive, regime-crippling sanctions to North Korea,"" he wrote in 2009, after a failed missile launch. ""Assets should be seized; international financial capabilities terminated. North Korea should be recategorized as a state sponsor of terror."" If a nation acts out, if it makes moves towards nuclear armament, it needs to be isolated, immediately. ""Si vis pacem, para bellum,"" wrote Romney in 2011. ""That is a Latin phrase, but the ayatollahs will have no trouble understanding its meaning from a Romney administration: If you want peace, prepare for war."" America's enemies are prepared. Barack Obama's America isn't prepared. In 2009, Romney surmised that Iran ""may already have enough enriched uranium to build a bomb [a]nd it may well have secured access to missile technology from other nations."" In No Apology, written around the same time as that column, he worried that ""the day is coming when [Venezuela President] Chavez announces a 'peaceful' nuclear program organized and supported by the mullahs in Iran."" We're three years on, and none of that has happened, but Romney was making a larger point. President Obama wasn't starting from a position of strength. International institutions, even if they worked, couldn't work as well as an idealized, America-led coalition. In No Apology, Romney mused about building a coalition like that, working around and outside the United Nations. ""The history, achievements, and current commitments of NATO make it the preferred foundation for such a body,"" he wrote. ""Including other democracies like Japan, Australia, and South Korea could be accomplished by forming regional security councils and establishing a worldwide charter, but the NATO alliance should remain its foundation."" That's not a new Romney idea. National Review has been kicking the tires on a possible ""Anglosphere"" alliance since at least 2003. Whatever you think of the Daily Telegraph's sneakily-sourced preview of the Romney trip, with an anonymous adviser riffing on Barack Obama's un-Anglo-Saxon thinking, it captured Romney's argument that a president should strengthen historic alliances until a historic rival is weakened. ""When Poland and the Czech Republic are humiliated by us,"" he wrote in No Apology, ""they lose confidence in America's support for them, and they may decide that they must incline more toward Russia."" ""May"" is a much-repeated word in Romney's foreign policy rhetoric. Conditionals--what could happen if America is weak--are played up, instead of our current selection of ugly slogs. In No Apology, he made no strategic recommendations for the ongoing war in Afghanistan. Instead, Afghanistan appeared as a test case of how a weaker nation could humble a stronger one--Afghanistan and the USSR, China and the United States. When Romney wrote op-eds opposing the new START Treaty, he worried that it would prohibit arms that ""might not be part of the Obama administration's current plans, but ... could surely be part of a subsequent administration's."" And that's the point. Romney wants to expand the size of the military. He admired, in No Apology, Ronald Reagan's Cold War deficit defense-spending hikes, and he insists that Ronald Reagan's bold speeches stiffened the spines of just the right people. ""It is a mistake--and sometimes a tragic one--to think that firmness in American foreign policy can bring only tension or conflict,"" Romney said this week, to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ""The surest path to danger is always weakness and indecision."""	Why Romney's Foreign Policy Vision Is Nothing More Than Tough Talk

In an election about the state of the economy, no state has been harder hit. The unemployment rate is 11.6 percent, the highest in the nation. Sixty-one percent of the homes are worth less than the mortgage on them, also the highest in the nation. Las Vegas is in the middle of the desert, but everyone there is underwater. Still, Barack Obama has a shot in Nevada. He won Nevada by 12 points in 2008 and an average of polls right now shows the president ahead by 5 points (and perhaps more if you believe pollsters underestimate the Hispanic vote). Analysts in both parties say the state is the president's to lose. Nevada is the most acute example of the key political dynamic in this election: The weight of a bad economy should sink the incumbent, but a combination of fortunate demographics and superior organization in the battleground states might rescue him in the end. The economy in Nevada isn't just bad, it's broken. ""Growth was heroin to a junkie in this state,"" says Billy Vassiliadis, the Democratic wise man and advertising and marketing executive whose firm has helped sell Las Vegas to the world. At the height of the boom in 2006, construction represented 12 percent of the workforce. ""The joke is that in the boom years we were the only state that had construction workers building homes for construction workers,"" says GOP Rep. Joe Heck. Since the housing bubble burst, 90,000 construction jobs have been lost. Construction workers now represent only 4 percent of the workforce. No one expects the industry to return to earlier heights. Anyone who might want to swing a hammer in another state can't leave, because they'd lose money on their house. In the first quarter of 2012, Nevada had the No. 1 foreclosure rate in the nation. The rate of debt to house value in Nevada is 114 percent. People aren't just hurting, they're imprisoned. This is not a new story. Nevada has had the highest unemployment rate in the country for the last two years and has led in foreclosure filings and the share of homes underwater. But the president's strategists think they know the key to running in such tough times: make your opponent objectionable and organize like hell. Democrats have run that playbook before. In 2010, Harry Reid was supposed to lose. The economy was in even worse shape than it is today. As Senate majority leader, he was a perfect receptacle for people's anger. In Reid's Democratic primary, 10 percent of the members of his own party voted for ""none of the above."" But Reid was lucky in his opponent. Sharron Angle, the unpredictable Tea Party candidate, was a bad campaigner and offered a range of zany proposals that Reid's campaign could exploit. Obama's strategists are relentless in framing the election as a choice. They have seized on Romney's claim that the housing market needs to ""hit bottom"" before it can get healthy. Even some of Romney' supporters found that comment insensitive to the local pain. The president, by contrast, in each of his visits to the state has come bearing federal help for the housing mess. The federal rescue has been tepid, but the president will argue that at least he's fighting for people, instead of leaving them to the mercy of the market. (Obama has to make amends for some of his own past statements: ""You don't blow a bunch of cash in Vegas when you're trying to save for college,"" he said in 2010, to the irritation of Sen. Reid and other officials in the city that relies so heavily on tourism.) Mitt Romney isn't Sharron Angle. He is a far more disciplined and earthbound candidate, so it will be harder to demonize him. Sure, he may have gaffed now and again, but Angle's gaffes were damaging because voters felt they exposed a fundamental extremism. It will be harder to caricature Romney that deeply. Harry Reid needed more than just a bad opponent, and Obama will too. The growing Hispanic population helps Obama in Nevada perhaps more than any other state. In 2008, 15 percent of the electorate was Hispanic. Nearly 2 million Latinos have turned 18 since then. In national polls, Obama leads Romney by as much as 40 percent among Hispanics. But turning Hispanic residents into Hispanic voters requires organization. Democrats in Nevada have been perfecting their machine for the last 10 years under Reid's deliberate guidance. The Democrats in every battleground state boast about their team, but the Nevada operation is considered among the best of the best. The key for any party is building a strong list of supporters and possible supporters so you can target your efforts to the most persuadable and motivated voters. Reid convinced the Democratic Party to move the state's caucus in 2008 to early in the process. That flushed out scores of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to support Obama and Clinton who then went on the list. If the list is maintained, it gets better with each election as the party adds more information to each person's record: what issues they care about, what made them vote in previous cycles--a knock on the door, an email, or a phone call--and how much attention they needed to go to the polls. Sixty percent of Nevada's voters vote in the two-week window before Election Day. The parties get a daily update of who has voted, so they know who on their list has cast a ballot and who needs more persuasion. In 2010, some Democratic voters got as many as 40 ""touches,"" the term used to describe any type of campaign-to-voter communication. Nevada Republicans are working hard to build their list too, but they haven't been as organized over the last few elections as the Democrats have. Reid has another incentive to turn out Democrats. The junior senator from Nevada, Republican Dean Heller, is up for re-election. If Reid can help Democrat Shelley Berkley flip that seat into the Democratic column, that would make it harder for Republicans to take control of the Senate. (They need four Democratic seats to steal Reid's majority leader title.) Next week both Obama and Romney will be in Reno for the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. Though the topic will be military issues, the economy will surely dominate the political conversation. Like the rest of the country, there are a few encouraging signs even amid the bleakness. Tourism has been up recently and ""the spend""--the money tourists drop while visiting--has been improving. Still, the economy isn't set to recover fully until 2017. That would be a year after Obama's second term. Mitt Romney is hoping Nevadans won't want to wait that long to give someone else a chance."	How Obama Can Win (Despite a Terrible Economy)

He tells a young associate People want to live like this in their cars and their big fucking houses that they can't even pay for?"" he rants. ""Then you're necessary. The only reason they all get to continue living like kings is because we've got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off and the whole world gets really fucking fair really fucking quickly and nobody actually wants that. Replace one of the key words in there with ""gosh-darn,"" and I think you've got the tone conservatives want Mitt Romney to strike. Why, when Bain Capital comes up, does the candidate go into a crouch? When he miked up for a media tour to clean up the story last week, why didn't he defend the private equity group he'd founded? The closest he came, in an interview with Jan Crawford, was ""I'm happy that Bain went on, on its own, and did a number of terrific things."" What kind of terrific things? The Obama campaign's multi-pronged attack against Bain criticizes the company, and Romney, for profiting from outsourcing by investing in companies like Global-Tech Appliances, and for making money from the failure of companies like AmPad. Angry laid-off workers have been cinema verite'd and placed in ads. SEC documents have been discovered, used to Raise Questions. Republicans are increasingly perplexed about this line of attack. This is how business works, they say to themselves. Who doesn't know that? ""We do know that the ability to export business around the world creates high-quality American jobs,"" says Sen. Jim DeMint, who ran a market research firm before entering politics. ""So, the idea that a company that has overseas subsidiaries is somehow hurting American jobs--the president counts that as outsourcing? The president doesn't understand business."" But the attacks are getting things done. Watching the Obama campaign force Romney to roll back the Bain claims he has made has been excruciating. Two months ago, the Romney campaign argued that their candidate deserved credit for ""100,000 jobs,"" because that was how many successful projects Bain had helped to fund. Obama allies quibbled with the math. When she launched the new Bain attacks, in a Web video responding to the Washington Post's investigative Bain story, Obama-Biden deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter shamed Romney for vetoing ""legislation that would have banned companies from shipping jobs overseas if they did business"" with Massachusetts. ""Now, that's just good common sense,"" said Cutter (even though her own incumbent candidate hasn't implemented any legislation like that). So how do the Democrats get away with it? Romney has preferred to concede the point than to defend some Bain Capital decisions that cost jobs. He's done so ever since he started walking away from the company. In 2002, when he was he was running for governor, he told the Boston Globe he ""had no involvement whatsoever"" in decisions that happened during his leave of absence, like the Global-Tech Appliances deal .""The suggestion that somehow I'm heartless,"" he said, ""I'm this tough business guy who doesn't care, could not be further from the truth."" What was the implication of that statement? Did Romney actually disagree with any of Bain Capital's decisions during his leave? Had he been there, would he have stormed into the boardroom and lit the contracts on fire? There's nothing in his Bain Capital record to suggest it. He's said, on other occasions, that it's good to lay people off if they're providing poor services. He's pledged, if elected, to lay off 10 percent of federal workers. Other GOP candidates have figured out how to talk about the difficult aspects of being a successful businessman. ""Executive leaders have to make tough calls that won't please everyone,"" says Herman Cain, the one-time Romney rival (and 2008 Romney endorser) who made his reputation by strategically closing down some restaurants. ""They can't be afraid of criticism when they do so. I had to let people go at Godfather's, too. It was necessary to turn the company around. Otherwise there would have been no company, and no jobs for anyone. Mitt Romney should point out that he helped build Bain Capital into a successful enterprise because he was willing to make tough but necessary decisions."" In 2010, Wisconsin manufacturer and first-time contender Ron Johnson appeared to have screwed up mightily when he suggested that some job losses were products of ""creative destruction,"" Joseph Schumpeter's widely accepted concept, and ""if it weren't for that, we'd still have buggy whip companies."" I vividly remember talking to labor activists who held sheafs of information about outsourcing-related layoffs, convinced that this would sink Johnson. But he beat Sen. Russ Feingold by five points. But Johnson was a manufacturer. People like businessmen who build stuff. (Johnson's best TV ad shot him against a whiteboard, sketching out how there were no people with his experience in the Senate.) As Matthew Yglesias explains, private equity isn't so well-loved. People wince when a firm takes over a failing business and makes a profit while scrapping it. But go back to ""creative destruction"" and to the angry trader from Margin Call. The people who make money this way--Mitt Romney, to pick a name at random--believe that they're creating wealth. Some people get hurt. Other people--like Bain's investors, the employees of Staples who keep their jobs in a revived company, and the customers who benefit from their products--are rewarded. Romney shook up his campaign speech today, but he didn't defend Bain Capital. He pivoted to attack the 2009 stimulus package for bad loan guarantees, and to ask for ""government to get out of investing in individual businesses."" And he echoed the conservative media, which has portrayed remarks by Obama last week as proof that the president doesn't think business owners actually build their own companies. He's fighting one caricature of investment with another, which is probably easier than trying to explain the truth."	What's Keeping Romney From Turning His Bain Experience to His Advantage?
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/07/barack_obama_told_charlie_rose_he_had_made_mistakes_but_it_was_really_a_humblebrag_.html	"""Presidents cannot admit mistakes,"" a senior Bush administration official once told me. Admitting mistakes makes a president look weak, gives critics ammunition, leads to more questions, and sets a dangerous precedent for the next time everything doesn't go to plan. Once you've admitted a mistake, where do you stop? You definitely don't want to admit a mistake in an election year. So when Charlie Rose showed up at the White House asking the president what he thought his big mistake was, all that remained a mystery was how Obama would evade the question. President Obama chose the humblebrag: ""The mistake of my first term--couple of years--was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right. And that's important. But the nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times."" This is a shame. Recognizing mistakes and knowing how to fix them is a key attribute of the presidency. The only way voters know that a candidate or president has this skill is if they talk about it. In our campaigns, we condition candidates to never reveal any mistakes, second guessing, or lessons they've learned through trial and error. Our campaigns are like an Olympic qualifying trial in which contestants are not tested for the sport they'll ultimately play. The president was essentially saying that he was working so hard trying to help the American people, he forgot to tell them about it. Candidate Obama had a laugh about the humblebrag in 2008. At a Democratic primary debate, the candidates were asked to name their biggest weakness. Obama said he was messy and had trouble keeping up with paperwork. Not very revealing, but not a humblebrag. Hillary Clinton and John Edwards both offered versions of the humblebrag which irked Obama. ""Folks, they don't tell you what they mean!"" he joked the next day. ""I thought that they meant, 'What's your biggest weakness?' So I said, 'Well, you know I don't handle paper that well, you know, my desk is a mess, I need somebody to help me file and stuff all the time.' So, the other two, they say, 'Well, my biggest weakness is I'm just too passionate about helping poor people. I am just too impatient to bring about change in America.' If I had gone last I would have known what the game was. I could have said, 'Well, you know I like to help old ladies across the street. Sometimes they don't want to be helped. It's terrible.' "" Though the president now knows the game, he has--even if fleetingly--offered actual contrition. He admitted early in his tenure that he mishandled the nomination of Sen. Tom Daschle. ""I screwed up,"" he said at the time, explaining that his seeming indifference to Daschle's tax problems sent a message that the powerful are treated differently than average people. And what he said this week to Charlie Rose is not a pure humblebrag--fake humility designed to make you look better--for which we should punish with public floggings. The president was likely being sincere. He honestly believes that his communication could have been better. How you react to this comment depends on where you sit. To the president's critics, it sounds patronizing. I was doing the right thing, but the slow American people didn't get it. For his fans, the president is embracing a critique they've made all along: What happened to the great orator of the campaigns? For students of the rhetorical presidency, Obama's focus on the centrality of words will seem anywhere from curious to laughable. Presidents don't win the country through stories; it's the policy that determines how people feel. Wherever you stand on the question of the power of rhetoric, there is a far more interesting list of mistakes that the president could have discussed: He overestimated the power of the stimulus, he took his eye off the ball by pursuing near universal health care at the expense of the economy, he tried for too long to win bipartisan agreement, or he didn't try hard enough. The president is not alone. Mitt Romney says he has made mistakes, but he doesn't really talk about them. He has his own version of the humblebrag. He says when he was CEO of Bain he didn't think JetBlue was a good investment. Romney was a wildly successful businessman, so this is a bit like a 450 hitter talking about a strikeout. Newt Gingrich took the form to a hysterical extreme when he explained that he had been unfaithful to his ex-wife because his desire to improve the country had put so much strain on him that he strayed. Politicians are interested in self-preservation. So the false modesty isn't surprising. But these answers rob us of so much that might actually help us evaluate our candidates. Imagine what a little public introspection might do: It would be a shock of candor that might wake the sleeping ears of the electorate. That would simply be refreshing. (And who doesn't want refreshment in this summer heat?) Voters might listen to a candidate who showed he was different by taking a little risk. (This means President Obama is making a compound error: He's missing the rhetorical opportunity by saying that his mistake was that he missed rhetorical opportunities.) In the presidency, in particular, it's hard to get good advice about your failures because so many people who work for you are awed by the office. Or they are in such a permanent state of partisan siege that they stay quiet for the sake of the cause. (Former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell is the exception; he seems to identify a new mistake Obama is making every day). A candidate's ability to see mistakes suggests they can tolerate candid advice from subordinates, which could short-circuit extended calamity. Presidents are criticized all day long. How they know what's worth ignoring and what's worth heeding gives us insight into how good their judgment really is. There are countless aphorisms on coffee cups, inspirational posters, and daily calendars devoted to the benefits of failure as a learning device, but our candidates will never show us how they have reaped those benefits, or more important, whether they're able to find benefit in failure at all. We should know if they are pig-headed, obstinate, or willing to ""stay the course"" out of psychological neediness. Ronald Reagan put all of this nicely: ''What should happen when you make a mistake is this. You take your knocks, you learn your lessons, and then you move on. That's the healthiest way to deal with a problem. You learn. You put things in perspective. You pull your energies together. You change.'' Reagan was admitting that his administration had tried to trade arms for hostages. His is among the few modern presidents to admit he made a mistake. Kennedy took his lumps after the Bay of Pigs, too. Those two cases were extreme. Each man had to do something to recoup their reputation after a devastating blow to their administrations. Perhaps it's a sign of political health for Obama that he hasn't been forced to apologize for any huge disaster. For anyone who has watched the current campaign fishtail from one absurd, out-of-context gaffe to another, the president's dodge probably seems smart. Self-reflection might be lovely and desirable, but self-immolation is dumb. Obama is not running for president in a therapy session full of compassionate listeners. He's running in whatever is the polar opposite of that. So we'll just have to take it on faith that he and his opponent know how to handle mistakes. Because we generally only learn if they can admit that they have made a mistake when it's a really big one."	Did You Hear Obama's Humblebrag?

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/07/barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_represent_two_different_types_of_elitism_in_american_politics_.html	"I don't know whether this was the intention--one certainly assumes so--but the handful of new investigations into Mitt Romney's investment arrangements in Switzerland, Bermuda, and the British Virgin Islands have come at a particularly interesting moment in the U.S. electoral cycle. With four months to go, both presidential candidates are frantically drawing lines in the sand: Each is arguing that he offers American voters a clear and distinct choice on health care, immigration, taxation--and that his opponent offers something quite different. On purpose or otherwise, the tales of the Cayman Islands make clear that Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are offering American voters another kind of choice as well. One of the words most frequently deployed during both the midterm elections and the now-forgotten Republican primaries was ""elite,"" usually as a term of opprobrium, usually by Republicans but sometimes by Democrats, too. Running for the Senate, Christine O'Donnell ran a campaign ad declaring, ""I didn't go to Yale ... I am YOU."" Attacking Obama, Rand Paul called the president a ""liberal elitist"" who ""believes that he knows what is best for people."" Occupy Wall Street rose up against the ""1 percent,"" but fizzled out before it could propose an alternative. At one point, even Justice Clarence Thomas's wife railed against the Washington political class, leading Slate columnist Dahlia Lithwick to wonder how that term could possibly exclude her husband (""If ever there were nine people who are actually paid to think they know better than the rest of us, Supreme Court justices are it.""). Granted, the word ""elite"" is often used, blurrily, to mean ""a group of people whose views I dislike."" But that doesn't mean that elites don't exist. On the contrary, the previous debates on the subject were insufficiently subtle, failing to recognize that in the modern world, there are multiple elites, each with its own customs and habits, its own moral codes and its own domestic and international connections. And let us be clear: When we are offered the choice between Obama and Romney, we are offered a choice between two sets of them. You know the stereotypes already. Both Obamas come from what might loosely be called the intellectual/academic meritocracy, the ""liberal elite,"" the post-WASP Ivy League, easily caricatured as the world of free-trade coffee, organic arugula, smug opinions, and Martha's Vineyard. The Romneys, by contrast, belong to the financial oligarchy, the ""global elite,"" the post-financial-deregulation world which is just as easily caricatured as one of iced champagne, offshore bank accounts, dressage trainers, and private islands. The two groups have some important overlaps. Though Romney got some attention for holding a fundraiser in the Hamptons last week, it is Obama who has raised more money in the Hamptons overall (the president scored particularly well in Sagaponack, by one account, where the median home sells for $4.4 million). They also have some important differences. The financial oligarchy, as we learned from the Barclays scandal in London last week, is happiest when it operates in deep secrecy, where it can manipulate interest rates, package derivatives, hide its profits, and shelter its taxes as it sees fit. The liberal meritocracy prefers to operate in the glare of publicity, where it can give lectures, write books, make documentaries, and generally promulgate its own views as loudly as possible. At age 34, Obama wrote his autobiography. At age 37, Romney founded Bain Capital. But while you might think one or the other group more preferable or more offensive for reasons of politics, culture, or taste, you certainly cannot argue that either one of them is in close touch with ""average"" or ""ordinary"" or even ""middle-class"" people, however those terms might be defined. And although both they and their supporters may shout about ""radical left-wing professors"" on the one hand or ""Gordon Gekko"" on the other, neither Obama nor Romney can plausibly claim to be leading a populist revolution against the ""elites"" who are allegedly destroying America. Which is just as well, because the political success of both Obama and Romney proves that radical populism in the United States has failed spectacularly. For all of the attention they got, neither Occupy Wall Street nor the Tea Party has a candidate in this race. Neither found a way to channel inchoate, ill-defined public anger--at the deficit, at the banks--into electoral politics or clear alternatives. Whoever wins in November, we'll therefore get the elite we deserve."	Why Obama and Romney Represent Dueling Brands of Elitism
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/07/the_obama_campaign_is_looking_to_paint_mitt_romney_in_the_image_of_fictional_corporate_raider_gordon_gekko_.html	"Sometimes, you can understand why conservatives think that a ""Democrat-Media Complex"" is meeting, mind-melding, and plotting against them. We are living through one of those times. On the Fourth of July, Vanity Fair uploaded a 4,457-word investigative feature by Nicholas Shaxon about Mitt Romney's offshore, tax-protected money--""$30 million in Bain Capital funds in the Cayman Islands alone?"" Four days later, President Obama's surrogates appeared on cable and the networks to tell viewers to read past the Pippa Middleton story and check out Shaxon. ""I've never known of a Swiss bank account to build an American bridge,"" zinged Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. (The Los Angeles Times headline for these interviews was ""Party surrogates rely on familiar talking points on Sunday shows."" Clip that one and stow it somewhere cold.) Sunday afternoon, running into Monday morning, reporters started filing stories on the Range Rover-surfeited scene outside of Romney's fundraisers in the Hamptons. One of these events, at a home owned by David Koch, was bracketed by bused-in Occupy and MoveOn protesters and buzzed by a plane with an anti-1-percent slogan: ""ROMNEY HAS A KOCH PROBLEM."" The donors avoided the protesters but gave reporters quotes worthy of F. Scott Fitzgerald characters. Which takes us to Monday afternoon, and President Obama's announcement that he wants to keep all of the Bush tax rates for households making less than $250,000. He campaigned on that in 2008. He campaigned on it in 2010. Nothing had changed except the hair color of his opponent. ""Many members of the other party,"" said Obama, ""believe that prosperity comes from the top down--that if we spend trillions of dollars on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, that that will somehow unleash jobs and economic growth. I disagree."" The ""narrative"" is a much-overrated thing in politics. The Romney campaign had wanted to discuss nothing but the weak June report of 80,000 new jobs. By the end of Monday, spokeswoman Amanda Hennenberg was sticking to that, saying that ""tax increases on families and job creators will create more economic uncertainty."" There's not going to be a massive recovery in the next three months. That matters more than any PR flanking maneuver. If Mitt Romney was replaced on the ticket by a cyborg that repeated the job, foreclosure, and household-debt numbers six times a day, the cyborg would get at least 240 electoral votes. But campaigns do matter. The Obama campaign has been aware for at least a year that it must toxify its opponent. In an August 2011 Politico story, which the Romney campaign pounced on as proof that Obama was threatened and crazed by their candidate, Jonathan Martin and Ben Smith reported that ""Obama officials intend to frame Romney as the very picture of greed in the great recession--a sort of political Gordon Gekko."" Not just the Obama campaign. In October, as the Occupy Wall Street movement was peaking, the staff of the largely union-funded 501(c)(3) Americans United for Change brainstormed ideas for an anti-Romney campaign. ""We saw that great picture, from Romney's Bain years, where he's holding up a dollar bill,"" remembers AUC's Lauren Weiner. ""We wanted to use that for posters, and to build a campaign around it. Somebody  said 'Gordon Gekko, greed is good.' That stuck."" It spread, but slowly. I first saw a ""Romney/Gekko"" sign in the wild at a ho-hum December protest of Romney's Des Moines, Iowa, office. Like much Occupy agitprop, it was jokey and obvious, with a reference to a movie that came out before compact discs replaced vinyl and cell phones were small. Memorable, but not the kind of thing Democrats would run with. They had a more complicated relationship with private equity. Indeed, according to Robert Draper's profile of the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, the meme took months to plant. In early 2012, Priorities USA tested out themes and found that people didn't believe that Romney--fending off challenges from Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich--was all that right-wing. ""When Priorities informed a focus group that Romney supported the Ryan budget plan,"" wrote Draper, ""and thus championed 'ending Medicare as we know it,' while also advocating tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing."" So Priorities told voters about the layoffs and benefit cuts at firms taken over by Bain Capital. That did the trick. ""When people think about who's rich, who's successful, they think of two archetypes,"" says Priorities USA Action adviser Paul Begala. ""The predominant one--he's probably a smart guy. He probably earned it. That's Bill Gates, that's Steve Jobs. The other archetype is Gordon Gekko."" So Romney was Gekko-ized. The risks of alienating other wealthy people, who might take this personally, were limited. Those people had turned on Obama years ago, telling reporters they were being scapegoated as ""fat cats."" If the Obama campaign could give a microphone to only one of the people who made the Romney/Koch fundraiser, it might be Sharon Zambrelli, who told the Los Angeles Times what a disappointment Obama was after ""all of Wall Street"" wrote him checks. Romney has begun out-fundraising Obama. How do you shame him for that? Stuff the bags of money with blue paint bombs. This isn't original campaign strategy. In 2010, it wasn't even successful strategy. But it matches up with Obama's actual policy agenda, and it polls well. The last Gallup poll on taxes, from April, found 62 percent of people agreeing that ""upper-income people"" were paying ""too little."" That was the highest positive response rate for the question since Obama was inaugurated. Is Obama's plan to phase out all but the top-rate Bush tax cuts better than, say, progressive tax simplification? No. But it's a hike that hits only 1.9 percent of taxpayers, many Romney supporters--and Mitt Romney! --among them. That sort of lumpen, personalized policy attack can work. In 1992, when Begala was working for the Clinton-Gore campaign, they ran an ad attacking George H.W. Bush for getting a Texas resident's tax break. ""You can find George Bush doing just about everything at his home in Maine except paying Maine taxes,"" sighed a narrator, as footage of the preppy, boating, president spooled. ""When George Bush saves $165,000 in taxes, guess who makes up the difference? You do!"" A $165,000 tax break, spread out over hundreds of millions of Americans, is nothing. Romney might have saved exponentially more money in Switzerland and the Caymans. The president and his allies--no coordination!--will point that out. ""Look at the internals of those swing state polls,"" says Begala. "" 'On your side,' 'cares about people like you'--that's where Romney has dropped in the swing states. That matters to me far more than the top-line vote. [Romney] began this with a fundamental falsehood about how he made his money, and that he will be about jobs as president. This is where his lack of a core and full-of-shit-ness is going to kill him."""	Can the Obama Campaign Turn Mitt Romney Into Gordon Gekko?

In shirtsleeves in the town square in Sandusky, Ohio, and at twilight in Parma, he explains how the theory at the heart of most of American life--that hard work and responsibility will lead to prosperity--is under threat. His audiences during his two-day bus tour are attentive. When they hear him speak, some say, ""Amen."" Others repeat his last word out loud, as if to affirm its truth. A man in Poland raised his hand as if in prayer, but most keep both hands raised to film him on their cell phones. The call-and-response might make it feel like a church service, but the candidate is not speaking to his audience, he is speaking from it. He is one of them, he says, which is why he understands this threat to their way of life. ""I believe in that basic promise of America because I lived it. That's my biography,"" he said amid the hay bales and a large American flag in Maumee, Ohio, on Thursday. At the end of the day, he said, ""I saw myself in you. I saw my hopes and dreams in you. And when I see your kids, I see my kids. And when I see your grandparents, I see my grandparents."" This guy may really have a shot against the incumbent. Barack Obama's pitch that he should be re-elected as the protector of the middle class is so skillful one might forget that a plurality of voters say their lives have gotten worse since he took office. The tension between Barack Obama the campaigner and Barack Obama the sitting president was on full display during his bus tour through Ohio on Thursday and Friday. He is a talented orator, and the middle-class audiences--selected by his impressive state organization--echoed his pitch with wild enthusiasm for the local television stations and Obama's ad-makers who were capturing every moment. On the other hand, as the trip came to an end, the president had to contend with another tepid jobs report. Only 84,000 jobs were created in June. For the last three months, the average job growth has been 75,000, barely half what is needed to keep up with population growth. Barack Obama has not gotten the job done. For more than 41 weeks, the unemployment rate has been over 8 percent. Mitt Romney is running as the guy who can get the job done. He has had enough success turning around companies and staging the Olympics that a weary nation looking for some hope might try electing a candidate with that kind of resume. That is the grim reality back on display in Ohio Friday. The president's strategy, laid out over the two days, was to explain how Republican single-minded obstructionism and the depth of the recession have limited what he has been able to accomplish. At the same time, his message carried a warning: If voters chose Mitt Romney, they would be returning to the policies that had helped create that recession and picking a candidate who wouldn't be thinking about them when he took office. The pitch was personal. At each stop, the president talked about how his grandparents had achieved the American Dream with government help. His father had fought in World War II and gone back to college on the G.I. bill. His grandmother had helped build bombers. He mused about a trip around the country he took as a boy riding Greyhound buses and trains. They stayed in Howard Johnsons, where he never left the pool and thought getting ice from an ice machine was the greatest thing ever. This life, said the president, was built on a ""simple bargain,"" that if you played by the rules you'd be OK. That bargain sustained the middle class and led to broad prosperity. Now that bargain is in danger, said Obama, either by the forces of change that have exposed people without health insurance or by the rising cost of college tuition. It is up to government to strengthen the bargain for the middle class, which is where Obama's argument turned personal again. The other party doesn't care about the middle class. The president argued that Republicans have an economic model that doesn't work: Lower taxes and reduced regulation won't protect the middle class. But there is a sharper-edged version of his message: You're going to be the victim. Gov. Romney's policies won't work and they certainly won't work for you. ""We've got a stalemate in Washington,"" said the president, framing the choice of the election. ""We've got two fundamentally different ideas about where we should take the country. And this election is about how we break that stalemate. And the good news is it's in your power to break this stalemate. It's in the power of everybody who lives in Ohio, everybody who lives in Poland, everybody who lives all across the Midwest--all those folks out there, whether you're punching a clock or starting a business, you've got a chance to move this country forward. But you're going to have to make a choice about which direction we go in."" If Barack Obama knows middle-class voters because he has lived their life, then his campaign also would like voters to believe the opposite: Mitt Romney's wealth and privilege must mean that he can't possibly understand how regular people live. In Ohio this week, this message was more the subtext than an overt attack. Neither the president nor any of his surrogates made any cracks about Mitt Romney's vacation this week or his gleaming water vehicle. But former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland did attack Romney for his personal bank accounts in off-shore locations as a way to show how little he had in common with middle-class voters. The president revealed his sharper elbows during a local interview, saying that Romney's recent change in his position on the individual mandate was a cave to his party's right wing. ""One of the things that you learn as president is that what you say matters and your principles matter. And sometimes, you've got to fight for things that you believe in and you can't just switch on a dime."" The Romney camp accused the president of the same failing. (To figure out where the two stand on this for yourself, read here and here). But the president stayed on message, saying that shoring up the middle-class bargain is what got him into politics. He said this would be his last campaign ever. Throughout his career and as president, he argued, he had been fighting for families like those nodding in agreement under the shade trees. At the stop in Sandusky, a woman thanked the president for his health care law on behalf of her sister who had been unable to get insurance and died. If there was a place for Obama to receive a bad unemployment report, northeastern Ohio is probably it. It is friendly territory for Democrats. In Ohio, the president could also point to significant domestic achievements like his support for the auto bailout. At each stop, a plant worker who had been unemployed but later found work, introduced the president, praising him for ""betting on America"" by supporting the car companies. The president had started his tour outside of Toledo the day before, where he announced that the administration was filing a trade complaint against China's new duties on some American-made cars, including the Jeep Wrangler which is made in--wait for it--Toledo. Mitt Romney did not support the bailout, which means the issue does double duty for the president. He can point to a job-creating achievement and he can make a clear distinction with his opponent. Ohio is a must-win for the Romney campaign. If President Obama wins Ohio and carries the states John Kerry did in 2004 (pretty likely), he'll have 264 electoral votes, just six shy of the magic 270 threshold. There are five states he won in 2008--Virginia, Colorado, New Mexico, Florida, and Iowa--any one of which could then provide him with the margin for victory. At times, it feels like the entire campaign might shrink down to a debate about the auto bailout in Ohio. If the president can make his case, despite the foghorn of a sluggish economy, then he really will be like his audience: someone whose job was in danger but saved by the bailout."	Will Obama's Personal Pitch to Ohio Voters Win Again?
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/07/mitt_romney_s_campaign_found_itself_out_of_step_with_the_republican_party_on_the_supreme_court_s_health_care_ruling_.html	"Republicans may have renewed reason to think well of Chief Justice John Roberts. Mitt Romney argued Wednesday that Roberts' Supreme Court ruling uncovered Barack Obama's hidden tax in the Affordable Care Act while simultaneously proving that Romney's similarly designed measure in his Massachusetts health care law was not a tax, but merely a penalty. Did Roberts do this? Not really, but Romney's novel claim offered the latest twist in a winding series of responses to the ruling. The last week has offered a rare window into the Romney campaign in action. Buttoned-down and risk-averse, the team is slow to react and sticks to the script so strictly they're even willing to endure ridicule. Those can be highly prized qualities in presidential campaigns. The presidency requires relentless focus, too. But politics and the presidency also require a certain dexterity, an ability to be nimble in the face of changing events. A blistering editorial from the conservative editors at the Wall Street Journal argues that the Romney campaign has failed to get this mix right, particularly in its response to the court's Affordable Care Act ruling. Bill Kristol, who was just a guest at Romney's high-donor event in Utah, has also penned a bracing piece asking: ""Is it too much to ask Mitt Romney to get off autopilot and actually think about the race he's running?"" The conservative complaint, which started brewing in the wake of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's recall victory, is that Romney lacks the entrepreneurial spark to take advantage of opportunities and is merely hoping the other guy loses. Romney's July 4 remarks on the health care decision represented an effort to get back on track: aligning himself with his party and eliding the challenges of his record in Massachusetts. When John Roberts' health care ruling was read on June 28, Romney's response was perfectly in keeping with his straightforward no-exposed-shirttail campaign. Romney spoke in front of a lectern, disagreed with the ruling and the campaign commenced arguing that Obama's health care plan would kill jobs, moving back to the Republican nominee's safest and most advantageous turf. But that was the easy part. It was clear from conversations with campaign aides in the wake of the ruling that there was no plan to manage or respond to Romney's exposure on the question of his Massachusetts health plan--particularly the provision that was nearly identical to President Obama's. When one aide was presented with a 2010 quote from Romney praising his Massachusetts ""tax,"" he questioned whether Romney really said that. Offered evidence, the aide responded: ""Possibly."" In the week since the decision, the lack of focus is reminiscent of Romney's muddled response during the primaries to questions about his tax returns and record at Bain. All of these questions are issues the campaign could see coming. Romney's exposure on health care is the largest of all--a storm that has always been on the horizon. Romney's immediate response may have been disciplined, but it was tone deaf to what the party was thinking and saying. Republicans had seized on John Roberts' reasoning in his decision that the individual mandate is constitutional based on Congress' power to tax. President Obama, delighted as he was to have his signature legislative accomplishment saved from the shredder, has steadfastly argued that this provision is not a tax, but a penalty. It may have been a tax for the purposes of the Supreme Court debate that kept the law alive, but once the law stumbled from behind the marble columns, it was a penalty. Republicans laughed at this reasoning and enjoyed watching White House officials and allies try to explain the distinction. The laughter was in unison until Monday when Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior Romney aide, said that the candidate disagreed with Republicans and agreed with the president: The provision should be considered a penalty. Why on earth would he do this? Intellectual honesty might be a reason. Fehrnstrom, the aide who introduced the Etch A Sketch analogy into the campaign, was manifestly not wiping away Romney's past. He was accepting that it was indelible. Romney had a nearly similar provision in his Massachusetts health care law which he had repeatedly called a tax. If Romney were to call Obama's penalty a tax, he would have to own up to his own measure being defined that way. There was a serious problem with this position though. Every other major Republican was arguing that Roberts had merely stated the obvious, that Obama's individual mandate was a tax. Romney was off message. On July 4, the candidate tried to fix this problem. In an interview with CBS's Jan Crawford, Romney contradicted Fehrnstrom and said he agreed with John Roberts. ""They concluded it was a tax. That's what it is. And the American people know that President Obama has broken the pledge he made. He said he wouldn't raise taxes on middle-income Americans ... It's now clear that his mandate, as described by the Supreme Court, is a tax."" Message unity restored. It was the politically wise thing for Romney to do. Better for him to take advantage of the unified GOP anti-tax message and endure charges he was contradicting his record in Massachusetts than maintain historical consistency about his Massachusetts record and be at odds with his entire party's critique of the president's signature legislative achievement. Asked by Crawford if his position on the Affordable Care Act meant he was confirming that his similar Massachusetts law was also a tax, Romney said it meant no such thing. He pointed to John Roberts as proof. ""The chief justice, in his opinion, made it very clear that at the state level, states have the power to put in place mandates. They don't need to require them to be called taxes in order for them to be constitutional. And--and as a result, Massachusetts' mandate was a mandate, was a penalty, was described that way by the legislature and by me. And so it stays as it was."" Romney is right. As governor he had the power that the president doesn't have to impose an individual mandate. That's why when the provision was challenged at the state level, the law was upheld rather easily. No judge had to go searching for a reason to support the individual mandate under taxing powers or anything else; it was upheld under the governor's broad ""police powers."" But Romney is not correct to say that he described the provision as a penalty. Sometimes he did; sometimes he called it a fee and other times he referred to it as a tax. More to the point though, whether Romney had the authority to institute a mandate and the tax-based mechanism for enforcing it was not what Crawford was asking him. The question is how to characterize the animal that both he and Obama have relied on to bring about health care reform. That's not a question of authority but of truth in advertising. If two men hold a shotgun, one may do so by right of a hunting license and another may do so because he is a police officer. Their authorities are different, but when we seek to describe what they hold in their hands, we can all agree it is a shotgun. What President Obama and Mitt Romney have supported are functionally equivalent, which means that whether Romney is going to label Obama's provision a tax or a grapefruit, the label should apply to his law as well. If you've stuck with this winding trail long enough, you can see how difficult it will be for the Obama campaign to call Romney out on his new position. If they try, they risk a public debate about the president's unpopular law punctuated by repetition of the word ""tax."" When raising taxes is the central issue of debate, GOP strategists have long felt it's good for Republicans because they are the party that is known for fighting to keep taxes low. Still, the Obama campaign released video of Romney calling his provision a tax to undermine Romney's latest stance. Another round of this debate was on. When Obama cites John Roberts in defining Romney's penalty as a tax we will have come full circle."	Why Romney Is Still Struggling To Get On-Message

""The Missing Campaign Policy Debate,"" which went live at Politico on Monday, hasn't generated the same buzz as ""The Hillary Moment."" But both columns made the same banal point. We're getting a ""divisive"" campaign, not a serious campaign. Woe, woe is the Republic. ""There is little talk of the need to rein in entitlements, balance the budget and reduce the debt and deficit,"" wailed the pundits. After Obama issued an executive order that de-emphasized deportations of younger undocumented immigrants, he gave a speech ""without putting forth any broad set of policies to deal with immigration reform."" Watch out for phrases like ""little talk."" Who defines what's a ""little talk"" in a presidential campaign? Columnists, that's who! Schoen and Caddell, like Tom Friedman, make a strange strategic choice to follow the arc of a campaign without burrowing into the candidates' plans. That's not new, exactly. Matt Taibbi, who has been mocking Friedman's glibness for half a decade, wrote last month that Friedman's ""analysis is to bloggers now what dick jokes are to standup comics."" What is new is a sense, among reporters, that the scolds are right. Also in Politico a couple of weeks ago, Maggie Haberman and Alexander Burns argued that 2012 is the ""smallest"" campaign in memory. ""The Obama and Romney campaigns spend all day strafing each other on Twitter,"" they wrote, ""all while decrying the campaign's lack of serious ideas for a serious time."" My colleague John Dickerson, who's covering his fifth presidential campaign, stacks Mitt Romney's available policy plans against George W. Bush's plans. The second stack is taller. But the evidence of a stupid campaign is not prima facie evidence that the entire campaign is stupid. Here's a useful way of looking at 2012. There is a Twitter Track of election news, a mardi gras of gaffes and Web ads and verbal flubs. Headlines on the Twitter Track usually involve phrases like ""fires back at,"" or ""unloads on."" And then there is a Reality Track of election news, about the policies that the next president and Congress will probably enact. These headlines usually have numbers in them, so--look, no offense--you might have missed a few. (Side note: Politico's Burns, who tweets at @aburnspolitico, has turned the shaming of lazy campaign journalism into a low-paying side gig. ""Here's a headline for all your future Joe Walsh stories,"" he wrote, after the Republican congressman made his umpteenth cheeky comment about his opponent's military service. "" 'Marginal congressman with virtually no path to reelection says something off-key.' "") The Twitter Track is constantly humming and distracting, and the campaigns keep it that way. The Romney campaign does this literally, with faux accounts that take advantage of the latest micro-story, or by piloting a campaign bus around Obama events for no purpose other than buzz-feeding. We have lived through weeks where Twitter Track stories led the news for cycle after cycle. By nature, the Twitter Track story is meaningless, frothy, and forgettable. Look back to the ""Mommy War"" that broke out after the GOP decided to pretend that Hilary Rosen, a former top recording industry lobbyist and frequent White House visitor, was speaking for the Obama campaign when she was dismissive of Ann Romney. (You can still buy ""MOMS Drive the Economy"" bumper stickers from the Romney campaign.) That was in mid-April. A Fox News poll conducted before the contretemps gave Obama a 49-41 lead over Romney among female voters. A Fox News poll conducted right afterward--one that fed voters questions about the story--gave Obama a barely-changed 47-42 lead with women. (Romney had just scared Rick Santorum out of the race, and that played into the poll changes, too.) Now, move on to this month, and Fox News gives Obama a 46-39 lead with women. How did voters process the Mommy War? They got distracted by something interesting. Compare that to the Obama campaign's focus on Mitt Romney's Bain Capital years. The Reality Track story, told to swing state voters with negative TV ads, was that Romney got rich, with little personal risk, from the dismantling of manufacturing firms. ""They promised us a health care package,"" said an angry worker in one Priorities USA ad. ""They promised us they'd maintain our retirement program. And those were the first two things that disappeared."" On the Twitter Track, the Bain story played out as a fight between surrogates. Cory Booker criticized the tone of the campaign. Bill Clinton and Ed Rendell gave normative praise of Romney's business skills. ""Will Obama's attacks on Bain backfire?"" asked CNN. The Twitter Track was obscuring everybody's view of those negative ads. This week, in their read of the swing state polls, reporters like Rick Klein and Mark Murray pointed out that the ads worked. If you lived in a swing state, you were around twice as likely as not to think of Romney's business experience and start dry-heaving. Isn't that type of ad exactly the kind of crap that the scolding columnists warned us about? That's a debate, sure, but Romney has urged voters to look to his private sector years--""I'm a business guy!"" --and understand how he'll govern. In his more specific speeches, he's endorsed the House-passed, Paul Ryan-written budget--which is full of details--and promised public sector freezes and lay-offs. The risk for the hand-wringing columnist is conflation. It's assuming that a negative attack is, by definition, a substance-free attack. That's not always true. Because of the limits of media, it might seem true. Take the example that Schoen and Caddell used--the pseudo-DREAM executive order. After he issued it, Obama appeared at the National Association of Elected and Appointed Legislators and gave a speech without a ""broad set of policies to deal with immigration reform."" Sure, the president spent more time on applause lines than on bullet-pointed policy. This was because he told the audience what his policy was, then moved on. That's how speeches work. He had supported the ""comprehensive immigration reform"" introduced by John McCain and Ted Kennedy in the Bush years, and voted for it. Do a little work (Bing, or Google, or that Jeeves site if it's still around) and you can see what was in it. Obama described how his pseudo-DREAM would work, and reiterated that he wanted the full DREAM--the version choked out by a 2010 filibuster--to pass. There is absolutely nothing stopping a voter or pundit from checking the Reality Track and schooling him- or herself on what a candidate, and his filibuster-empowered Congress, may try and do in January 2013. The campaign is just as substantive as you want it to be."	Why the 2012 Campaign Is More Substantive, Serious, and Smart Than You Think

""How many people here--this is a hypothetical question--how many people here remember what a great job he did at the Battle of Ticonderoga?"" It was the last day of June. Kibbe, the president of the Tea Party umbrella group FreedomWorks, was moderating an activist briefing/action report on the Supreme Court triumph of ""Obamacare."" Of course it would start with a Revolutionary War analogy. ""Anyone remember that?"" Kibbe asked. ""No. You remember something else that he did. And I think Justice Roberts, in his action, threw away a great legal career with one decision."" Everybody was angry, so why not vent? Every time a lower court had struck down the law, FreedomWorks had celebrated and predicted more victories. They needed those victories, because conservative courts were more trustworthy than Mitt Romney. Last July, FreedomWorks bailed on a Tea Party Express tour because Romney would appear at one stop, and the movement needed to ""defend our brand against poseurs."" Last November, FreedomWorks PAC's Max Pappas reminded activists that ""Romney called his beta version of ObamaCare 'a model for the nation.' "" And now the beta-tester for the Road to Serfdom was the GOP nominee against Barack Obama. Fantastic. Kibbe handed the call over to FreedomWorks's health care analyst Dean Clancy. The first question: Could people ""trust"" Romney to repeal the law? ""I believe that Gov. Romney is the man who put us in this fix, to some extent,"" said Clancy. ""At the same time, I believe that he is a man who can very much help us get out of this fix. He has said, repeatedly, that he would repeal Obamacare in its entirety, and he would even try to stop implementation in the states on day one."" Two things are true about the conservative movement, Romney, and health care. One: The activists don't trust him. Two: They will correct this by bending him to their will. They really don't have a choice. Romney passed a mandate-driven health care plan in Massachusetts. Ask him to renounce it, and he'll give you a PowerPoint about why he can't. On Monday, Romney's ""dark knight"" Eric Fehrnstrom confirmed that his boss ""agreed with the dissent that was written by Justice Scalia, which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax."" That's too bad, but activists and PACs don't change their thinking because a candidate says so. As Romney choked, Americans for Prosperity was rolling out a $9 million campaign with ad that deploys the word ""tax"" five times in 30 seconds. American Commitment, a new group founded by former AFP vice president Phil Kerpen, was counting up signatures and support for a ""No Mandate Tax"" campaign. Did it matter what Romney thought? ""No,"" said Kerpen. ""Whether it's an unconstitutional exercise of the commerce power or a dubious use of the taxation power has little bearing on the propriety or popularity of the provision."" You can fight this out in plenty of arenas, and in some of them you can win. On the FreedomWorks call, Clancy and others reminded Tea Partiers that their governors and legislators could throw themselves into the gears to stop Obamacare. Newly Republican legislatures spent part of 2011 passing Health Care Freedom Acts, written to ban any compliance with insurance mandates. According to the American Legislative Exchange Council, the go-to libertarian model-legislation shop, 14 states have passed the HCFA. In November, Ohio voters passed a Health Care Freedom Act by a landslide 2-1 margin. One problem with this: The HCFA doesn't actually prevent the mandate from crossing the Ohio border. ""It does not, and never did, override a federal law,"" sighed Attorney General Mike DeWine after the decision. But please, consider the Republican base. A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll, taken after the Supreme Court's health care ruling, found that only 38 percent of Americans wanted politicians to ""continue trying to block the law from being implemented."" Among Republicans? Sixty-nine percent. So the GOP needs other, better ""block Obamacare"" tactics. Some Republican-dominated legislatures have refused to implement health care exchanges. Since the decision came down, a rump of Republican governors--led by Louisiana's Bobby Jindal--have showily pledged not to implement the law until such time as they can ""elect Gov. Romney to repeal Obamacare."" Ignore the record and ignore what his flacks say. Romney will sign what conservatives make him sign. Conservatives believe this, or they're starting to. In the first 24 hours after the court saved Obamacare, the Romney campaign announced $5.5 million in new money from at least 55,000 donors. Some of those donors had clicked on a new Web ad that offered a brand new T-shirt, with the slogan ""Obamacare Survived. It Falls on November 6."" It didn't matter to most anti-war Democrats that John Kerry voted for the war and got mush-mouthed about it in the general election. The same principle's playing out here. That, and one more thing. ""The fact of the matter,"" said Dean Clancy on that FreedomWorks call, ""is [that] it would be very easy for Romney to come in and say, 'You know what, we didn't elect enough Republicans in the Senate, so we don't have enough votes to fix it.' "" You're upset about Romney's latest tax/mandate/repeal answer? Hit the ""donate"" button for your local Republican candidate instead. Make sure he signed the necessary ""repeal"" pledges. You can deal with Benedict Arnold after you win."	How the Tea Party Plans To Bend Romney to Their Will

""This is a sad day,"" said Oklahoma Rep. James Lankford. ""There is no joy in this,"" said Michigan Rep. Tim Walberg. For Republicans, certainly, days hardly get sadder. Shortly after 10 a.m., they learned from CNN and Fox News that the Affordable Care Act had been overturned. Shortly after that--after some of them had started celebrating--they learned that the act had been upheld. The next few hours were a carnival of meetings, gaffes, apologies for gaffes, and promises to hold another vote--there have been more than 30--to overturn all or part of the health care law. After that loomed the contempt vote, which Republicans were going to win. But they couldn't treat it like a win. The resolution punished Holder ""for failure to comply with a congressional subpoena,"" for not releasing tranches of documents related to the ATF's ""gun-walking"" programs--under which federal agents purportedly recorded the serial numbers of weapons and then tracked how they were used as they were trafficked to cartels in Mexico. Practically, the vote meant that the Holder case would be referred to the U.S. Attorney's office, which can punt if it wants to. Politically--hang on, don't say anything about politics! ""It looked like [Government Oversight and Reform] Chairman Darrell [Issa] gave the White House a lot of opportunities to de-escalate,"" said Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), before the vote. The focus was on transparency and executive overreach: Holder and company had slow-walked Congress, withholding information and acting in the grand, distressing tradition of executive branches everywhere. In February 2011, the DOJ claimed that it had no knowledge of the ATF's Arizona gun-walking bungle, the ""fast and furious"" operation. It later retracted that. As Katherine Eban explained in Fortune, the whole saga was one of government officials back-biting, spinning their back-biting, and otherwise avoiding transparency. But you'd have to remove part of your brain to miss the politics. In March 2011, early on in the investigation, National Rifle Association vice president Wayne LaPierre speculated about a possible conspiracy. ""They wanted to prove that there were guns flowing to Mexico,"" he told CBS News, ""so they set up an illegal pipeline to send guns to Mexico."" This was a robust seven months before a CBS investigation of the available disclosed documents actually suggested that, yes, ATF agents were apt to use the details of crimes carried out by the walked guns to advocate for stronger gun regulations. That's not quite the same as an ""Architects of Fear""-style plot, but at the NRA's April 2012 convention, Issa floated the idea. ""Could it be that what they really were thinking of was in fact to use this walking of guns in order to promote an assault weapons ban?"" he asked. ""Many think so. And they haven't come up with an explanation that would cause any of us not to agree."" Schweikert dismissed the idea that many conservatives hold this theory. ""That's a complete leftist folklore,"" he said. ""At no time--you can look at the statements from my office, my speeches--have we said oh, this was about the White House's secret plot to restrict firearms. When you see that on MSNBC and other outlets, I hate to say it, but it's almost like a flourish a magician uses to distract you."" But it was real. On June 20, the NRA sent a letter to the Issa's oversight committee promising to ""score"" the vote--counting it on the report cards that are released to tell voters whether their member is pro-gun or not. ""Heightening our concerns, and requiring our involvement,"" wrote NRA executive director Chris Cox, ""is the White House's use of this program to advance its gun control agenda."" Democrats like Minnesota Rep. Tim Walz, who would vote for contempt on transparency grounds, had to consider this issue of whether gun-walking was part of a plot to restrict the Second Amendment. ""That's a motive that was certainly not spelled out,"" said Walz today, before the vote. (He'd voted for contempt against Bush's White House counsel Harriet Miers and Chief of Staff Josh Bolten in 2008, so he was being consistent.) ""The problem is that leaving these things as speculation opens it up to what could be. I don't think it's helpful to speculate, to be honest, but that's [the NRA's] prerogative. They're an interest group [...] and that's what they believe. The teachers' unions speculate about vouchers trying to destroy public education. I've been a teachers' unions member."" When the floor debate started, the letters N, R, and A were safely tucked away from view. Republicans, to a man, began or concluded their remarks with the name of Brian Terry, the border patrol agent gunned down in December 2010 by weapons walked in ""fast and furious."" Schweikert had previewed this for me, sort of. ""As I take my vote, I'm hitting my credit card button to donate to HonorBrianTerry.com,"" he said. ""We thought there'd be an interesting symbolism to that."" There was. ""There are questions about our motivations,"" said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). ""Let me be clear about my motivations. We have a dead U.S. agent. We have more than 200 dead people in Mexico."" Democrats who enabled the administration were denying justice to a grieving family, he said. ""I can tell you this--the family of Brian Terry doesn't have answers. You don't have answers."" Issa managed the debate with iPhone in hand. The Brian Terry story would not be lost on anyone. To make sure, he gave his own remarks in front of a blown-up portrait of the agent in uniform, right above the dates of his birth and death. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), a House senior statesman, offered a (doomed) motion to stop the contempt vote. Issa warned him that the Terry family had already condemned any such efforts in a letter. ""When you say you represent the Terry family, you do not,"" said Issa. He produced the letter. ""Among the statements in there are--his statements do not represent the Terry family. ... he has never spoken to the Terry family."" Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), a former D.A. with a gift for drama, cast an even darker pall on the mood. Democrats, he said, acted as though they'd settle for ""50 percent of the truth, a third of the truth."" How could they? ""Have you ever sat down with these parents who have lost a child? It is a humbling, emotional, life-altering experience. All they want is the truth!"" Gowdy's voice broke as he finished; the Republican side of the chamber burst into applause. Chaffetz patted his colleague on the back. Issa sent a tweet: ""That was amazing."" The vote on the criminal contempt resolution was a fait accompli--255-57 for contempt, with 17 Dems on the ""yes"" side and two Republicans voting no. Most Democrats walked out of the chamber, just as Republicans had in 2008, when Miers and Bolten were held in contempt. The motives of their 17 defectors weren't hard to figure out. But what about the two Republican dissenters, Ohio's Rep. Steve LaTourette and Virginia's Rep. Scott Rigell? ""These things,"" LaTourette told PRI reporter Todd Zwillich, ""have a funny way of coming back around at you."""	Weigel: House Republicans Find Holder in Contempt of Congress--but They Can't Celebrate
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/06/john_roberts_ruling_is_a_big_win_for_barack_obama_but_the_president_is_looking_to_move_on.html	"Read the rest of Slate's coverage on the Supreme Court upholding the Affordable Care Act. President Obama's campaign team can come up from the root cellar. The summer health care tornado did not land. The Supreme Court ruled the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, protecting the president's signature legislative achievement. The decision was authored by conservative darling Chief Justice John Roberts, suggesting that, politically at least, this seal of approval was affixed by Betty Crocker herself. If the law had been struck down in whole or in large parts, it would have endorsed Mitt Romney's claim that President Obama committed a double sin: He wasted the precious start of his presidency on a wrong-headed scheme while ignoring a weak economy. But what now? Just because the Supreme Court upheld the law doesn't mean the legislation is popular. The president avoided a big defeat, but Mitt Romney's conservative base is energized. The net result is that it was a good day politically for the president, but it's a small net. If President Obama wanted to claim it, he could argue that this legal victory gives him back some of his 2008 mojo. When he signed the law in March of 2010, Obama made broad claims for it: Today, we are affirming that essential truth--a truth every generation is called to rediscover for itself--that we are not a nation that scales back its aspirations. We are not a nation that falls prey to doubt or mistrust. We don't fall prey to fear. We are not a nation that does what's easy. That's not who we are. That's not how we got here. We are a nation that faces its challenges and accepts its responsibilities. We are a nation that does what is hard. What is necessary. What is right. Here, in this country, we shape our own destiny. That is what we do. That is who we are. That is what makes us the United States of America. The president echoed some of that sentiment Thursday after the ruling. ""It should be pretty clear by now that I didn't do this because it was good politics,"" he said in the East Room of the White House, where he had signed the legislation two years earlier. ""I did it because I believed it was good for the country. I did it because I believed it was good for the American people."" The president mentioned politics 10 times in the short speech, always putting himself at arm's length from that dirty business. You may remember that was his posture in the 2008 campaign. He then launched into a story, as he did so effectively as a candidate, explaining how he carried with him the letter of a woman named Natoma Canfield who was driven to drop coverage because it was too expensive. And now that he's said this, he's going to move on from this issue. Fast. ""What we won't do--what the country can't afford to do--is refight the political battles of two years ago or go back to the way things were,"" said Obama. The president once said he welcomed a fight over health care, but he doesn't want one now. Obama aides expect and hope that Republicans will want to make the election a fight over health care, but their view is that the country does not want to go through a health care fight again. They compare the situation to the contentious Bush v. Gore ruling; liberals wanted to fight another round, but the country wanted to move on. If Obama does not embrace his victory, it will make a tidy parallel with Mitt Romney: two politicians whose signature legislation was reforming health care based on an individual mandate, both of whom would like to talk about something else. Will Mitt Romney start talking more about health care now? Conservatives would like the 2012 election to be about the Affordable Care Act. This will test Rick Santorum's contention that Mitt Romney can't argue against the ACA because of his Massachusetts health care plan. Romney in a statement after the ruling promised to work for the defeat of the president's version from his first day in office. He issued a fundraising appeal to conservatives talking about the threat to liberty. His campaign boasts that in the immediate aftermath of the ruling, they raised $1 million. Recent polling suggests that Romney might not benefit significantly outside his core constituents. It's clear that the ruling will help him with conservatives. The Affordable Care Act helped galvanize Tea Party activists in 2010. Now the only way the law can be defeated is if Mitt Romney is elected. In a recent CBS poll, 70 percent of Tea Party voters said they wanted to overturn the law. But outside that group of activists, the opposition to the law doesn't look passionate enough to drive a big group of voters. Overall, 37 percent of voters in the CBS poll think the law went too far, 27 percent think the law didn't go far enough, and another 25 percent think it's about right. That's a small base of voters for Romney to work from; he's already got most of them (84 percent of this group are either Tea Party or Republicans); and anyone who doesn't like the law but isn't already voting for Mitt Romney isn't going to be swayed just by a Supreme Court ruling. Of course this is polling before the fact. Things could change. Mitt Romney will have to make the case against health care reform with more specifics if he is to pick up more votes than he gets by merely giving it the big thumbs down. That means he'll have to engage the issue in a way he has not before. Mere assertion won't do if he's trying to convince voters that they should lose all of the benefits President Obama cites--the millions with coverage who would previously have been denied, the seniors with expanded Medicare coverage, those who are protected from insurance companies who might have dropped them before the law was passed. If Gov. Romney is going to do that, he'll have to propose an alternative. That may be turf more favorable to the president. Twice in Romney's statement responding to the ruling, he said, ""This is a choice"" when talking about the electoral conditions created by the court's action. The president has been trying to get people to see the election as a choice for months--a choice between two candidates and their plans is preferable than a referendum on his record. Right now, according to the latest Pew poll, voters say they are about evenly divided on which candidate they trust to handle the issue of health care. If Mitt Romney can convince voters that health care is an economic issue, he'll be fighting on his turf. The Pew poll shows that by an 8-point margin, voters trust him to handle the economy over Obama. Romney could use Roberts' argument that the individual mandate is a tax (and not a penalty) against the president as a part of his larger argument that Obama is an old-style liberal who will raise your taxes. The peril of that approach, though, is that it will lead to a debate about Romney's use of tax penalties as governor of Massachusetts. If voters see health care as a matter of which candidate will look out for them, then Obama has the advantage. He leads Romney by 31 points in the latest Pew poll when respondents were asked, ""Who connects more with ordinary Americans?"" In this fight, the president may have an unlikely ally in Chief Justice Roberts. By upholding the law and authoring the decision, he lent an extra measure of validation. According to a recent CBS poll, 76 percent of the country thinks Supreme Court justices make their decisions based on politics. If that were true, John Roberts would have ruled against the president. Since he didn't, it could suggest wider approval than if Obama had won with a 5-4 majority signed by Justice Kennedy. Robert's role led to an outcry from conservatives like Sarah Palin, Red State's Erick Erikson, and Rep. Jack Kingston, who Tweeted that after the ruling he was no longer friends with John Roberts. Perhaps the chief justice should head down the root cellar until this thing clears."	Did Obama Just Get His Mojo Back?
