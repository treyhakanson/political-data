He visits late-night talk shows--just like your favorite celebrities! He has an adorable dog--just like you! He drops into sports bars and fills out an NCAA bracket--just like that one guy at the office! But when the topic of Edward Snowden comes up, President Obama talks like he's at the summit of Olympus, uninterested in mortals. It's not a very convincing act. In June, he scoffed at the idea of ""scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker."" Snowden was actually 30, and within a week a U.S. ally would ground a plane because of a rumor Snowden had boarded it. At Friday's press conference, at which Obama discussed potential changes to America's surveillance programs, NBC News' Chuck Todd asked the president whether Snowden was a ""patriot,"" and he scoffed again. ""I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot,"" he said. ""I called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks. ... Mr. Snowden's been charged with three felonies [and] if in fact he believes that what he did was right, then, like every American citizen, he can come here, appear before the court with a lawyer and make his case."" The outsized ire makes a lot of sense. If you're praising spies and snoops, you can't be praising a quasi-defector working from Russia to undermine them, no matter how popular he is. The Snowden-bashing just isn't terribly consistent, as Obama proved as his answer to Todd's question spooled out. He insisted that his May speech at the National Defense University put new pressure on the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and reminded reporters that he'd ""signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistle-blower protection to the intelligence community for the first time."" A minute later, he demolished that line with an epic on-the-other-hand. ""There's no doubt that Mr. Snowden's leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through--and I'd sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through--it would have been less exciting and it would not have generated as much press. I actually think we would have gotten to the same place, and we would have done so without putting at risk our national security and some very vital ways that we are able to get intelligence that we need to secure the country,"" Obama said. Well, yes, that's true. Congress is brimming with reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court and Section 215 of the Patriot Act that had stalled out without the impetus of a new surveillance scandal. Far from acting as a distracting soap opera (though it felt like that, at times), the Snowden story really did pique interest in reform bills. The president's mission, as set out on Friday, is to take credit for all the reforms that sound the best, and to re-establish the government as a trusted actor without doing much that's new. In that May speech at the National Defense University, Obama committed to ""a strong Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to review those issues where our counterterrorism efforts and our values may come into tension."" On Friday, he said that he'd ""asked the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to review where our counterterrorism efforts and our values come into tension."" Created in 2004, on the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, the board was effectively powerless until three months ago, when it finally got a chairman, and the president's still bland when it comes to its goals. Blandness serves a purpose. The White House's plans for a website that will ""serve as the hub for further transparency"" are obviously silly, and the most concrete plan denoted in the press conference may not have a real impact. ""One of the concerns that people raise is that a judge reviewing a request from the government to conduct programmatic surveillance only hears one side of the story,"" Obama said. ""We can take steps to make sure civil liberties concerns have an independent voice, in appropriate cases, by ensuring that the government's position is challenged by an adversary."" He was referring obliquely to a Democratic bill that would create a ""public advocate"" in the FISA court. Civil libertarians wonder if that would truly add more accountability to the process, or whether it would become yet another surveillance rubber stamp. At least they've got the White House talking. Six weeks ago, the National Security Agency story was discussed as one of a ""hat trick"" of scandals. The other stories bugging the administration were investigations into the aftermath of the Benghazi, Libya, attack and into the Internal Revenue Service's irritating questions to conservative groups. Benghazi was mentioned once in Friday's press conference; the IRS wasn't mentioned at all. The questioning remained broad and big picture, apart from the focus on Snowden. That made for a contradictory call-and-response. On domestic matters, the president got to talk about his clout and the Republicans' lack thereof. When asked what ""political leverage"" he had to get an immigration bill signed, he said he was ""absolutely confident that if that bill was on the floor of the House, it would pass."" Asked about the coming appointment of a Federal Reserve chairman, he promised a nominee who believed in full employment. ""A big part of my job right now is to make sure the economy's growing quickly and robustly and is sustained and durable so that people who work hard in this country are able to find a job,"" he said. Surveillance policy is ""part of his job,"" too. It reveals the range of his powers and the limits of his control. No reporter asked the president about another angle of the story: the Drug Enforcement Administration getting tips from the NSA and using them for investigations. Today, Snowden's the human problem that the White House can't control. Tomorrow, it'll be someone else."	President Obama Dismisses Edward Snowden From Astride Mount Olympus	['Obama']	[]

The new accuser was a nurse who met with Filner in June to secure help for--wait for it--an Iraq War veteran suffering from brain injuries. Filner, according to the nurse, asked everyone else to leave the room so he could flirt. ""I want you to go out to dinner with me,"" said Filner, according to Allred. ""Will you go to dinner with me if I help your Marine?"" Lori Saldana was watching Allred's press conference on her iPhone, streaming the video between meetings. Her disgust was magnified by the predictability of the whole thing. In 2011, while still in the California Assembly, Saldana told San Diego County Democratic Party Chairman Jess Durfee that Filner had been ""harassing women and acting inappropriately."" The stories she heard then sounded like the one she heard now: Filner was picking a moment in a professional meeting when a woman could be ""isolated from others in the group"" and subjected to his charms. ""Durfee is a gay man, so I don't know that he understood the power dynamics,"" speculates Saldana. ""The dynamics were completely unequal. Filner was propositioning women who needed his help. Of course they weren't coming forward themselves. But I was told, 'I heard rumors about you and Bob not getting along,' which was true. Bob apparently told him there was nothing to it because nobody had ever filed an ethics complaint."" That was Filner's defense, according to Durfee. It looked like the public record against her word, and she'd been clashing with Filner on policy for a while, anyway. ""When Lori approached me to basically say something negative about Bob Filner,"" Durfee says, ""I started with a certain amount of skepticism. My response was I'd be happy to talk to any of these individuals."" The only story Durfee could corroborate, of Escondido's mayor being hit on by Filner, didn't really rise to the level of sexual harassment. ""Had I gone before any group of Democrats and said that this was the case against Filner, I would have been laughed at. That was basically what I had to work with."" Bob Filner spent 20 years in the House of Representatives. At no time did any colleagues file ethics complaints against him. Some staffers for other members of Congress or campaigns call him ""creepy"" or say his overestimation of his own wittiness led him to say odd things to women. So Washington isn't drop-dead shocked at what Filner did. It just doesn't look like what he did around the Capitol. Conservatives watching this scandal wonder if Filner's colleagues are engaged in a cover-up. They remember how Republican Rep. Mark Foley was rushed out of Congress right before the 2006 elections, after former pages came out and said he'd used his status to hit on them. They also point to Hilary Rosen, a Democrat-around-town and CNN contributor who repeated what ""former members"" told her at dinner last month. ""[They] said this guy has kind of been this way all along,"" said Rosen, ""that everybody thought he was a little creepy."" But Filner's ultra-slow-motion downfall--he's working through nine more days of ""therapy"" on the city's dime--tells us just how long you can get away with being a creep in politics. The tolerance for mild creepiness is quite high, because your victims don't know how much of it they're expected to put up with. The tolerance is higher if you save the high-level grossness for your district, instead of doing it in full view of the D.C. press corps and your colleagues. For a while, Filner pulled this off. He wasn't a terribly popular member of his party; when Democrats won back Congress in 2007, he had to fight Maine Rep. Mike Michaud for the chairmanship of the House veterans affairs committee, and only beat him 24-20 in the steering committee. Nobody brought up any accusations of sexual harassment. The argument was that Filner was abrasive and didn't play well with Republicans. The first part of that was borne out quickly, after Filner attacked a Dulles baggage handler over lost luggage. The victim actually appeared in an anti-Filner ad last year; Filner won anyway. The nasty side of Filner was easier to spot when he returned home. In 2004, when she was working her way up in California politics, Saldana had dinner with the congressman. ""It was the most awkward dinner I've ever had,"" she remembers. ""I heard him make disparaging remarks about the women he was serving with. 'She dresses like a hooker'--stuff like that, comments on women's appearances. ... Which ones? I don't even want to get into the details and embarrass them."" So Filner was reckless in front of a Democrat he barely knew. He was, apparently, more careful in D.C., and that separated him from the members who'd brought themselves down during his tenure. Mark Foley fixated on pages who worked on the Hill and lived nearby. Eric Massa ""tickled"" three staffers, who took their stories to the House ethics committee. Both of those incidents spurred the usual ""and when did you know it"" questions to party leaders, questions that conservatives want the media to ask Democrats. The D.C. Democrats plead ignorance, and indeed, the harassment and flirtations that people know about all happened somewhere else. But for a while the same had been true of Massa. After his 2010 ethics complaint emerged, Joshua Green talked to Massa's former subordinates in the Navy about the ""special massages"" he'd offer/inflict upon them. He was ""notorious"" for this, but he didn't get caught. ""Massa's shipmates didn't turn him in for fear that he would retaliate."" Filner's alleged victims weren't able to retaliate, either. One was a university administrator with a question about land use near the Naval Training Center. One, Gerry Tindly, was an Army veteran and rape survivor who'd just given a speech about her horror at a ""healing and hiring fair."" When Filner came onto her, she wondered what could happen if she exposed him. ""What am I gonna say?"" she told CNN. ""You're a congressman. What am I gonna say to you? What am I gonna say to this man? Can he destroy my life, can he stop me from moving forward?"" He couldn't, it turned out, but what made him act that way? For most of his career Filner was married, and his second wife lived in D.C. ""He might have been constrained there,"" says Saldana. ""When I served on the [California] Assembly ethics committee, I heard a lot of complaints, but I found that if there was a spouse in closer proximity to a member, it reduced the problems like this."" But in his final term in Congress, before he ran for mayor, Filner got divorced. In 2012, when meeting with gay activists, he half-joked that his lousy adventures with matrimony made him unsympathetic about marriage rights. ""As a heterosexual person who's been married, you can take quite a cynical view of marriage and wonder why would you want to,"" Filner said. ""The last one took all my money; all my property."" Filner wasn't just dropping warning signs. He was buying a 500-foot billboard and scrawling the word ""WARNING"" across it in day-glo colors. He might have expected that the niceties of politics, the lack of complaints against him, and a focus on women far from the spotlight would protect him. For quite a while, it did. Saldana ended up endorsing Filner for mayor. ""At that point in time,"" says Durfee, ""I was thinking, well, just how seriously was she about Bob Filner?"""

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/reince_priebus_threatens_nbc_and_cnn_the_republican_party_will_refuse_to.html	"Six long years ago, the Democratic candidates for president declared war on Fox News. The channel had partnered with the Congressional Black Caucus to put on a debate. The party's online activist base, growing every month, started asking Democrats to skip that one. John Edwards went first, then Barack Obama, then Hillary Clinton, then--oh, the indignity--Bill Richardson! The debate was canceled faster than a Rob Schneider sitcom. But the death rattle lasted for weeks. The Democratic campaigns were explicit: They canceled, in the words of an Edwards spokesman, because ""there's just no reason for Democrats to give Fox a platform to advance the right-wing agenda while pretending they're objective."" Republicans and some media watchers warned that the diss would dog the party. ""Any candidate for high office from either party who believes he can blacklist any news organization is making a terrible mistake about journalists,"" said Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes. He was wrong, at least that year. Democrats debated on other networks and produced a winning ticket. The lesson, finally internalized by Republicans, is that threatening to skip debates because of ""bias"" is a thrill for your base and does no harm to your candidates. Cue today's letters from RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who warned the presidents of NBC Entertainment and CNN Worldwide what might happen if two in-production Hillary Clinton films aired. ""The committee will neither partner with you in 2016 primary debates nor sanction primary debates which you sponsor,"" wrote Priebus. It's not always easy to get every Republican activist in 50 states singing from the same hymnal. That letter made it incredibly easy, because basically every Republican agreed with it. Even the March 2013 ""party autopsy"" report, which asked Republicans to moderate their messaging, bemoaned the early and loaded schedule of the 2012 campaign and how ""the media"" decided it. ""In order to have a process that respects a candidate's time and one that helps the Party win,"" wrote the experts, ""the Party should create a system that results in a more rational number of debates."" Rational means 10 to 12, maybe, and rational means no more jumping for everything the media proposes. ""We're sending a signal to the media that we're not going to tolerate this anymore,"" said A.J. Spiker, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. ""For too long the Republicans have really stood back and stayed quiet and helpless as the networks have covered everything except the news--as they've become platforms for left-wing causes and candidates. That's got to change. We're not going to tolerate left-wing media propping up the people they want to run for president."" Be fair: This was the logic Democrats used to kill the Fox debate. They viewed the debate as an attempt to legitimize a network they saw as illegitimate. The Republican version has a more pained, less universal hook, sticking to the outrage of a docudrama that might--well, nobody knows what it might contain, but it's got Diane Lane in the lead, so it's not going to be a takedown. ""Liberals complained noisily when Citizens United sought to air a pay-per-view documentary on Hillary Clinton prior to the 2008 election,"" wrote Priebus, ""and yet they're conspicuously silent now."" Priebus has given the networks nine days to answer the demand. For a moment, put aside the demand. Would it be such a terrible crime for the GOP to scrap some ""mainstream media"" debates in 2015? Would it be an improvement if the party put together more forums--viewable online, of course, or maybe on Fox--where the questions came from people they liked? No, no, that could be fascinating. Republicans know exactly how to handle the mainstream media, and they know how to play against it. Newt Gingrich was never stronger than when he joined debate crowds in solidarity against whatever ""preposterous"" question that day's rent-an-anchor was asking him. They're often more compelling when their interviews are pushing them from the right. Who but Bill O'Reilly would tell John McCain that pro-immigration reform forces on the left ""want to break down the white Christian male power structure of which you are a part?"" Who but Glenn Beck would get Rand Paul to reveal his synapse-by-synapse approach to leveraging Senate votes for what he wanted? That's not to say the median conservative media interview is really tough, in the traditional sense. Republicans don't give interviews to Sean Hannity or their local radio host because they'll get grilled. They go because they get to say what they believe in a setting cozier and more lulling than an opium den. But there are advantages to that, and there are questions and ways of asking questions that the ""MSM"" wouldn't think to use. Look back to the 2011 debate co-sponsored by the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. It wasn't memorable, really, because nobody gaffed or imploded on the stage, but it took the candidates into turf they'd never been asked to explore. Ed Meese, the former attorney general and now full-time conservative scold, asked the candidates whether they'd make the Patriot Act permanent. ""Shouldn't we have a long-range extension of the investigative powers contained in the act so that our law enforcement officers can have the tools that they need?"" he asked. Fred Kagan, the think tanker most responsible for the Iraq ""surge,"" asked the only question about drone strikes in any debate that year: ""Do you think that an expanded drone campaign in Pakistan would be sufficient to defeat al-Qaeda and to secure our interests in Pakistan?"" The format wasn't perfect, as CNN was actually running the thing, and Wolf Blitzer got to ask the follow-ups. But those questions! They were the reality-based, policy-based questions that Aaron Sorkin fans (or Aaron Sorkin himself) dream about when the Professional Debates devolve into ""this or that"" questions. Watching the candidates submit to litmus tests, in real time, might give us new shades and details. Maybe the Hillary threat doesn't look serious, but today the party said that candidates who agreed to debates on any rogue networks would face sanctions. ""There comes a point where you have to draw a line in the sand,"" Spiker says. ""Twenty, thirty, forty years ago, you had to use certain networks to get your message out. That's just not true today. We'll get our Republican candidates in front of the voters."""	Why Republican Candidates Should Only Debate Each Other on Fox News.	['Clinton', 'Paul', 'Wolf', 'Black', 'McCain']	[]
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/democratic_party_control_of_the_senate_how_bad_are_their_chances_in_2014.html	"Sen. Michael Bennet's timing was almost perfect. At 1 p.m., he was supposed to meet with reporters in the Escher-esque Maryland Avenue house that Democratic senators use for political work. Bennet, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was tasked with explaining how his party would ""hold the majority."" A few hours earlier, Associated Press reporters in Arkansas broke news that Republican Rep. Tom Cotton would run against Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor. Pryor's resume: son of a senator turned fairly unremarkable senator in a state Barack Obama lost by 24 points. Cotton's resume: 34-year-old Harvard Law-educated veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Club for Growth had been on the air in Arkansas since February with ads condemning ""Obama's senator"" and with polls showing Cotton (who'd been elected just months earlier) up by 8 points in a hypothetical race. This was what Bennet had to deal with when he took his seat in front of the press corps. To his left, an LED screen displayed the map of 2014 Senate races, under the ominous slogan ""Hand We Were Dealt."" To hold onto the Senate, Bennet's party could only afford to lose five races. It took nine minutes for Bennet to address Arkansas. ""There are a number of Washington groups that were instrumental in recruiting Tom Cotton into this race,"" he said in his calming monotone, somewhere on the tone scale between family doctor and late-night public radio host. ""I think they're going to regret somebody so ideological, [who was] just elected last year and thinks he deserves a promotion."" Later that day, Cotton would ""likely"" oppose a student loan compromise ""because he doesn't think students deserve support when they go to college."" Pretty thin, but what else could he say? Anyone with a map handy can see how fragile the Democrats' eight-seat Senate majority actually is. (In two months, when Newark Mayor Cory Booker most likely becomes a Democratic senator from New Jersey, it'll be a 10-vote margin. For now it's eight.) In the 2008 Democratic rout, the party managed to scare off challengers in West Virginia, South Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas, to defeat a scandalized incumbent in Alaska, and to upset Republican incumbents in Oregon, Minnesota, and North Carolina. The map will never look like that again. In West Virginia, Montana, and South Dakota which haven't voted for a Democratic president since 1996, 1992, and 1964, long-time Democratic incumbents are retiring.* In the first two, Republicans have already recruited Rep. Shelley Moore Capito and former Gov. Mike Rounds, candidates with moderate profiles and avert-your-eyes poll leads. Democrats haven't recruited anyone, though according to Bennet they're still doing so ""aggressively."" In Montana, Democrats expected to run former Gov. Brian Schweitzer, until he surprised everyone and said ""no."" That decision inspired a Nate Silver post about how ""Senate control in 2014 increasingly looks like a tossup,"" which in turn inspired a wave of that most renewable resource: Democratic panic. Let's categorize the forms of panic. Using the defense readiness condition preferred by the armed forces, here they are. Defcon 5: This is a happier place than the one Democrats currently live in. At the briefing, Bennet insisted that control of the Senate would come down to six states: Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Alaska, Kentucky, and Georgia. Four Democrats, four Republicans, all in ""red America."" He moved right passed Montana and West Virginia, where the local Democratic parties lost ground in 2012 but held onto a decent bench of candidates. So: What if they come off the bench? Democrats failed to bring Montana's state auditor into the race, and they've failed more dramatically to recruit West Virginia Democratic players. State Supreme Court Justice Robin Davis didn't just opt out; she added that her party had ""no leadership and no vision."" And it sort of doesn't, being one of the last redoubts of white conservative Democrats. On a reporting trip to that state in 2010, I saw sign after sign, white letters on black paper, telling voters that [name of Democrat in the area] = OBAMA. It almost worked! In a dream scenario, the Democrats manage to pull candidates into these races. Guy Cecil, the DSCC's political director, kept reminding reporters at the briefing that now-North Dakota Sen. Heidi Keitkamp wasn't even recruited until 11 months before her election. This is true, but human cloning is still illegal. Defcon 4: That's where Democrats are now. The smart money in Washington is for a hung Senate--maybe the party loses West Virginia, South Dakota, Arkansas, Montana, and Alaska. But Democrats aren't actually down in the polls in Alaska. That state, which hadn't previously elected a Democratic senator since Mike Gravel (yes, him), is a test case of whether Democrats can help a lousy candidate navigate the Republican primary to face the DSCC on the killing field. Begich is four points ahead of Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, who's running, but he'd be 12 points ahead of Sarah Palin if she ran, and he'd be doing even better if failed (and Palin-endorsed) 2010 GOP candidate Joe Miller won the primary. Knowing this, Begich has aggressively trolled Palin, and gotten the predictable angry response in the form of Facebook posts. This is a playbook Democrats haven't snapped shut yet. In 2012, Guy Cecil helped shape Sen. Claire McCaskill's strategy of elevating Todd Akin by attacking him as the ""most conservative"" candidate in TV ads that, obviously, thrilled conservatives. In 2014, they could try that in Georgia, where two of the most right-wing members of the House are trying to make the runoff. ""They've never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity,"" said Bennet. Would the DSCC help them in that effort? ""If we did, I wouldn't tell you."" Defcon 3: This is where the recruiting fails, Sen. Mitch McConnell discredits everyone running against him, and control of the Senate comes down to saving North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu. Both of them ran ahead of Barack Obama in 2008, but both benefited from higher turnout with the black voters who made up, respectively, 29 percent and 19 percent of the electorate. In 2010, when that turnout fell, Democrats were vaporized in both states. If things get desperate, Democratic survival will depend on getting that turnout up--maybe not to presidential levels, but 2 to 3 points higher than 2010. White conservative voters will turn out anyway. ""I'm sure Republicans will suggest Barack Obama is on the ballot in 2014,"" said Bennet. ""He's not on the ballot."" Defcon 2: It's fantasy for now, but what would happen to the Democrats if the rest of their open seats got competitive? Their current map includes open seats in Michigan and Iowa, newly won seats in Colorado and New Mexico, and seats in purple territory like New Hampshire, Oregon, and Minnesota. None of these races are competitive right now. ""We're going to win Michigan,"" Bennet predicted, deriding Republicans for trying to coax another candidate into the race months after the Democrats settled on theirs. (Yes, the Democrats are in the exact same position in West Virginia, but don't point that out, thanks.) If one or a few of these seats opens up, real panic begins. Defcon 1: Total chaos, otherwise normal citizens cracking each others' skulls open to feast on the goo inside. This was where Democrats found themselves in the final stretch of 2010, when even Sen. Barbara Boxer temporarily looked like she could go down. They're not there yet. They might lose the Senate in far kinder circumstances. Correction, Aug. 5, 2013: This article incorrectly stated that a Democratic presidential candidate had not won the state of Montana since 1964. In fact, Bill Clinton won Montana in 1992. (Return.)"

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/nsa_lexicon_how_james_clapper_and_other_u_s_officials_mislead_the_american.html	"James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, has been harshly criticized for having misled Congress earlier this year about the scope of the National Security Agency's surveillance activities. The criticism is entirely justified. An equally insidious threat to the integrity of our national debate, however, comes not from officials' outright lies but from the language they use to tell the truth. When it comes to discussing government surveillance, U.S. intelligence officials have been using a vocabulary of misdirection--a language that allows them to say one thing while meaning quite another. The assignment of unconventional meanings to conventional words allows officials to imply that the NSA's activities are narrow and closely supervised, though neither of those things is true. What follows is a lexicon for decoding the true meaning of what NSA officials say. Surveillance. Every time we pick up the phone, the NSA makes a note of whom we spoke to, when we spoke to him, and for how long--and it's been doing this for seven years. After the call-tracking program was exposed, few people thought twice about attaching the label ""surveillance"" to it. Government officials, though, have rejected the term, pointing out that this particular program doesn't involve the NSA actually listening to phone calls--just keeping track of them. Their crabbed definition of ""surveillance"" allows them to claim that the NSA isn't engaged in surveillance even when it quite plainly is. Collect. If an intelligence official says that the NSA isn't ""collecting"" a certain kind of information, what has he actually said? Not very much, it turns out. One of the NSA's foundational documents states that ""collection"" occurs not when the government acquires information but when the government ""selects"" or ""tasks"" that information for ""subsequent processing."" Thus it becomes possible for the government to acquire great reams of information while denying that it is ""collecting"" anything at all. Relevant. The NSA's call-tracking program is ostensibly based on the Patriot Act's Section 215, a provision that allows the government to compel businesses to disclose records that are ""relevant"" to authorized foreign intelligence investigations. The theory, it seems, is that everybody's phone records are relevant today because anybody's phone records might become relevant in the future. This stretches the concept of ""relevance"" far beyond the breaking point. Even the legislator who wrote Section 215 has rejected the government's theory. If ""relevance"" is given such a broad compass, what room is left for ""irrelevance""? Targeted. The call-tracking program is only one of the NSA's surveillance efforts. Another is what's been branded PRISM, a program that involves the acquisition of the contents of phone calls, emails, and other electronic communications. Americans need not worry about the program, the government says, because the NSA's surveillance activities are ""targeted"" not at Americans but at foreigners outside the United States. No one should be reassured by this. The government's foreign targets aren't necessarily criminals or terrorists--they may be journalists, lawyers, academics, or human rights advocates. And even if one is indifferent to the NSA's invasion of foreigners' privacy, the surveillance of those foreigners involves the acquisition of Americans' communications with those foreigners. The spying may be ""targeted"" at foreigners, but it vacuums up thousands of Americans' phone calls and emails. Incidental. Because the government's surveillance targets are foreigners outside the United States, intelligence officials describe the acquisition of Americans' communications as ""incidental."" But the truth is that the statute behind PRISM--the FISA Amendments Act of 2008--was intended to let the government conduct warrantless surveillance of these very communications. In the debate that preceded passage of the law, intelligence officials told Congress that it was Americans' communications that were of most interest to them. Indeed, when some legislators introduced bills that would have barred access to these communications without a warrant, President Bush said he would veto them. (One of those bills, incidentally, was introduced by then-Sen. Barack Obama.) Inadvertent. The PRISM program sweeps up Americans' purely domestic communications, too. Officials have said that the collection of domestic communications is ""inadvertent,"" but PRISM's very design makes the collection of Americans' domestic communications perfectly predictable. This is in part because the NSA presumes that its surveillance targets are foreigners outside the United States unless it has specific information to the contrary. In 2009, the New York Times reported that the NSA's collection of purely domestic communications under the 2008 statute had been ""significant and systemic."" Minimize. What does the NSA do with communications that are acquired ""incidentally"" or ""inadvertently""? As intelligence officials have told the courts and Congress, so-called ""minimization"" procedures limit the NSA's retention and use of information about American citizens and permanent residents. Here again, though, the terminology is grossly misleading. The 2008 statute gives the NSA broad latitude to retain Americans' communications, share them with other agencies, and even share them with foreign governments. The NSA's own documents suggest that the agency retains Americans' communications indefinitely if they include ""foreign intelligence information,"" a term defined so broadly that it encompasses any conversation relating to foreign affairs. Even communications that don't include foreign intelligence information are retained for as long as five years. No. When James Clapper was asked at a March Senate hearing whether the NSA was collecting information about millions of Americans, he answered, ""No,"" and then, after a pause, ""not wittingly."" As Clapper has now conceded, the correct answer was simply ""yes."" Officials who describe the NSA's activities using strategically idiosyncratic terminology presumably believe that they are telling the truth. In a certain formal sense, they usually are--though Clapper's statement is a glaring exception. It shouldn't need to be said, though, that their duties as public officials go beyond the avoidance of perjury charges. They have an obligation to ensure that the courts, Congress, and the public fully understand the policies that they are being asked to accept. They could start by using the same dictionary the rest of us do."	How to Decode the True Meaning of What NSA Officials Say	['Obama']	[]

Bradley Manning trial came down a little after 1 p.m., not an ideal time for members of the U.S. Senate. Democrats and Republicans were meeting for their weekly lunches, and when they exited, around 2 p.m., most of them pled ignorance of the WikiLeaks source's fate--guilty of violating the Espionage Act, guilty of stealing government property, acquitted of ""aiding the enemy."" Only the disappointed senators seemed willing to dish. ""I'm very surprised by the verdict,"" said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, ranking member of the Homeland Security committee and one of the Republicans on the Select Committee on Intelligence. ""I believe the information he disclosed was extremely harmful to our country. It is not in the same category as [Edward] Snowden's betrayals, but it's very serious nonetheless. I respect the judgment, even though I find it hard to believe."" North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, another member of the intelligence committee, cheered himself with the guilty verdicts. ""Clearly if you look at the other charges, many of which he pleaded guilty to, there's a substantial amount of jail time that's probably triggered--probably at least 20 years,"" said Burr. ""I'm more focused now on trying to find Snowden, and trying to get him in front of the judicial process, but I think this should discourage other leakers. I don't think anybody wants to serve jail time."" The dream of dissuading future leakers had been a goal all along--the executive branch's goal, and the Senate's. Convicting Manning of violating the Espionage Act was the sort of win Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein had wanted all along. ""The Supreme Court has held that its protections of free speech and freedom of the press are not a green light to abandon the protection of our vital national interests,"" she argued in 2010, at that time making the case for prosecuting Julian Assange, the man who took Manning's information and spread it online. Assange called today's verdict ""the first ever espionage conviction against a whistleblower"" and ""a dangerous precedent and an example of national security extremism."" But it wasn't a new definition or precedent on ""aiding the enemy."" The government had argued that Manning possessed an ""evil intent"" when he burned diplomatic cables onto CDs then handed the information to the Assange organization. It cited, for example, the case of Pvt. Henry Vanderwater, a treacherous soldier in the Union army who'd given a command roster to a Confederate newspaper. And had the government won, someone who revealed information later used by, say, al-Qaida, would have been as legally liable as someone who passed secrets directly to the terrorists. The government didn't win. The legislators and spymasters who insist that Manning was a traitor--and that Snowden is a traitor too--have a weaker case today. Feinstein insisted that Snowden ""violated his oath,"" and thus committed ""treason."" Over in Fort Meade, Col. Denise Lind has declared that Manning didn't truly intend to aid the enemy. That's a major setback for intel hawks (or whatever you can call these people), because despite the outrage generated on the Hill, there's no real momentum for legislation to further criminalize leaking. A brutal judgment from Lind was the best they could have hoped for, and this one wasn't brutal enough. So Manning's critics gritted their teeth and praised the court. ""I'm not saying WikiLeaks was the enemy,"" said Collins today. ""I'm saying that the information revealed was helpful to those who do not wish us well. "" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former JAG lawyer, declined to second-guess the judgment from Fort Meade. ""I think it's a logical consequence that the enemy might pick up the information leaked here, but I think the statute is written that you have to intend that,"" he said. ""But I can understand why the judge ruled that way, and I think the process has been fair. I respect the court's decision. I think he should have been tried for all the crimes, including aiding the enemy. The process worked, didn't it?"" Graham headed out of the Capitol on a hopeful note. ""This is one of the more serious things that I've seen a military member do in 30 years,"" he said. ""I hope people who say he's a hero see they're misguided in terms of what a hero might be."""

The White House strategy for the fall relies on back-to-back capitulations from conservative Republicans on the core issues of taxes and spending and immigration. That's bad news for supporters of comprehensive immigration reform. Their issue is going to come up after a deal is reached on the budget, which means passage of comprehensive reform would require the second huge cave by Republican leaders. That's more spelunking than the system can tolerate. Last week President Obama started framing the fall's budget fights. The first battle will be over the continued funding of the government after money runs out Sept. 30. Then there will be a squabble over raising the debt limit. In the first fight, Democrats and the president want to avoid the next round of sequestration cuts and repair the damage done by the ones that have already taken place. On the other side stand House Republicans and some newer Republican arrivals in the Senate who oppose this effort and have even more ambitious fiscal goals. They want to reduce government spending by far more than the White House and Senate Democrats want, and they want to use these crisis moments as leverage to defund the president's health care plan. The president has some leverage in the budget argument. Republican leaders don't want to look like they are being reckless with the credit of the United States. That's why they backed off a debt limit fight earlier in the year. Several Republicans, including conservatives like Sen. Richard Burr and Rep. Tom Cole, have already spoken out against the Obamacare defunding gambit. The president also has Republican allies who are trying to rescue defense cuts from the dumb across-the-board nature of the sequestration. And he knows that the business interests backing the GOP--and wealthy patrons writing checks for their fall campaigns--do not want to rattle the markets with more talk of a government shutdown or default on the full faith and credit of the United States. You could see the president pressing this advantage in his speech last week. Though he said he was willing to work with Republicans on solving the budget impasse, it was an even more meaningless overture than usual because in the very next sentence this is how he characterized Republicans: ""There are Republicans in Congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas I'll be proposing. I know because they've said so. But they worry they'll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me. Now, there are others who will dismiss every idea I put forward either because they're playing to their most strident supporters or, in some cases, because sincerely they have a fundamentally different vision for America--one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families."" When you're characterizing the people most likely to work with you as moral cowards, you're not starting negotiations in a happy place. Better, I suppose, than the other two categories of Republican the president outlined: political hacks and the heartless who enjoy inequality, pain, and uncertainty. The president was a little more generous about the ""thoughtful and sensible"" Republicans in the Senate in his recent New York Times interview, but for now, despite regular meetings, the president and Senate Republicans remain far apart. These are going to be ugly fights. Senate Democrats are calling for $91 billion more in spending for next year than the House Republican majority is planning to spend. The president is saying he's not going to negotiate on raising the debt limit, but Speaker John Boehner says that every dollar the debt limit increases must be matched with a dollar in spending cuts. These impasses will have to get resolved, and when they are, a sizable group of conservative Republicans will be very angry about the outcome. They'll be angry because the federal government will not have shrunk as much as they'd like and because they will have lost a high-profile fight to a president who characterized them as unprincipled hacks backed by constituents too dumb to understand the genius of his policies. It's in this dismal atmosphere that the House will turn to immigration reform. John Boehner has been adamant that he won't bring immigration reform for a vote in the House without the support of a majority of Republicans. The problem is that the 2012 election didn't put pressure on enough Republicans to move an immigration bill. Passage of a comprehensive plan in the Senate didn't do that either. So for the last few weeks comprehensive immigration reform supporters have been promoting a theory about how reform passes the House with a wink and a nod between John Boehner and a bloc of conservatives. The theory about how he picks his own lock goes something like this: These conservatives get so much pressure from pro-comprehensive reform forces like evangelical leaders, farmers, and the Chamber of Commerce that they realize that a comprehensive bill must pass. They go to Speaker Boehner and say that they won't support such a bill but they also won't raise total hell about it if one passes. They won't challenge his speakership and they won't make future legislation impossible. Essentially, they give him permission to go back on his word and allow a vote without a majority of the majority. This scenario has always seemed like a fantasy. It's logistically complex, requiring a lot of agreements and relying on secrecy and trust of a kind that is uncharacteristic of the 113th Congress. And it needs time. Conservative opponents of reform need to feel like they are being heard, their concerns are being met at some level, and they need an opportunity for their constituents to get to yes too. That time for consideration is going to be shredded by the budget fight. Rushed deals, like the last-minute attempt in the Senate to buy support with a host of new spending on border agents and fencing, didn't work. If this immigration Plan C is going to work, it also means the president keeping his distance from the process so that no one would get hung up on the idea that they were giving him something he wanted. It's a fantasy, but senators in the Gang of Eight and members of the White House staff have been promoting it enough that you have to at least think through the plausibility. But when you do engage in this mental experiment, it's hard to keep out the smell of acrid smoke and big piles of rubble that will be the result of the budget wars. The budget fights will not just further spoil relations between the left and right, but they will also poke at the lack of trust between grassroots conservatives and Washington politicians. John Boehner and his team are going to have a hell of a time asking a member to take a second set of tough votes their constituents won't like. The rank-and-file opposition to immigration reform may be overstated, but what comprehensive immigration proponents will face in the fall is not just opposition to the immigration reform itself, but opposition to the entire Washington process. In the wake of the budget fights, that process will have just offended them afresh."	How Imminent Fights Over the Budget Could Spell Doom for Immigration Reform	['Obama', 'Burr']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/chris_christie_is_the_favorite_for_the_gop_s_super_rich_the_gop_wants_the.html	"Two summers ago, after Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels decided not to run for president, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was summoned to meet Henry Kissinger. ""When he called me into his office,"" Christie told Washington Post reporter Dan Balz, ""he just said, 'The country needs a change and you connect with people in a way that I haven't seen a politician connect with someone in a long time.' "" Kissinger's pitch is a highlight of Balz's forthcoming campaign book Collision 2012. Christie, as other early readers have noted, hardly needs prodding to talk about how many ""unsolicited phone calls"" came in asking him to run. In context he's fairly dazzled about the attention--and revealing about what the GOP icons and donors planned for him. He told Kissinger that he honestly didn't think he could run yet. ""I haven't given any deep thought to foreign policy,"" Christie admitted. ""Don't worry about that,"" said Kissinger, according to Christie. ""We can work with you on that. Foreign policy is instinct, it's character, that's what foreign policy is."" The advice has started jumping off the page. At a Thursday forum with Republican governors in Aspen, Colo., Christie spoke with disgust about ""this strain of libertarianism"" from people ""not on the front line"" who were criticizing tactics in the war on terror. ""As a former prosecutor who was appointed by George W. Bush on Sept.10, 2001, I just want us to be very cautious,"" said Christie. ""What we as a country have to decide is: Do we have amnesia? Because I don't. I remember what we felt like on Sept. 12, 2001."" A moderator floated the name of one possible amnesiac, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, and Christie ran with it. ""I love all these esoteric debates we're gettin' into--these esoteric, intellectual debates. I want these people to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation. They won't, because that's a much tougher conversation."" In less time than it takes a magician to saw a woman in half, Christie had morphed into Rudy Giuliani. Kissinger's instincts were right: He's not just a good demagogue, he's in alignment with what the wise-man and donor classes want from their party. There's a certain indignity in writing about a presidential race three years before the party conventions. At some point a furloughed shipbuilder in Norfolk is going to get so tired of reading 2016 speculation instead of sequestration coverage that he'll embed an ice pick in a pundit's head, and the jury will let him off. But Christie's remark was about what the GOP elite wants now. The donor class wants to restore a GOP that cuts taxes at home, wins wars abroad, and (for the moment) allows more immigrants to provide cheap labor. They've been saying this for years. A while after the Kissinger meeting, Christie met with at least 50 and as many as 60 wealthy people, gathered together by Home Depot founder Ken Langone. (Politico's Mike Allen, at the time, said 50; Balz says 60.) David Koch was there, as was hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. The point of the meeting, according to Christie, was for Langone to tell him that ""everyone in this room will raise every dollar you need."" But what were their politics? Jones had donated to Obama in 2007--he'd co-sponsored a fundraiser with George Soros. Koch, bogeyman status aside, has said he supports legal gay marriage, decriminalized marijuana, and defense cuts. ""It's essential to be able to achieve spending reductions and maybe it's going to require some tax increases,"" he told Politico's Ken Vogel in 2012. Even Langone served on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's transition team. These guys aren't outliers. As Alec MacGillis points out in the New Republic, one of Christie's most passionate wealthy backers is Paul Singer. That name curdles in the mouths of anti-gay marriage activists: Singer has given more than $4 million to gay rights causes, and gets some credit for New York's 2012 marriage law. He also happens to consider the Obama administration dangerously weak on Israel, but he has company. Sheldon Adelson, who effectively set $100 million on fire with donations to 2012 GOP campaigns, is right-wing on Israel and labor unions and taxes and ... that's about it. ""I'm basically a social liberal,"" he told the Wall Street Journal last year. ""I'm pro-choice. I'm pro-the DREAM Act."" The resurgence of libertarianism in the GOP means different things to these donors--some of them are happy to see marijuana legalizers get their footing. By and large they want the party to get behind some form of immigration reform (Bob Perry, the old Swift Boat vets donor, was a believer). Rand Paul was aware of that when he rebranded himself as a possible reformer, saying enough to move the bill along with conservatives without actually endorsing their plan. Alas, the pure libertarians aren't compatible with the rest of their views. The donor class that wanted Christie, settled for Romney, and wants Christie again needs a candidate who'll slash at regulation in office and come off patriotic (and pro-Israel) enough to actually get into office. There's plenty of overlap with the conservative hawks who can feel the movement shifting away from them, but libertarians are more worried about the donors than the likes of Bill Kristol or Rep. Peter King. One example: Rand Paul's circle worries that Paul Singer may become enamored of the idea of a pro-gay marriage hawk and boost Liz Cheney's campaign for U.S. Senate. Every week there's another reminder that the GOP's libertarian wing hasn't truly overcome the Bush wing. Back in Aspen, Christie gave them more fresh evidence. ""President Obama has done nothing to change the policies of the Bush administration in the war on terrorism,"" he said. ""I mean practically nothing. You know why? Because they work."""

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/barack_obama_s_economic_speech_in_illinois_the_president_and_house_republicans.html	"We all get a little exhausted just before summer vacation. Proof of that in Washington is that President Obama and House Republicans head into the vacation period embracing the same tired theme: how bad Washington is. That's why President Obama traveled to Illinois and Missouri today to deliver speeches on the economy. The point of the excursion, White House aide Dan Pfeiffer told reporters in an email, is that the president thinks ""Washington has largely taken its eye off the ball when it comes to the economy."" President Obama told volunteers that he will concentrate on ""how we need to put behind us the distractions and the phony debate and nonsense that somehow passes for politics these days and get back to basics, refocus on what it is that everybody is talking about around the kitchen table, what people are talking about day to day with their families."" The president is using his fellow politicians down the street as a foil to bring attention to his more considered view. Meanwhile, House Republicans will be heading back to their districts with a binder labeled ""Fighting Washington for All Americans."" It is full of summer tactical advice about how they can connect with their constituents by railing against Washington. Apparently this is the Summer of Self-Hate: Washington politicians railing against Washington politicians. They're joining a national chorus. In a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 83 percent of voters disapprove of the job Congress is doing, an all-time high in the survey. President Obama's 45 percent job-approval rating is at its lowest level since two summers ago when the debt-ceiling fight bruised everyone involved. Almost 60 percent in the survey say they would vote to defeat and replace every single member of Congress if they could--another all-time high. By blaming Washington, politicians seek to anticipate public anger and channel it, but it may very well stoke the embers. Or it should, anyway. The finger-pointing from both quarters is a sign that the next round of budget fights will be just as small-minded and irritating as the last several. Partisan audiences probably won't mind though. They're happy to hear stories about the other team and since we're headed into a non-presidential election year, those partisan audiences are the most important ones to reach. Last weekend on Face the Nation, John Boehner put the House strategy in pithy form. Judge us not by what bills we pass, the Republican speaker of the House said, but by what we undo. As Roll Call reports, that's the message at the heart of a set of instructions issued to House Republicans. A ""sample op-ed"" in the GOP binders, titled ""Fighting Washington for You,"" encourages members to write ""Washington is out of control."" House Republicans are encouraged to say things such as, ""Every day I serve in Congress, I work to fight Washington,"" and, according to Roll Call, the memo suggests the member use the op-ed to tout an event where attendees won't get ""another boring speech or more inside-the-beltway rhetoric."" Talking points are the bouillon cube of inside-the-beltway rhetoric, so when your talking points instruct you to boast about how you won't use inside-the-beltway rhetoric, you're ready for a nap and a wet washcloth. You have lost the theme. The president's economic speech Wednesday kicks off a series of at least six such events scheduled for the next couple of months. It is based on a wiggly logic. Aides say Washington has lost focus, but isn't part of the president's job to keep Washington politicians focused? Indeed, that's what the White House has been doing: staying focused. Just ask them. During the spring and early summer as various controversies erupted, White House aides said they were at their desk bearing down on the important work. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough told everyone to only spend 10 percent of their time on the outrage of the day and the rest of the time working on bigger issues. But when Pfeiffer says Washington doesn't have ""its eye on the ball"" he is really referring to Twitter chatter, cable news sparring, and the message of the day coming out of the partisan opposition. There hasn't been a lot of talk about the economy there. Fair point. But the failure to put in place an adult, reasonable set of fiscal policies is not the result of distracted Washington politicians and elites. That failure exists because the president and Republican leaders cannot find common ground. Since that is the case, there's not much hope the president's forays outside of Washington are going to help us all think afresh. The president has tried time and again to win over the chatter world with his economic argument. He's made it the focus of his State of the Union addresses, he's published glossy binders, he's cycled through slogans (""win the future,"" etc.). It was the central topic of the 2012 presidential campaign. A president's ability to rally the country to a complicated set of proposals is limited--and President Obama has proved it. Not much will come of these trips, other than the White House can say it tried. (A president can't simply do nothing.) But that doesn't mean all hope is lost. The president has been working with renewed vigor with congressional leaders. (Focused!) Chief of staff McDonough gets high marks from both parties for his outreach on issues from health care to the budget. The president and his staff are more in touch with members of Congress than ever, boasts one White House aide. The chances for a deal with open-minded Republican senators continues to flicker, and efforts to reform the tax code, which could be part of a bigger budget deal, have been proceeding in a very non-Washington fashion. Democratic Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and Republican House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp have been working together for three years on that project. The two will travel to Philadelphia next week to hold one of their periodic public data-collecting hearings. It is an example of the way Washington should work. As a result, you're not likely to hear about it again."	Breaking: Obama and House Republicans Still Hate Washington	['Obama']	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/john_boehner_wants_to_facilitate_the_house_speaker_s_modest_leadership_ambitions.html	"When John Boehner was sworn in as speaker of the House, he was handed an enormous gavel. But when he was recently describing his role as a legislative leader, it sounded like a shepherd's crook would be more useful. In an interview on Face the Nation on Sunday, Boehner said his job was not to dictate to Republican members what legislation they should support but merely to ""facilitate"" a process where they found their own outcome. He didn't dare offer an opinion about comprehensive immigration reform because it would interfere. ""It's not about me,"" the speaker told Bob Schieffer. ""It's not about what I want. What I've committed to, when I became speaker, was to a more open and fair process. And as difficult as this issue is, me taking a hard position for or against some of these issues will make it harder for us to get a bill ... If I come out and say, 'I'm for this' and 'I'm for that,' all I'm doing is making my job harder."" It's a shame that Barack Obama and John Boehner don't talk much, because they'd have a lot to commiserate over. Though the two men have very different jobs, responsibilities, and powers, they both face the same challenge: how to assert their will in an office circumscribed by the Constitution and circumstance. They also each face frequent criticism--sometimes from each other--that they are weaklings, unable to wield the powers granted to them. In the end, both men face one of two evaluations: They either did the best they could with the blunt tools of office in a unique time of partisanship, or they fell short of greatness because they could not adapt and use the tools of the job to overcome the partisan conditions. Republicans snicker at the idea of Obama ""leading from behind,"" so it was surprising to hear Boehner give such a rousing defense of the practice. The term was used by an Obama aide in a New Yorker profile to describe his approach for intervening in Libya. When used by the president's critics, it is meant to show just how clueless the president is about leadership. Leaders always lead from the front, so the critique goes. That is the essence of the word. The notion of ""leading from behind"" is as silly as saying ""batting from the clubhouse."" But that's wrong. Leading from behind is simply a different style of leadership. If done well, it can be a sign of intelligence and adaptation, and it can be far more effective in achieving an objective than the action-hero vision of leadership we all enjoyed during King Henry V's speech at Agincourt. So the question shouldn't be whether a leader is correct in trying to achieve his objective this way, but whether he's applying this method at the right moment. In the presidency, the most talked about version of this approach is Dwight Eisenhower's ""hidden hand,"" but all the great presidents knew how to play behind the scenes. LBJ, most recently put forward as the patron saint of robust leadership, nevertheless knew when to confine himself to the background. As Robert Caro writes in The Passage of Power, after he wooed Sen. Harry Byrd on a tax bill, he gave him instructions on how to make the Virginian look better in public at LBJ's own expense: ""Now you can tell your friends that you forced the President of the United States to reduce the budget before you let him have his tax cut.""* Leading from behind is also a useful strategy when you have no others. Boehner has few options in the House. If he pushes conservatives too hard to a specific outcome, they will not go. Ultimately, a House speaker's strength comes from the size and unity of his majority. Boehner's majority is not unified. He's not the first speaker to face this problem. As Molly Ball points out in the Atlantic, Speaker Tip O'Neill was equally constrained by Democratic conservatives in his caucus who wanted to vote with President Reagan. O'Neill had to stomach a lot of votes with which he personally disagreed. But he played a long game, waiting for Reagan to overplay his hand so that he could win new members in the 1982 election that expanded his liberal coalition. When that came to pass, O'Neill could orchestrate a far more left-leaning budget in 1983. Speakers have found ways to force unity, but Boehner has fewer tools than his predecessors. He still retains the office's big powers--the ability to dictate what legislation makes it to the floor and committee assignments--but he has fewer day-to-day tricks to get the job done. When Sam Rayburn was speaker, he kept the legislation coming up for a vote secret to keep as many members in the dark as possible; their ignorance helped him push through bills. Previous speakers could also make it easier or harder for members to bring pork home to their districts. Earmarks are essentially gone now, which means Boehner and his team have far fewer inducements to woo members to his side. The hardcore conservatives who give Boehner heartburn are also not rewarded by their constituents for bringing home goodies. Committee assignments don't mean as much as they once did because members can build their own brand and power base in the media. Members are highly suspicious now of the back-room deal, so the speaker has to appear more hands off than ever. That's why Boehner talks so much about letting the House ""work its will."" This serves two purposes. It allows members time to have their say, which makes them feel good and allows them to show their constituents how hard they are fighting for them. It also allows constituencies to get to them and make their case directly. So while talk radio hosts are railing against amnesty in the comprehensive immigration bill, local farmers, faith leaders, and high-tech CEOs can perhaps help these members get to yes. If in the end if comprehensive immigration skeptics fall in line, they don't feel like they've been jammed into it. They also aren't likely to be accused of being railroaded by a rigged process if they can show their constituents that the game was played fairly. This was something Rayburn understood as he tried to balance a split between Southern and Northern factions of his party. ""You cannot be a leader, and ask other people to follow you, unless you know how to follow, too,"" said Rayburn. So far, momentum has been useless when it comes to passing immigration reform. The initial burst of momentum gained by the GOP's postelection panic over losing Hispanic voters has not changed the minds of enough conservatives. Senate passage of a comprehensive bill did not change minds in the House either. If Boehner permits a free-flowing process that moves the House in the direction he wants, that creates actual useful momentum for him. What does he want? His biggest goal is an outcome that allows him to put the immigration issue behind him. Boehner's constraints are self-imposed. He could make a deal with Democrats to pass immigration reform, and he has done that before on the fiscal cliff deal, the Violence Against Women Act, and Hurricane Sandy relief funding. But those issues were not as volatile in Republican ranks as immigration and did not risk a conservative crack-up. If he cut a deal, would he lose his speakership? There would have to be a viable alternative candidate who wanted to herd the cats. But even if he retained the job, that kind of crack-up would make passing bills, which will require cajoling the same conservatives, that much harder. There has been a lot of speculation on whether Boehner will stick to the so-called Hastert Rule, allowing no bill to come to the floor unless it can pass with a majority of the majority. He has said he will not break this promise. That may be his heart's true desire, but we can't really know right now. Boehner understands that the more Democrats think he needs them for passage of a comprehensive bill, the more they'll demand from him. So even if Boehner were planning on passing immigration reform with a minority of his party, he will maintain his firm stance on the Hastert Rule until the very last minute. In the end, the question is not whether John Boehner is a leader. He is--he's just a leader with modest ambitions. In the study of House speakers, the debate splits along lines familiar to presidential observers. Presidents are either ""at liberty ... to be as big a man as he can,"" as Woodrow Wilson wrote when he was a Princeton political science professor. Or presidents are circumscribed by the political conditions they face, as Wilson discovered when he actually had the job. In congressional studies, the split is over whether a speaker is merely an agent carrying out the will of his conference or whether a powerful speaker can make his own weather. Newt Gingrich is the most recent example of the latter category, a risk-taker with vast ambitions for his party and himself. These kinds of leaders, argues political scientist Randall Strahan in Leading Representatives, are the ones we remember because they assert themselves at precisely the moment we face now: when the party is divided and can be turned in one direction or another by active leadership. Gingrich came into office with specific policy goals and drove the institution toward them. He wanted to change the House to make it more effective for him. Gingrich achieved a great deal but ultimately was undone by fellow Republicans. Boehner is far less ambitious. He wants to change the House simply to make it a more effective vehicle for conservative policies. That may help him achieve various goals along the way, but he is not moving the institution toward a fixed star that guides him.

He appealed to that same sense of hope again Friday in the White House briefing room. After a week of emotional reactions to the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial, President Obama made a bet that he could contribute something useful in the aftermath, and that despite all of the partisanship of the last five years and America's tragic history with the issue of race, there would be some portion of the audience that would actually listen to what he said. If it was a renewal of his original promise, it was also fulfillment of it for many. No other president could give that talk. Obama spoke as a president, an African-American, and as a former law professor. The task he set for himself, according to sources close to him, was to be a bridge builder: explaining the hurt and anguish so many African-Americans feel in the wake of the verdict to those who don't understand it or who might misunderstand it. He had been following the reactions in the press since the verdict and talking to his family and friends. He thought he would be asked about it during interviews earlier in the week. When he wasn't, he told his staff yesterday that he wanted to speak out to put that anguish (and the protests and marches it has inspired) in context. Context. The president used the word four times. It's one of Obama's favorite themes, along with balance. He was sounding both themes in a statement that was at once informal but carefully constructed. The former teacher of law said that the jury verdict should be honored; he took pains not to appear to be interfering with the jury's judgment. But the first African-American president also knew he wanted to speak to the unresolved wound with authority. President Obama the African-American returned to the themes of his first book, Dreams From My Father, talking at length about what it was like to be a black man in America. ""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."" (He too had smoked pot and made mischief as a kid.) He said he knew what it was like to have people lock their car door when you came near or what it was like to be followed by security in a department store. He spoke as a witness for African-Americans, describing the ""sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different."" In an attempt to keep the message balanced, he also testified to the truth that African-American men are disproportionately linked to the criminal justice system and also ""somebody like Trayvon Martin was probably, statistically, more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else.""  As he called for ""soul-searching"" from all of us, he told African Americans that they needed to deal with the violence in their own communities. President Obama the University of Chicago Law School lecturer turned questions inside out. Would the ""stand your ground"" law in Florida have allowed Trayvon Martin to stand his ground in the encounter? He spoke in the carefully calibrated language of the classroom, saying ""if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws."" Finally, Barack Obama the president tried to offer some solutions. He was wary of a national ""conversation"" on race, but he made some halting suggestions. State and local governments should examine what they could do to reduce mistrust in the system. He asked citizens for their help, too, asking everyone to ask themselves: ""Am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?  Am I judging people as much as I can based on not the color of their skin, but the content of their character? That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy."" The moment was carefully orchestrated, which is also signature Obama. The Friday afternoon surprise appearance put this weekend's marches in context, but it also downplayed the pomp of the moment. This was not a Presidential Speech on Race. The president was not trying to lecture anyone. He was trying to explain, maybe even nudge. Everything--his words, the forum, his manner--were designed to take the air out of the supercharged moment. For a president whose leadership and powers are constantly questioned, he was doing what he had come to office promising to do: help one part of America relate to another part of America."

""I'm a lifelong conservative, and I can tell the real thing when I see it,"" announced Dick Cheney. ""I have looked at the records of both candidates in the race, and it is clear to me that Trey Grayson is right on the issues that matter--both on fiscal responsibility and on national security."" Paul's campaign was half-unsurprised, half-amused. They'd seen this coming a week before, when former Cheney policy adviser Cesar Conda emailed some fellow neoconservatives and asked them to ""help us get the word out about Rand Paul's troubling and dangerous views on foreign policy.""* Fun on its own, but by weighing in personally, Cheney had confirmed a white-knuckle panic among their least favorite Republicans. The Louisville Courier-Journal ran a cartoon about the news, in which two Kentuckians learned that Cheney (represented by Darth Vader) had endorsed Paul's opponent. ""On purpose?"" asked one of the cartoon characters. That joke rocketed around the inboxes of Paul campaigners. They kept on laughing, as Paul rose from a 15-point lead before the Cheney announcement to a 23-point ""Randslide"" on primary night. Their hard-won confidence explains why Sen. Paul came out so early against Liz Cheney's candidacy in Wyoming, nearly a week before she actually announced it. ""I don't know much about her or her politics, really,"" he said--a totally unbelievable statement that could only be read as dismissive. That reading was rewarded yesterday, as Paul claimed that when he ""heard Liz Cheney was running for Senate I wondered if she was running in her home state of Virginia."" Reporters looking for a feud between the Cheneys and her new foe Sen. Mike Enzi have come up a little short. Enzi's not enjoying the challenge, but he's known the Cheneys for decades and he's gone fly-fishing with the paterfamilias. The real ""feud"" is between the ascendant America-first Republicans represented by Paul, and the conservative hawks who've lost their leading role in the party. It's not that the neoconservatives have disappeared, exactly. Conda, who tried to organize that late anti-Paul surge in 2010, is now chief of staff to Sen. Marco Rubio. (He chose not to comment for this story.) Jamie Fly, who co-founded the hawkish Foreign Policy Initiative with Bill Kristol--right around the time Kristol founded ""Keep America Safe"" with Liz Cheney--is now Rubio's counseler on foreign policy. But Rubio's star has faded this year, and he regularly polls behind Paul in 2016 ballot tests for a Republican primary. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, the most reliable hawks in the Senate, cause burning sensations for conservatives on ... basically everything else. Liz Cheney doesn't have those problems. Like Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, a freshman who's been nudged to run for the U.S. Senate by Kristol and others, Cheney's seen by neoconservatives as a possible star. ""She's so good at articulating her views on policy,"" says Debra Burlingame, the sister of a pilot whose plane was hijacked on 9/11 and a co-founder of Keep America Safe with the now-candidate. ""I think she'll help shore up support for what she believes and bring people back into the Republican Party, because we're hungering for leadership. We can't retreat from the world."" And would she stave off the intellectual challenge from Paul? ""I don't think that will be a serious factor. How many Rand Paul types are out there?"" Quite a few, actually. Wyoming wasn't one of Ron Paul's strongest states in the Republican primaries, but Paul did pull one-fifth of the vote and six delegates out of the March 2012 caucus. The Pauls personify a kind of libertarian ""America first"" foreign policy, but it thrives in the mountain West even when they're not around. Rand Paul's filibuster against the theoretical drone-killing of Americans at cafes was a hit with Republicans everywhere. As Reason's Mike Riggs first noticed, one of the Republicans who praised Paul the loudest was Sen. Mike Enzi. ""It's an issue that I and many of my constituents in the State of Wyoming find very troubling,"" said Enzi. ""In fact, as I traveled around Wyoming several weeks ago, it became abundantly clear that people are very concerned over this administration's disregard for constitutionally guaranteed individual rights."" That's not the Wyoming that voted for Dick Cheney so many times. Back in 2011, in a joint television appearance (Liz helped her father with his memoirs), the Cheneys praised the killing of American-born Anwar al-Awlaki as a ""very good strike,"" and asked when President Obama would ""go back and correct"" his prior heresies about Cheney-ism. He won't, of course, and neither will Paul. In his first book, The Tea Party Goes to Washington, Paul relishes in how he humiliated the neoconservatives who came after him. ""In a sense, Cheney's aide was right,"" writes Paul, referring to that gather-your-armies email from Cesar Conda. ""My measured and conservative views on foreign policy, rooted in the Founding and informed by the Constitution, are indeed dangerous to neoconservative ideologues who are always anxious to find new excuses to get us involved in conflicts abroad."" Paul isn't leading with that attack now. He's just making fun of Cheney for moving to the state with the easiest route to power. Cheney isn't leading with foreign policy, either--her opening attack on Enzi, predictably, is that the 69-year old senator is too senile to remember where he put his pants. Keep America Safe's Web presence actually ended a couple of weeks ago, though Burlingame says that's because ""we succeeded in accomplishing what we wanted to accomplish."" Clearly, Cheney herself has to accomplish much more. It starts with finding a way to end the GOP's lurch away from what she believes. Correction, July 18, 2013: David Weigel misstated Cesar Conda's former title. He was an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, not chief of staff. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/harry_reid_s_filibuster_reform_why_it_might_succeed.html	"Anyone who's been living in Washington for a while assumes he or she knows how the periodic fight over the filibuster ends. The majority party issues a threat of a nuclear option. The minority party threatens to respond by ""blowing up the Senate."" (Notice a theme to these metaphors?) Then, like the wisecracking partner who was left for dead in the second act of the movie, a senator unexpectedly rides in and announces a deal that ends the crisis--while leaving the filibuster exactly the same. The inevitability of the failure of reform is probably why Majority Leader Harry Reid has spent the past 72 hours trying to convince everyone that the filibuster will really, truly be changed when the Senate considers it Tuesday. Reid and other Democrats are pushing for a rule change that would bar the filibuster for most presidential nominees, though leave it intact for legislation and judicial nominations. On Monday morning Reid arrived at the small 10th-floor event space of the Center for American Progress to give a speech about the need to change Senate rules, and to snarl at reporters who doubted he'd really do that. Questioners took their turns, attempting to get Reid to float a compromise or to at least admit that he used to defend the filibuster. He once called it ""part of the fabric of this institution,"" and ""an integral part of our country's 217 years of history,"" and now he was saying that ""the Founding Fathers wanted an up-or-down vote, and that's basically what we've been crying for years."" ABC News' Jeff Zeleny politely asked him to explain the hypocrisy. ""What it is, is that you don't understand the right question,"" said Reid. ""I wasn't talking about changing the rules for nominees. I was talking about changing the rules for judges."" That distinction can get lost, but it's important, and it explains why Democrats are seemingly so ready to change the rules. The great filibuster standoff of 2005, the last one to occur with Republicans in control of the Senate, was sparked by years of failed cloture votes on George W. Bush's judicial nominees. The stakes of judicial battles are obviously high, because the winners get to don dark robes for the rest of their lives. John Roberts was nominated for a slot on the D.C. Circuit in 2001. He finally got confirmed in 2003. Two years later he was the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and he'll be alternately vexing or surprising liberals for a few more decades. Reid, for now, is only concerned with making it easier to confirm non-lifetime appointees to the executive branch. He counts seven jobs in limbo, including the top roles at the EPA, Department of Labor, and (somewhat prematurely) the Department of Homeland Security. The four stuck jobs that Democrats care about the most are the directorship of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and three Democratic seats on the National Labor Relations Board. It's the NLRB holdup that's giving Democrats their new urgency, and Reid his new pique. Since the start of the Obama administration, Republicans have prevented votes on Obama's Democratic nominees for the board, even as he's offering to keep the traditional two minority-party nominees for balance. Obama responded by recess-appointing the board members. In January the D.C. Circuit ruled that Obama's appointees were invalid, as the House of Representatives hadn't consented to the recess. (Since early 2011 John Boehner has kept the House in pro forma sessions instead of recess, in order to create exactly this kind of impediment for the White House.) In the past plenty of liberal groups have fretted about filibustered bills and nominees. None of them has had the personal investment that the labor movement now has in a Democratic-majority NLRB. The court decision that invalidated the current board has been used by a series of employers to ignore the NLRB's decisions. And when the terms of these current members finally end next month, the machine shudders to a halt. That's not acceptable to labor, which already watched a filibuster grind away its top Obama-era priority, the Employee Free Choice Act. When Reid pondered filibuster reform in January before settling for the usual do-nothing deal, labor didn't even get a single NLRB board member confirmed as part of the compromise. ""What is Barack Obama supposed to do?"" Reid sputtered at CAP. ""The NLRB goes out of business on Aug. 1. It's gone, it's over with. And they're using--oh, I've heard it, oh, you're doing this illegally. It's only happened because of them!"" That's the message labor wants to hear from Reid. One of the most frequent head-nodders at the CAP speech, a labor strategist, told me that he'd ""never seen Reid angrier about this"" and clarified that the unions would prefer a ""nuclear"" solution to another deal. Labor doesn't really fear the fallout, either. Would Republicans eventually get revenge in 2015 or 2017 by ending the 60-vote threshold on any legislation? Big deal. Had Republicans won control of the Senate in 2012, McConnell was ready to repeal the Affordable Care Act through the reconciliation process, with 51 votes. Would Republicans ""blow up the Senate"" if the rules were changed, forcing extended debate and verbatim daily readings of the record? Democrats and labor strategists are in a cynical mood about that. They expect Republicans to be blamed for any obstruction, because, well, have you seen their poll numbers? ""Any poll that you look at indicates that [the Senate is] unpopular for two reasons,"" said Reid. ""One: gridlock. Two: not getting things done."" A few hours after he wrapped up at CAP, Reid would head to the Old Senate Chamber for a bipartisan meeting about the nominee problem. At CAP he sounded superficially excited about this meeting. But he bristled when a reporter asked whether talks could stop him from holding the vote. ""Talks on what?"" said Reid. ""Talks on what? Talks on what? If they have a proposal, bring it to me, but otherwise we're going to have a vote tomorrow. If they have a proposal, bring it to me."" And asked whether some gang of senators could emerge to stop him, as happened in 2005 and this year, Reid shrugged. ""There've been gangs forming for a while,"" he said. ""We're where we are. My caucus supports where we are. I'm not concerned about gangs. That's a passe thing."""

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/trayvon_martin_and_the_justice_department_s_community_relations_service.html	"If last night you failed to watch the Fox News family of cable channels, you missed one hell of a scoop. Sean Hannity informed his audience of a story that was broken hours earlier by the legal watchdogs/gadflies (depending on your politics) at Judicial Watch. ""A little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS), was deployed to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting,"" reported Judicial Watch. Its mission: ""to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman."" Hannity was shocked. ""We learned today that [President Obama's] Justice Department got involved in this case through their own Community Relations Service,"" he told Pat Buchanan. ""What does that say about the administration? Should they have been involved?"" ""They should not,"" pronounced Buchanan. Over on the Fox Business Channel, another sage of interracial politics was fulminating about this ""little-known unit"" and its meddling. ""Instead of following their stated mission of preventing racial and ethnic tensions,"" said Lou Dobbs, ""they allegedly helped to organize anti-Zimmerman demonstrations. We have talked and reported to you a great deal on this broadcast about the politicization of the Justice Department, but I don't think anyone covering this story anticipated such a thing as what we have just reported to you."" How did Dobbs know that the Justice Department had betrayed its mission? Well, he didn't, and so far no one speculating about what the ""little-known unit"" did seems to possess much expertise about it. That's almost immaterial. We're one day out from jury deliberations in George Zimmerman's case, and there's considerable, reality-based worry that a ""not guilty"" verdict would spark violence in Sanford or Miami. That's inspired conservatives to look back at how this became a national story in the first place--an inquest that leads them to Eric Holder's doorstep. Let's fix the ""little-known"" problem first. The Community Relations Service was created 49 years ago, by the Civil Rights Act, at a time of steady conflict between the government and local law enforcement and white citizens groups. Its original mission was to swoop in and mediate when communities start roiling over ""actions, policies, and practices that are perceived to be based on race, ethnicity, or national origin."" This has only occasionally been controversial. The CRS's budget request for 2013 was only $12,036,000, and no politician from either party made hay about cutting it. And that request was made after this ""organizing anti-Zimmerman demonstrations"" story was broken in conservative media, mostly by Breitbart.com's Lee Stranahan and TheBlaze.com's Erica Ritz. On April 17, 2012, Ritz reported that ""a little-known"" (that phrase again!) Justice Department outlet ""has apparently been helping protesters angry over the Trayvon Martin shooting."" Ritz's revelation came after reading the Orlando Sentinel, which during that churn of daily Martin stories had profiled the ""league of secretive peacemakers"" working in Sanford and Miami. ""In their Navy blue windbreakers, polo shirts and dark sunglasses, they look like federal agents,"" reported Arelis Hernandez. The agents, according to local civil rights leaders, ""helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of [Sanford] police Chief Bill Lee."" In the Sentinel, this was a human interest story; online, it looked like a smoking gun. How could one branch of the Justice Department be investigating the case while another branch was shuttling activists to rallies? ""Is the DOJ's presence, seemingly in a supportive role of the protesters, working to undercut the very mission of the organization?"" asked Ritz. The question answered itself. But the timeline, now revealed by Judicial Watch, actually complicated the matter. Trayvon Martin was killed on Feb. 26, 2012. The Stanford police (i.e., Bill Lee) handed the case over to the state on March 12. That was when the media frenzy started to build. On March 23 and 24, students at 34 Miami schools walked out of class to protest Zimmerman's non-arrest. The Judicial Watch documents have the CRS workers on the scene after this, starting on March 25. ""The walkout was what put it on the radar,"" says Amy Carswell, the program officer of the Miami-Dade County Community Relations Board. Her board, which you could call ""little-known,"" is a 30-member bureaucracy designed to alert the city to developments in the racially diverse county. Carswell's been embroiled in the new story because--after the glowing Sentinel write-up--she emailed CRS regional director Thomas Battles to thank him for ""outstanding and ongoing efforts to reduce tensions and build bridges of understanding and respect."" According to Carswell, board members had known Battles for 20 years, and this round of mediation was mostly notable for the media attention it drew. ""Zimmerman was never really the focus,"" she says. ""We try to keep away from vilification, any of that stuff."" But on the right, it's becoming conventional wisdom that the Justice Department worked to bring down Zimmerman. ""Eric Holder's Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies,"" writes Stranahan. ""Why are we taxpayers paying for a goofy mediation service within the Department of Justice?"" asks John Hinderaker, a lawyer and writer for PowerLine, named Time's 2004 ""blog of the year"" for its coverage of the story that destroyed Dan Rather. Right now the most dedicated critic in what Stranahan calls ""Trayvongate"" is J. Christian Adams. In 2005 Adams was hired by the Bush administration's Department of Justice. In 2008 Adams built the DOJ's case against the very black supremacist, very fringe New Black Panther Party, after two of its members had skulked outside a polling place brandishing nightsticks. (One signal of their strategic intelligence: The polling place they chose was overwhelmingly black and Democratic.) When the Obama administration didn't pursue the case, Adams quit and started writing and speaking about the racial ""politicization"" of Eric Holder's Justice Department. ""One might ponder why the Justice Department Civil Rights Division rushed to Florida in the first place and took sides once the racial furnace was sufficiently stoked,"" Adams wrote last month, before the Judicial Watch release. ""When Eric Holder's old pal from D.C. (and a Philadelphia court case), New Black Panther chieftain Malik Zulu Shabazz, called for a 10,000 strong black-male mob to seize George Zimmerman, we knew what was in store."" A careful reader might notice something here. There was no ""10,000 strong black-male mob"" that seized George Zimmerman. At the time of the mediations, sure, the going theory in some conservative media was that the DOJ was stepping aside and letting people fly their freak flags. ""Maybe what happened here was that somebody came down hard on them,"" Glenn Beck told listeners in April 2012, after he noticed the New Black Panthers and Al Sharpton toning down their rhetoric. ""It certainly wasn't the Justice Department, because where was Eric Holder yesterday? Eric Holder was at a fundraiser for Al Sharpton."" Oops. The DOJ did mediate; the result was peaceful rallies, after which a police chief resigned and Zimmerman was charged. The argument on the right now is that even this mediation tipped the scales. ""The CRS's participation in these meetings appears to be intimidating,"" says Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. ""You got these guys in dark glasses and hats in the back of rooms, I just don't see that as neutral advocacy. It seems they were focusing the anger of the activists who wanted the prosecution of Zimmerman, and making sure those activists were talking to the right people. If they were impartial, why weren't they talking to Zimmerman's family?"" That's almost an existential question. If you think the government should materialize when some racial controversy starts boiling, you have no problem with the CRS. But if you think Obama and Holder are habitual race-baiters, the CRS's Sanford adventure fits into a pattern. Instead of nailing the New Black Panthers, Obama's saying, ""If I had a son, he'd  look like Trayvon,"" and Holder's calling America ""a nation of cowards on race."" That's why they went after Zimmerman. That's why you can't trust the Obama regime. ""I think stoking the racial stuff is the way Obama was raised,"" Rush Limbaugh told his listeners this week, after telling them about the CRS documents. ""He was raised to believe this country was founded unjustly and immorally and slavery this and slavery that. This country, he's got a chip on his shoulder about it, and he's here to square the deal. And Holder, too."""	The Right's Newest Wild Trayvon Martin Race-Baiting Theory	['Rush', 'Adams', 'Buchanan', 'Sanford', 'Black', 'Obama']	[]
14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/republican_party_divided_on_immigration_reform_will_the_senate_proposal.html	"On Tuesday, William Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard and Rich Lowry, the editor of the National Review, wrote a rare joint editorial denouncing the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform plan. They said it was full of loopholes and exceptions that would do nothing to end illegal immigration. Republican Senators had signed on to the bill fueled by a ""panic"" about attracting Hispanic voters. House Republicans, they argued, should not only refuse to vote on the Senate bill, they should refuse to join a conference committee where their version could be melded with the impure Senate's product. Republicans should shelve immigration reform until after the 2014 election, they argued. What's the rush? There used to be a simple answer: existential dread. After the 2012 elections, Republicans had to get right with Hispanic voters or face another loss as the country's demographics shifted away from the GOP's base of older, white voters. Immigration reform was the only solution. This view was so roundly accepted that the Republican National Committee endorsed it in the party autopsy commissioned after the election: The GOP ""must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only."" Since that time, the political theory has faced two sustained assaults. The first, argued by Rush Limbaugh and others, is that Hispanic voters will not suddenly find Republicans attractive after immigration reform passes. As a voting bloc, they are temperamentally in line with the Democratic Party. The second blow to the political case was the argument, put forward by Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics, Byron York, and others, that Hispanics aren't the key voting bloc for the GOP's future hopes of creating a winning presidential coalition. The GOP can also make a path to the presidency by courting lower-income white voters. Kristol and Lowrey added a third reason to slow the political stampede: If Republicans wait, they might take control of the Senate in 2014, which would allow them to pass a more conservative version of immigration reform in 2015. With the political arguments weakened, the slapdash construction of the Senate bill is harder for its proponents to defend. But Hispanics were not the only constituency Republican immigration proponents were trying to reach. When I interviewed Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, a member of the Gang of Eight, last April, he said comprehensive immigration reform would also appeal to moderate voters who watched Republicans debating immigration and came away with a sour view. ""When people see a party that is not rational, they're not going to go with that party,"" he said. Republicans don't always look good when debating immigration reform. They get emotional, judge each other's motives, and generally provide Democrats with opportunities to point fingers at them. Republicans on both sides of the issue point to the trouble the GOP has had talking about immigration in the past. Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado is blamed for years of immigrant bashing that made the party look intolerant. In the 2012 GOP primary, the unresolved immigration issue caused a rolling fracas between Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. When Romney came out for ""self-deportation,"" many in the party believe it defined Romney and the GOP as cold and unwelcoming. This public squabbling not only looks unseemly, it also blocks Republicans from spending time talking about a positive agenda for the future that appeals to a wider range of voters. This level of public acrimony hasn't defined this debate so far, say Lowrey and Kristol. ""During the debate over immigration in 2006-07, Republican rhetoric at times had a flavor that communicated a hostility to immigrants as such. That was a mistake, and it did political damage. This time has been different. The case against the bill has been as responsible as it has been damning."" It's true that the debate has been relatively benign (with the exception of Alaskan Rep. Don Young who referred to Latino farm workers as ""wetbacks"" and had to apologize twice), but that's not a condition that is guaranteed to continue. The risk that an unresolved immigration debate will define the party in the next few years is the pro-reform crowd's answer to Lowrey and Kristol's question of ""why now?"" The public debate over immigration reform has the potential to erupt into a self-inflicted wound again because it touches on the most sensitive issues of racism, tolerance, morality, and adherence to the rule of law. Both sides have been trying to appeal to the other in order to build a coalition for a final piece of legislation, so the rhetoric has been somewhat tempered. But each side thinks the stakes are enormous. On Meet the Press two weeks ago, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Republicans were in a ""demographic death spiral as a party and the only way we can get back in good graces with the Hispanic community, in my view, is to pass comprehensive immigration reform."" The next week, Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho made the opposite case. If Republicans support the Senate bill that Sen. Graham is promoting, ""politically it's going to be the death of the Republican Party."" Whatever happens, someone is going to need bereavement therapy. All this talk of death may be hyperbole, but a voter not involved in the clubhouse spat might wonder why one side or the other is committing suicide. Whatever this voter decides, the rhetoric from Republicans leaves him or her with the view that half of the party is not simply wrong, but insane. Waiting for 2015 also means Republicans will have to live with the collapse of immigration reform for the next year or so. Perhaps voters will applaud that Republicans didn't rush a bill that was bad policy. But given Congress' approval ratings and willing Republicans ready to point fingers, it's also just as possible that the independent voter might conclude that the GOP cannot apply reason to the problems of the day to find a workable solution. Voters unsure of where to place the blame will have trusted sources like the Wall Street Journal helping them. When senators appeared ready to block the effort in that body on the grounds it did not secure the border, the Journal's editorial page questioned the motives of senators on the ""restrictionist right,"" arguing that their concerns about security were a fig leaf for their basic disinterest in granting citizenship to undocumented workers. ""The real game here is to kill a bill that would create a more pro-growth and humane immigration system for America and the millions already here or in line to come. If the right succeeds in blowing all this up, one wonders what comes next? Perhaps Republicans can campaign in 2014 on self-deporting the 11 million illegals who are here now. That worked so well for Mitt Romney."" If House Republicans follow Lowry and Kristol's advice, that kind of tone and language is likely to become more common."

Suggestion No. 1: Go fishing for more IRS scandals. ""Invite local 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 group leaders to your district office to hear stories of how they could have been targeted by the IRS,"" advised party leaders. ""Hold a press conference."" The none-too-subtle message was that the furor over the IRS's nosy letters to political groups--mostly conservative groups--was not phony. Republicans would pursue any lead of any kind, anywhere. And yesterday, they claimed to have found another lead at the offices of the Federal Election Commission. The House's own investigations had turned up emails from FEC staffers to the IRS's tax exemption division--run by Lois Lerner, the Darth Vader of the scandal--asking for current exemption info on 501(c)3s called the American Future Fund and the American Principles Project. In an interview with CNN, outgoing Republican FEC Commissioner Donald McGahn called this ""probably out of the ordinary."" Darrell Issa heard his cue. The chairman of the House oversight committee sent a letter to FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub--a Democratic appointee--wondering whether the FEC-IRS emails might ""indicate some coordination."" Based on that, the FEC had two weeks to scour and copy its records for ""all documents and communications between or among any FEC official or employee and any IRS official or employee for the period January 1, 2008 to the present."" Issa was going fishing, but fishing for what? The allegation here is that the FEC's counsel might have asked not just for the tax-exempt status of a group--that's public information--but for something private. The IRS then might have responded with private information, though the emails released thus far don't indicate that. Weintraub has said she's ""not aware of requesting or receiving any confidential taxpayer information,"" and while flank-covering statements from public officials don't have a 100 percent record of accuracy, Weintraub has also requested that the FEC's inspector general conduct an ""impartial, independent review"" of the scandal charge. She announced this a day before the Issa letter; for some reason, Issa's play got more media attention. This level of scrutiny, with this much evidence, is a puzzle to some former FEC commissioners. ""From what I've seen so far this doesn't look like anything,"" said Larry Noble, a Democratic appointee until 2000 who now advocates for public funding of elections. ""It looked like what happened was that the staff contacted the IRS and asked for what was public. When I was there, certainly, it was always clear that the IRS would not give out anything that was not public. The IRS has a list of c3 groups, but it's often out of date, so people check with the source. This looked like a routine inquiry for public information."" Bradley Smith, a Republican FEC commissioner from 2000 to 2005, was nearly as skeptical as Noble. ""I don't think these emails are damning in any great way,"" he said, ""but they do raise a question. That's whether the staff at the FEC can be legally, lawfully making these kinds of inquiries without commission approval. Leaving that aside, I don't think anything that's emerged so far is damning as regards the larger IRS scandal."" Whether the staff is allowed to answer requests from other agencies--that's a much smaller question. Unless you're a real FEC wonk, you might wonder what makes this fishy at all. The answer is in the FEC's current rules, and in a push by Republicans (like McGahn) who want to tighten them. The rules are already tighter than campaign finance reformers would like them to be. To conduct an investigation, technically, a majority of FEC commissioners, split equally between Republicans and Democrats, have to agree that there's a ""reason to believe"" (RTB) it's worth doing. Republicans have fought to enforce that and prevent more independent staff investigations. ""Congress did not intend for the Commission to conduct an investigation before finding RTB,"" wrote McGahn in a July memo, before a meeting to discuss possible rule changes. The rules weren't changed, but the same day McGahn published that memo, he published two enforcement actions chiding recent investigations into Rick Santorum's presidential campaign and into a 501(c)4 called the American Issues Project. The AIP investigation had started during the 2008 campaign--AIP's most famous for the 11th-hour ads it ran reminding voters about Jeremiah Wright's ties to Barack Obama--and dragged on. After the Citizens United decision invalidated the original complaint, the FEC took another tack, looking at whether AIP's political spending during the election was above and beyond that of a ""social welfare"" group expected to spend some money on ""education."" In his judgment, McGahn accused his peers of ""manipulating the timeline to reach the conclusion that AIP is a political committee."" If you're a campaign finance reformer on the left, this reads as surreal. It's an open secret that 501s skirt the ""education"" requirement, and keep their tax status, by classifying some of their ads as educational. If you're a conservative, it reads as classic ""conservative targeting"" and harassment, enabled by the decision to study the calendar-year spending instead of spending through the election cycle. That's how Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel covered the ""fishy"" story on Aug. 1, reporting that ""the FEC staff, as part of an extraordinary campaign to bring down AIP and other 501(c)(4) groups, reache[d] out to Lois Lerner, the woman overseeing IRS targeting,"" acting on the Obama campaign's ""vendetta against a political opponent."" Three days later, the paper editorialized that the FEC ""used their enforcement power as an anti-conservative sword."" This is how a fairly complicated story of bent rules, deadlocked regulators, and enforcement memos became a very simple scandal. Lois Lerner worked for the FEC counsel's office; Lerner then went to the IRS's tax exemption office. Until proven otherwise, it can be assumed--as National Review assumed--that Lerner disobeyed ""Rule 6103, which prohibits the IRS from sharing confidential taxpayer information."" As the tax policy journalist David Cay Johnson has pointed out, the info requested by the FEC in the exchange with Lerner was already supposed to be public. The scandal will burn anyway. Maybe a bowel-deep investigation of the FEC will find political collusion; likely, it won't. But it will find evidence that FEC staffers are running questions when Congress has told them not to. That elevates the internal dispute inside the FEC to a controversy that will outlast Donald McGahn. The drip-drip of stories about Congress investigating ""possible collusion"" are a win for Republicans, too. As Brendan Nyhan's been pointing out, most of the mainstream media's coverage of the IRS scandal happened in its first two weeks. ""Is the White House behind this?"" was an irresistible story; ""Nope, it wasn't"" is a very resistible story. But while everybody moves on, you can put a lot of fear into the bureaucrats."

During the George W. Bush administration, the public was regaled repeatedly with warnings that intelligence had determined, through an in-depth analysis of ""chatter"" and other such information, that al-Qaida was about to strike again. Thus in May 2004--a few months before the presidential election--Attorney General John Ashcroft, standing beside the grim-faced director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, announced that ""credible intelligence from multiple sources"" indicated that al-Qaida was planning an attack on the United States in the next few months and specifically intended to ""hit the United States hard."" He also pointed out ominously that the group had announced that it had completed ""90 percent of the arrangements"" for an attack. Two months later, Department of Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge relayed a similar warning. No terrorist disaster transpired or was attempted during the remainder of 2004. Of course, in the view of many, calamity did nonetheless ensue with the re-election in November of George W. Bush--partly the result, they darkly suspect, of the artful, if unfulfilled, scare-mongering earlier in the year. And the 2004 warnings were hardly unusual. A year earlier, John Negroponte, then the U.S. representative at the United Nations, declared there to be ""a high probability that within two years al-Qaida will attempt an attack using a nuclear or other weapon of mass destruction."" And in 2007 DHS Director Michael Chertoff disclosed that his gut was telling him there'd be an attack that summer. Later that year U.S. intelligence was reportedly concluding that al-Qaida was ""marshaling its reconstituted forces for a spectacular new attack on the United States."" There were also innumerable raisings of that color-coded threat indicator we all remember so fondly. Regrettably, the Obama administration has never subjected massive homeland security expenditures to the kind of sober and systematic evaluation they so richly deserve after a decade of drunken-sailor profligacy. And it has continued to find threatening proto-al-Qaidas popping up everywhere. However, it has reduced the official hysteria level. Only very occasionally have Obama's representatives characterized the extremely limited terrorist threat as ""existential."" The inflated phrase, ""Global War on Terrorism,"" has been consigned to well-deserved oblivion. And the administration has mostly eschewed generalized warnings of the Ashcroft-Ridge-Chertoff sort. Because the current warnings and embassy closings across the Muslim world are coming from a less fear-mongering administration, then, it is possible there is more to them than there was to the older ones, and that the perfect failure record of such warnings will be broken. But it must be said that the specifics--insofar as they exist--in these warnings don't look any more convincing than those of old. We are, as usual, told about ""chatter"" and about intercepts of vaguely-worded communications that fail to specify timing or targets. Although it can hardly be news to terrorists that their communications are constantly monitored by U.S. intelligence, the new revelations about the extent of the eavesdropping may have reminded them anew that they can easily push the U.S. into paroxysms of costly, self-punishing behavior just by communicating convincing information to their avid auditors about ominous, if idle, terror plans. And there is deja-vu in recent official comments that the ""chatter"" and streams of intelligence resemble those that preceded the 9/11 attacks. In 2007, reported warnings of an imminent ""spectacular"" terrorist attack included a senior official's observation that ""This is reminiscent of the warnings and intelligence we were getting in the summer of 2001."" And those raising the alarm have a decided advantage: They can never be proved wrong. As Dan Gardner points out in his superb book, Future Babble, if there is an attack, they can claim prescience. If there isn't, they can insist that their warnings and preparations prevented or deterred it while deftly classifying information that might determine whether that is true or not. The suspicion this time, obviously, is that the warning, with what seems to be its outsize focus on embassies spread in a wide arc across over a dozen countries, has been primarily, and irrationally, impelled by the Benghazi experience--a tragedy that exacted exceptional political costs to those in charge. However, experience questions whether such generalized warnings should be issued at all. If intelligence has uncovered specifics of target and time of attack, the sensible response, of course, is not to bloviate grandly, but to work to secure the likely target or targets or to use policing measure to disrupt the plot. But if, as it appears thus far in the present case, the warnings are vague and unspecific, issuing proclamations of danger out of an ""abundance of caution"" (as it has been put by the State Department) scarcely helps the situation. It is not clear what individuals are supposed to do except perhaps to look over their shoulders more often, and the proclamations often exact substantial costs in unnecessary anxiety, disruption, inconvenience, and lost economic opportunity. Nothing wrong, I suppose, in telling Americans that Yemen is not the safest travel destination. But few are likely to need the warning. At any rate, the record strongly suggests that warnings based on vague and unspecific intelligence have failed to stop or to protect against terrorist attacks. Conceivably, some attacks have been deterred by the proclamations, but, if so, one would expect truly dedicated terrorists, inconvenienced in their immediate planning, to move into action once the alarms have faded. But that, it seems, hasn't happened. The predictions noted in this article are detailed and sourced at http://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/PREDICT.PDF."	Since 9/11, no terror warning about al-Qaida has ever panned out. Why?	['Gardner', 'Obama']	[]
17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/the_republican_party_s_permanent_campaign_gop_lawmakers_must_always_be_guarding.html	If the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, then House Republicans might look potty. On Friday, the House voted for the 40th time to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Though each week presents new reasons to not like the bill--premiums up 40 percent in Ohio--the votes are as pointless as ever because the legislation isn't going anywhere. But this isn't as insane as it looks because the goal isn't repealing the legislation. The vote is entirely symbolic. The conservative base likes it and we are heading into a non-presidential-election year where the base is important. (Sen. Mike Lee is raising money from his effort to kill the bill.) But while House Republicans can pass bills that do nothing, they could not pass an appropriations bill, which is a basic requirement of being in charge of the place. House leaders had to pull the vote on an appropriations bill for transportation and housing at the last minute on Wednesday because they could not find the votes. The spending cuts were too deep for almost all Democrats and even some Republicans. Conservatives also voted against it for not cutting enough. Mix that opposition together and the effort went THUD, the appropriate shorthand used to refer to the bill (Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development). When you spend your time doing base maintenance and not basic maintenance, something has gotten out of whack. But it's all about maintaining your base more than ever in Washington these days, whether it's your ideological base or your fundraising base. The more time you spend raising money and fighting off primary challenges, the less time and inclination a lawmaker has for governing. Not coincidentally, Congress takes its mid-year break having passed the fewest laws in its history. Congressional approval has been so low for so long the store of metaphors describing how low it has fallen is bankrupt, too. The money story is a familiar one. Lawmakers may not be highly productive when it comes to creative solutions or passing bills, but they are productive when it comes to raising money. Politico did an analysis this week which showed that Senate incumbents running for re-election in 2014 are building up their war chests faster and larger than ever before. If you are raising that much money, you're not doing your day job. The hunt for money also infects your day job because you are more inclined to do what your money backers want. When you're stooped in a permanent grovel, it's hard to straighten up. It's not just the fundraising requirements that have moved candidates to election mode earlier. If you define yourself or your opponent early, you can make your job easier later. Or, you can scare them out of the race with a robust set of early attacks. That is how Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell scared actress/activist Ashley Judd from running. To be ready to pounce, you've got to start your next campaign the day you win your seat. Candidates can't relax. Republican Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming had only raised $1 million because he thought he was safe this cycle. Now he faces Liz Cheney, daughter of Vice President Dick Cheney, in a GOP primary. Cheney has a huge group of donors she can tap. (Many of them live in Virginia, where she was a longtime resident before moving to Wyoming to run for Senate.) But perhaps the more important takeaway from the Enzi race is that no one is safe on the Republican side. Sen. Enzi has a conservative voting record, but that's not enough. Conservatives want a pugilist for the cause, and they have picked Cheney. It's just one of the ways that the Senate is beginning to resemble the rough-and-tumble House. The fear of an electoral ejection has moved into the twitch muscles. Everyone must be on the lookout. The old cliche is that an incumbent either runs scared or runs unopposed, but now GOP candidates have to stay in a perpetual state of fear, even if they are unopposed. You might get a challenger any day, and the old barriers to entry don't stop the challenges. Politicians have always acted politically, but there were holidays. After elections you could vote your conscience, provided you had one. Or seniority and institutional structure allowed you to attend to long-term problems free from the push-button will of the people. Being in Senate leadership isn't enough for Mitch McConnell, for example. He now has a Tea Party challenger. Being the party leader in Washington doesn't mean what it used to when Washington is out of favor. Young bucks in the Senate who could help neutralize the Tea Party threat to McConnell are not stepping in to protect him. Sens. Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, and Ron Johnson all refused to say whether they were backing their leader against his challenger. In the old days they would have backed him to grease their ascent in the Senate. But they can do that on their own. They get their donations from the grassroots or conservative billionaires, so they're not beholden to K Street. They don't need McConnell's entree to the lobbyists club. McConnell probably won't get turned out of office--he's a fierce political warrior--but he's not going to take any risks either. He's certainly not going to work hard to extend his hand in a fit of bipartisanship; he's got to keep his base happy. Spread this phenomenon out across all Republicans and it's not a recipe for getting much done. Activist groups know this, which means if they can back a more conservative opponent, they can keep lawmakers in line. The illustrative tale is the behavior of Sens. Bob Bennett and Orrin Hatch of Utah. Bennett lost his seat, for among other things, working toward compromise with Democrats. Hatch once had that reputation, too, but faced with a possible challenge he moved fast and hard to the right. He is now such a sterling example of how to avoid a primary challenge, other senators use his campaign as a model. Speaker Boehner says he can pass the THUD bill when the House returns in the fall. He could do so by increasing the funding levels to make it more palatable to moderate Republicans and maybe some Democrats. That would anger the grassroots focused on reducing the size of government. They are wary that Boehner, who likes to cut spending but also needs to run the place, might capitulate. If the House speaker can't find a solution, this problem will face him on a host of appropriations bills, a debt limit agreement, and immigration--bills we might want to relabel KERPLUNK, SPLAT, and CRASH.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/the_gop_governing_dysfunction_republican_would_rather_wait_until_2012_than.html	"Early on Thursday afternoon, a few hours before the start of a monthlong summer recess, the U.S. Senate held a doomed vote on a $44 billion package of transportation and housing funds. The vote was 54-43, six short of cloture, most Republicans making sure that the bill with the accidentally perfect name of THUD (Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development) went down in flames for now. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, whose work on a gun control amendment this year gave him the temporary glow of a centrist, walked from the Senate to a special, open live-streamed meeting of the Republican Study Committee, all about the Obama administration's scandals. Anyone watching the Tea Party Patriots-sponsored feed could hear Toomey tell a colleague that ""we did something constructive today"" in the Senate. ""We denied cloture on the THUD bill,"" said Toomey. ""I told you we'd kill it, and we did."" This was only a day after the House of Representatives had pulled its version of THUD from the floor. All week congressmen had been slogging through amendments, on schedule, but late on Wednesday they punted, promising to take up the bill after the recess. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers thought otherwise. ""The prospects for passing this bill in September are bleak at best,"" he said in a statement, ""given the vote count on passage that was apparent this afternoon."" That put House Speaker John Boehner in the awkward but survivable position of facing reporters on Thursday and telling them that Rogers was wrong. ""I believe the votes would have been there for the THUD bill, but we had some 50 amendments to work through,"" said Boehner. At the moment they pulled the bill, they'd already dealt with 22 amendments. It was just too much, said the speaker, ""considering everything else we had this week."" Gazing in horror at the Republican House and pronouncing it ""dysfunctional"" is a favorite Washington hobby this year, and Republicans know it. They've played into it. Boehner often insists that the party controls ""one-half of one-third of the government,"" as if that renders it helpless, and as if the Supreme Court doesn't lean right. In a July 21 interview, Boehner sidestepped a question about how little was getting to the president's desk by insisting Congress ""ought to be judged on how many laws we repeal."" That was a smarter line than pundits gave him credit for. Boehner was translating a core tenet that most Republicans believe--that ""government is best which governs least."" (Many think Thomas Jefferson said this, when actually Henry David Thoreau did, but the point is that they believe it.) The real problem with the line was that Boehner hasn't really succeeded at repealing laws, either. Right now the House is incredibly good at passing ""message"" bills and amendments, and pretty terrible at passing spending bills that could get to conference with the Senate. Why? Three reasons. First, most House Republicans, and plenty of Senate Republicans, fundamentally mistrust the Democrats and think they'd use the conference to ram through spending bills (or immigration reform, or anything, really) they don't like. The House GOP's big idea on the debt ceiling this year was to force the Senate to pass a budget. It did. The House didn't take the rebound. ""We were so proud,"" moaned Sen. John McCain in an interview this week. ""We passed a budget resolution--most of it nonsense--but guess what? Now we have the same group [who demanded this] who are blocking going to conference. The same group sometimes doesn't want to take up a bill and at other times blocks a bill because they can't get all the amendments they want."" The second reason is that House Republicans are stuck in a vise between Democrats who want to beat them in 2014 and conservatives who want to ... well, in some cases, beat them in 2014. When the first version of the farm bill failed, it was for the same reason THUD was pulled. Democrats provided no cover (they neither whipped for or against, though some members organized the conference for the ""no"" side), and there weren't enough ""ayes"" from the conservative wing. As Brian Beutler pointed out yesterday, House Republicans have only really agreed on the numbers in Paul Ryan's budgets, which (if you remember the 2012 campaign) don't get into specifics about cuts. They don't ""say how to allocate the dollars, nor does it grapple in any way with the possibility that cutting domestic spending so profoundly might be unworkable."" When spending bills come up, they're going to contain details, and the details are going to lose people. The third reason has much more to do with optimism. House Republicans face a map designed by state legislators to re-elect them for years. They know the Senate can flip in 2014 if Republicans win three open seats in red states (South Dakota, Montana, West Virginia) and knock out three Democratic incumbents. So they can easily imagine a future in which they don't have to negotiate as much with Democrats, and when they can fill in the abstractions of the Ryan budget. The ""one more election will fix this"" theory dominated in 2012, and to a lesser extent in 2010--the believers are like blackjack players who hit on 20. What do they pass in the meantime? Well, today, they were supposed to be celebrating the successful conclusion of Stop Government Abuse Week, with new bills (doomed in the Senate) to punish venal IRS employees, prevent the enactment of Obamacare, and so on. ""We have a package of about 10 bills aimed directly at that very point,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on Fox News last Friday. ""The reason why we're really doing it is because you've seen now across the country a lot of waning, if you will, of the trust that people have in this government."" The result was the one development more ironic than ""THUD."" In order to fast-track the bills and protect them from deleterious Democratic amendments, Republicans needed more than 80 Democrats to join them for two-thirds supermajorities. Democrats in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee whipped against it, so Republicans changed the rule on bills that weren't actually generating many headlines anyway. They'll keep trying. Instructions for House Republicans heading home tell them to convene town halls or hold events that raise awareness of the IRS story. At his Thursday press conference, before he told reporters he was ""not the least bit concerned"" about the perception of a fumbling House, Boehner told reporters that he'd just met with House investigators digging into the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi. ""I stressed once again we need to get to the bottom of what happened that terrible night,"" said Boehner. ""We're also continuing to investigate the IRS for its abuse of power. There's nothing phony about these scandals, Mr. President."""	Why the GOP Would Rather Wait Until 2014 Than Govern Today 	['Obama', 'Paul', 'McCain', 'Beutler', 'Toomey']	[]
19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/hillary_clinton_fatigue_will_the_constant_drama_around_the_former_secretary.html	"For Hillary Clinton, the problem with Anthony Weiner's candidacy is supposed to be that it conjures memories of her own marital troubles. It's not good to have an ongoing public discussion of the parallels between Weiner's wife and former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin (who is standing by her man) and Clinton (who did a version of the same). But didn't voters reconcile themselves Clinton's personal past long ago? Plus, as the Weiner three-ring circus adds more rings and more freak show characters by the hour--the whirling communications director of expletives, the pouty former intern, and the dishy phone paramour (phonamour?)--Weiner's behavior and the mushrooming calamity of his public life surpasses anything Bill Clinton could conjure up. But, for Hillary Clinton, the problem with the Weiner fiasco may not be the memories but the mishigas. Though she and her husband have nothing to do with this campaign, the episode does bring to mind a familiar feeling about the Clinton enterprise--that it was always surrounded by some kind of drama. ""That's what we were talking about with No Drama Obama,"" says a veteran of Obama's 2008 campaign reflecting on the Weiner episode. ""That's how we ran against her."" Anthony Weiner will almost certainly be long gone, forgotten, or irrelevant when and if Hillary Clinton runs for president. But even if the Weiner problem doesn't' linger, the episode highlights two challenges that Hillary Clinton 2016 will face. The first is how she will dispel the drama question that attends her family name and present herself afresh, and the second is whether the drama of the kind kicked up by Weiner gives her pause about running again. The issue lurking behind Clinton drama is really one of Clinton fatigue. Presidential campaigns, like Christmas, seem to come earlier every year. With Hillary Clinton as a possible candidate, this has exacerbated the trend. She is a popular subject and she would be the most viable female candidate ever. So CNN just announced that it has contracted a documentary of her life. NBC has a miniseries in the works. Both ventures are literally banking that Clinton will run for president. Sure, it's 90 degrees outside, but might as well put up the lights. The problem with this trend is that by the time a candidacy actually rolls around, everyone will be thoroughly sick of the enterprise. The tree will be a collection of needles at the base of some scrawny branches. President Obama was the most fresh-faced candidate in modern times. He was biracial, had an unfamiliar background, and said interesting things. Now Democrats are lining up to nominate the most encrusted candidate in a long time. Hillary Clinton has been at the center of two political trends: the feeding frenzy media that cares less and less about substance and the rise in partisanship that has targeted the Clinton, Bush, and Obama presidencies with a special intensity. That can be wearying as the press obsesses over familiar ground and as new episodes like the Weiner unpleasantness allow the press and elites to indulge their Hillary obsessions. Clinton does not invite all this attention, but she must respond to it, which means we are treated to rounds of stories quoting people from the Clinton camp. That is likely to wear people out long before the next piece of drama--whatever it is--from the Clinton arena: squabbling aides, a misunderstanding about what Bill Clinton just said, or another round of endless feminist and post-feminist debate about some tiny choice Clinton has made. Of course, the Clinton campaign could make a concerted effort to limit the drama. Good luck--lots of it is not in her control. The other option is to make a clean break with the past, much as Clinton did at the State Department. The great triumph of Clinton's tenure there, until the Benghazi tragedy, was that it was drama free. Not only were there no public distractions, she added to her presidential bona fides: Staffers speak glowingly of her management abilities, something that was not in evidence during her first White House run. Another possibility is that the public gets tired of the press'  Clinton fascination and decides to tune it out, marking it down to a media ever-more incapable of distinguishing the frivolous from the meaningful. The ""drama"" will no longer be Clinton's but a creation of the media and the partisans who just can't get over her. Today, Matt Drudge was pushing a supposed new tape from the Lewinsky affair. From this posture, Clinton's ability to weather a delegitimized media's scrutiny and abuse from the right for so many years becomes an asset. It means she has experience, grit, and tenacity. Those voters who like Barack Obama but think he lacked the toughness to steamroll the obstacles that faced him might imagine that Clinton would be able to gut it out. Clinton is a battler, but is she interested in endless battle? The Clinton connection to Anthony Weiner is stupid and frustrating for her. Clinton has nothing to do with the race and she has nothing to do with most of the people who are in the press speaking about her or her husband's motives. She can do little to fix this condition. That's what the campaign will be like: Days and days of this kind of foolishness. Clinton won't be able to avoid it, even if the Democratic race feels like a coronation. It's not that she'll have to face some yet to be found wonder-candidate like Obama. She will have to face Hillary Clinton the Myth, the Cartoon, and Media Creation. The Weiner episode demonstrates how animated those characters can be. It doesn't require Clinton's actual involvement at all, and yet story after story is produced, analysis spools out across the airwaves, and interns are sent to the tape files to pull up old footage of this or that thing. Is Hillary Clinton ready for a constant dose of all that?"	Will Clinton Fatigue Doom Hillary Clinton Long Before 2016?	['Clinton', 'Obama']	['creation']

Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles were back together, pitching them in private about the revised version of their deficit reduction plan, and about how a grand bargain on spending really could still happen. Really. ""What a wonderful group!"" remembers Simpson. ""They work with each other. They talk to each other. You know that [Montana Sen. Max] Baucus and [Michigan Rep. Dave] camp are working on tax reform already, so we don't need to prod them. We say, pull up a chair. We don't serve any bullshit or mush. We'll tell you where your country is."" Unexpectedly, July was shaping up to be a good month for the austerity crowd. They'd been losing their best argument, watching the deficit fall from $1.1 trillion last year to $642 billion this year. The grim experiences of nations committed to actual austerity programs hadn't helped that group, either. But the relevant parties were listening, and a posse of Senate Republicans was meeting with White House negotiators about a possible bargain. The White House is still open to the package of tax hikes and entitlement cuts it proposed in the last few showdowns--$400 billion in Medicare cuts, maybe chained CPI. The last few times the deal-makers got here, they were undone by conservatives who didn't want to bend on taxes. Things change: The austerity crowd may be undone, one more time, by conservatives who view the coming vote to fund the government--deadline Sept. 30--as the ""last chance"" to defund the Affordable Care Act. Completely predictable, and yet it came out of nowhere. Last week, Utah Sen. Mike Lee unveiled a letter co-signed by 11 colleagues, pledging that they ""will not support any continuing resolution or appropriations legislation that funds further implementation or enforcement of Obamacare."" North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows Xeroxed that letter in the House, and quickly made 66 foxhole buddies. The rest of the party--and keep in mind, it's a party wholly committed to destroying Obamacare--has reacted with a combustible mix of disgust and panic. The continuing resolution (and after that, the fight over the debt limit) was an opportunity to force the White House to deal on entitlements. ""The one thing that we have achieved is that we have actually cut discretionary spending through sequestration and the Budget Control Act,"" Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn pointed out. ""That's one thing we've done great for the country, and you're going to put that at risk trying to achieve something that is impossible for us to achieve."" But the Republicans demanding a repeal vote are changing the conversation. In their corner, demanding as a pH test of conservatism, are the Club for Growth, Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, and the other usual suspects. Every Republican discussed as a credible 2016 candidate (Rubio, Cruz, Paul) signed the letter. They've sold it to conservative media as much as they've sold it to anybody else. ""We need the American people to stand with us in demanding that not another cent be spent on implementing ObamaCare,"" wrote Rubio in an editorial for RedState.com. ""At that point, the President will have a decision to make: sign it and keep the government open, or veto it and shut down the government."" Cruz spent Monday in conversation with conservatives, starting with Fox News and continuing with Glenn Beck and Missouri radio talker Dana Loesch. ""If we surrender, as Republicans are so good at, it's guaranteed we will not win this fight,"" he said on Fox. Talking to Loesch, he reiterated what was written in the letter, the claim that the delay in the employer mandate meant that Senate Republicans had no duty to fund the whole law.  ""There is a powerful defeatist approach among Republicans in Washington,"" he told her. ""The House of Representatives should pass a continuing resolution that funds the entire government, except Obamacare."" In the right context, the defund-Obamacare-first Republicans might actually enable a bargain. Most deals begin with unreasonable demands and end in the center. Move the center to the right and, theoretically, you end up closer to that side than to the president's side. One problem with that: Republicans already tried to do this. They were in a stronger political position. They failed. In 2011, the new Republican Congress tried to defund Obamacare, and for their troubles the president mocked them. ""I said to them, 'Let me tell you something: I spent a year and a half getting healthcare passed,' "" said Obama at an April 2011 fundraiser. ""'I had to take that issue across the country and I paid significant political costs to get it done. The notion that I'm going to let you guys undo that in a six-month spending bill?' I said, 'You want to repeal health care? Go at it. We'll have that debate. You're not going to be able to do that by nickel-and-diming me in the budget. You think we're stupid?' "" So the threat to Obamacare doesn't actually scare the left. To them, it feels like the demands conservatives have made on taxes in every round of the Debt Wars. Their refusal to raise taxes, even on Social Security, has effectively checkmated the administration on its entitlement plans. The shrinking deficit has made it easier for progressives to defend entitlements as they are.

The grand-bargainers are well aware of that. ""It's just great that the deficit is down,"" says Alan Simpson. ""That's what you hope for--get the deficit down, get more people back to work. Hell, any good news is good news!"" His struggle, he says, is to get members of Congress to worry about the 30-year threat of entitlement liabilities as much as they worried about a Greece-like collapse in 2011 or 2012. Changing the discussion to Obamacare? That's short-term. ""If you begin to draw the line in the sand, I doubt the other folks will go along with that. There'll be a great orgy of discussion then they'll kick the can down the road."""

Weiner's supposed nom d'amour? Carlos Danger. Judging by a snap poll of New York City residents conducted by Slate and SurveyMonkey, Weiner is in the Danger Zone. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Of the New Yorkers polled, 60 percent said they were ""not at all likely"" to vote for Weiner for mayor, and only 20 percent said they were ""extremely likely,"" ""very likely,"" or ""moderately likely"" to vote for him. Most interesting is seeing the percentage of New Yorkers who changed their mind about Weiner after this week's revelations. ""Before you heard about his recent 'sexting' habits,"" the question asks, ""how likely were you to vote for Weiner in the upcoming mayoral election?"" Only 35 percent said they were ""not at all likely,"" compared to 42 percent who were ""moderately"" to ""extremely"" likely. Apparently, New York residents believe Weiner deserved a second chance, but after hearing of his latest batch of debauchery (some of which occurred after he resigned), they've seen enough. And, contrary to pundits (here, here) who posit that voters don't or shouldn't care about Weiner's latest online indiscretions, fully 86 percent of the survey respondents said a politician's personal behavior factors into their decision at least somewhat. And for most of them--81 percent--the fact that Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, forgave him doesn't make a lick of difference in their opinion of him. In the Slate/SurveyMonkey poll, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn beat out former city comptroller Bill Thompson, who Quinnipiac University has as the favored pick in the Democratic primary. Either way, Weiner is a distant third--and 61 percent of respondents think he should drop out of the race altogether. Respondents gave two main reasons for why they thought Weiner should exit early: ""His lack of moral judgment"" and ""His lying/untrustworthiness."" Despite what we tell ourselves about separating the personal from the political, these voters are nonetheless allergic to being fed a false story of self-reformation. The takeaway: Do not mess with New Yorkers' B.S. detectors."	This Poll Shows Why New Yorkers Don't Like Anthony Weiner	[]	[]
22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/justin_amash_s_nsa_amendment_almost_passed_congressional_critics_think_they.html	"For a few minutes on Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Justin Amash thought he might have killed the National Security Agency's metadata collection program. He'd optimistically expected maybe 90 Republicans to back his amendment to the Department of Defense budget. Ninety-four of them did. But he ran out of votes eventually--the Democrats didn't come through--and by a 217-205 margin, the House killed his amendment. Amash loaded the confetti cannon anyway. ""My friends and colleagues stuck with me on my NSA amendment and changed the dynamic of the debate with tonight's close vote,"" the Republican congressman tweeted. ""What an amazing staff I have. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You guys are awesome."" Awesome, even though they lost? Neither party's leadership, Republicans or Democrats, is particularly invested in challenging the NSA. Rep. Darrell Issa's House Oversight Committee has held multiple hearings this year on the 2011 attack in Benghazi and on the IRS's pokey approval of Tea Party tax-exemption applications, but nothing on the metadata scandal that composes the rest of the ""Obama administration in tatters"" narrative. Senate Democrats are holding a hearing next week on the NSA program, but that's the point--the hearing is only next week, many news cycles since Edward Snowden arrived in the Moscow airport. The NSA's critics, from the libertarian right to the civil rights left, can't depend on unified action in Congress. They need to poke holes in the national security consensus. They won't get a new Church Committee, but they can put enough heat on the administration that it changes its standards. That's what they liked about Amash's amendment. ""They picked up more Republican votes than any of us thought they would, and that was thanks to Amash,"" says Michelle Richardson, legislative director for national security at the ACLU in D.C. ""He's super-smart. His staff is super-smart. They don't just throw an amendment out there and let the chips fall. They work it on the floor."" Defenders of the NSA program are furious that Amash even got that far, and are working to undermine him. According to Politico's Jake Sherman, Amash started this process with an ""unworkable amendment"" that would have failed easily, until staffers ""held his hand"" to fix it. That's their story, but it doesn't reflect what led up to the amendment. In the wake of Edward Snowden's disclosures, every member of Congress who'd been sitting on some security state reform picked it back up and reintroduced it. In the Senate, Utah's Mike Lee (a Republican) and Oregon's Jeff Merkley (a Democrat) brought back the Ending Secret Law Act that they couldn't pass when FISA was reauthorized. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden and Colorado Sen. Mark Udall, both Democrats, introduced legislation to restrict NSA data collection unless the material contained a ""demonstrated link to terrorism or espionage."" At the time, the lack of quick action on those bills suggested that the Snowden story had been a blip. Privacy advocates in Congress now refer to those bills as the first wave, part of a strategy of attrition that will make the current policy politically untenable. Amash proved the NSA will have to concede some ground when his amendment moved quickly from obscurity to reality to being under attack from the administration. On Monday night, before the Rules Committee voted on which amendments to bring up, Amash was told to meet with Speaker of the House John Boehner on the floor. He returned from that meeting convinced (and surprised) that he'd get a vote after all. That all happened before 8 p.m on Monday. At 9:20 p.m., House Republicans received this email from the House Intelligence Committee. Classified Member-Only Briefing
 Topic: ""NSA Programs""
 **Members ONLY** This meeting will be given at a Top Secret/SCI level and will be strictly Members-Only.

 Briefing Team: General Keith B. Alexander, National Security Agency

 Note from the Committee: In advance of anticipated action on amendments to the DoD Appropriations bill, Chairman Mike Rogers of the House Intelligence Committee invites your Member to attend a question and answer session with General Keith B. Alexander of the National Security Agency. That message was the start of a lobbying push that succeeded--while convincing Amash and his allies that they were on the right path. Every relevant committee leader worked the vote. Democratic leaders didn't whip their conference, leaving that to their ranking member on the intelligence committee, Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger. Hours before the vote, Ruppersberger's office emailed Democrats a critical statement from the committee, a pre-emptive attack on the amendment from the White House, and an editorial from the Wall Street Journal titled ""Republicans for Snowden."" Democrats were suddenly supposed to be swayed by an article that pointed out that ""several former Bush security officials on Tuesday also released an open letter to Congress supporting the NSA programs as lawful."" Miraculously, all of this worked. A bare majority of the House killed the amendment. But it did so in a way that bucked up the NSA's critics, convincing them that they could win. ""The side of transparency and openness is starting to put some points on the board,"" declared Sen. Wyden in a speech this week. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was something ""virtually no one had heard of two months ago and now the public asks me about it at the barber."" Wyden's little joke was loaded. After next week, members will spend a month in their districts. The NSA's critics expect the issues they work on to smolder through August, right in time for a ""second wave"" of bills. California Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat, is ready with a bill that would create a ""public advocate"" for the FISA court, someone who'd argue for the public when the court was asked for a warrant. Vermont Sen. Pat Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has readied a bill to move up the ""sunset"" of FISA reauthorization from December 2017 to June 2015. There's no grand strategy for passing these bills. But there's no grand strategy for stopping them. There's something quite panicky and ad hoc, something that Amash, Wyden, and 200 other odd members of Congress are no longer moved by."	Could a Small Group of Congressmen Actually Defeat the NSA?

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/inside_the_moral_mondays_protests_the_rev_william_barber_and_his_campaign.html	"RALEIGH, N.C.--For a few hours every Monday, one of the black churches on the outskirts of town becomes a political beachhead. Today it's Christian Faith Baptist Church on Hilltop Drive, conveniently about a mile from the Wake County Detention Center. I walk in shortly after 2 p.m., sign in as ""media,"" and pick up yesterday's prayer program, which includes a Harper's-style listicle of ominous numbers. The last of them: 21 million - estimated numbers of votes cast in North Carolina elections in the last twelve years 1 - number of cases of voter impersonation fraud that occurred in North Carolina in the last 12 years according to the State Board of Elections It syncs up neatly with today's rally. For the 12th time this year, state NAACP President Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II will lead a few hundred protesters to the North Carolina legislature, where 90 or so will refuse to leave and be hauled away by police. Every week, they focus on a new piece of legislation from the state's Republican House and Senate--background checks for welfare recipients, opting out of Obamcare's Medicaid money, an end to long-term unemployment benefits, an omnibus abortion restrictions bill attached (for reasons of efficiency and bad PR) to a motorcycle safety bill. Every week, the legislation passes anyway. Yet the reporters keep showing up and talking to Barber. As a PBS camera crew sets up in the chapel, two volunteers wheel a yellow-and-black NAACP logo in front of the pulpit, to frame the shot. Barber, a former linebacker who steadies his considerable bulk on a wooden cane, makes small talk with his interviewers. They want to know how many people they'll be filming. ""The thing about a moral movement is that you don't measure numbers,"" says Barber, opening the buttons of his long suit coat. ""You say you're gonna get 5,000. Everybody focuses on whether you got 5,000. In a moral movement, it takes one person whose constitutional rights are violated, or one person who's offended in some way. Think about Dr. King. Birmingham--that was started by 50 people."" Barber sits for one interview, then another, then talks to me, offering only slight variations on a theme. The goal today is to occupy the Statehouse until police start arresting protesters. It's not to stop the new voter ID bill, which was dropped at the end of last week, because Moral Monday protesters aren't taken seriously by the solid Republican majority in the legislature. State Sen. Thom Goolsby calls the movement ""Moron Monday."" Gov. Pat McCrory has accused them of ""cussing"" him out. Sen. Tom Apodaca, who runs the rules committee, has announced the progress of these bills with all the confidence of someone who can't possibly lose re-election. ""They haven't moved,"" Barber tells me, after I ask what the protesters are actually winning. ""The people have moved. Now less than one in five North Carolinians agree with them. Moral Monday is more popular than them."" This theory, that a boldly obnoxious ""citizens movement"" can bring down the elected class, gets a new text every year or so. In the summer of 2009, to the horror of Democrats, Tea Party activists swarmed congressional town halls and begged them not to pass the Affordable Care Act. The swarmers won. In the winter of 2011, progressives occupied the Wisconsin capitol until the newly dominant Republicans found a way to pass a ""budget control"" bill that broke most collective bargaining rights for labor unions. The Republicans won, crushing an attempted recall of Gov. Scott Walker and keeping control of the legislature thanks to their own favorable gerrymander. Then came the Occupy movement, then came the protests of Texas' abortion bill, all of it resulting in a legislative defeat but plenty of media. That's what's happening in North Carolina, with a twist. Barber is a veteran organizer who became the NAACP's leader in the state in 2006 and jumped feet-first into the Duke Lacrosse rape scandal. His credibility survived, and by 2011 he was celebrating a Democratic rout of Wake County school board members who had ended a busing program. When the new Republican legislature started working through its backlog of conservative bills, Barber was ideally positioned to embarrass them in front of national TV cameras. So he does. As we finish talking, volunteers for today's rally and civil disobedience walk into the pews. ""Marchers on the right,"" says a volunteer. ""Civil disobedience on the left."" Out in the lobby, another volunteer is ripping up green gingham cloth to create armbands for the people who'll get arrested. ""It's what was on sale at Marshalls,"" she explains. Outside, as activists stream into the church, seven members of an extended family wait to meet Barber--he wants to congratulate them for joining the cause last week. ""It was awesome getting arrested,"" says Alisa Denbow. She worked at a gun shop--Sovereign Guns--got laid off, and joined the cause when the Republicans ended long-term unemployment benefits. ""I've never been arrested, but I felt really good about standing up for what we believe."" ""Half of the officers said they agreed with us!"" says her cousin Dennis Bailey. ""Well, the one I had wasn't too nice,"" says Denbow. ""He about ripped my arms off. He tightened that cuff so frickin' tight I couldn't feel anything."" Denbow and Bailey are white, as are most of the people training and rallying today. The activists have their theories about this. ""Six years ago I'd march with Rev. Barber and you could pick me out of a crowd,"" says Timothy Tyson, a Duke professor who'll be cooking lamb stew for the protesters when they get out of the detention center. He teaches civil rights movement history, he had a book about his father's activism adapted into a movie, and on a previous Moral Monday, he'd gotten himself arrested. ""There might have been three white people at one of those protests. Now, I think the people getting arrested are the people who can afford to, a lot of older people."" Younger people or black people might worry more about acquiring Google-accessible mug shots. A good crop of younger people make it to the civil disobedience session anyway. After they learn how to conduct themselves and which attorneys to talk to afterward, they join the generally gray-haired activists in rows behind Barber for a press conference-cum-sermon. Barber points to veterans of the 1960s marches for civil rights--one of them ""was there with those who said we're gonna march from Selma to Montgomery to create a crisis that was going to save the possibility of our voting rights."" And that's why they're going to get arrested today. The media won't cover the predictable march of conservative legislation through a conservative legislature. They will cover an actual march that ends in a flurry of white plastic handcuffs. So the marchers are off, and at 5 p.m. they join the public, jail-free part of Moral Monday. Halifax Square, a pleasantly anonymous green space in front of the Statehouse, is around half-filled with a few hundred protesters. They move closer to the center of the field as the July sun is obscured by clouds. Some hold up pictures of Trayvon Martin. Some hold up parasols decorated with slogans against the ""War on Women,"" mementos from the week before, when the legislature rammed the ""motorcycle abortion bill"" through. ""That crowd went all the way back to the Statehouse,"" says Leslie Boyd, a health care access activist who was arrested after the state opted out of Medicaid expansion money. ""Seeing these middle-aged and older women smiling politely, walking out in handcuffs, that was just incredibly inspiring."" The field is littered with the noble failure of previous protests. A few days earlier, the Senate passed a ban on foreign law generally understood to be a prohibition on ""Shariah courts."" Archie Mustafa-Gordon, a retired corrections offer and member of the Nation of Islam, stands with four fellow Muslims holding plaintive signs, asking people to understand what Shariah is. ""They're misinterpreting what's in the Quran,"" he starts to say--but just then, a Democrat bounds onto the stage to announce that the voter ID bill they had been protesting will be replaced by an omnibus bill, with even more restrictions. ""They put all the bad stuff together, and we're gonna fight it!"" says the speaker. ""Do not rig the election if you can't win it!"" Mustafa-Gordon frowns. ""Right, right, we keep hearing that,"" he says. ""But the thing is, we voted them in there."" The rally keeps to a tight schedule, anchored by another rousing Barber speech with call-and-response slogans. ""Somebody say the right to vote--"" The right to vote! ""--is sacred--"" Is sacred! ""--and this fight"" And this fight! ""--is personal."" Is personal! ""When Sen. Apodaca describes the Voting Right Acts as a headache, he sounds like Strom Thurmond or George Wallace or something! He needs to get his heaaaaad fixed and his heaaaart regulated--he thinking like he's in the 19th century!"" A little bit after 6 p.m., the rally comes to an end, and the crowd needs only a little guidance for the next step. It parts, cutting a path from the stage into the Statehouse. The people getting arrested and the people supporting them march through, high-fiving and hugging and posing for pictures as they go. Expressionless police officers watch them head in, knowing what comes next. Organizers stand inside the building, barking commands: ""If you have a green armband, go left! Everybody else go right."" The crowd, finding its way up some stairs and through hallways, fills both levels of the atrium between the legislative chambers. Those on the third floor can peer past a bronze chandelier and see Barber and anyone else who wants to speak, without amplification, into news cameras. At some point, even though the legislature is gone for the day, they're going to get arrested, so the trick is keeping the mood up until the cops play their part. So most activists say something short and personal. A student from Wisconsin is greeted with cheers, even though the idea that this crowd is inflated by ""outsiders"" has been a Republican knock against them. Harold Timberlake, a pastor from Charlotte, opens his iPhone and reads Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech in its entirety, affecting a spotless King impression. It's not until 7:12, when a hesitant older woman starts to speak, that the police loudspeakers announce that ""this building is closed"" and anyone not wanting to be arrested has five minutes to leave. The reaction is unfailingly polite. Those who really want to leave do so immediately, in a slow push out of the building. The 90-odd civil disobeyers stay put, facing the police officers, one of whom dutifully points a camcorder at them. They run through the chants: Tell me what democracy looks like? This is what democracy looks like! The people, united, will never be defeated! Whose house? Our house! Whose house? Our house! At 7:17, the arrests begin. Some of the protesters closest to the police pre-emptively clasp their hands, prepping for the cuffs to come on. There's no rush--the process is so deliberate that the protesters run through the standard peace and civil rights anthems and start depending on a man who knows a few union ballads. The arrests are still going on at 7:45, when I follow some of the non-arrested protesters outside to face the prison bus. There are two buses backed up to the building, waiting to be filled for the short drive to the detention center. The other side of the street, abutting a parking lot, is filled up with supporters singing and chanting and being supplied with water, as black pastors walk up and down the street, revving them up. I turn away from the street for a second, just as a massive cheer goes up. Joggers, half of them shirtless and well-toned, are running past the protesters and giving the thumbs-up. ""They do it every week,"" says protester Cathy O'Neill, wearing one of the ""Jailed for Justice"" T-shirts that started going on sale a few weeks ago. ""It's usually the same people, going for a run and putting us on the route. They're fantastic."" O'Neill and I wait for 30 minutes as the arrests finally conclude. She speculates that the state's trying to wait out the pesky singing protesters across the street. The first bus only starts to board as the sunlight fades. It loads from the back--there's no way to see the people being arrested. The crowd starts cheering anyway. ""Thank you! We love you! Thank you! We love you!"" As the second bus loads, I drive over to the detention center, an impressively bland fortress on the outside of town with plenty of parking. The ""welcoming crew"" is already there--the group of veteran protesters who've been through this plenty of times, and the lawyers who can notarize documents as the civil disobeyers exit with their personal items and court dates. One of the simpler and more rewarding tasks goes to Dick Reavis. He's a professor of English at North Carolina State University, but before that, he wrote what he calls ""adventure journalism"" for Texas Monthly; before that, he worked to register voters in Alabama. It was there, in 1965, that he was arrested and sentenced to six months of hard labor. ""It was a segregated prison, and they weren't about to put me into hard labor with the black prisoners,"" he remembers. ""So I spent three weeks reading Socrates."" As the protesters come out--starting at 9:12 p.m.--Reavis gives them buttons commemorating their service. I Went to JAIL With Rev. Barber 2013 It's all gotten quite neatly regimented. After that first round of processing at the Statehouse, prisoners are brought to a common room, given blue arm bands--""to denote that they're political prisoners,"" says Reavis--and nudged out quickly. People arrested in the first weeks remember waiting until 4 a.m. to get out of jail. The state's goal now is to cycle the interlopers out, as quickly as possible. The protesters' goal is to keep doing this, as long as the legislature is in session, then take the ""Moral Monday"" brand on the road, to each congressional district. The goal, after that, is to win the 2014 elections. ""People are going to suffer though months without unemployment insurance, without the Medicaid expansion,"" says state Sen. Earline Parmon, a member of the welcoming committee. ""They're going to understand that the brand 'smaller government,' means less services to people. Look, the legislature is at 49 percent disapproval right now, with independents, and you're going to see those numbers rise."" The prisoner releases keep on happening, in short bursts, and people who are hungry are driven back to Christian Faith Baptist Church. The rooms usually used for Sunday school are given over to a potluck dinner. Tom High, a retiree, waits near the door to hand out plastic plates and silverware; a retinue of black women applaud when someone arrives with one of the ""I Got Arrested"" buttons. In between servings, High speculates about ""the positive things the movement can focus on next"" so it's not just a protest movement that fails to stop the legislature but drives down its approval numbers. Maybe a ballot initiative. Maybe an aggressive public finance law put to the voters. There's no consensus about that yet. The consensus is only that the protests are working, and that Tim Tyson's lamb stew is delicious. At 10:30, the people who got arrested are still arriving and enjoying the spread, talking about how inspiring the whole drama was. ""We heard good things from the people processing us, actually,"" says a college student from Greensboro named Noelle Lane. ""The magistrate told me: I'd love to be on your side next time."""

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/florida_democrat_alan_grayson_is_the_most_effective_member_of_the_house.html	"Alan Grayson is running 40 minutes late, but his reason is sound. At 11:30 a.m., the House Science Committee started marking up NASA's funding bill, adding and subtracting whatever they could. At 5 p.m., the committee was still at it. When the members finished a half hour later, the only headline they'd generate would be about the killing of a program to ""send a robotic mission to a small asteroid by 2016."" Grayson, once again, had walked under the radar. The Democratic congressman from Orlando had convinced the Republican-run committee to adopt five of his amendments. One would bar ""the federal government from awarding contracts to corporations convicted of fraud,"" and another would force NASA to ""consider American public-private partnership human space flight"" before it partnered with foreign space programs. Each was getting him closer to an unheralded title: The congressman who's passed more amendments than any of his 434 peers. ""We've passed 31 amendments in committee so far,"" says Grayson. ""Hardly any Democrats who put in amendments put in any effort to get to 218. They just think they've accomplished something when it's ruled in order, and that's the end of the story."" The last time the media noticed Alan Grayson, he was a freshman Democrat, a member of the 2008 Obama wave, trying and failing to survive 2010. Grayson joked that Dick Cheney left a ""torture rack"" in the White House, said that the Republican health care plan was for people to ""die quickly""--so on and so on, all very helpful to a press trying to prove that the Tea Party had an ideological match on the left. Grayson went down by 18 points to the blandly conservative former state senator Daniel Webster, or ""Taliban Dan,"" as a Grayson ad called him. The Washington Post eulogized him as ""a controversial liberal icon that many in the Democratic Party weren't sad to see lose."" Grayson's back because the last round of redistricting created a new, safe seat in metro Orlando. He won it, reclaiming a job he says he wants to keep ""for a long, long time."" In doing so he's stopped being a Republican target and started getting along with the majority. In his office, the only evidence that he used to irritate the other party is a plaque on his desk: I Have Flying Monkeys and I'm Not Afraid to Use Them. He doesn't use them on Republicans anymore. ""I don't think they feel the same sort of glee,"" he says. ""I don't see them using me as a fundraising ploy."" The new strategy is simple. Grayson and his staff scan the bills that come out of the majority. They scan amendments that passed in previous Congresses but died at some point along the way. They resurrect or mold bills that can appeal to the libertarian streak in the GOP, and Grayson lobbies his colleagues personally. That's how he attached a ban on funding for ""unmanned aerial vehicles,"" i.e. drones, to the homeland security bill. He swears that they don't back away from him because of his old persona--well, his relationship with Webster is ""strained,"" but he points out that Webster won re-election by 5,000 votes and Grayson won with 70,000. Never mind that. Are the members of Congress more forgiving than members of the press? ""It's either that, or we're all senile,"" he says. ""In some cases it's a short conversation. In some cases it's a long conversation. In some cases, they're desperate to talk to somebody. Some members are actually very lonely people."" This is how he brings members aboard on bills that either keep resources in Florida or enshrine some liberal or libertarian principle in the law. ""They might come from the perspective that Barack Obama is a horrible president, and I come from the perspective of being critical of the military-industrial complex."" Grayson added one amendment to the last homeland security funding bill that prohibited ""funds in the bill from being used in contravention of the First, Second, or Fourth Amendments."" That was surprisingly easy to do. ""We knew they couldn't vote against it,"" he says. ""They wouldn't want to roll call vote against the Constitution. They're constantly trying to acquire the Constitution for their own purposes, and claim that they're the guardians of it, so we knew that couldn't fail."" The real prize of passing that amendment was writing the legislative justification for it into the Congressional Record. ""The intent of Congress with this legislation,"" Grayson wrote, ""is to place an absolute prohibition on any DHS involvement of any type or to any degree with any surveillance of Americans without specificity or without probable cause, such as the National Security Agency's recently revealed surveillance program."" That, he says, was ""the benefit of future courts, for the benefit of future administrations."" Does any of it matter? The Obama administration doesn't talk to him about these amendments, and he doesn't clear anything by it. The most high-profile progressive move Grayson made all year was a letter he co-wrote with California freshman Mark Takano, pledging to ""vote against any and every cut to Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security benefits"" in a theoretical sequestration fix. Democrats never got the chance to act on that threat, because, paradoxically, the Republican House's inability to cut big deals has kept entitlements off the block. ""You never heard people say--why doesn't Pelosi do more?"" says Grayson. ""Some people would say, why doesn't she do less? There are Democrats who've said since then, I wish she didn't do so much. But now it's a common feeling even among the lobbyists that the Republican leadership doesn't deliver for them. All they do is put out these 'message' bills."" Grayson has usually benefited from the way the House is run. His losses have been close-run things. At the end of June, when the House was moving a pair of energy bills, Grayson tried to attach language to enshrine ""the right of any state to prohibit the management, leasing, developing, or use of lands"" for offshore drilling. He nearly had the votes--one of the amendments failed on a rare 213-213 tie. ""I can only imagine what they offered people to switch,"" he says. He got close by selling Republicans on the enviro-friendly amendment as a defense of state's rights. Halfway through our conversation, Grayson has to trek from his office to the House floor for a series of votes. He disappears into the chamber, emerging after almost everybody else. On the way out he spots Florida Rep. Trey Radel, a 37-year-old freshman who that morning had written an op-ed about his love for hip-hop. ""I need to talk to you when you have a moment,"" says Grayson. Radel actually has plenty of time, and the two congressmen stroll back to their offices, just out of earshot. When they're done, Grayson returns to his staff and informs them that ""Radel says yes"" on another NSA-limiting amendment. ""[California Rep. Dana] Rohrabacher says yes,"" he says. ""We need four more."" They're going to be gettable. ""These guys despise the NSA."" Nothing's stopping any of these Republicans from writing civil liberties-friendly amendments. Plenty of them do. Democrats, say Grayson, are just more inclined to act quickly, less inclined to think that you can whittle the state down if you defund it or ignore it. ""The government doesn't go away if you close your eyes."""	Why Alan Grayson Is the Most Effective Member of the House	['Grayson', 'Webster', 'Pelosi', 'Rohrabacher', 'Obama']	[]

It is meant to convey Wyoming, the state she would like to represent and where she has lived for only a year or so. Her opponent, Sen. Mike Enzi, is a three-term incumbent and could achieve the same effect by standing alone in a room. He is a 40-year veteran of Wyoming politics who built a business there and whose lack of Beltway trappings would help him do well in a ranking of sitting senators least likely to be mistaken for one. If this were a campaign based on geography, Cheney would be sunk. That is why--despite the tableau--the video announces not so much that she's running from Wyoming but that she's really running to become a senator from a Conservitopia, an ideological place where mere garden-variety conservatism is not enough. In a Republican Party roiled by purity tests over immigration, taxes, and abortion, Liz Cheney has launched the most precise one. Her opponent has no glaring breaks with conservative orthodoxy. He spends his weekends at home and not on the Washington talk shows where Cheney is a frequent commentator. There is no obvious geographical or ideological rationale for her candidacy. Instead, it is built on age and aggression. The promise of Cheney's candidacy is that she will go to Washington to be an energetic warrior for the conservative cause. By taking on a solid conservative, she will either clarify precisely what a constitutional conservative is or she will launch a high-profile, messy fight that will create a spectacle of GOP discord and acrimony for all to see. Cheney argues that the conservative cause needs a ""new generation of leaders"" who ""can't just go along to get along."" She is making a version of the case used against former Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar: It's no longer enough to be a solid conservative. Evidence of the shifting definitions of conservative can be seen in Enzi's rankings. National Journal ranks him as the eighth-most conservative senator, but Heritage Action only gives him a middle-of-the-pack 67 percent score. Enzi hasn't grown disconnected from his constituents the way Lugar had, which makes this a more pure form of the purity test. In 2010, Republican Sen. Bob Bennett was bounced in a primary because he voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and worked with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden on a health care plan. Enzi's critics will try to make his vote in support of an Internet sales tax a key attack line, but that will be harder to do than exploiting TARP. (Enzi didn't vote for immigration reform or background checks.) Cheney's supporters argue that she will be a true believer in the mold of Sen. Ted Cruz, who is proving day by day in fights with Sens. Dianne Feinstein and John McCain that he doesn't want to just get along. In the ongoing battle against progressives, Enzi ""is not putting points on the board for conservatives,"" says Erick Erickson, editor-in-chief of RedState. He says he backs Cheney because she will score those points. ""We need GOP Senators to be willing to 'beat up on their colleagues,' "" argues Kurt Schlichter at Townhall. ""It's not about collegiality in the cloakroom. We want you hated, despised, and targeted because that will mean you are getting something conservative done."" The race comes at an interesting time for Senate Republicans, when some members are showing signs of tiring of the purity tests. ""Are we here to just be part of a debating society where we argue all day? "" Sen. Lamar Alexander said to me recently. ""Or are we up here to accomplish something?"" Alexander was among the 14 Republicans who voted with Democrats to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Members of this group, which President Obama has called ""the common-sense caucus,"" have also been working behind the scenes with the White House to find some kind of long-term budget deal since the spring. On the other side of the GOP caucus is a new guard of younger members impatient with Senate niceties. Cheney seeks to join that gang, though that will be complicated. The first problem is that new guard member Sen. Rand Paul isn't a fan of Cheney (or her father, the former vice president) and supports Enzi. In particular, Cheney and Paul are on the opposite ends of the foreign-policy spectrum. She's a hawk. He's not. The other challenge for Cheney is her father's legacy on fiscal issues. The Bush administration is not well-regarded for its fiscal stewardship. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney famously told Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill that ""Reagan proved that deficits don't matter."" The precise meaning of the quote is in dispute--Cheney may have been making a point about the political cost of deficits--but many budget hawks made the case to Cheney while he was in a position of power that the administration could do more to slow federal spending. Unlike on national security matters where Cheney gladly bucked the realists in the State Department and stood his ground during internal fights, he had no such reputation when it came to shrinking government. If Liz Cheney's role is to be a fearless, clear-eyed warrior for smaller government, a good test of her purity would be her views on the Bush-Cheney budgets. The usual worry for a party in a primary fight is that it will open up a spot for an eventual challenger from the other party. There's little danger of that in Wyoming, which makes it a perfect place for this intramural scrimmage. It could be long and bloody; both candidates will be well-funded. Democrats hope that the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which has pledged to support Enzi, will have to spend millions against the sure-to-be-well-financed Cheney. They also hope that Cheney will be forced to make ever more extravagant claims about Washington Republicans to give voters a clear rationale for why the unobjectionable Enzi should be turned out. That Republican Washington establishment hopes to regain control of the Senate in 2014. To keep that from happening, Democrats hope Cheney and Enzi will be bloodying themselves for months to come."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/filibuster_reform_s_nuclear_option_republicans_caved_on_obama_s_nominees.html	"When they woke up on Tuesday, most members of the Senate were fixing to go nuclear. For the fourth time since 2005, the majority party had responded to filibusters of presidential nominees by threatening to end such filibusters; for the first time, no one doubted that the majority had the votes to do it. There would be an 11 a.m. vote on Richard Cordray's nomination to lead the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. If he was filibustered, the Enola Gay was circling overhead. All of a sudden, comity--that terrific homonym of ""comedy,"" the word senators always have to over-enunciate--broke out like sunshine through a cottage window. Late-night and early-morning negotiations between Sens. John McCain, and Chuck Schumer produced a compromise. Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters he would take a ""leap of faith"" and vote for Cordray. Shortly before 11 a.m., Sen. Harry Reid announced a deal that would let the nominees get their votes. ""As of this morning, I thought there was going to have to be a vote,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, one of the very few Democratic hold-outs on the nuclear option. He walked into the Cordray vote, cheerily admitting that the crisis was over. No thanks to him, the Democrats completely routed the GOP. The credible threat of a scaled-down filibuster was enough to move Republicans away from positions they'd held since 2009. Forty-three of them had pledged not to move on Cordray unless the CFPB was reformed in some ways they wanted; one-third of them caved. Republicans had been holding up Obama nominees to the National Labor Relations Board since 2010, and now they were agreeing to trade two current Democratic nominees for two new ones, pledging to confirm the replacements. On the right, the scale of the loss was felt immediately. It could only be interpreted with sickness or with silence. ""Senate GOP caves again,"" tweeted the table-banging radio host Mark Levin. The Club for Growth refused to comment. Republican attrition had been quite effective in gumming up agencies, for quite a long time. Now, Republicans weren't even getting meaningful concessions. There were ""no structural changes"" in how the CFPB would work, according to the deal-friendly Sen. Bob Corker. Democrats had sacrificed Richard Griffin and Sharon Block, the two NLRB members serving thanks to recess appointments that a D.C. circuit panel later deemed illegal. In return, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham, the majority party was ""talking about Craig Becker."" Becker was the first NLRB nominee that the GOP had filibustered. Rush Limbaugh had called him a communist. ""Now you might have the return of Becker--you could make it a movie,"" said Graham with a dark laugh. ""I think the NLRB needs to operate. I get that. The problem with how the president picked these two guys went far deeper than any problem with the NLRB."" Sure, Republicans didn't like the recess appointments, but they liked his NLRB appointees even less. Right after he voted for Cordray, Graham tweeted that ""NLRB is a four-letter word"" in South Carolina. What had Republicans won, really, in the compromise? ""We've avoided going from 12 percent to 4 percent,"" said Graham, referring to Congress's job approval numbers. ""We avoided going into single digits."" That was a fairly common take on the deal and its upside for Republicans. ""Look, we see the polling numbers,"" said Sen. John McCain. ""Ten percent approval of Congress. Members of Congress want to work more together and get things done for the American people. We appreciate approval, obviously. That's what politicians largely are about."" He was describing the limits of an obstruction strategy. Reid's new push for a weakened filibuster had occurred in stages, after each successful Republican stymieing of a Democratic nominee. In the days before this deal, he bemoaned that Republicans had filibustered Chuck Hagel--""a war hero""--and that dying New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg had been summoned, ""literally from his deathbed,"" to vote for a bill that Republicans filibustered anyway. His goal was to put some distance between Democrats in Congress and Republicans, and play off an existing public impression that the Republicans were responsible for whatever they hated about Washington. The public was very present in the Senate on Tuesday. As Republicans met to huddle over the deal in a room named after the late South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond, a steady flow of tourists moved between them and reporters. After McCain spent a few minutes talking about how senators ""looked into the abyss and stepped back,"" and started to walk back to vote, one tourist whose legs had been amputated stopped him. ""You're a hero,"" said the tourist. ""Thank you,"" said McCain. He shook hands with the tourist's family and patted the youngest member on the shoulder. ""Nice to see you all! How you doin', pal?"" Then he returned his attention to the reporters, telling them that ""elections have consequences"" and that he maintained a good relationship with Sen. Reid. No wonder the right was quiet. Its strategy, all year, has been to raise hell about Obama's initiatives and nominees and loudly celebrate when the filibuster blocks them. After a filibuster thwarted the watered down post-Sandy Hook gun bill, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told activists that the senators who stood on ""principle"" had beaten the ""squishes."" Republicans can still use filibusters to humiliate the Democrats. But this week saw a late-night Kumbaya meeting that actually worked, a dangerous precedent for the block-everything strategy. Sen. Chuck Schumer was just one of many senators to call for more bipartisan meetings. ""We started to do more with the inner sanctum,"" he said. ""We go on boat rides occasionally, together. To do it more often, one way or another--I think that's the overwhelming consensus."""

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/farm_bill_passes_without_food_stamp_funding_the_conference_committee_is.html	"When the bipartisan machine breaks down, it collapses in ways that can be seen and unseen. The saga of the farm bill gives us examples of both. For the last 40 years, the bill has passed through an unofficial agreement between urban liberals and rural conservatives. The former got funding for food stamps and the latter got farm subsidies. Yesterday, the farm bill passed the House without this deal in place. For the first time since the 1970s, the bill did not include funding for food stamps. No Democrats voted for it. The jalopy of bipartisanship has been going through a prolonged collapse. Still, it's notable when the usual death rattle is augmented by a convulsion that throws off a wheel. The farm bill episode also highlights a less visible part of the machine that's going kaput: congressional orgies. Actually, that's not the topic of this piece. Congressional conference committees are the topic of this piece, but I thought I might lose your attention on a summer weekend. Congressional conference committees are important because they are the mechanism that has often been used to hammer out deals for the most contentious pieces of legislation. They haven't undergone a public undoing like the one at the heart of the farm bill, but they are fading away. Let's review the parts of the bipartisan machine that have already broken down. Members of Congress from opposite parties don't socialize much any more. The earmarks and pork that helped leaders buy the votes of reluctant legislators are now gone. Gerrymandering and demographic shifts bunch like-minded voters together and make districts more partisan. Republicans, in particular, are more fearful of primary challenges and are reluctant to compromise for fear of getting one. Grassroots organizations on both sides have harnessed technology to become more effective at spotlighting anything that looks like a break with orthodoxy and exacting revenge. Many of these political arrangements that improved deal-making were not set in stone. That was true of the rural and urban consensus that held the farm bill together. The conference committee is a more formal structure though. It is the procedure for reconciling the differences between legislation that has passed the House and the Senate on the same topic but in different forms. It is not the only way to pass legislation, but it has often been deployed for the most controversial bills. It offered the appearance that each side was getting a fair hearing, while the venue was small enough to allow everyone to have an old-fashioned working relationship that is necessary to finesse the details so that a final deal can be reached. The congressional conference committee has always been in flux--shaped by the partisan makeup of the two houses of Congress. But the shift now seems bigger, from a mechanism to reconcile the views of competing bodies to a forum for reconciling the views of competing ideologies. It seems useless--or at least unused. The farm bill offers a good example of its troubled recent history. Several weeks ago when the House was not able to pass a farm bill, House Republican leaders were angry with the small band of Democrats who had withdrawn their support for it at the last minute. This didn't make sense, since a big group of GOP conservatives had not voted for the bill and were heralding its defeat, but Republican leaders were angry at Democrats because they had broken an arrangement based on a tacit understanding of how the bill might change on its way to becoming law. The argument Republicans were making to Democrats went something like this: Vote for a bill that you don't completely like to get to conference committee. Once the bill makes it to the conference committee, it will be melded to the Senate bill and the final product will be something you can live with. Why would Democrats agree to this? Because if they didn't, House Republicans would produce a bill that was so conservative the differences could never be reconciled in committee and nothing would happen. Or worse: a bill would pass with measures they didn't like. Republican leaders thought they had enough Democrats who appreciated the long game, but if that were ever the case, those Democrats were spooked at the last minute as Republicans added amendments undermining the food stamp program that seemed impossible to fix through the committee process. Democrats balked. Republican leaders went back to their members and changed their strategy. They dropped the food stamp provision of the bill in order to attract House conservatives. But their vote is contingent on the farm bill not changing very much in committee. If it does, those conservative Republicans will balk the way they did last time. ""We highly suspect that this whole process is a 'rope-a-dope' exercise"" of ""splitting up the farm bill only as a means to get to conference with the Senate where a bicameral back-room deal will reassemble the commodity and food stamp titles, leaving us back where we started,"" the conservative Club for Growth said in a statement. This now sets up a furious battle with the Democrats in the Senate and President Obama who has threatened to veto the bill. Given how different the House position is from the Senate one, there's very little chance the conference committee is going to be useful as a mechanism to sort anything out, but it's better for House Republicans politically to pass something and engage in a fight that will produce nothing than have the House offer nothing at all. When you send a piece of legislation into a process designed to change it on the assumption that it isn't going to get changed, you're not treating the process seriously. Republicans have used a version of this same argument to keep the budget from getting to conference. In that case, a move to reconcile the House and Senate budgets puts Republicans in a tight spot. Under the rules of the Budget Act, any budget that emerges from the conference process is brought up under the rules of reconciliation, which means it would only need a simple majority to pass the Senate. It couldn't be filibustered. That would give Republicans less leverage. So Republicans have refused to go forward with the conference process, arguing that there's no point in going to conference when the two sides are so far apart. Democrats did a version of the same thing with Obamacare. They skipped conference to rob Republicans of a chance to use procedural maneuvers to thwart passage. The reason that having a conference is important--even if you worry about what might result--is that it at least moves the legislative process away from the slapdash, last-minute deal. It also provides one of the last places to use the process to improve a piece of legislation's chances. If it emerges from conference, it might gain legitimacy that will help it pass when both houses of Congress vote on the final product. That is a dubious proposition--the whole notion of momentum in politics is under assault--but the prospect of the conference committee doing real work is alive enough that comprehensive immigration reform opponents don't want to see it. Andrew Stiles outlines nine reasons comprehensive immigration reform opponents are nervous about a conference committee. Perhaps the only reason they need is that John McCain, a member of the Gang of Eight pushing reform, emerged from a White House meeting saying, ""We want legislation that we can go to conference on."" McCain's bet is that if it can get to conference and some compromise can be found, House Republicans will be forced to vote for it. For McCain, getting to conference is part of doing the job of accomplishing something. For hard-core conservatives--like the ones McCain battled over moving the budget to conference committee--it is a capitulation party. It used to be that the problem in Washington was that opposing sides got into a room and couldn't agree. Now they can't even get into the room."

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/house_republicans_opposing_immigration_reform_the_gop_is_quickly_turning.html	"For untold months, the ritual never changed. Sen. Lindsey Graham or Sen. John McCain would approach a Senate lunch or a vote. A pack of reporters would descend on them, asking for updates and wisdom about the comprehensive immigration bill. One or both would supply a handy quote about the doom facing the Republican Party if this bill did not pass. ""We're in a demographic death spiral."" Stuff like that. The bill did pass, in one chamber, and the media has struggled a bit as the game has moved to the House of Representatives. The people's house suffers from a distinct lack of Meet the Press guests. On Wednesday afternoon, members of the GOP majority filed in and out of a basement meeting room, with reporters lined up along all the escape routes. When a member exited, and he slowed down, a dozen or more reporters would pounce with questions. What was the mood in the room? Would he back a path to citizenship? Was the Senate bill dead? It didn't really matter who the congressman was or if reporters knew who he was. Nebraska Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, who looks like Michigan Rep. Bill Huizenga, who looks like Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, paused to take questions from an Omaha World-Herald reporter. Then came the swarm. ""Would you say there's a general resistance to a pathway to citizenship?"" asked a reporter. ""We had a good discussion about the whole variety of perspectives,"" said Fortenberry. ""What about the Dreamers, congressman?"" asked a reporter about the euphemistically named group of people brought to the United States when they were too young to know they were here illegally. ""Is there a sense that those children should be given priority or different treatment than adults?"" ""There's a very serious concern that the Senate bill prioritizes a pathway to citizenship over securing the border."" Quietly, as Fortenberry heated up the boilerplate, a couple of reporters tried to figure out who was talking. ""Berry?"" asked a radio reporter holding an eggplant-shaped microphone toward one of the 200-odd men who could make or break immigration reform. ""Fortenberry,"" corrected a colleague. ""Fortenberry,"" said the radio hack, turning into the microphone to make note. ""Fortenberry. With an F."" The special meeting was called to deal with exactly that sort of randomness and confusion, from members and from the media. House Republicans have been cast all year as the assassins-in-waiting of ""comprehensive immigration reform."" That was accurate: They don't want to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and they are increasingly cold to theories that killing the bill will hurt their party. But the party leadership--and to a larger extent, the party's grandees and donors--see a risk if House Republicans are blamed for killing a deal that passed in the Senate. On MSNBC's Now With Alex Wagner, just three hours before this meeting, Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador had insisted that Democrats' obstinance was the real reason the bill would fail. ""If Chuck Schumer's not going to accept anything unless he gets 100 percent of what he wants, then he's the one who's killing immigration reform,"" said Labrador. Nobody believes that, given that the Senate did pass something, it included border security that Schumer hadn't wanted, and Labrador himself had bolted a House dealmaking group. So the House is embracing chaos while nudging members toward a tolerant-sounding message. According to members in the room, the meeting began with House Speaker John Boehner calling the immigration dialogue ""important"" and insisting that the House would have to stay engaged. Majority Leader Eric Cantor compared the need for some kind of GOP alternative to the alternative ""economic stimulus package"" the party proposed in the deep minority back in 2009. Rank-and-file members had been worried about this possibility. They feared that any bill that made it out of their body, no matter how limited, would go to the conference committee composed of House and Senate negotiators and be Frankensteined into a new comprehensive bill. ""We want to hear that none of the bills that come out of the House will serve as a Trojan horse that can be changed and morphed in conference committee,"" said Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, ""so that we'll have an amnesty bill on the House floor."" The fear is reasonable, because Senate compromisers openly talk about it. ""If the House passes any kind of border bill, or security bill, or any other element,"" Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker told reporters Tuesday, ""it still gives an opportunity for a conference to occur. And I think if a conference occurs, we still have a chance of getting a more comprehensive piece of legislation."" In the Wednesday meeting, Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton asked leaders to make sure that this wouldn't happen. The leaders tried to calm them down, with some success. ""I think that Speaker Boehner is very aware of that,"" said Colorado Rep. Doug Lamborn. ""He won't let it happen in the first place."" Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta, who rose to fame in the 2000s as a small-city mayor cracking down on illegal immigration, was a little less satisfied. ""It was addressed by leadership,"" he said. ""I can't say whether it put to rest the concerns. I'm not concerned, because I won't vote for anything but border security first."" More importantly for Republicans, Barletta left the meeting talking more positively about a small piece of happy-sounding reform. Like many Republicans leaving the meeting, he wondered whether the House could pass something that made citizenship obtainable for young people who'd been brought to America by their lawbreaking parents. ""They are in a special category,"" said Arizona Rep. Trent Franks. He's been such a solid ""no"" on comprehensive reform that McCain didn't bother to lobby him when they shared a plane to Washington on Wednesday morning. But a sop to the Dreamers might make sense. ""What puts them in a special category is that they did not break the law. Their parents did, but they didn't."" There's no current Republican version of the Dream Act, last seen dying in the 2010 lame duck session after nearly every Republican senator voted against it. Yet Republicans have been warming to the idea. Last week, in town hall meetings, multiple members--including the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Rep. Bob Goodlatte--used a version of the ""they did nothing wrong"" pitch. It's a problem that really does concern Republican members, and what would Democrats do if this House tried to fix it? Kill that bill? ""There were some voices of strong compassion for people in that situation,"" said Lamborn, describing the mood in the room. ""It was a situation they didn't cause. They were thrust into it."" There were holdouts. Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, who won a Republican-leaning seat in the 2010 wave and stands no chance of losing it, left the meeting for a row of cameras and microphones. He quoted ""America the Beautiful,"" just as he'd quoted it in the meeting: ""Confirm thy soul in self-control, thy liberty in law."" He'd oppose ""anything that rewards or ratifies illegal conduct,"" because ""if anyone who's come to this country as a first act thumbed their nose at our law, we should not bestow upon them our highest honor, which is citizenship."" The challenge for Republicans is to let members like Brooks talk the way they talk while finding some neat way out of the impasse. According to Lamborn, Republicans definitely wanted to vote on something before the end of the year, as long as they can keep it tight. ""I as a mayor saw many times how people used fraudulent documents to stay in the country,"" said Barletta. ""My concern is how we separate the salt from the sugar. How do we separate the people who were brought here through no fault of their own from the people faking it?"" Implicit in that, though: At least some of the people living illegally in the United States are a little sweet."

Darrell Issa's hubristic spokesman, Mark Leibovich accidentally drains the story of its drama. Kurt Bardella had been forwarding embarrassing emails from staffers, reporters, and congressmen to Leibovich. These people found out, and the ensuing controversy, according to Fox News, had a ""seismic"" impact on Capitol Hill. And yet, ""a few weeks after [Kurt] Bardella was fired,"" writes Leibovich, ""I kept running into people who said they'd seen my name mentioned somewhere but did not remember exactly why. Bardella was finding the same thing. The life cycle of public disgrace had been reduced to almost nothing, and what's left after it exhausts itself is just a neutral sheen of notoriety."" That insight, excerpted in Leibovich's New York Times Magazine cover story over the weekend, proves the silliness of this book's prerelease hype. Way back in April, Politico tried to blunt the This Town's impact (it's fairly brutal on Politico) by ratting out the ""strangely self-conscious"" Leibovich's ""therapy session""-esque reporting. Far too many reviews of the book have asked whether Leibovich will ever ""eat lunch in this town again,"" a cliche that hasn't gotten fresher in the 20 years it's been said about Hollywood. Of course he'll eat lunch in this town. That's the point. The political press corps in Washington is unencumbered by shame, quick to forgive, driven by ego. Leibovich has written a very funny book about how horrible his industry can be. He shouldn't suffer for having done that, and he won't. This Town's tone reminds me of Reuters/Financial Times star Chrystia Freeland's 2012 book Plutocrats, which managed to excoriate the new global elite while featuring near-constant use of the phrase ""as he told me over lunch in Davos."" This Town takes place over four years and (rounding up) several thousand parties. These parties range in scale from the White House Correspondents' Dinner fetes, which Leibovich neatly condemns by listing the menus (""sushi bar, butterscotch milkshakes ... flutes of champagne""), and endless book parties with identical guest lists no matter how minor the author (""first-time novelist Graham Moore, the twenty-nine-year-old son of Michelle Obama's chief of staff""). Leibovich roams through these parties like a middle-aged Holden Caulfield, agog at the phoniness of it all, writing down slights like the ""D.C. scalp stare"" endemic to parties, when someone is ""looking for [someone] over your head if he happened to be stuck talking to you."" What are they looking for? People who matter. Why do they matter? ""You know you've made it in D.C.,"" writes Leibovich, ""when someone says ... 'It isn't clear what he does' about you."" Much has been written about D.C.'s permanent political class, but Leibovich argues that it's no longer interested in anything except wealth accretion. Tammy Haddad, the former Larry King Live producer who throws parties whether people want them or not (""party rape""), starts fundraising for epilepsy research because, well, David Axelrod's family is very focused on epilepsy research. Leibovich's reporting produces some uncommonly honest observations about this horror. It's pretty obvious that most people referred to as ""informal advisers"" to campaigns don't do anything. Leibovich gets Charlie Black, who played this role for the Romney-Ryan campaign, to say so. ""I have the best job I've had in any election,"" says Black. ""I have no responsibilities. I am not accountable for anything."" Lots of people think that the ""hope and change"" Obama team sold out quickly; Robert Gibbs says so, admitting that ""Washington changed us."" It's all very depressing, and worse when Leibovich turns to the media. ""They are, by and large,"" he writes, ""a cohort that is predominately white and male and much younger than in the bygone days of pay-your-dues-on-the-city-desk-for-ten-years veterans for whom the elite political jobs were once reserved."" Refreshingly, he doesn't pretend that the bygone era was much better, or that its survivors are beyond lazy journalism. There is a theme, which only gets funnier with repetition, of how journalistic icons keep memorializing each other by saying their fallen comrades are ""asking God some tough questions"" or sitting ""in heaven's green room."" One of the best pithy discursions in the book comes when Leibovich traces how two idiotic, baseless rumors became stories, one about how Joe Biden might be dumped from the Obama ticket and one about how Mike Bloomberg and Joe Scarborough might run a third-party campaign. The respective stories started with respected reporters, Bob Woodward and Howard Fineman. In retrospect, Fineman admits his story was ""probably the ultimate example of the political-media complex flying up its own asshole."" The overall tone of This Town is hopelessness, which is probably why the only people who come off well here are the cynics. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is portrayed as an admirably charmless politician who ends phone calls without saying ""goodbye"" and leaves parties within 10 minutes of entering. When Leibovich visits his home in Nevada, Reid openly admits that he's only offering a drink because ""they said I'm supposed to."" Hillary Clinton comes off well, too. Many mags have already quoted what she said about the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I'll quote it again: ""Fuck the White House Correspondents' Dinner."" There's an even richer moment, though, when she arrives at a public memorial for Tim Russert and is stopped by a TV producer who decides, yes, this is the moment to Reach Out. ""It is a pleasure to meet you,"" says Clinton, smiling and walking on. Reading that, you realize that the Clintons, having slogged through politics for 40 years, realize just what they need from it and what they can avoid. And you assume that the poor (nameless, classless) producer on the other end of this turned out OK. After all, ""the life cycle of public disgrace had been reduced to almost nothing."""
