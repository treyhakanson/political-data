Gridlock and partisanship are the top reason Americans are so critical. But when you look at polls of public attitudes about Congress, the majority hold opinions that would do the least to change this situation they hate so much. People either want to split party control of Congress, which would perpetuate the current stagnation, or they don't think that a change in congressional control would change anything, which suggests they won't vote because they believe gridlock isn't going away, no matter who is in charge. In a recent Gallup poll, a combined 56 percent of registered voters held those views. In a recent CBS poll of registered voters, 43 percent agreed with the statement, ""It makes no real difference which party controls Congress, things go on just as they did before."" That's the highest percentage that has responded that way in a CBS poll. Among voters who are less enthusiastic about casting a ballot, 50 percent think it doesn't matter which party is at the helm. If shaking up things in Washington is all you care about, there is an obvious solution: Vote for a Republican Senate candidate near you. This is not a partisan or ideological pitch. It's simply the only available option this November for voters who are driven by their frustration with inaction. The House is going to stay in the GOP's hands, which means the two possible outcomes in November are that either things stay the same or Republicans take control of both houses of Congress. We know what the former produces: Bills that pass the House go nowhere in the Senate and vice versa. That is unlikely to change after the elections. The rut is pretty deep, and there would be no new political pressure to break either party out of it. The onset of presidential politics is likely to slow progress further. For some, this is a fine outcome. The American constitutional system is designed to be slow, frustrating, and seize up now and again. Change for change's sake is like driving off a bridge to get out of traffic; you're not stuck in traffic any more all right. If you're impatient, though, Republican control would likely give you the change you seek. That is what excites and terrifies partisans. The president will immediately have a harder time getting his nominations through the Senate. If a Supreme Court justice retires, it will lead to an epic confirmation battle. Right now Democrats in the Senate can investigate anything they like. So even if Congress is on course to be one of the least productive in history (based on the number of bills passed into law), Democratic senators can keep the pressure on polluters and low-cost housing landlords and at least raise awareness about the issues they care about. All of that goes away under Republican control when a new batch of committee chairmen schedule hearings devoted to conservative causes. Republican senators will also be able to join their House counterparts in launching investigations of the Obama administration. (Michael Tomasky has an exhaustive examination of the consequences, including ways in which the GOP could target the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.) For those who don't think much will change no matter who is in control, this won't sound like change. It's just the same partisan battle; the two sides are just switching positions. A more substantive change would come from Republicans having to prove that they can govern. For the moment, partisanship provides an excuse and impediment to action. House Republicans pass legislation, but their views never have to be sharpened or reconciled with those of their Senate colleagues. Control of both houses could force clarity in the GOP on issues like immigration, which leaders have ducked so far, claiming they didn't have a trusted partner in the president. That is a dodge to keep from starting a fight in the party over a contentious issue. When you control both houses, this kind of inaction can't be allowed if the goal is to be taken seriously as a governing party. Republicans would also have to provide more concrete votes on issues like health care, tax reform, and implementing portions of Rep. Paul Ryan's budget. Republican strategists know the GOP has to shake the ""Party of No"" label, which means producing actual accomplishments--that is, unless you want the governors in the GOP 2016 field using you as a foil. (Of course they're already doing that anyway). Republicans in the Senate face a terrible landscape in 2016 with 24 incumbents up for re-election. Many of them--such as Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin--will be in states where increased Democratic turnout in the presidential year will imperil their chances for re-election to the Senate. Those GOP senators can't run on having done nothing, and there will be pressure to pass legislation that will appeal to a broad swath of voters. There will also be pressure not to launch extended show trials that might make voters think the party is so obsessed with partisan point scoring that they don't have any answers to the problems that confront people in their daily lives. Perhaps the pressure on Republicans in the Senate will lead to legislation that the president, conscious of his legacy, can sign. The first easy score would be Trade Promotion Authority, which would give President Obama the tools to complete and sign trade agreements in Asia and Europe. That is a key domestic priority for the president because he believes it would boost the economy and assist his foreign policy, too. Democrats have blocked it. Education legislation promoting charter schools would pass. (It might even pass before November). And you could also imagine a pathway to immigration reform of some kind if those Republicans who think passing something in 2015 is key to the party's long-term survival came together with a president thinking about his legacy. Even if none of this comes to pass, and the president vetoes everything he is sent, and Democrats filibuster as their Republican colleagues did when they were in control, policy debates will still be sharper than the ones we have now. Both GOP houses will have produced legislative language, votes will have been taken, and all of this activity will clarify the lines of debate heading into the presidential election in 2016. At the moment, debates on policy take place without the reality-inducing legislative process. Simply introducing that would give voters clearer choices than they have now. That will not revolutionize governance, but given the two possible outcomes in November, if you're making your choice on what scenario might crack the peanut brittle casings of governance, Republican control of the Senate offers the best chance."

In Denver, home to the bulk of the first-in-the-nation retail stores, violent crime fell by 5.6 percent over the first four months of the year, with major property crimes down nearly twice that, according to the city's police. State coffers, meanwhile, are flush with tax revenues from the nearly $50 million worth of recreational weed that was sold through March, the last month for which official estimates are available. Those sales translate into $7.3 million for the state, a number that jumps to $12.6 million when you factor in medical marijuana and licensing fees. Lawmakers are already trying to figure out how to spend future revenues that are projected to reach $98 million this year alone. It's too soon, however, to call Colorado's measure an unqualified success. Officials had long warned of unforeseen problems once the retail stores opened their doors on Jan. 1, and such fears have proved legitimate thanks largely to how people are choosing to get high. So-called edibles are being blamed for an increase in the number of pot-related emergency room visits, including those from a half-dozen or so children who unknowingly ate pot-laced treats. The baked goods and candies also are believed to have played a role in two deaths in the past two months--providing opponents with front-page anecdotes that run counter to the cannabis-kills-no-one narrative long trumpeted by legalization advocates. A college student visiting from Wyoming jumped to his death from a Denver hotel balcony in March after consuming six times the recommended dose of a pot-infused cookie. The following month, a Denver man is believed to have shot and killed his wife after eating pot-laced candy, although police concede that he may have had other drugs in his system, too. Edibles aren't the only problem. Colorado authorities are also dealing with a rash of fiery house explosions caused by pot enthusiasts making THC-rich hash oil in their homes through a dangerous process that involves heavy amounts of butane, a highly flammable gas that can linger and ignite. Earlier this week in a suburb of Colorado Springs, firefighters responded to one such explosion at an apartment and found two adults and a 3-year-old child trapped inside. No one was injured, although the adults now face reckless endangerment charges in addition to child abuse and arson. It was a similar scene late last month in Jefferson County, where hash oil-making is believed to have caused a blast that destroyed a townhouse. All told, firefighters have responded to more than 30 such explosions this year already, roughly three times the number from all of last year, according to the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area agency. Regulators are already pursuing some obvious solutions. Lawmakers are considering legislation that would require edibles to be individually wrapped and labeled, both to give consumers a better idea of what they're getting themselves into and in hopes of keeping the treats out of the mouths of children. (Officials have already limited the amount of THC in edibles to 10 milligrams per serving, with the number of servings in a package likewise capped at 10--nice round numbers that, as Rolling Stone's Bruce Barcott has pointed out, suggest officials are guessing as to how much is too much at this point.) Stopping the meth lab-like house explosions may be harder, but one option that has been floated is a crackdown on the bulk sale of butane, much like the strict limits on over-the-counter cold medicines that are often the building blocks of meth production. Longer-term challenges will require more complicated fixes. Recreational weed comes with a hefty surcharge, including a 15 percent excise tax and a special 10 percent sales tax on top of the regular 2.9 percent one. As long as legal weed is more expensive than its tax-free illegal stuff, there will always be a black market. The trick for regulators is finding a tax-adjusted price that allows the state to bring in revenues while still keeping weed cheap enough where most people will be willing to pay the markup to keep things above board. So far, they appear to have found a sweet-enough spot, although that could change as the novelty of legal marijuana wears off and consumers' tastes change. Regulators must also find a solution to federal banking requirements that has pot shops operating like cash-only lemonade stands, and a way to make sure that small home-growing operations--legal under the law--don't flourish to the point where they fuel their own unregulated market. Many of these potential wrinkles hinge on the fact that officials simply don't yet have the data to tell what is a problem and what isn't. Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat who opposed the 2012 legalization initiative, has warned his fellow governors to wait and see before following Colorado's example. ""There are no long-term studies, and we're not screaming and crying alarm, but what I've told people is: You ought to wait a year or two,"" he said last month. ""Let's see whether we can keep it out of the hands of kids. Let's see that people aren't driving while high. [Let's] make sure there aren't unintended consequences."""

""Tea Party Challengers Fall Short in Primaries,"" reports USA Today. ""Republicans Keep Tea Party Wing at Bay in Primary Races,"" reports the Los Angeles Times. ""Tea Party Losses Tilt Republican Split to Business Gain,"" reports Bloomberg, confusingly. It's just more complicated than that. Mitch McConnell Didn't Win Easy ... On July 24, 2013, a businessman and novice candidate named Matt Bevin announced that he'd challenge Sen. Mitch McConnell in the Republican primary. Almost immediately, the polling group Wenzel Strategies returned from the field with numbers--McConnell was at 59 percent to Bevin's 20 percent. This represented more than double the biggest lead McConnell's old ally Trey Grayson ever posted over Sen. Rand Paul, when the libertarian Muad'Dib challenged Grayson and ""the establishment"" in 2010.* Tuesday night, after untold articles making fun of Bevin's slapstick campaign (it took him weeks--weeks--to give a straight answer on whether he endorsed legal cockfighting), and more articles analyzing McConnell's change-to-win victory plan, the Senate minority leader triumphed. He took 60 percent of the vote, no more than he'd been earning the day the primary began. A win is a win is a win, but that's remarkably weak. I can find no example of a modern-era Senate party leader--Harry Reid, Tom Daschle, Trent Lott, George Mitchell, and so on--facing a challenge like that. McConnell survived it by hiring Ron and Rand Paul's own campaign manager, who admitted on tape that he was ""holding [his] nose"" and working for McConnell until the Paul Restoration; he survived by spending at least $11 million. ... but ""the Tea Party"" Has Nothing Left to Run On. The defining theme of Bevin's campaign was a combination of fantasy and lying. McConnell, according to Bevin, was ""not a conservative"" and had done ""nothing"" to impede Barack Obama's march to socialism. According to the Senate Conservatives Fund, which Team McConnell has spent the past day mocking relentlessly, McConnell was a flat-out ""liberal."" Thirty-odd percent of Kentucky's Republican primary voters went along with this, but it was never credible.* Neither was the defeated and unlamented Rep. Steve Stockman's screeching insistence that Texas Sen. John Cornyn was a liberal. Among Stockman's evidence was Cornyn's mere 87 percent score from the Club for Growth and 86 percent score from Heritage Action. On Earth, primary voters viewed those as pretty good scores. There was absolutely zero consequence for McConnell and Cornyn backing a debt limit increase this year, as they had already done so in the past, and they had done nothing else to separate themselves from their base. Speaking of that: The Chamber of Commerce Can Win, but It Can't Influence. Credit where due: It took the Chamber of Commerce only four years and two election cycles to figure out that it could thwart unelectable conservatives in primaries if it spent some money. The resulting arms race has been costly--according to Politico, the cost of defending an incumbent Republican senator has risen from $1.1 million in 2002 to $2.8 million today. Yet in defeat, the Tea Party has changed what the GOP stands for. A Bush Republican in 2008 could get behind TARP, an auto bailout, immigration reform, and stimulus spending. These were all priorities supported by the chamber. Just this month, the chamber's president, Tom Donohue, warned Republicans that they ""shouldn't bother"" to field a 2016 candidate if they didn't join the chamber on immigration reform. Let's check--what do the candidates bailed out by the chamber think of immigration reform? Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson?"	Six Lessons From the Year's First Big Primary Night

The last time this happened, it was 1964 and the Republican presidential nominee--Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater--had pledged his opposition to the bulk of the Civil Rights Act, driving blacks out of the party just four years after they gave Richard Nixon a sizable minority in his presidential bid. Put another way, the last time Republicans were this unpopular with black Americans, their nominee had sided with white supremacists. Which is to say, the party has a serious image problem, to say nothing of an electoral one. If blacks were dispersed throughout the country, or concentrated in a handful of red and blue states--like Latinos and Asians--the GOP's disadvantage wouldn't mean much. But most blacks live in the South and the areas around it, which includes a large number who live in swing states--like Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, and Ohio--as well as potential swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. What's more, the huge Democratic advantage means that any black voter at the polls is a Democratic voter. In those states, as long as there's average or high turnout, black voters have an outsized effect on the popular vote. In 2012, for instance, Obama won several states by substituting new black voters for lost white ones. What's more, his popular vote margin in Ohio can be explained solely by higher black turnout. Imagine a world where Mitt Romney won the votes of 9 or 10 percent of black Americans, in line with the GOP's historic performance with blacks since 1964. In that world, given the geography of the black vote, there's a good chance Romney is president, having deprived Obama of needed votes in Ohio, Virginia, and Florida. For the GOP, then, African-American outreach is critical, and according to BuzzFeed's McKay Coppins, the Republican National Committee has developed a strategy for competing for the black vote: meeting with local black leaders, recruiting black politicians, and attacking black voices in media. If your reaction to the last item is a raised eyebrow, you're not alone. To rational ears, that sounds counterproductive. But the RNC believes it can work. To wit, after a dismissive tweet from Jamilah Lemieux, senior editor for Ebony, to Raffi Williams, a staffer with the RNC, Republicans escalated the online conflict, and Chairman Reince Priebus demanded an apology.

In it, President Obama (played by Peele) responds to his more populist liberal critics with a new hire, Luther, his ""anger translator"" (played by Key). When Obama says, ""I know a lot of folks say I haven't done a good job at communicating my accomplishments to the public,"" Luther translates with ""Because y'all don't listen!"" And when Obama says he wants Republicans to know his ""intentions are coming from the right place,"" Luther gives the real message, ""They're coming from Hawaii, which is where I'm from, which is in the United States of America, y'all. This is ridiculous. I have a birth certificate!"" The parallel isn't great--there's no visible anger, for one--but I can't help but think of this skit when I see Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, and their rhetoric on race and racism. Obama has said less on race than any other president, and when he does speak, he tends to aim for broad inclusivity. In his 2008 Philadelphia speech, given in the wake of the Jeremiah Wright controversy, he analogized the ""anger within the black community"" to the ""resentments"" in ""segments of white community,"" arguing against both as counterproductive, while urging listeners to recognize that they are ""grounded in legitimate concerns."" Likewise, in his remarks on the George Zimmerman verdict last year, he challenged Americans to ask themselves about their own lives. ""[A]m I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can? Am I judging people as much as I can based on not the color of their skin, but the content of their character?"" he said. In each case, he strives to speak to all Americans, reflecting politics--he doesn't want to alienate white people--as well as his own life and experiences. At the same time, in all of remarks on race, he leaves hints of a deeper, less conciliatory critique. His Philadelphia speech, for instance, includes a small section on the persistence and power of institutional racism:"	Eric Holder Talks About Racism the Way Obama Wishes He Could
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/georgia_s_republican_party_senate_primary_karen_handel_jack_kingston_and.html	"KENNESAW, Georgia--The last great public battle between the Tea Party and the Republican establishment happened a few hours away from here, right over the Georgia-Florida border. One month ago, the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership decamped to Amelia Island for its annual retreat. Tea Party activists, furious at the presence of Republican leaders like Rep. Eric Cantor, followed them down. Gadsden-flag-wavers from northeast Florida and southeast Georgia gathered outside the meeting to shame them. ""We surrounded the place,"" remembers William Temple. ""Over the whole weekend they had to look out of their windows at rattlesnake flags!"" Eventually, the scene irritated former Rep. Steve LaTourette so much that the RMSP's president stormed outside to get in Temple's face. His might be the most famous citizen face in the Tea Party. Temple, a pastor in Brunswick, Georgia, shows up to an unbelievable number of conservative events in full Revolutionary War garb. A reporter searching for a generic photo of a ""Tea Partier"" usually plumps for one of Temple, waving his flag and bellowing ""huzzah"" after a Michele Bachmann zinger. ""So am I a traitor?"" LaTourette asked Temple. ""Am I a traitor?"" ""I told him, if you're supporting this PAC, you're a traitor,"" remembers Temple. ""We've got all your faces. We know who you all are."" But the Georgia Tea Party doesn't know who its Senate candidate is. Last year, as soon as Sen. Saxby Chambliss announced his retirement, conservatives saw a chance to replace a deal-cutting, TARP-supporting Republican with one of their own. Georgia had produced William Temple, Tea Party Patriots, and the entire political career of Herman Cain--why shouldn't it have a Tea Party senator? What did it matter if the Democratic nominee, Michelle Nunn, was polling unusually well? Rep. Paul Broun, who describes himself as being ""Tea Party before there was a Tea Party,"" jumped into the race. So did Rep. Phil Gingrey, a reliable vote against any compromise in the House and a reliable sponsor of anti-Obamacare legislation. Both have faded in the stretch. In the campaign's final week, Broun and Gingrey are burning their cash on TV ads and making appearances at friendly venues. Democrats, who had hoped to see one of them make the July runoff, now concede that the first round of the race will come down to 20-year Rep. Jack Kingston, wealthy businessman David Perdue, and former Secretary of State Karen Handel. Gingrey is closing by accusing Handel of ""promoting teenage homosexuality"" in her days as chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners. Broun is going out with a playlist of everything he's failed to achieve since coming to Congress in 2007. At a Tuesday night meeting of the Canton Tea Party, Broun waved his pocket Constitution in the air and declared that he only put it down when he was ""in the shower."" ""Let's close down the Department of Education and get rid of Common Core once and for all,"" said Broun. ""And while we're closin' down things, y'all, let's close down the EPA also. We've got to get the heavy boot of the EPA off of our economy. And while we're shutting down things, y'all, let's shut down the IRS also!"" Broun and Gingrey have their adherents, and some loyalty in the districts they've represented since 2007 and 2003. After a Republican Party dinner in Rome, Georgia--Handel was there, and Kingston sent his son John as a surrogate--local activist Mickey Tuck said he was sticking with Broun as long as he could. ""I'm kind of a Republican-leaning, libertarian--stand with Rand,"" said Tuck. ""Broun's always been voting conservative. The other two congressmen changed their votes once they started running this year."" That's the important part of the Broun/Gingrey fade--their politics have been passed on to the front-runners, who were plenty conservative to start with. It hasn't even been four years since Republicans won the House and conservatives lobbied for Kingston to take over the Appropriations Committee on the theory that he'd be a reliable spending-slasher. It was just two years ago that Handel resigned from Susan G. Komen for the Cure after she'd cut the group's ties to Planned Parenthood and progressives rose up in a fury. David Perdue? On Friday, Herman Cain used his radio show to declare (in the third person, as is his wont) that Perdue ""looks like a mirror image of Herman Cain."" The front-runners, bereft of true ideological differences, are closing out the race with appeals to different cultures. Each is traversing the state's population centers in a campaign bus, packing in as many meet-and-greets as they can stand. Handel started her tour on Tuesday, at a diner in the north Atlanta suburb of Roswell. As they shuffled in and ordered coffee, Handel's supporters could grab fliers that portrayed her congressional opponents as incompetent frauds and Perdue as an ""elitist."" It had been more than a month since Perdue had dismissed Handel as a ""high school graduate,"" less able to understand the complexities of government than a world-traveler like him. It had been more than a month since he apologized. Handel kept battering him with the quote anyway. ""I'm proud of the fact that I was able to overcome long odds,"" said Handel. ""I'm proud of the fact that a lot of Georgians did the same thing."" As she talked, a supporter pointed out to me that 58 percent of Georgians lacked college degrees. ""If we don't win in November--or we win with another go-along-to-get-along, or an elitist establishment type--we haven't accomplished a thing,"" said Handel. ""Who's gonna take it to Michelle Nunn, y'all? We know we need to cut the spending. We know we need to get the economy going by cutting taxes and cutting regulation."" After a short speech, Handel stuck around the diner to talk to explain why her story made her electable, and her rivals' ""elitism"" would lead to doom. ""Look at the headlines that they've already generated,"" she said. ""Jack Kingston: Poor children should sweep the floor. Look at the narrative around David Perdue: His disdain for people who don't have a college degree and haven't been overseas, that they aren't smart enough. Gingrey, Broun ..."" She paused and laughed. ""Do I need to go into that?"" She really didn't. Later that day, more than 100 miles down the road, Perdue's bus pulled into the parking lot of Jackson's, a seafood restaurant just across the water from a coal plant that--as several patrons pointed out--was being shut down by the EPA. He worked the room as his potential voters snacked on ceviche and mussels, then he paused for a short, relatable speech. ""How many of you know someone who's out of work?"" he asked. His hand went up--so did most everyone else's. ""I'll tell ya, it's a problem. One out of five Americans is unemployed or underemployed. You go to Atlanta, you don't see it, but you go around the state and you see it a lot."" After the speech, Perdue strolled over to the reporter in the room to rebut the latest charges against him. He didn't favor tax hikes; he'd been telling the newspaper in Macon that he favored ""revenue,"" and politicians misunderstood him. He wasn't an elitist. ""We could retire four career politicians in this race,"" he said. ""The federal reserve has put several trillion dollars into the economy and the economy's really not growing,"" he said. But the ""high school degree"" story has been hard to erase. Candidates like Perdue or Cain happily rip into ""politicians"" as know-nothings and meddlers. Whenever Perdue talked about those politicians, he couldn't help but point out that they weren't that smart.  ""You have people in political leadership who don't have a lot of experience in the free enterprise system,"" he said. Could Georgia's coasts withstand climate change? Sure, the right people could figure it out. Alas: ""The EPA is really overreaching and damaging entire industries. We've got to get some common sense back in Washington--in science, there's an active debate going on."" Back in the Atlanta suburbs, in the downtown plaza of Douglassville, Jack Kingston was taking an even softer tone. His pitch, in ads and in person, was that he was incredibly, personally thrifty. He rode to events in a Buick Roadmaster with 279,000 miles on the speedometer and a paint job chipping like some ancient church fresco. Some campaign aides followed in an RV, but it was the Roadmaster that voters recognized from TV. ""I'm the only one in this race who's cut the budget,"" said Kingston to a few dozen assembled voters and dignitaries. He didn't say much more about what he'd cut. Kingston huddled for a little while with Terry Baggett, a retired air force colonel who wanted Kingston to keep funding the A-10 Thunderbolt. It was an old, ""tank-killing"" plane, one that the Obama administration had put on the block to save money, but the veteran didn't want to see it go. ""I've represented five out of our eight military installations,"" Kingston told the crowd. ""I don't ever want America's service men and women to have to fight a fair fight. I want them to be the best trained and best equipped so that they can go to any place and we know what the outcome will be."" Kingston wasn't running as moderate. No one was. He had the Chamber of Commerce behind him, which made it impossible for him to run as ""the Tea Party candidate,"" but even William Temple said he could support Kingston in the fall. Kingston, like the rest of this year's ""establishment"" candidates, was running as far to the right as he could. He just wasn't going to give Democrats as much to work with as poor Paul Broun or Phil Gingrey. The Democrats had not given up hope. Wherever he traveled, Kingston was trailed by liberal video trackers--an honor not given to Broun or Gingrey or Handel. ""They're with Morning Joe,"" said Kingston, pointing at an NBC crew who'd followed him to Douglassville. He pointed at the trackers. ""They're with George Soros."" As Kingston walked the plaza, a towering volunteer in brown cowboy boots hoisted a KINGSTON sign. The trackers moved, and he moved his sign in front of them. ""Ever play cat-and-mouse?"" he asked a former local GOP chairman who was watching the dance. After the meet-and-greet, Kingston ducked inside city hall for an interview. The tracker was blocked at the door; the aide and the former chairman exchanged a quick high-five."	Georgia's GOP Senate Candidates Are Racing Each Other to the Far Right
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/ag_gag_laws_idaho_is_criminalizing_muckraking_to_protect_farmers.html	"Over several weeks in 2012, an animal rights activist secretly filmed workers at an Idaho dairy farm kicking and punching cows in the head, jumping up and down on their backs, sexually abusing one, and dragging another behind a tractor by its neck. The Mercy for Animals-made video--one of roughly 80 that activists say they've recorded over the past decade--prompted the owners of Bettencourt Dairies to fire five workers and install cameras in their barns to prevent future abuses. A police investigation, meanwhile, ended with three of the fired employees charged with animal cruelty. It was a clear victory for those groups that have made it their mission to expose animal cruelty and criminal wrongdoing on modern American farms. It will also be their last, if the agriculture industry and its allies in state government have their way. Earlier this year, Idaho became at least the seventh state to pass a law aimed specifically at thwarting such undercover investigations, and roughly a dozen similar bills are currently winding their way through statehouses around the country. While the specifics vary, so-called ag-gag laws generally make it illegal to covertly record animal abuse on farms, or to lie about any ties to animal rights groups or news organizations when applying for a farm job. Idaho's law is the strictest of those currently on the books. It threatens muckrakers with up to a year in jail and fines up to $5,000--a sentence, it should be noted, that's the same as what someone convicted of animal abuse faces. The laws specifically target animal rights groups like the Humane Society of the United States, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and similar organizations that have increasingly turned to clandestine video in their battle with Big Ag. But the way many of the laws are tailored, they also could ensnare journalists, whistleblowers, and even unions in their legal net, in the process raising serious concerns about the legal impact on everything from free speech to food safety. A wide-ranging coalition of organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Food Safety, has joined animal rights groups in challenging the Idaho law, along with a similar one in Utah, in federal court. The lawsuits also have the backing of the Government Accountability Project, the AFL-CIO, and a host of media organizations, including NPR. ""They can dress these laws up however they want, but ultimately the rationale here is pretty clearly self-interest on the part of the industry,"" says Michael McFadden, the general counsel at Farm Forward, an advocacy group that's leading the charge against such laws. The industry and their statehouse allies don't necessarily disagree. State Sen. Jim Patrick, a lead sponsor of the Idaho legislation and a farmer himself, explained the rationale behind his bill: ""It's not designed to cover up animal cruelty, but we have to defend ourselves."" The way Patrick and his like-minded colleagues see things, farmers in their state are under attack by activists who will stop at nothing to paint what happens on factory farms in the worst possible light. ""Terrorism has been used by enemies for centuries to destroy the ability to produce food and the confidence in food safety,"" the Idaho Republican told his fellow lawmakers while advocating for his bill several months ago. He struck a similar note during our conversation, comparing groups like Mercy for Animals, which has made a name for itself legally capturing wrongdoing on camera, with more extreme groups like the Earth Liberation Front, an eco-terrorist organization known for setting fire to ski resorts and lumber mills. Farmers and their allies are quick to brush off the unsanctioned animal rights investigations as craven attempts to manipulate the public and undermine the meat and dairy industry as a whole. ""Their goal wasn't to protect the animals,"" Patrick said of the Mercy for Animals investigation at Bettencourt. ""Their goal was to put the farmer, or in this case the dairyman, out of business."" That, the activists admit, is largely true. After investigations uncover inhumane or illegal practices on big farms, the groups have a history of applying public pressure to any corporation it can tie to that particular farm. In the case of the Idaho dairy, Mercy for Animals publicized an indirect link to Burger King--complete with a still-active webpage, BurgerKingCruelty.com--and successfully pressed the fast-food giant to stop topping its burgers with cheese made from the dairy's milk. While that didn't put Bettencourt, one of the nation's largest dairies, out of business, it certainly hurt its bottom line. The industry concedes that abuses do happen on farms--how could it not when there is video evidence one Google search away?--but largely dismisses them as the work of bad actors that are the exception to the industry rule. The industry says reporters and the public are welcome behind closed barn doors--just as long as farmers are there to give context and explain the unsightly details. ""We have no intent to stop journalists, but we do want them to ask permission first,"" Patrick said, noting that he and his colleagues intentionally left their law as broad as they could. There are plenty of problems with that logic as far as the public good is concerned. For starters, Upton Sinclair didn't rely on official tours of Chicago's slaughterhouses before sitting down to write The Jungle, the 1906 novel that was based on his undercover trips into meatpacking facilities and a work that is widely credited with driving widespread regulatory reform. Likewise for the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting of the New York Times' Michael Moss, who used confidential company records in 2009 to raise questions about the effectiveness of injecting ammonia into beef to remove E. coli. The AFL-CIO warns that the effort could have a chilling effect on unions by making it more difficult for undercover organizers to land positions at companies where they are unwelcome, a practice known as ""salting."" Ditto for whistleblowers, who in theory could be charged under the law if they were to record evidence to back up their allegations, according to the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower protection and advocacy organization. State lawmakers behind the efforts often voice fears that activists could easily stage abuse where there is none, leaving farmers convicted in the court of public opinion without a chance to defend themselves--although Patrick couldn't cite any examples of that ever happening. There's also the arguably more pressing matter of the laws' main target: camera-toting activists on farm factory floors. While the industry might not like what it sees in the videos, it can't make a convincing case that the footage has no value. In the last three years alone, activists have taped stable workers in Tennessee illegally burning the ankles of horses with chemicals, employees in Wyoming kicking pigs and flinging piglets into the air, and farmhands in Iowa burning and snapping off the beaks of young chickens. Those actions went undiscovered, or at least unreported, by the farm owners and government regulators before they were caught on camera by muckraking activists. What they capture on film can go far beyond animal cruelty, too. The footage is capable of shifting the debate from one about the welfare of livestock to that of humans, a topic much more likely to hit home with consumers. The most damning investigation in the past decade occurred in Southern California, where an undercover Humane Society operative caught workers illegally pushing so-called downer cows, those cattle that are too sick or weak to stand on their own, to slaughter with the help of chains, forklifts, and high-pressure water hoses at the Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has deemed those cows potential carriers of mad cow disease, salmonella, and E. coli. As a result, the video prompted the recall of 143 million pounds of beef--the largest meat recall in U.S. history--large portions of which were destined for school lunch programs and fast-food restaurants. That investigation would have likely never happened if laws like Idaho's had been on the books in California. Both sides are set to get their day in court later this summer when a federal judge hears the suit against the Idaho law. But even if the law is ultimately struck down, the fight will continue. ""If it fails, we'll revise it,"" Patrick said. ""I know we did the right thing."""	Why Do American Farmers Need Some of the Strongest Anti-Whistleblower Laws in the Land?

Board of Education, the landmark case where a unanimous Supreme Court held that ""separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."" The following year the justices ordered that states end school segregation with ""all deliberate speed."" In the popular narrative, this is the beginning of American integration, a process that goes from Rosa Parks to Martin Luther King to the Civil Rights Act and eventually to President Obama. But for as much as we share an integrated culture, millions of Americans--and blacks in particular--live in segregated worlds, a fact illustrated by the persistence and retrenchment of school segregation, as detailed in a new report from the Civil Rights Project at the University of California-Los Angeles. Before considering the report, it's worth taking a closer look at the process of school desegregation. Almost immediately after Brown, white Southerners met the decision with ""massive resistance."" In Virginia, segregationist Democrats pushed sweeping educational changes to combat integration. In 1956, the Commission on Public Education--convened by Gov. Thomas Stanley--asked the General Assembly to repeal compulsory education, empower the governor to close public schools, and provide vouchers to parents to enroll their children in segregated private schools. In the next few years, whites would open ""segregation academies"" across the state, while closing public schools to block integration. Following Stanley's lead, whites across the South worked to keep blacks out of their schools with rules, legislation, angry mobs, and outright violence. But it failed. Within the decade, new civil rights laws had enhanced federal power. By the end of the 1960s, the federal government was authorized to file suit against segregated school districts and work to dismantle them ""root and branch."" As Nikole Hannah-Jones details for ProPublica, federal desegregation orders helped ""break the back of Jim Crow education in the South, helping transform the region's educational systems into the most integrated in the country."" She continues, ""In 1963, about 1 percent of black children in the South attended school with white children. By the early 1970s, the South had been remade--fully 90 percent of black children attended desegregated schools."" The problem today is that these gains are reversing. As the Civil Rights Project shows, minority students across the country are more likely to attend majority-minority schools than they were a generation ago. The average white student, for instance, attends a school that's 73 percent white, 8 percent black, 12 percent Latino, and 4 percent Asian-American. By contrast, the average black student attends a school that's 49 percent black, 17 percent Latino, 4 percent Asian-American, and 28 percent white. And the average Latino student attends a school that's 57 percent Latino, 11 percent black, 25 percent white, and 5 percent Asian-American. But this understates the extent to which minority students--and again blacks in particular--attend hyper-segregated schools. In 2011, more than 40 percent of black students attended schools that were 90 percent minority or more. That marks an increase over previous years. In 1991, just 35 percent of black students attended schools with such high levels of segregation. Even more striking is the regional variation. While hyper-segregation has increased across the board, it comes after staggering declines in the South, the ""border states""--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri, i.e., former slaveholding states that never joined the Confederacy--the Midwest, and the West. In the Northeast, however, school segregation has increased, going from 42.7 percent in 1968 to 51.4 percent in 2011. Or, put another way, desegregation never happened in the schools of the urban North. Today in New York, for instance, 64.6 percent of black students attend hyper-segregated schools. In New Jersey, it's 48.5 percent and in Pennsylvania it's 46 percent. They're joined by Illinois (61.3 percent), Maryland (53.1 percent), and Michigan (50.4 percent). And these schools are distinctive in another way: More than half have poverty rates above 90 percent. By contrast, just 1.9 percent of schools serving whites and Asians are similarly impoverished. It's this poverty and segregation that leads to other, more dramatic problems. As shown in a report from the Journey for Justice Alliance, these schools are understaffed, under-resourced, and most likely to face closure. Indeed, of the schools closed by shrinking budgets and ""charter-ization,"" the vast majority are in communities of color, even as the geography of school dysfunction includes predominantly white areas. But while we've moved backward, Brown wasn't a failure. For minority students in general, there's more exposure to each other--and to whites--than there's been in the past. And for black students in particular, there's much greater integration in almost every region of the country. ""Outside of the Northeast,"" notes the Civil Rights Project, ""the share of black students in more than 90 percent minority schools remains lower in 2011 than in 1968, even with the reversals of civil rights gains in recent decades."" What's more, states like Virginia and Louisiana--once at the forefront of opposition to desegregation--are now among the most integrated for black students. At the same time, the backlash to civil rights has taken its toll, as has American complacency and a pervasive belief in ""colorblindness."" ""With increasing frequency,"" writes Nikole Hannah-Jones, ""federal judges are releasing districts from court oversight even where segregation prevails, at times taking the lack of action in cases as evidence that the problems have been resolved."" Likewise, the highest courts have all but prohibited school districts and elected officials from considering race to balance school enrollments. ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,"" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in 2007, striking a Seattle plan for racial diversity in its schools. School segregation doesn't happen by accident; it flows inexorably from housing segregation. If most black Americans live near other blacks and in a level of neighborhood poverty unseen by the vast majority of white Americans, then in the same way, their children attend schools that are poorer and more segregated than anything experienced by their white peers. We could fix this. If the only way to solve the problem of school segregation is to tackle housing, then we could commit to a national assault on concentrated poverty, entrenched segregation, and housing discrimination. We could mirror our decades of suburban investment with equal investment to our cities, with better transportation and more ways for families to find affordable housing. And we could do all of this with an eye toward racism--a recognition of our role in creating the conditions for hyper-segregation. To do this, however, requires a commitment to anti-racism in thought, word, and deed. And given our high national tolerance for racial inequality, I doubt we'll rise to the challenge."	Why American Schools Are Becoming Segregated Once Again
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/marco_rubio_george_w_bush_and_deficits_why_republicans_may_return_to_the.html	"Marco Rubio doesn't care about deficits. Sure, the Republican Florida senator says he does, and--in his address to the National Press Club on Tuesday--he stressed his belief in fiscal responsibility. ""[A]n agenda that cuts government spending and spurs economic growth is the single most important step toward stabilizing the three legs of the retirement stool,"" he said. At the same time, his main proposal was a tax cut. To help Americans save for retirement, Rubio wants to slash the Social Security payroll tax for all individuals who reach retirement age and expand the federal Thrift Savings Plan--along with its tax benefits--to Americans without an employer-sponsored 401(k). And this is on top of his general support for across-the-board tax cuts, including cuts to corporate taxes and taxes on investment income. In addition, as he said earlier this year, Rubio wants to reform anti-poverty programs by funding relocation programs--so individuals could find jobs in other areas--and a ""federal wage enhancement"" for qualifying low-wage jobs. Put simply, after four years of pushing the austerity budgets of the Tea Party, Rubio--who is running for the Republican presidential nomination--is calling for low taxes and new spending, with little concern for the deficit. As a message to the Republican base, which hates new spending, it's a loser. But as a message for the general election, it's perfect and proven. Before there was a Tea Party, there was George W. Bush, and as president he wasn't overly concerned with squaring the circle of his priorities. Bush's playbook for policymaking was straightforward. Rhetorically, he would commit himself to reducing the debt and putting the United States on firm fiscal footing without ""balancing the budget on the backs of the poor."" In practice, he ignored the budget altogether. Within three years of his election, the ""fiscally conservative"" George Bush--who during the 2000 campaign, said, ""If Gore gets elected, the era of big government being over is over""--had charged tax cuts, wars, and the Medicare prescription drug benefit to the nation's credit card, spending trillions without a dime in new revenue. That was irresponsible. But politically, it worked. Republicans talk about deficit reduction, but what they want are tax cuts, and it's incredibly difficult to reconcile the two. By definition, cutting taxes adds to the deficit. The only way to stop that is to also cut spending. But if like Bush you've committed to higher military spending and new programs for the elderly, your only choice is to slash everything else. In other words, you have to follow some version of Rep. Paul Ryan's budget, which eviscerates the social safety net to pay for tax cuts and defense spending. Of course, the Ryan budget is unpopular. Voters hate debt, but they love spending and oppose cuts to existing programs. In a national environment, there's little to gain from a plan that destroys food stamps and unemployment insurance to pay for low taxes on dividends and capital gains. And so, like Captain Kirk and the Kobayashi Maru, Bush changed the parameters. He would cut taxes, pass new programs, and forget about the deficit. No, nothing was paid for, but with $2 trillion in tax cuts, Republicans didn't care. All of that changed with the election of Barack Obama. Once again, the GOP raged against spending, only this time it adopted an extreme austerity agenda of spending caps and balanced budgets, even as the economy sputtered through a slow recovery, starved for stimulus and demand. That worked well enough in the midterm elections. It was disastrous in 2012, when Democrats hammered the GOP with economic populism and denounced Mitt Romney as a heartless plutocrat. Now, with 2016 on the horizon--and as Democrats sharpen their populist message for this year's elections--the Republican Party is trying to switch gears and soften its message. So far, this has meant a lot of words about poverty--""I want to figure out a way for conservatives to come up with solutions to poverty. ... I have to do this,"" said Ryan during his ""listening tour"" of inner-city neighborhoods--without any policy changes. Which, while frustrating, is understandable. Unless they abandon the commitment to balanced budgets and deficit reduction, neither Ryan nor Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz can offer reform as well as tax cuts. By borrowing from Bush, Rubio offers a way forward. Republicans can have their tax cuts--and avoid the political peril of slashing the welfare state--if they give up on deficit reduction. Yes, it might anger the GOP base. But if debt complacency brings electoral victory--if President Rubio begins 2017 with a large tax cut and an expansion of the earned income tax credit--the base will manage, more pleased by a Republican president than angered by new deficits. In other words, Republicans will thrive--and avoid the policy traps of the Obama years--if they discover, again, that ""Reagan proved that deficits don't matter."""	Why Republicans May Be Destined to Return to George W. Bush's Economic Policies
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/ben_sasse_may_be_the_next_ted_cruz_the_senate_candidate_leads_in_the_nebraska.html	"If you believe the polls, Nebraska's next senator will be a health care consultant and university president who recently described himself as a ""nerd"" and an ""autodidact."" He did not say that to a Republican crowd. He said that to a room full of intellectuals, or people paying to look like intellectuals at TEDxOmaha. Yet the nerd in question, Ben Sasse, will likely win today's three-way Republican primary as the candidate of the populist right--of Sarah Palin, of Sen. Ted Cruz, of the National Review, of the Tea Party Express. He won them over by holding town halls where, standing beside a stacked-up copy of the Affordable Care Act, he would wonk out for hours and shame Republicans who couldn't offer their own, credible Obamacare alternatives. Sure, the law was doomed, but his party had to explain why. ""We're setting the rates for tens of thousands of things, and we know this doesn't work,"" Sasse told me last year. ""I think the numbers are: Medicare is setting payment rates for like 11,000 drugs and procedures, crosswalked by 100 different geographies, whatever that math comes out to. It isn't workable. You ultimately are going to have cost control in this system."" The easy read on Nebraska's primary is that it will test the already tired theme of the ""Tea Party versus the establishment."" That's not quite true. Sasse is a veteran of the establishment who masterfully ingratiated himself with the conservative movement. He did so by appealing to them personally, by seeking out media to tell his story, and by acing the interviews that major endorsers demand of their candidates. ""We talked to all the candidates in Nebraska,"" says Sal Russo, the Republican consultant who co-founded Tea Party Express. Shane Osborn, the one-term state treasurer who had led the early polls, didn't seem terrible. After all, he was a fan of Jack Kemp; he'd briefly been imprisoned by the Chinese in 2001, after crashing a spy plane. ""But Sasse had a stronger campaign organization, and we're looking for people that can put together viable political campaigns. This is not 2010, when we thought it was important to take a stand and reflect the disappointment people had with both parties. We need viable candidates now."" Sasse became viable the old-fashioned way--by lapping his opponents in fundraising. He'd never run for office before, but he easily out-raised Osborn, and raised twice as much as Omaha banker Sid Dinsdale. (Dinsdale papered over the gap by moving $1 million from his wallet to his campaign.) The word went out early that the 42-year old wonk was going to be a new Ted Cruz. That was very specific praise. Cruz, however he's viewed by the press and the left, was seen by the Tea Party as a generational talent with an unmatched intellectual command of the Constitution and the law. And so, 11 months before the primary, right after Republican Sen. Mike Johanns announced his retirement, Sasse was profiled glowingly in the Weekly Standard. Reporting from Fremont, Nebraska, where Sasse ran Midland University, Mark Hemingway declared that the candidate had ""reinvented the higher education wheel"" and created ""the best of all worlds"" with McKinsey-esque metrics and standards. (That was also the subject of his TED talk.) Next came the Tea Party taste-makers. Nebraska was a gimme race--serious Democrats had been obliterated in 2008 and 2012 open-seat runs, and no one with a future was going to run in a midterm year. Republicans could nominate the most conservative candidate possible, so Sasse and Osborn presented themselves that way to endorsers. Sasse cut a few straight-to-camera videos in which he dared Republicans to ""show some actual leadership."" Endorsers like that sort of thing. The Senate Conservatives Fund, founded by former Sen. Jim DeMint to aid insurgents in primaries, backed Sasse in October 2013; the Club for Growth backed Sasse in early November 2013. But the endorsement process degenerated rather quickly into farce. Later in November, when Sasse met with Sen. Mitch McConnell, the GOP minority leader attacked him for cutting the ""leadership"" video and accepting support from a group--the Senate Conservatives Fund--that was funding a Kentucky primary challenger. Here's the irony, one that will run through modern conservative politics for years to come. The McConnell spat probably helped Sasse. In January, the candidate earned a cover story in National Review, labeling him ""Obamacare's Nebraska Nemesis."" Sasse liked it so much that he ran a TV ad with the cover image, even re-enacting the photo shoot. His opponents decided to attack his strength. Hadn't Sasse presided over the birth of Medicare Part D? Hadn't he been paid to talk about Obamacare since it was implemented? And hadn't he once called Obamacare an ""important first step"" in the takeover of health care? ""He supports the basic principles of Obamacare,"" wrote FreedomWorks's Dean Clancy in March 2014. FreedomWorks had endorsed Osborn, and was increasingly looking isolated. ""Universal coverage, individual mandate, premium support--he just wants it to be less complicated, less top-down, more efficient , and presumably more patient-friendly... I think he's a Mitt Romney-style technocrat masquerading as an anti-Obamacare firebrand for temporary political purposes."" The attacks never connected. The ""important first step"" quote, which Osborn and Dinsdale used to batter Sasse, was ripped from a blander, nerdier speech. ""Ultimately,"" Sasse had said in 2010, ""what we passed in March is an important first step on thinking about the coverage problem in the American health care system."" The attack was so obviously flawed that Sasse's hometown newspaper called on the rival campaigns to stop bowdlerizing it. That didn't work, but the sense that Sasse was being attacked by ""the establishment"" absolutely did. On March 4, Utah Sen. Mike Lee endorsed Sasse. On March 28, FreedomWorks announced that it had bailed on Osborn and endorsed Sasse. ""It is clear that Shane Osborn formed allegiances with Mitch McConnell and the K Street lobbying class,"" FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe explained. Dean Clancy quit the organization, and has not responded to any questions since then. Later, when a Daily Caller reporter followed up, Kibbe explained that his new candidate was ""organizing around the grassroots, around the kinds of senators like Mike Lee and Ted Cruz who I have a lot of respect for."" Nothing had come out to peg Osborn as a ""moderate."" Nothing suggested he'd be less conservative than Sasse. The movement turned on him anyway, and the nadir of this probably occurred when the candidates appeared back to back on the April 17 episode of Glenn Beck's talk show. Beck, who is paid by FreedomWorks for promotional work, gave Osborn all the rope he needed to hang himself. ""Karl Rove helped Sasse raise money,"" snarled Osborn, after being asked whether he was the Rove candidate. ""It's Michael Bloomberg's TV team that's getting behind Sasse."" ""You're not in unfriendly territory,"" interrupted Beck. ""Do you realize that?"" Osborn recovered slightly, pointing out that he was a combat veteran and Sasse wasn't. ""John McCain?"" asked Beck rhetorically. ""Enough John McCain."" Then came the tailspin. Osborn mentioned that he'd be hosting a tele-townhall with Grover Norquist. The video feed of Beck's show captured the host in something between a snarl and a gasp. When the candidate signed off, Beck's zoo crew made fun of how he'd mispronounced Norquist's name--Nord-quist--as the host pronounced the Americans for Tax Reform president as a ""very dangerous, bad, bad guy."" Sasse was up next. Beck asked him whether all his educational experience would turn him into a Senate know-it all. ""That's the right kind of skeptical question our founders would relate to,"" said Sasse. Interviews like this weren't what took Sasse from 5 percent to first place. Gaffe-free months of fundraising and campaigning did that. The anti-establishment posture just made him impossible to stop. By the final weekend, the only possible threat to a Sasse win was a late surge by Dinsdale, the colorless Omaha banker who'd stayed out of the establishment/Tea Party proxy wars and scored some newspaper endorsements. Sasse's endorsers, starting with the Club for Growth, responded with a TV ad blitz. The smart guy, the one they'd turned into their avatar, needed to win this one."	Is Nebraska About to Create the Next Ted Cruz?
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/michael_boggs_judicial_nomination_president_obama_shouldn_t_nominate_judges.html	"During his time in the Georgia state house, Michael Boggs targeted abortion rights, voted to keep the Confederate battle emblem on the state flag, and defended discrimination against same-sex couples as ""premised on good Christian values."" But, thanks to an agreement between the White House and Georgia's Republican senators--Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson--he's now one of two judicial nominees expected to come to the Senate on Tuesday. Liberal groups like NARAL Pro-Choice America aren't happy, and they're right; there's no reason a Democratic president should nominate a reactionary to the federal judiciary, even if he's better than the alternatives--it feels like a betrayal. With that said, it's important to understand how we got to a place where a liberal president is backing a revanchist conservative to a lifetime position on the federal bench. For the last five years, a combination of Republican obstruction and White House neglect has left the federal judiciary with a record number of vacancies. With the end of the filibuster on judicial nominees other than Supreme Court judges, however, one part of the problem was solved: Republicans had fewer avenues for hindering the process. But there were still obstacles, and at least one of them was built by the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy. Under his tenure, the Judiciary Committee has made unusual use of the blue-slip, a Senate tradition that, in Leahy's words, allows the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman to ""solicit views of home state senators when someone is nominated to be a judge in their state."" For Leahy, a negative blue-slip means the nominee is verboten, even if the other senator has given her consent to the nomination. And in that way, it's become a wide backdoor for Republican obstruction. It should be said that, in its original use, the blue-slip was a simple note on the acceptability of the nominee. But, as traditions are wont to do, its role changed with the circumstances. Under Mississippi Sen. James Eastland, for example, it became a tool for Southern Democrats desperate to keep pro-Brown judges from the courts. Indeed, during Eastland's tenure as committee chairman any blue-slip in opposition to a nominee was an automatic veto. After Eastland's retirement in 1978, subsequent chairs abandoned the practice of an automatic veto, giving weight to the blue-slip--""one negative blue-slip would be 'a significant factor to be weighed,' "" said then-Sen. Joe Biden when he led the committee--but treating it as a recommendation, not a final judgment. Still, the general practice was that one positive blue-slip was needed for a nominee to move forward. That changed in 1995 when Republicans took the Senate. Eager to stymie the Clinton administration, Republicans required two blue-slips for a nominee to go forward, which made it easier to kill Clinton's nominees. With the election of George W. Bush, however, Republicans reverted to the one-slip rule, in order to expedite the process. It flipped again in 2001 after Sen. Jim Jeffords defected from the GOP caucus, giving Democrats control of the Senate, and then again in 2003, when Republicans won the chamber and announced a zero blue-slip rule, allowing hearings on nominees even if there wasn't a note in favor of the candidate. It's in response to this that Leahy restored the two blue-slip rule when Democrats took the Senate in 2006 and he became chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Yes, the single-senator veto slows the pace of nominations, but, he argues, it's more consistent than the haphazard approach of the past. The problem, of course, is that it empowers Republican obstruction and gives substantial leverage to GOP senators, hence the nomination of Michael Boggs. In return for nominating Judge Julie Carnes to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and giving Boggs (and two other Republican-picked attorneys) a place on the Northern District Court of Georgia, Sens. Chambliss and Isakson would end a more than two-year hold on Jill Pryor's nomination to the 11th Circuit. Even with Boggs' admirable work on Georgia's Special Council for Criminal Justice Reform, this is a terrible deal. If it goes through, Republicans get four lifetime appointments to the federal judiciary, putting a stamp on the courts at a time when Obama should have the prerogative. And while I admire Sen. Leahy's commitment to the blue-slip rule and Senate tradition, I have to wonder if he's just ignored the last five years of Republican radicalism. Simply put, there's a strong chance that, if they take the Senate and the presidency, Republicans would abandon Leahy's approach and return to the zero blue-slip rule, to facilitate the confirmation of Republican judges. Which gets to why the Boggs nomination matters. It's not just a slap in the face to Obama's liberal supporters; it's illustrative of the president's nearly casual approach to the courts. On health care, climate change, and other concerns, Obama might win the policy fight, but he'll need friendly judges to defend his accomplishments from conservative lawsuits and an organized right-wing opposition. But by nominating conservatives, he's moving in the opposite direction. It's true that the president has recently improved his performance with nominations. But vacancies are still high, and there's a good chance that the Republicans will win the Senate this year, ending any effort to fill them. To secure his legacy, President Obama needs to act now, and make as many nominations as possible. And to that he'll need Senate Democrats to shift gears on blue-slips and abandon the single-senator veto. Yes, tradition is important, but for a liberal presidency, it's not nearly as important as ending the right's three-decade dominance of the courts."	Obama Hasn't Been Ideological Enough
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/republicans_shooting_guns_gop_candidates_are_advertising_how_they_fire_a.html	"The killing of Diren Dide has made Missoula, Montana, famous for the worst possible reason. On April 27, the German exchange student snuck into the garage of a neighbor, Markus Kaarma. According to the New York Times, the homeowner had been rattled by a recent run of burglaries. That was why he fired four shotgun blasts into the night, killing Dide and sparking an international incident. ""America cannot continue to play cowboy,"" Dide's father told a German news channel. Anyone watching TV in Missoula might also see the state's next congressman shooting at a drone. In an immediately successful spot, state Sen. Matt Rosendale poses next to an ATV and stares up at a drone that's filming him. ""This is what I think about it,"" says Rosendale, firing a shot that takes out the pesky robo-spy. He cradles the scoped rifle under his right arm as he promises he's ""ready to stand tall for freedom."" An ad like that would be unthinkable in Dide's Germany, not because nobody has rifles (they do) or candidates don't go on TV (they get one party broadcast per campaign). It's just a uniquely American spot, an immediate appeal to common culture and common fears, displaying a live firearm to tell the voter that this guy has all the right values. Uniquely American, but not unique--2014 is the year of the gun-toting candidate. There has been no safer (strictly speaking) way to bring attention to a campaign than to give a candidate a gun or auction one off.  So we've seen just-defeated North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate Greg Brannon empty a clip while wearing a Gadsden flag baseball cap: We've seen Will Brooke, running for Congress in Alabama, switch among three guns to blow holes in a copy of the Affordable Care Act, before loading the law in a wood-chipper. We've seen Joni Ernst, a U.S. Senate candidate in Iowa, head to a firing rage as a narrator promises that ""once she sets her sights on Obamacare, Joni's gonna unload."" Todd Harris, an Ernst strategist who previously worked with Sen. Marco Rubio, explains that ""some spots with guns are really well-done, and some feel contrived,"" and this one fits into Column A. ""I think this spot works for Joni because this is who she really is. She does ride a Harley. She does carry a 9 mm with a concealed carry permit. She is a good marksman."" And we've seen Bob Quast, an extremely long-shot independent candidate for that same office, explain that ""even a baby"" knows the Second Amendment and pledge to blow the  ""balls off"" the man who murdered his sister. (Quast tells me that the ad was wildly misinterpreted, and directed at the man who actually murdered his sister.) None of those ads is explicitly about threats to the Second Amendment. None of them were run in states where any new restrictions on guns have passed or could pass since the 2012 Newtown murders kicked awake the ""gun safety"" lobby. Quite the contrary, actually--Brannon lost his primary to North Carolina's speaker of the House, who'd passed a law that allowed guns back onto playgrounds and college campuses.  The long tail of Newtown was a fitful U.S. Senate gun debate that ended in victory for the National Rifle Association, in a few dozen state bills that tightened gun laws, and in almost twice as many state laws that loosened them. The recall of two Colorado state senators who'd voted for a new gun bill effectively silenced the left for the rest of the cycle, but the fear of ""gun-grabbers"" has never abated. ""We saw with the Colorado state Senate elections and from what Mike Bloomberg is doing that the Second Amendment is under attack,"" says Mark McNulty, spokesman for Will Brooke's campaign. ""People want to show they're responsible gun owners, and this is a way to emphasize that."" Another way to emphasize it is seen in the surge of gun raffles, each of them certain to raise money and--just as importantly--show the left that you won't be cowed.  The raffles didn't start this year. But as Mother Jones' Tim Murphy found out, the win-an-AR-15 trend has exploded since the Newtown panic. At least 17 candidates in this cycle had raised money with gun auctions. Retired Rep. Ron Paul auctioned off an AR-15 with ""Magpul MBUS front and rear sights and two Magpul mags"" to benefit his Campaign for Liberty. The trend is new enough, and newsy enough, that a local Fox news station could call a Tennessee candidate's Beretta fundraiser ""one of the more unique things you'll find on a candidate's website this year."" The story is basically the same in every race: A Republican raffles a gun, and Democrats ask whether these heartless people never think of the victims, of the Newtown kids, of Gabrielle Giffords. ""It's such an easy two-sentence story to write,"" scoffs John Curley, an auctioneer who helped Washington state Republicans auction off an AR-15 this year. ""The story is, oh, they're selling the same weapon used in a shooting. But I'll probably end up raffling off two or three more this year, and you know what? They're selling for sometimes twice the retail value."" They're selling for the reason the NRA evokes in its new, post-victory ad campaign. This is the gun Democrats don't want you to have. They're trying to take firearms away from the good guys. ""It can be, for some people, an 'eff you' item,"" says Curley. ""Right? We're going to show you it's not about the gun--it's about whose hand the gun is in. The gun becomes destigmatized, because in the hands of a law-abiding citizen, it's an item for self-defense. But it is a lightning rod item. It's even weird to stand up onstage, to stand up and sell it. You feel like Charlton Heston up there. You know, 'from my cold, dead hands.' """	How 2014 Became the Year of the Gun-Toting Candidate
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/trey_gowdy_leads_the_benghazi_select_committee_the_south_carolina_republican.html	"For once, Rep. Trey Gowdy had no questions to ask. It was Sep. 19, 2013, well into a full day of House Oversight Committee hearings on the 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. The morning had been spent on the facts gathered, then and later, by the State Department. After that the panel heard from the family members of victims--from people like Patricia Smith, whose 34-year old son Sean had been killed in the attack. ""When you were testifying, I couldn't help but think about this dichotomy of death,"" said Gowdy. ""That sometimes, it walks slowly to the front of your life--it gives you time to get your affairs in order, you've had a good life, you have time to say goodbye to the people you love. It just walks slowly and knocks gently on the front door. And then sometimes it kick downs the door."" Patricia Smith was transfixed. She had not come to Congress expecting to hear low country poetry about her son. But here it was, spooling out on C-Span, and here came more of it. ""I can't offer you closure,"" said Gowdy. ""What I hope we can offer you is the truth. Facts. Justice. And let you do with that what you need to do as you walk down that road called grief."" He insisted, ""From church, to the grocery store, to Costco--frankly, to the golf course--I am asked about Benghazi."" Smith finally interjected, forgetting to use her microphone: ""Get answers, please!"" Gowdy said that he would. It was the most compelling moment of a day that the White House was largely able to ignore. And it was resonant in a way that Chairman Darrell Issa's post-game response--to tweet a photo of empty Democratic chairs in the room, as if the other party had taken a respite to spit on some graves--was not. This is one of the reasons that Gowdy, who's in his second term representing the areas around Spartanburg and Greenville, South Carolina, was chosen to run the upcoming Select Committee on Benghazi. As many as 206 Republicans reportedly want roles on the committee. None have suggested that Gowdy shouldn't run it. To conduct hearings that may lead to impeachment, Republicans needed a leader who seemed unimpeachable. They needed someone exactly unlike former Rep. Dan Burton, who never lived down a demonstration, involving a watermelon and a gun, of how Vince Foster's ""murder"" might have gone down. ""When you're shooting a watermelon you're probably going too far,"" says South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. ""I don't think Trey is going to have a demonstration in his backyard about how Benghazi happened. I've known him for years. If you ask any lawyer or judge in South Carolina, Democrat or Republican, he'd get A-plus marks. You'd find that to be a universal assessment."" That's barely hyperbole. In 2010, Gowdy got to Congress by humiliating Rep. Bob Inglis in a Republican primary. Inglis, panicked over the damage done when he voted for the Wall Street bailout, attacked Gowdy, and charged him with ethics violations. ""We had a number of joint appearances and debates,"" Inglis says now. ""Those were not, necessarily, his finest moments, and his work on Benghazi will be a better moment. I assume it will be substantive. A campaign in the midst of the great recession is not necessarily a substantive discussion. Trey is a very capable guy and I think he'll do a fine job with a special investigation, because certainly he's suited for the task."" All is forgiven. It's the same with Holmon Gossett, the man Gowdy defeated in the 2000 circuit prosecutor race that started him in politics. ""I'd have liked to have won,"" says Gossett, ""but we started as friends and we ended as friends. I noticed that he was assigned to that Benghazi committee, and I think it's very fortunate to have somebody of that caliber to have those skills and background."" That background began when Gowdy was 28, bored, and working at a private practice. He got a phone call, ""right after lunch"" one day, telling him that a family friend had been shot dead. ""I imagine the powerful legs of one of North Carolina's greatest tennis players thrusting at the asphalt of a parking lot outside a Charlotte apartment building,"" Gowdy wrote in 2001, in a diary for Slate. ""I imagine his last thought. I wonder why God let this happen. Jeff Adams was barely 30 years old. He was a beautiful person who never felt the sweet kiss of a daughter. If the thug who shot him had only known the loss and havoc he wreaked.  A family friend died in utter, useless vain."" Gowdy went to work for the U.S. attorney's office, then to run for Holmon Gossett's job. Soon after he won, a think tank released a study of one of the prosecutor's offices in Spartanburg County, part of Gowdy's new jurisdiction. Researchers had pronounced it sloppy and adrift. One of the condemned prosecutors accused Gowdy of supplying the dirt. ""He's mad at me for winning,"" Gowdy told a reporter. ""He's further frustrated by the fact that the overwhelming majority of prosecutors in the solicitor's office want to stay after I take office."" Of course, the impression of disarray worked to Gowdy's advantage. After he took over, the South Carolina Court Administration revealed that two-thirds of the circuit's cases were half a year old, or older. ""I am embarrassed to have the second-oldest backlog in the state,"" Gowdy told the press. Right from the start he was building a reputation for taking ice-cold cases, and for knowing precisely how to handle a local media that wanted details of crimes. Gowdy has hardly changed. He delivers floor statements and press conferences, which tend toward tedium, with the passion of a losing argument. (One video of Gowdy deriding the administration over Benghazi got 2.2 million views on YouTube, probably for the way he stalks to and from the podium and throws down notes that he hardly seems to need.) In hearings, Gowdy sometimes refers to the Oversight Committee as a ""jury."" At the most recent Benghazi hearing, on May 1, he accidentally started to call Issa ""your honor."" He turns any room, temporarily, into a courtroom. ""He can ask a question,"" says Graham. ""Now, the bar is low in Congress, I'll be first to admit. These five-minute rounds that are four-minute speeches with one question that's--why did you ask that question?"" This isn't always true. Gowdy's inquisitions, especially about Benghazi, can expand to include every fact he wants known. At the May 1 hearing, when Gowdy was given his time to question Brig. Gen. Robert Lovell, he mused about the questions he wanted to ask the Obama administration and the incoherent answers he'd gotten so far. ""Maybe instead of reading comprehension we ought to teach writing comprehension,"" he snarked. He paraphrased White House press secretary Jay Carney while ""edit[ing] out all the stumbling and stammering Jay Carney did."" The snark ran out, and Gowdy got to the question. ""What evidence did you have that this was an escalation of a protest rooted in spontaneity that got out of control and resulted in the murder of four of our fellow Americans?"" he asked. ""There was none,"" said Lovell. It was a perfect answer, coaxed out by a passionate reminder of how they were discussing not just talking points but the lives of Americans--Americans Gowdy had promised to honor in their deaths. It was also, as Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon would prove, one of very few useful answers. Lovell was there to contradict the official, investigated story that the military did everything it could to get resources to Benghazi. ""BG Lovell did not serve in a capacity that gave him reliable insight into operational options available to commanders during the attack,"" said McKeon. But Lovell could confirm to Gowdy that the false story of an escalating protest did not come from the military. That was Gowdy's point--however many days passed since the attack, he would put together a narrative that explained who lied. And this makes him hard for the Obama administration to immediately dismiss, though it's trying. Issa, in the White House's view, was always a wounded figure whose repeated histrionics have gone nowhere. It wants Gowdy to be seen the same way, as a dispenser of cornpone and grenades who will run a show trial. Actually, in the media tour that started after he was picked to run the committee, Gowdy has relied on his ""trial"" metaphor. He's stuck by a claim of ""evidence"" that the Obama administration scrambled to hide relevant facts. ""If an administration is slow-walking document production,"" he said on MSNBC's Morning Joe, ""I can't end a trial simply because the defense won't cooperate."" Gowdy only talks about Benghazi the way he'd talk about a re-opened murder investigation, a case given to his courtroom because somebody else screwed it up. He's good at this. Republicans, who can imagine the select committee lasting through the midterms and into a lame duck president's final years, are clamoring to be in his jury."	Trey Gowdy Is Precisely the Person the White House Doesn't Want Investigating Benghazi
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/the_republican_party_should_keep_its_crazy_debates_those_gop_contests_were.html	"The Republican Party has ""taken control"" of its presidential primary debate process--putting a party committee in charge of its primary debates, and signaling that they will have fewer debates, with stricter rules, and fewer candidates. Slate's John Dickerson has summed up the move by writing, ""The Republican Party wants an orderly process so that their candidates can put their best foot forward,"" and explaining that the plan is an effort to ""take control of the crazy"" that dominated the 2012 GOP debates. Except for this: What is crazy is changing the one thing that actually worked well for Republicans in 2012--their unruly, burdensome, endless debate process. Sure, the candidates hated it. Sure, the party elders hated it. Yes, it was messy. But those messy, crazy, chaotic debates did more to give the GOP a fighting chance in 2012 than anything else the party did--and they are making a big mistake in undoing what worked so well. The GOP debates in 2012 saved the party from what surely would have led to a 50-state Obama landslide: nominating Rick Perry. It may be hard to remember, but when Texas Gov. Rick Perry entered the race in 2011, it looked like the nomination was his for the taking and the Perry momentum was overwhelming. In fact, a year prior to Election Day 2012 the Perry juggernaut was so strong that even the Great and Powerful Oz (aka Nate Silver) wrote a New York Times Sunday magazine piece forecasting a 55 percent chance that Perry would beat Obama in the general election. What stopped Perry, and saved the Republican Party from nominating a hopeless, hapless candidate?   Those much reviled debates, where Perry blew--not one, not two--but three debate appearances. And what finally did Perry in? One of those much maligned ""media sponsored"" debates, where CNBC journalist John Harwood called Perry out for being unable to name the three federal agencies he proposed to abolish. It took multiple debates to expose Perry's weakness, and sharp questioning by a savvy reporter to make that weakness fatal. Absent those, the GOP might have nominated an atrocious candidate and left the dissection work to President Obama in the fall. Rather than trying to cut back the number of debates and wrest control of them from media types, the Republican Party should send Harwood and CNBC a bouquet and beg them to hold 20 more debates in 2016 to weed out any empty suit candidates. The debates also provided legitimacy for Mitt Romney's ultimate triumph over more base-favored candidates like Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, and Herman Cain. Yes, party insiders hated the fact that the numerous GOP primary debates gave Gingrich, Bachmann, and Cain ""oxygen"" in the race and propelled each to prominence at various points. But as the debates ground on, they became venues in which Romney--showing skill and aggressiveness as a candidate--took down these opponents and triumphed over them on the strength of his persuasive power and personal engagement. For example, in an NBC-sponsored debate in Tampa, Romney decimated Gingrich on his congressional record and post-congressional career--and substantially strengthened his bid for the nomination. While I am certain that Romney would have preferred to have been spared this sparring, the alternative--Romney rolling over lesser candidates by dint of bigger donors, paid ads, and a well-financed campaign--would have given him less stature and legitimacy as the nominee of the entire Republican Party. A coronation may be more fun for a would-be ruler than having to triumph at a jousting tournament, but the latter leaves much less doubt over who is the true king. Romney was helped by winning the nomination on the field of debate battle, and not in the backrooms where he was busy chatting about the 47 percent. It was also those nasty, unpleasant, and numerous debates in the winter of 2011 and 2012 that enabled Romney to have his best moment of the 2012 campaign: His victory over President Obama in Denver in the first general election debate. Yes, some of the reason why Romney bested Obama that night had to do with Obama's weak performance, and some of the credit must go to the excellent Romney preparation plan led by Beth Myers and her team. But there can be no doubt--none--that having to engage in more than 20 primary debates during the campaign made Romney a better, sharper, more experienced debater when his chance came to face Obama in October--and the absence of primary debates for the president made him rustier and less sharp. This is why, of the six incumbent presidents who have engaged in general election debates, five have lost to their challengers in their first debate--including the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan in 1984.  (Bill Clinton besting Bob Dole in 1996 is the lone exception.) Obama's Denver debacle was not a fluke--it was part of a well-established pattern for incumbent presidents. And while many factors account for this trend, the fact that challengers must run a gauntlet of primary debates to make it to the final contest, while incumbents are spared this ordeal, obviously plays a role. It is ironic that the party that believes in challenging, frequent, and multiple tests for our children in school as a condition of promotion now thinks that their putative leader should be spared a rigorous examination as part of their selection process. So please, GOP, nominate an untested candidate who has not been subjected to difficult debates at the hands of hard questioners and a grueling schedule. (Heck, Rick Perry wants another crack at it.) That's definitely the path to victory in 2016."	Why Those Messy, Chaotic, and Crazy Debates Were the One Thing Republicans Did Right in 2012

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/hispanics_opting_to_identify_as_white_how_are_hispanics_assimilating.html	"Between 2000 and 2010, Hispanics grew from 12.5 percent of the American population to 16.3 percent, a change of more than 30 percent. The Great Recession slowed migration from Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, but researchers still project a steady increase in the number of Hispanic residents. By 2050, predicts the Census Bureau, Hispanics will grow to 28 percent of the population, the largest portion of a ""majority-minority"" America that includes blacks, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and mixed-race people. The projection is sound, but--as I wrote last month--we should temper this prediction of a majority-minority future with an awareness of race and shifting identity. As a category, ""Hispanic"" includes a range of ethnic and racial backgrounds, from Afro-Brazilians and brown-skinned Puerto Ricans to indigenous Mexicans and Argentinians of largely European descent. Assimilation, intermarriage, and upward mobility might lead some Hispanics to identify as ""white,"" even as they hold to their cultural heritage. And in the same way, society may reciprocate, treating light-skinned, European Hispanics as ethnic whites, akin to Italians and Eastern Europeans. Which would fit the American pattern. One hundred years ago, Italians were considered a separate race of people, distinct from Anglo-Americans in the nation's racial taxonomy. And fear of their presence sparked violence, discrimination, and strict anti-immigration laws. With time, mobility, and the shared experience of depression and war, however, those Italians began to see themselves as white and mainstream, and in turn, white Americans agreed. In fact, new research says that's happening right now. According to data presented at an annual meeting of the Population Association of America, an estimated 1.2 million Americans changed their racial and ethnic identification from ""Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin"" on the 2000 census to ""white"" on the one in 2010. Here's the Pew Research Center with more: The largest number of those who changed their race/ethnicity category were 2.5 million Americans who said they were Hispanic and ""some other race"" in 2000, but a decade later, told the census they were Hispanic and white, preliminary data showed. Another 1.3 million people made the switch in the other direction. Other large groups of category-changers were more than a million Americans who switched from non-Hispanic white to Hispanic white, or the other way around. What's interesting is that this happened during a decade of rising anti-immigrant sentiment, draconian anti-immigrant laws, and a rising pan-Latino identity, which seem to stand as countervailing forces. To be clear, as Nate Cohn notes for the New York Times, ""White identification is not necessarily a sign that Hispanics consider themselves white. Many or even most might identify their race as ""Hispanic"" if it were an explicit option."" At the same time, this change reflects growing assimilation among a group of Hispanics, who--as Cohn writes--""are likelier to be second- and third-generation Hispanics than foreign-born and noncitizen Hispanics"" and have higher incomes and more education. Intermarriage will of course play a role in shaping identity. Already, intermarriage is most common among whites and Hispanics. The children of those unions could see themselves as white and Hispanic, simply Hispanic, or simply white. In any case, it's more than clear that some Hispanics are following the path of previous European immigrant groups, where success breeds assimilation, and assimilation brings whiteness."	Are Hispanics Joining the White Mainstream?
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/public_schools_and_reform_u_s_schools_cost_way_too_much_and_should_be_cheaper.html	"Say you were given $26,000 to educate a young kid for a year. Do you think you could put that money to good use? I do. In most of the country, there are quite good private schools that would charge you substantially less for a year's tuition, leaving you with plenty of extra money for field trips, academic enrichment programs, summer camp. Tuition at the average Catholic elementary school, for example, is $3,673, and it is $9,622 for a freshman in high school. To be sure, tuition tends to be higher at nonsectarian schools, but the average is nowhere near $26,000. There are rarefied schools in America's big cities and boarding schools where tuition is substantially higher than $26,000, but that largely reflects the fact that those schools long to be highly exclusive status symbols. Let's leave aside this crazy notion that you'd just spend your $26,000 on private school tuition and a few extras for the kid in question. That's too easy. Let's instead imagine that you're given $26,000 per student to educate 30 kids, or a classroom's worth. If my math's not off--and it very well could be, as I am a product of America's public schools--you would have $780,000. Don't you think you could hire a couple of pretty good teachers, two personal trainers, a chef, and a social worker for that much money--and have enough left over to rent a light and airy loft space in a typical American city? The rent might be cheaper still in a depressed inner-city neighborhood. If you decided to skimp on the personal trainers, you'd have more money to spend on high-tech gadgets and enriching experiences for your young charges. Lots of people would come up with lots of different ways to give their students an engaging learning experience. Yes, I'm making this sound much easier than it would be in practice. It takes a lot of experience to know which teachers you should hire, and to navigate the thicket of regulations designed to prevent amateurs like me from setting up fly-by-night schools. The reason I'm so fixated on this $26,000 figure is that in 2010, when Newark, New Jersey, became ground zero of the education reform movement, the local schools were spending more than $26,000 per student. That was the year Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged $100 million to back education reform efforts in Newark if the city raised another $100 million, a pledge that helped put then-Mayor Cory Booker and Gov. Chris Christie on the national radar. It's admirable that Zuckerberg chose to devote this money to poor kids and not to buying an island off the coast of Central America and populating it with reanimated dinosaurs. But Rick Hess, the director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, points out the inconvenient fact that this $200 million cash infusion--Zuckerberg's money plus the matching funds--would represent just a 4 percent increase in Newark's annual public school spending over the course of its five-year payout. An extra $40 million a year might have made a difference if Newark's public schools were a well-oiled machine. That's not the impression you get from Dale Russakoff's sobering account of Newark's school reform efforts in The New Yorker. Russakoff reports that there is one administrator for every six public school students in Newark, and clerks represent 30 percent of the central bureaucracy's workforce. Despite this army of administrators, Russakoff observes that ""payroll checks and student data were habitually late and inaccurate."" Given the enormous amount Newark was spending on clerks, and clerks' clerks, is it obvious that Newark's public schools needed bigger budgets to improve the quality of education? Newark is a rough town. It has long been one of America's poorest and most corrupt cities, and the problems plaguing its public schools are so egregious that one hesitates to treat it as a test case. Even if Newark's public schools were run by crackerjack professionals, they'd face serious challenges. Unfortunately, its problems aren't unique. Few of Newark's children are raised in the kind of stable homes that offer a solid foundation for educational success, and that's a phenomenon that's increasingly common across the country. In fairness, Newark's per pupil spending is unusually high. The K-12 average for the United States in 2010 was $11,826. That is 39 percent higher than the average per pupil spending in the world's rich democracies, and it is second only to Switzerland. Though American students don't perform terribly well in math, reading, and science compared with students in other rich democracies, American schools know how to spend. As of 2011, the U.S. spent $550 billion on K-12 public schools. This masks enormous variation across states. New York state, for example, spent $18,618 per pupil in 2010 while Utah spent $6,064. To some extent, this reflects differences in the cost of living, but the cost of living isn't three times as high in Oswego, New York, as it is in St. George, Utah. Is New York state's spending buying better results? One crude way to answer this question is to consider how New York state students fare on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. When we compare the average math scores of fourth-graders who are eligible for the national school lunch program, we find that poor kids in New York state score 231 while poor kids in Utah score 233. This is hardly a slam-dunk case. Kids in New York state and kids in Utah are different in all kinds of ways that go beyond income. But are they ""we have no choice but to spend three times as much"" different? Or consider Milwaukee, which has had a system of school vouchers in place for several years. In 2012, 57 percent of voucher students scored proficient or higher in reading on a statewide standardized test while the same was true of 60 percent of Milwaukee Public School students. Score one for traditional public schools! The math results were similar: 41 percent of voucher students reached proficiency while 50 percent of their MPS peers cleared the same bar. So was this a clear case of public school superiority? Not quite. It turns out that while MPS spent an average of $9,812 per student, the voucher program spent $7,670 per student. This partly reflects the fact that voucher schools are often more bare bones than local public schools. But the voucher schools also did a much better job of getting their students to graduate. Though Milwaukee's voucher schools are far from perfect, they appear to be doing something right, starting with the fact that they're using public dollars more efficiently. (Update, May 21, 2014: Here is a more rigorous take on how Milwaukee's voucher schools stack up against its public schools.) Calling for higher spending is an easy way to signal that you care about The Children. Yet there is very little reason to believe that spending more leads to better results. Though per-pupil spending in the United States has doubled since 1983 in inflation-adjusted terms, educational outcomes have remained stagnant. What does make a difference is allowing new educational models to flourish. Instead of top-down ""reform"" of the kind that Cory Booker and Chris Christie championed in Newark, America's school districts need to ""relinquish"" their power over how schools are run day to day, as Neerav Kingsland, the CEO of New Schools for New Orleans, has argued. Over the course of six years, New Orleans cut the gap in educational performance between its students and students across the state of Louisiana by 70 percent. The share of students attending failing schools fell from 78 percent to 40 percent. All of this happened without a big funding boost. Rather, it was the result of the steady replacement of traditional public schools with innovative public charter schools, which found new ways to do more with less. If you really care about public education, calling for more spending is exactly the wrong thing to do. Pouring more money into dysfunctional schools gives incompetent administrators the excuse they need to avoid trimming bureaucratic fat and shedding underutilized facilities and underperforming personnel. It spares them the need to focus on the essentials, or to rethink familiar models. The promise of constant spending increases is what keeps lousy schools lousy. When private businesses keep failing their customers year after year, they eventually go out of business. When public schools do the same, they dupe taxpayers, and the occasional tech billionaire, into forking over more money. If you really, really care about The Children, call for a system in which the most cost-effective schools expand while the least cost-effective schools shrink, and school leaders are given the freedom to figure out what works best for their teachers and their students."

In the hospital, you look to every doctor or nurse who throws back that curtain and punches the hand sanitizer machine as if they have the answer, but they don't. This test or that test will tell us more, you're told, or we'll know more after one more bag is hooked up and drained. If you're on a slower track, it's just a gauntlet of appointments weeks away, tests on different floors or in different buildings, illegible return visit dates scribbled on little cards, lost parking tickets you can't validate, endless pill trays (the clear one in the morning and the opaque one at night). This is what it's like even if everything goes relatively smoothly and you get care: It's scary and helpless. Now imagine if you experienced it with the inefficiency of the worst experience you've ever had with customer service. That's what's happening in some cases at Veteran Affairs clinics and hospitals around the country: People at their most acute moments of need are being ignored and forgotten. This is an outrage to be outraged about. But does anyone have faith that this outrage will be answered by serious action? One primary reason to despair is that we're already living at peak outrage. Fake umbrage taking and outrage production are our most plentiful political products, not legislation and certainly not interesting solutions to complicated issues. We are in a new political season, too--that means an extra dose of hot, high stakes outrage over the slightest thing that might move votes. How does something get recognized as beyond the pale when we live beyond the pale? What makes the VA scandal different is not only that it affected people at their most desperate moment of need--and continues to affect them at subpar facilities. It's also a failure of one of the most basic transactions government is supposed to perform: keeping a promise to those who were asked to protect our very form of government. The growing scandal points out more than just incompetence. When the wait times were long and those promises were being broken to veterans, administrators then lied about it. It appears this was true across the country. If you want another injured party, it's the angels at the VA--the doctors and nurses who work long hours and call you on their cellphone after dinner to answer questions that to you seem like the only thing in the world that's important. This scandal is an offense to the people trying to keep their most basic promises, even though the system is tough, battered, and bruised. Unlike some other debates, this one can't be delayed by a conversation over whether caring for veterans is the proper responsibility of the federal government. But the political conversation is so caught up in the wasteful cycle of outrage, that this is simply being sorted as another thing to be angry about. The politicians are to blame for that fact, but so are we. Genuine outrage--sustained outrage--is required to move politicians. Every time we let politicians claim we're facing another Watergate, or partisan pundits inflame us on Facebook, or Twitter trolls play on our emotions, we spoil our ability to respond to the outrages that really matter. Obviously given the level of incompetence at the Department of Veteran Affairs and the real costs of this scandal, we should demand more action from the president and the men and women who lead this department. Maybe Congress can move as quickly and in as bipartisan a fashion as they did when it seemed that sequestration might cause long airline delays. The pressure can't be short-lived. Unlike the phony outrages that get addressed and forgotten, improving service at the VA is going to take time. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the VA was a more difficult bureaucracy than the Pentagon. We can also do something immediately to show our respect for the people being abused or neglected. The VA scandal should temper the faux outrage we project on lesser matters. As FDR said, the public cannot ""be attuned for long periods of time to a constant repetition of the highest note on the scale."" If we are constantly yelling outrage, it leaves us with nothing when the real thing comes along. In this time of political purity tests, let's require a purity test for the constant state of alarm. The next time someone turns their meter up to 11--whether it's a politician, a pundit, or your aunt on Facebook--their outrage should be measured against what has already happened at the VA."	Why the VA Scandal Is the Real Outrage

Stacey Abrams' office, there's a handy visual reminder of how rotten things are for Democrats. It displays every legislative district in the state, in bright colors, with photographs of Abrams' colleagues plunked inside them. They are outnumbered, 119 to 60, in districts that cut jaggedly across the terrain to keep the Republicans in power indefinitely. That was the point. They drew the map after winning one of 2010's many GOP landslides, in a year when nine Georgia Democratic legislators threw up their hands and switched parties. It's easy to view Abrams, the first woman and the first black leader of the House Democrats, as the captain of a permanent minority. She views herself and her Democrats as the beneficiaries--eventually--of Republican hubris. ""They were going after a supermajority,"" she says, pointing at the map. ""They actually drew themselves 124 seats. But those 124 seats became competitive in a way they wouldn't have, had they drawn 110 seats. Each year, we will double the number of pick-ups that we have, in part because in order to draw so many seats in a state that is so increasingly Democratic and demographically diverse, they had to draw too many slim margins. We can nibble away with that this year, and in 2016 and 2018 we can take much bigger slices. 2014 advanced our agenda by two years."" She ticks off the reasons. Republicans have run Georgia since 2003, and first-term Gov. Nathan Deal has struggled to keep above water. He won his office in a 10-point rout over a former Democratic governor, but his lead over state Sen. Jason Carter--the grandson of the 39th president--is in single digits. The Democratic candidate for an open U.S. Senate seat will be Michelle Nunn, the do-gooding daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn. The party had been courting her for years, and now she's tied in polling with any possible Republican nominee, all of whom she's out-fundraised by a factor of at least 2-1. On May 20, two of them will be forced into a two-month runoff, while Nunn campaigns freely and stacks dollars. And those are just the horse-race factors. Democrats are counting on a backlash to a gun bill that legalized firearms in bars and churches. They expect voters to blame the Republicans for larger class sizes and a spike in the cost of teachers' health plans. And they're shaming Republicans for turning down the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, which has spawned a steady run of stories about doomed or closing rural hospitals. ""Most people viewed Medicaid as sort of a poor people's program,"" Abrams says. ""What they're starting to realize is that it's actually the funding for their hospitals. You lose one of those hospitals and you lose an economic center. A lot of the effect of that won't be felt until July, when they start budgeting for next year."" That's the theory, but none of it will matter unless Democrats turn out Georgia's growing, nonwhite population. In 2004, the Kerry-Edwards ticket lost Georgia by 17 points, with an electorate that was 70 percent white. In 2008, Barack Obama came within five points of winning Georgia with an electorate that was only 66 percent white. There were no state exit polls in 2012, but the president's re-election campaign lost the state by only eight points, less than public surveys had predicted, helping Abrams' Democrats win in a few of those gerrymandered seats. Georgia Democrats now have to figure out how to make the electorate look like it does in an Obama year, minus Barack Obama. They want, basically, to turn their state into the next Virginia, where a population that's growing less and less white can elect Democrats. No other state in the South has figured out how to replace the long-gone Dixiecrat/black majority with a majority of white liberals and nonwhites. By pulling out the nonwhite vote, by pulling maybe 30 or 31 percent of whites, they can elect Carter or Nunn. But nobody pretends that the legacy candidates have the same appeal as the first black president. Every Georgia Democrat remembers the 2008 Senate race and runoff. Jim Martin, the perfectly adequate Democratic candidate, came within three points of Sen. Saxby Chambliss. That forced a runoff, which Martin lost by 15 points. The Republican vote had fallen by 34 percent, but the Obama-free Democratic vote had collapsed by 48 percent. It mirrored what happened in every midterm in the new, red Georgia. Now, the Democratic base needs to get thrilled about two candidates who are running to the center. Carter actually voted for the gun bill, in a naked attempt to neutralize the issue. ""They're unhappy about it,"" suggested Abrams, ""but they've been unhappy about lots of things. People are disappointed, but they're not willing to sacrifice Jason to Gov. Deal."" Nunn has no legislative record at all, spending her career in charity organizations before running this year. That's attracted some support from Republicans, and Nunn has only embraced Democratic stances when she's been pushed to do so. Her first TV ad ended with her rejecting ""special treatment"" on health care for members of Congress--meaning she supported a dilatory Republican effort to deny subsidies for their care under the ACA. In her final televised debate against a field of fringe candidates, Nunn was dared to ""say President Obama in any of your speeches."" She responded with a lukewarm statement about how proud she'd been to work with the president and his predecessors. But she and Carter are all the Democrats have at the moment. Georgia, like North Carolina before it, is home to a ""Moral Monday"" protest movement uniting the NAACP and progressive groups against Republican legislation. Tim Franzen, a 37-year-old organizer with the American Friends Service Committee, takes questions about the campaign from an office in downtown Atlanta, decorated by posters from the campaign to close the School of the Americas and to block banks from foreclosing on homes. He walks through this year's plans--the first of a multiyear strategy--to build progressive momentum across the state. ""We're going to Savannah, we're going to Atlanta twice, we're going to Augusta, Dalton, Gainesville--anywhere that has even a medium-sized college, anywhere with a medium-sized population,"" he says. ""It's going to take longer than North Carolina. We've never been a progressive state."" To pull this off, the Moral Monday activists were going to register voters--""we want to do 10,000 between now and the election""--and team up with Georgia WAND, a group that focuses on the female vote. ""When we look at this election cycle,"" says Franze, ""the most powerful demographic is going to be African-American women."" But why would they turn out this year? The strategies of Carter and Nunn are designed to offend as few white conservatives as possible while counting on a backlash to turn out their actual base. Other Democrats have shown how not to do that. In 2010, black Democratic Rep. Artur Davis ran for governor of Alabama and opposed the Affordable Care Act, with his eye on the general election. Black voters rebelled and nominated a white Democrat in the primary by a landslide. Nunn isn't making Davis's mistake, but she's trying to say as little about ""progressive"" issues as she can. Last week, in an interview with MSNBC, Nunn carefully avoided saying whether she would have voted for the Affordable Care Act--""I was working at Points of Light""--while rattling off some of her preferred changes to the law and sticking up for the Medicaid expansion. That's the message, but MSNBC saw the dodge, and Nunn ended Monday with an AP story about her ""struggle"" to explain herself. The candidate had a slightly easier time talking about Michael Boggs. On Friday, after most of Georgia's congressional delegation had condemned the conservative court nominee and called for the Senate to reject him, Nunn told Politico that she ""share[d] some of the concerns that have been raised by the Senate committee members."" She wasn't a hard no, but she wasn't running away from the position of black Democrats, either. On Saturday, I followed Nunn into a hybrid campaign/charity event in a poor section of Atlanta. Nunn volunteers set up a table at the front of Perkerson Elementary School, presenting a campaign sign-up sheet and free T-shirts to the 300 locals who showed up to paint walls, restore a basketball court, and plug fresh mulch into a playground. I asked her whether she had anything else to say about Boggs, or about what she looked for in a jurist. ""How are we going to ensure that our judicial nominees represent and are inclusive of the full diversity, the full spectrum of our Georgia constituents?"" she asked. (Nunn has a possibly genetic habit of referring to Georgians, whom she does not yet represent, as constituents.) ""I think that's a starting point. Someone who represents the best ideals of jurisprudence [and has] experiences in the world that make that individual empathetic and wise and capable. "" It was a soft remix of Barack Obama's 2009 explanation of what he wanted from a Supreme Court nominee, before picking Sonia Sotomayor. Nunn's defense of the Affordable Care Act was exactly what Democrats wanted from Georgia--talk about the Medicaid expansion. Voters, she said, ""see that we have 650,000 people that are going without insurance that, if they lived in Kentucky, they'd have access to."" This is no call to action, but former Sen. Sam Nunn didn't do that sort of thing, either. Michelle Nunn's success, Jason Carter's success, and the whole Georgia Democratic revival depends on a base remaining angry and motivated and in the streets--and then ready to back centrist-sounding, centrist-acting candidates who shrink from the national party. Before they inherit the state's demographic future, Democrats need to be inoffensive to its demographic present. They don't need the voter who, say, marches against Common Core or kicked in a TV when Michael Sam celebrated his NFL drafting with a same-sex kiss. ""That's not who I want,"" Abrams said. ""What I want is the person who flinched a little bit and still watched it and said, 'Eh, okay.' The person who has evolved."""	Can Georgia Democrats Make the State Turn Blue Ahead of Schedule?
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/the_veterans_affairs_crisis_and_the_obama_administration_the_response_will.html	"The story of trouble at the Department of Veterans Affairs is a familiar one: A political firestorm erupts, and firings are called for. Hearings are held. Outrage is produced. Pundits want to know what the president is going to do. Interested parties say he is moving too slowly. The president's opponents take advantage. His advisers insist the president is livid. The president is ""madder than hell,"" Obama's chief of staff Denis McDonough said on Face the Nation. But the president is also not going to engage in symbolic acts. Obama doesn't just fire people because they got bad theater reviews after congressional hearings. While the story is familiar, the context is different this time. When administration officials say that they are doing everything they can to address a problem that they insist is vitally important, we now have a standard against which to judge those claims. We know what it looks like when Obama aides rush to the sound of sirens. That was how the president and his team responded to healthcare.gov after it exploded on launch. They've been celebrating the miraculous resuscitation since the March 31 open enrollment deadline when more people signed up than anyone might have expected after such a dismal start. So perhaps all future emergency responses should be measured on the healthcare.gov scale. In the coming weeks, will the administration response to systemic problems in the VA be on par with the response to healthcare.gov? A half? A quarter? If not, what is it about these conditions that justify lesser effort? After healthcare.gov had its bad start, the president spoke to the country frequently and appointed an emergency team to solve the management and technological issues. Everyone in the administration was very clear on the dire stakes. So far, with the problems at the VA--long waiting lists and falsified patient appointment reports from hospitals and clinics across the country--the president has spoken once about the issue. Gen. Eric Shinseki, the secretary of veterans affairs, has taken the lead, and the president has appointed his own deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors to oversee a review. Republicans have raised the unflattering comparison in responses, suggesting that when the president's political legacy is at stake his team moves quickly. When it's just veterans, though, they move at the same dull pace. We'll see. You'd think the political incentives would be pretty great for Democrats and the administration. Not only are veterans a rightfully honored political constituency--watch Democrats in tight Senate races appeal to service members here and here--but Democrats should be worried that Republicans will successfully portray the VA mess as the ghost of Obamacare future. But you don't have to be interested in scoring political points to find it useful to compare the all-hands effort to troubleshoot the healthcare.gov website to the slower approach being applied here. In political situations, action is often measured against some fantastical perfect outcome. This rainbow-spiked alternative is mostly a political trap: Why isn't the administration able to stop time to solve this problem? This creates false expectations for political gain. It also irritates whoever is in the administration and anesthetizes them. They categorize criticism as unrealistic and satisfy themselves that they are pushing as hard as they can. But in this case, the healthcare.gov comparison seems sufficiently equivalent to be a useful measuring stick. Or, if you like, a useful prod to break through the typical fog that rises up around these acute moments and strangles any meaningful response. The VA mess does share some broad similarities with the health care law's mess. There is the management rot: VA managers received performance bonuses even as internal audits revealed lengthy wait times for health care. There is the poorly performing technology: The VA computer system for scheduling patients is 25 years old. They also have a rough symbolic equivalence. The fact that the bureaucracy couldn't put together the health care website reinforces fears that the health care system will be ruined by the Obamacare bureaucracy. When Gen. Shinseki testified and seemed passive in the face of congressional outrage, it mirrored the frustration of those trying to make an appointment with the VA who can't seem to scare up any urgency from the person on the other end of the telephone line. To recognize similarities is not to suggest the problems are the same. As much of a disaster as healthcare.gov was, the VA is a far more sprawling operation. It is the largest health system in the country. It processes 230,000 claims a day. Some 185 investigators are working on the inspector general's investigation into the most recent allegations. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates says reforming the VA was even harder than reforming the Pentagon. If the VA problems and the healthcare.gov ones are thoroughly different, then knowing that will be useful, too. Resuscitating healthcare.gov is now the leading case study for taming the bureaucracy, and that experience could be used to clarify the remedy needed to solve this problem. For the last several months the administration has been teaching the American public about its success fixing healthcare.gov. No sign of activity was too small to herald. It's harder to say that change doesn't come quickly when you've been celebrating miraculous change for the past several months. Whether it's valid or not, the Obama administration has given the public the new standard against which to judge its latest emergency response."	Will Obama Work As Hard to Solve the VA Crisis As He Did to Fix Healthcare.gov?
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/millennials_racism_and_mtv_poll_young_people_are_confused_about_bias_prejudice.html	"When you hear MTV, you don't think ""research."" But, for the last few years, the music television channel has been building a public affairs campaign to address bias called ""Look Different."" Aimed at millennials, it seeks to help them deal with prejudice and discrimination in their lives. And as part of the project, MTV has worked with pollsters to survey a nationally representative sample of people ages 14 to 24 to measure how young people are ""experiencing, affected by, and responding to issues associated with bias."" Overall, MTV confirms the general view of millennials: Compared with previous generations, they're more tolerant and diverse and profess a deeper commitment to equality and fairness. At the same time, however, they're committed to an ideal of colorblindness that leaves them uncomfortable with race, opposed to measures to reduce racial inequality, and a bit confused about what racism is. All of this is apparent in the findings. Ninety-one percent of respondents ""believe in equality"" and believe ""everyone should be treated equally."" Likewise, 84 percent say their families taught them to treat everyone the same, no matter their race, and 89 percent believe everyone should be treated as equals. With that said, only 37 percent of respondents (30 percent of whites and 46 percent of minorities) say they were raised in families that talk about race. For this reason, perhaps, a majority of millennials say that their generation is ""post-racial."" Seventy-two percent believe their generation believes in equality more than older people, and 58 percent believe that as they get older, racism will become less of an issue. It's almost certainly true that this view is influenced by the presence of President Obama. Sixty-two percent believe that having a black president shows that minorities have the same opportunities as whites, and 67 percent believe it proves that race is not a ""barrier to accomplishments."" It's no surprise, then, that most millennials aspire to ""colorblindness."" Sixty-eight percent say ""focusing on race prevents society from becoming colorblind."" As such, millennials are hostile to race-based affirmative action: 88 percent believe racial preferences are unfair as a matter of course, and 70 percent believe they are unfair regardless of ""historical inequalities."" Interestingly, the difference between whites and people of color is nonexistent on the first question and small (74 percent versus 65 percent) on the second. But this might look different if you disaggregated ""people of color"" by race. There's a chance that black millennials are more friendly to affirmative action than their Latino or Asian peers. For all of these aspirations, however, millennials have a hard time talking about race and discrimination. Although 73 percent believe that we should talk ""more openly"" about bias, only 20 percent say they're comfortable doing so--despite the fact that a plurality of minorities say that their racial identities shape their views of the world. What's more, for all of their unity on tolerance and equality, white and minority millennials have divergent views on the status of whites and minorities in society. Forty-one percent of white millennials say that the government ""pays too much attention to the problems of racial minority groups while 65 percent of minorities say that whites have more opportunities."" More jarring is the 48 percent of white millennials who say discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against racial minorities. With that in mind, it's worth a quick look at a 2012 poll from the Public Religion Research Institute, where 58 percent of white millennials said that discrimination against whites was as big a problem as discrimination against minorities. It's hard to say which is the ""true"" number, but there's no doubt that a substantial plurality of young white people believe their race is a disadvantage, which is ludicrous given the small number who say that they've felt excluded because of their race (10 percent) or say that they've been hurt by racial offenses (25 percent). But while this reaction doesn't seem to have a basis in reality, it makes perfect sense given what millennials writ large believe about racism. Let's go back to the results on colorblindness and affirmative action. Seventy-three percent believe that ""never considering race would improve society,"" and 90 percent say that ""everyone should be treated the same regardless of race."" From these results, it's clear that--like most Americans--millennials see racism as a matter of different treatment, justified by race, that you solve by removing race from the equation. If we ignore skin color in our decisions, then there can't be racism. The problem is that racism isn't reducible to ""different treatment."" Since if it is, measures to ameliorate racial inequality--like the Voting Rights Act--would be as ""racist"" as the policies that necessitated them. No, racism is better understood as white supremacy--anything that furthers a broad hierarchy of racist inequity, where whites possess the greatest share of power, respect, and resources, and blacks the least. And the magic of white supremacy is that its presence is obscured by the focus on race. When a black teenager is unfairly profiled by police, we say it's ""because of the color of his skin,"" which--as a construction--avoids the racism at play, from the segregated neighborhood the officer patrols to the pervasive belief in black criminality that shapes our approach to crime. Likewise, it obscures the extent to which this isn't just different treatment-- it's unequal treatment rooted in unequal conditions. Millennials have grown up in a world where we talk about race without racism--or don't talk about it at all--and where ""skin color"" is the explanation for racial inequality, as if ghettos are ghettos because they are black, and not because they were created. As such, their views on racism--where you fight bias by denying it matters to outcomes--are muddled and confused. Which gets to the irony of this survey: A generation that hates racism but chooses colorblindness is a generation that, through its neglect, comes to perpetuate it."	Why Do Millennials Not Understand Racism?
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/bob_barr_running_for_congress_the_bizarre_return_of_georgia_s_unpredictable.html	"HOLLY SPRINGS, Georgia--The letter was so compelling because no one expected Bob Barr to write it. It was January 2009, shortly after President Obama had put forward Eric Holder as his nominee for attorney general. Barr had just run for president as the Libertarian Party's nominee, but he remained best-known as the tireless inquisitor of Bill Clinton. Republicans, eager to weaken Obama, were lacerating Holder for his role in Clinton's pardon of financier Marc Rich. Barr was not. ""Mr. Holder and I may have had disagreements over policy matters during the time he served in the administration of President Clinton,"" he wrote. ""However, I never had reason to question his personal and professional integrity, or his deep understanding of and commitment to our Constitution and especially the Bill of Rights."" Holder, he suggested, ""will restore public confidence in the Department of Justice."" Barr, at that time, seemed to be morphing into a sort of post-partisan figure. He'd left the GOP for the Libertarian Party in 2006, out of disgust for the Bush administration's civil liberties record. ""I've been very pleased to listen to some of the things some of the Democrat leaders are saying,"" he told me then. He won the Libertarian nomination by telling activists that he'd ""made mistakes,"" like backing the war on drugs. ""The last few times I've been on the same panel as Bob Barr,"" Democratic New York Rep. Jerry Nadler told me recently, ""we've been on the same side."" But in March 2013, Georgia Rep. Phil Gingrey announced a run for Senate. Twenty-four hours later, Barr jumped into the race for Gingrey's seat in the deep red northern suburbs of Atlanta--some of the turf he'd held between 1995 and 2003, when he was redistricted out of Congress and began his amazing journey across the ideologies. Three months later Barr informed readers of his syndicated column that ""the time has come for Attorney General Holder to step down,"" in order to ""salvage"" his reputation. It's the Holder letter, more than anything else Bob Barr has said, that has been weaponized by his six opponents. Not his evolution from a DOMA sponsor to a DOMA critic, not his sojourn in the Libertarian Party, not his brief advocacy for Haiti's exiled president-for-life. It's the three-page post-partisan letter he wrote for one nominee, and it's a criticism he simply refuses to consider. ""It's just politics,"" Barr told me. I asked him why he thought Holder had ""fallen,"" or whether he ever expected better from the Obama administration. ""What else would I say that I haven't said already?"" That was the end of the answer. Barr's slogan is ""Experience, to Right the Wrongs,"" and implicit in that is that he knows which mistakes he made. The theory of the Bob Barr comeback is that the Republican Party of 2014 has become more libertarian and more ready for what he's good at--investigating and humiliating politicians. ""I missed the opportunity to actually draft and amend legislation,"" Barr told me. ""You simply can't do that from the outside. Through teaching, through my law practice, in the private sector, you can influence the debate--but ultimately, in terms of passing and debating laws, you have to be in the arena."" Barr barely won the 2008 Libertarian nomination, prevailing in a daylong ballot fight after gambling pro Wayne Allyn Root finished in third place and endorsed him over the longtime Libertarian activist Mary Ruwart, in exchange for a place on the ticket. The novelty of Bob Barr running for president intrigued the press, and the candidate earned time on The Colbert Report and a long profile in The New Yorker. Yet the Barr-Root ticket won only 0.4 percent of the vote, running third to Ralph Nader's umpteenth (and last) attempt to ruin things for Democrats. Barr's reswitch ""didn't come as a surprise,"" said Ruwart. Root, who's also returned to the Republican Party and become an occasional Fox News pundit, was proud of his old running mate for rediscovering a path to relevance. ""The system and the media bias make it impossible for third-party candidates to gain momentum and win elections,"" he said. The Libertarians--who ended up nominating another former Republican for president in 2012, and getting .99 percent of the vote--have moved on. ""He never seemed to fit in with most of us,"" said Doug Craig, chairman of the Georgia Libertarian Party. ""He made it hard on us to get new people because they did not think we took libertarianism serious enough with his nomination. When Bob Barr and Wayne Root left the party, we actually had a spike in new members."" Barr has gotten back on board with Republican orthodoxy, as it's moved closer to what he believed. In 2008 he said that ""the federal government's approach to the war against drugs has been one that tramples on the very notion of federalism."" When I asked him whether he'd challenge D.C.'s new law decriminalizing marijuana--similar to something Barr had opposed in the 1990s--he started by saying that Congress absolutely had the right to vet the law. ""I'd have to take a long, hard look at it,"" he said. ""It's not something I've focused on in the last couple of years."" Still, Doug Craig was hopeful. Barr's time with the Libertarians did seem to ""move him closer to libertarianism."" He spent two years of his life telling activists and journalists of his new religion, and he's returning to a Republican Party in which ""NSA"" is a curse word and Sen. Rand Paul is a tastemaker. ""The party has moved, though I don't take credit for it,"" said Barr. ""It has to do to some extent with Ron Paul's runs for the presidency, with Ted Cruz raising these issues. All of these things combined have brought the Republican Party back to its Reagan roots."" He didn't mention ""the Tea Party,"" but that's the movement that makes him confident. On Tuesday night a conservative in the district had a couple of choices. He could attend a fundraiser for state Sen. Barry Loudermilk, Barr's strongest challenger, where for a small fee he could meet the candidate and hear from RedState's Erick Erickson. ""We need to not just send Republicans to Washington, but send conservatives into the general as our Republican nominees,"" Erickson told me. ""I like Bob Barr a lot, but I feel very sorry for him. He reminds me of Tolian Soran desperate to get back inside the Nexus."" Alternatively, the conservative voter could head to the monthly meeting of the Canton T.E.A. Party, held at an old train depot in the suburb of Holly Springs. (The Canton group, like many in the movement, makes TEA into an acronym: ""Taxed Enough Already."") On the way in, he could pick up a brochure that made it clear why the Canton Tea Party vetted all the candidates and endorsed Barr."	He Once Led the Charge to Impeach Bill Clinton.

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/republican_party_primaries_aren_t_divisive_the_gop_s_civil_war_hasn_t_been.html	"The civil war in the Republican Party is so civil. At least on the Senate battlefield, the much-anticipated and contentious intraparty fights are not happening. After the GOP primaries in North Carolina and Nebraska, the grassroots conservatives of the Tea Party and elites of the GOP establishment can both claim victories, but the real winners for the moment are the forces of order. Several months ago, this seemed unlikely. Republican strategist Karl Rove launched a new effort he said was designed to support candidates who could win elections. He said sloppy, unproven candidates had cost the GOP several Senate seats they should have won in 2010 and 2012 in Delaware, Nevada, Colorado, Indiana, and Missouri. Those who claim to speak for the grassroots charged that Rove was trying to drown out the voices of true conservatives. The hashtag #crushrove started trending. Democrats rejoiced. They hoped contentious primary fights would produce exploitable examples of Republican extremism as candidates competed in extravagant purity tests. They also hoped the process would elevate grassroots candidates who were bad politicians prone to saying crazy things. So far, this hasn't happened either. On Tuesday in Nebraska, Senate candidate Ben Sasse won the Republican primary. Movement conservative elites like Brent Bozell and Erick Erickson cheered it as a victory in their battle against the forces of unprincipled capitulation.* It's true, to a point. Sasse had all the right backers, and he was attacked by a super PAC associated with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (who had his own issues with Sasse), but Rove's American Crossroads didn't enter the race, and the back and forth never rose above the standard acrimony of politics. In part, that's because Sasse's opponent Shane Osborn was hardly Jeb Bush. He had the support of local Tea Party groups, conservative veteran Phyllis Schlafly, and FreedomWorks. In an example of how thin the distinctions have become, Sal Russo, the Republican consultant who co-founded the Tea Party Express, made the case for Sasse over Osborn to my colleague David Weigel based on Sasse's campaign organization, not his purity. ""This is not 2010, when we thought it was important to take a stand and reflect the disappointment people had with both parties,"" said Russo. ""We need viable candidates now."" FreedomWorks, which had attacked Sasse as a supporter of Obamacare, then switched to endorse him. As a late-game ploy, Osborn accused Sasse of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants. That put Osborn, the supposed establishment candidate, to the right of Tea Party favorite Sen. Marco Rubio. Nebraska is a safe Republican state. Perhaps the forces of the establishment would have jumped in more heavily if the march to the majority in the Senate were threatened. But that's not a certainty. Sasse is no Christine O'Donnell or Richard Mourdock, two of the candidates often cited as being substandard. Sasse has political skill, an Ivy League education, and credentials as a Bush administration veteran. He will win the general election in the heavily red state and come to Washington as a Rand Paul or Ron Johnson type of senator--what used to be known as simply a good movement conservative. (Sasse, who describes himself as a ""nerd"" and ""autodidact,"" may also increase the populist egghead caucus to two). In the North Carolina Republican primary, the contest among the different factions of the party wasn't a debilitating fight either. Lots of money was spent supporting different candidates, but there was very little bloodshed for such huge amounts of cash. Thom Tillis, the establishment pick who won, was not so objectionable that he kept movement conservatives from falling in line quickly behind him and against Democrat Kay Hagan.* In Alaska, American Crossroads and the Club for Growth are supporting the same candidate, Dan Sullivan, another veteran of the Bush administration. Next week McConnell is likely to beat back his Tea Party challenger--by quite a lot if the polls are to be believed. None of McConnell's apostasies on the debt limit or the government shutdown appear to have hurt him. Democrats hoping for primary fireworks are still holding out hopes for Iowa and Georgia, where a close race could lead to a runoff, though in Georgia the fringe candidates are at the back of the pack. Democratic strategists also argue the lack of public intraparty spats means that the most conservative viewpoints have been thoroughly internalized, making the winning candidates vulnerable on issues from the minimum wage to Medicare, where they say Republican orthodoxy is out of step with general-election voters. Maybe, but in these coming fights, Democrats will be debating GOP candidates who can build a winning coalition, raise money, and have political experience. That's an improvement. The Republican Party has not banished its pressing internal debates. Immigration, Common Core education standards, and the role of U.S. foreign policy overseas can still stir a rousing argument. But these arguments are not controlling the Republican primary process. Yes, GOP elites and grassroots conservatives are claiming victory in their struggle against each other. Ideological warriors are always claiming victory, and they believe the stakes are real. Plus, claiming resounding victory is good for fundraising. But for those who were rooting for both sides to lose in a fit of chaos, there hasn't been much to cheer about yet.

There is apparently a requirement that the political world go periodically insane about the former secretary of state. Sterling has just the kind of insane opinions that would really drive up business for whoever benefits from these bouts of madness. Instead, we're left with Karl Rove's opinions about Hillary Clinton's brain. ""Thirty days in the hospital?"" he said, referring to Clinton's four-day treatment in late December 2012 for a blood clot after a fall earlier in the month.* ""And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that."" Rove later took to television and the Washington Post to say that he merely meant that Clinton would get scrutiny from the press about her health. She will now get it earlier, thanks to Dr. Rove. This is the problem with having so much gravitational pull that the New York Times depicts you as a planet. Everything, including air tanks from Skylab, comes your way. In the last week, Hillary Clinton has been connected to issues ranging in seriousness from Benghazi and Boko Haram to armchair speculation about her brain health and role in orchestrating Monica Lewinsky's comeback. This is the downside of having no viable opposition. Clinton has no likely opponents who might draw the GOP's fire and no announced campaign that creates a distracting horserace for the press to cover. Hillary Clinton has been accused of being involved in a murder plot, lying to a grand jury, and orchestrating her daughter's pregnancy for political gain, so being accused of concealing a brain trauma is probably not shocking. Going after the front-runner early is also now a best practice. The Obama team brags about how attacking Mitt Romney long before he was the official nominee was a key to its success. Raising issues about health and age is also standard operating procedure in campaigns; in modern history, it has been a chiefly Democratic technique, used against Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, and John McCain. Dick Cheney also enjoyed speculation about whether his heart condition had made him go nuts. Clinton's health has come up in lots of conversations I've had with Republican political strategists and even some potential presidential candidates, but the topic dribbles away because Clinton's doctors cleared her of neurological damage and said she didn't have a stroke. It is a legitimate issue, but it's awfully early. Rove knows better than most that the press will raise the question once the campaign begins in earnest. Now that the age issue is out in the open, though, perhaps some conspiracies can flower. The questions about her health might grow so baroque that they blossom into the spectacular nuttiness of the Obama birth certificate claims. Or, these daily questions about Clinton could achieve a collective weight on her candidacy. So many issues, so much drama, it's always something with her. On the other hand, Rove's counterdiagnosis to the official one could also make it look like the GOP is totally unhinged about Hillary Clinton, so fevered in its desire to drag her down that it will engage in medical speculation.* Baseless allegations could create sympathy for Clinton, rally her supporters, and put each incremental GOP claim, regardless of its merits, into the category of wolf crying. This is a spasm miles away from the election, so no one can make any serious claims this will matter. (It won't.) But it does highlight a historical quirk of the Clinton candidacy, if there is one. If Hillary Clinton runs, she will be the most uncontested presidential nominee not running for a second term since 1908, when both William Howard Taft and William Jennings Bryan had relatively easy ascensions. Even if she does get a challenger, David Plouffe is probably right that their candidacies will merely be MSNBC auditions. The press will put the resources it would have sunk into covering the Democratic horserace into an evaluation of Clinton's biography, record, and yes, her health. It was always certain that the media examination of Hillary Clinton would come earlier than usual. Still, the republic can sleep soundly knowing Dr. Rove is already making emergency calls. *Correction, May 14, 2014: This article originally misstated that Clinton fell in late December. She fell earlier in the month. She was admitted to the hospital in late December. This article also misstated that Clinton did not wear special glasses after she was released to the hospital."	"Why Karl's Rove's Bizarre ""Brain Damage"" Theory Won't Be the Strangest GOP Attack Hillary Clinton Faces"
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/the_gop_and_the_minimum_wage_republican_ideas_about_the_minimum_wage_are.html	"For a few hours on Friday, Mitt Romney was the subject of positive press. Why? Because, in an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the former Republican presidential candidate pushed his party to back a minimum wage increase. ""I, for instance, as you know, part company with many of the conservatives in my party on the issue of the minimum wage. I think we ought to raise it,"" Romney said. ""Because frankly, our party is all about more jobs and better pay."" Romney wasn't alone. ""There are some basic things that we should be for, and one of them is a reasonable increase from time to time in the minimum wage,"" said former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, also speaking on Morning Joe. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum followed suit on The Daily Rundown, telling Chuck Todd that Republicans should be OK with an occasional increase in the minimum wage. And on Tuesday, in an address to the American Enterprise Institute, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman endorsed his state's move to index the minimum wage to inflation. On the surface, this trend looks like a GOP shift to the center. But these men are outliers. For the large majority of Republican lawmakers, there's no reason to raise the minimum wage. And when Democrats raise the issue, they push back with the usual reactionary rhetoric. ""[W]hen you raise the cost of something, you get less of it,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, after the White House revealed its plan to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers. He continued: ""We know from increases in the minimum wage in the past that hundreds of thousands of low income Americans have lost their jobs."" Likewise, after voting to block cloture on a minimum wage bill in the Senate--thus killing the proposal--Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, the senior Senate Republican on the Joint Economic Committee, said, ""Raising the minimum wage creates winners and losers--it will raise the wages of some but result in job losses for many low-income workers. The true problem plaguing impoverished Americans is not low wage rates but a lack of good job opportunities."" In both instances, the message is that an increase is either futile or counterproductive--a cure that's worse than the disease. We know that's an exaggeration. According to a February report from the Congressional Budget Office, the Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 would reduce total employment by 500,000 workers over the next three years. At the same time, it would lift more than 900,000 families out of poverty and increase the incomes of 16.5 million low-wage workers. What's more, it's reasonable to think we would gain jobs as a result of new economic activity generated by higher wages and new consumer spending. But none of this mattered to Republicans who read the report. For them, it was vindication. ""Raising the minimum wage could destroy as many as one million jobs, a devastating blow to the very people that need help most in this economy,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, all but speaking for most of the Republican Party, and echoing decades of rhetoric against increasing the minimum wage. All of this doomsaying raises a question: If raising the minimum wage destroys jobs and prevents employment, then lowering it would do the opposite. And if you gain from lowering the minimum wage, then why have one at all? At least a few Republicans--including two presidential contenders--seem to have wondered as much, and have gone to where that logic leads: Complete opposition to the minimum wage. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, for example, has no tolerance for the minimum wage. ""When you set the minimum wage, it may cause unemployment,"" he told ABC News during his 2010 Senate campaign. ""The least skilled people in our society have more trouble getting work the higher you make the minimum wage."" Similarly, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sees the minimum wage as an exercise in futility. ""We all support--I certainly do--having more taxpayers, meaning more people who are employed,"" said Rubio. ""The problem is you can't do that by mandating it in the minimum wage laws. Minimum wage laws have never worked in terms of having the middle class attain more prosperity."" The same is true of Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, who--when asked if he does not ""believe in the concept of a minimum wage""--responded in the affirmative, and said that he would abolish the standard if he had a chance. Most recently, one of the Republican candidates for Senate in Georgia, Karen Handel, told ThinkProgress, ""The federal government has absolutely no business being involved in mandating salary and wages in the private sector."" The problem with this position, of course, is that it's incredibly unpopular. As it stands, huge majorities support a minimum wage increase, which--by definition--includes Republican voters. In a winter poll from CBS News and the New York Times, 65 percent of Americans favored raising the minimum wage, including 53 percent of non-Tea Party Republicans. A Gallup poll conducted in March found similar results. There, 71 percent of adults favored an increase in the minimum wage, including 50 percent of self-described Republicans and 54 percent of self-described conservatives. Republican politicians might be united on the minimum wage, but Republican voters aren't, and that difference is why Democrats are laser-focused on raising the minimum wage. Touting an increase doesn't just motivate the base--a key part of any turnout strategy for Democrats--it potentially wins Republicans, or at the very least sows discontent between the party and its supporters. For both sides, turnout is everything in this year's elections. And if Democrats can discourage even a handful of Republicans, then they've won themselves an important boost."	The GOP Doesn't Want to Admit How Much It Hates the Minimum Wage
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/highway_trust_fund_gas_tax_washington_is_refusing_to_even_consider_the_only.html	"The White House is warning Congress that it has until August to find at least $18 billion for the federal account that funds the nation's roads and public transit systems from going broke. Failing to fork over the money would immediately threaten to slow or stop thousands of transportation projects around the country. Even assuming lawmakers find a short-term fix, the account will face a similar $18 billion shortfall every year for the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It's Infrastructure Week, but it's safe to say no one is celebrating. Democrats and Republicans agree on two things when it comes to what has become a perpetual transportation funding crisis. The first is that it will not end until they find a long-term solution. The second is that they know what needs to be done, but they are unwilling to do it. This contradiction has been on full display in recent weeks in Washington as lawmakers scramble to bail out the Highway Trust Fund. The account relies on revenues from fuel taxes to provide the bulk of federal funding for the nation's highways and public transportation. As a result, it has faced one looming shortfall after another during the past half-decade as Americans drive more fuel-efficient cars fewer miles and as the cost of construction rises while the fuel taxes themselves remain unchanged since 1993. Lawmakers understand better than anyone that the current tax rates--18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline, 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel fuel--aren't enough to prevent America's roads from crumbling and bridges from collapsing. They've had to transfer more than $50 billion in taxpayer money to the trust fund over the past six years just to keep it solvent. And it's worth remembering what that current level of investment has bought us: a road system that was ranked 18th internationally by the World Economic Forum, behind Saudi Arabia and Luxemburg, and a transportation infrastructure that experts warn will fall apart as existing roads wear down faster than they are repaired or replaced. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, 1 in 9 of the country's bridges are structurally deficient, more than 4 in 10 major urban highways are overcrowded, and 45 percent of Americans still don't have access to public transit. ""States, cities, and businesses involved in transportation need the certainty from a long-term bill--a short-term patch is not sufficient,"" Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer told the Finance Committee last week. Yet when Boxer and a bipartisan group unveil their relatively conservative proposal this week to keep the nation's surface transportation programs funded for the next six years, she has made it clear it will come with a 12-figure price tag but no mechanism to pay for it. The White House, meanwhile, unveiled its own blueprint late last month that was noteworthy for actually seeking to boost transportation spending by an additional $87 billion over the next four years. It was less remarkable for how it planned to do it--by relying on an injection of cash from a temporary tax increase on companies' overseas earnings, making the proposal the latest in a string to address the short-term cash crunch while ignoring the long-term crisis. ""The only way we're going to fix this is if everyone puts their ideas on the table and has an honest discussion on how to find common ground,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters during the proposal's rollout. Days later, however, Jay Carney made it clear that not all ideas are welcome. ""We have never proposed or supported a gas tax,"" the White House spokesman told reporters. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor did Carney one better later that same week, telling Reuters: ""I can rule out a gas tax increase."" Washington's refusal to consider raising the gas tax is simple politics. GOP leaders would risk an insurrection from the right if they were to support, let alone propose, a tax hike of any kind. President Obama and congressional Democrats, meanwhile, have no interest in providing their opponents with the raw material for an election-year attack ad. (One notable exception: Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who last year introduced a bill to phase in a 15-cent hike in the gas tax and then index it to inflation. Tellingly, that bill has gone nowhere.) As a whole, politicians have been so loath to endorse the solution staring them in the face that the idea has been relegated to a parenthetical even off the Hill. As a recent report from Chris Krueger, a policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, tellingly put it: ""There is not a silver bullet, other than the most obvious (raise the gas tax and index to inflation)."" There's little argument among policy experts that those who drive on America's roads should pay more to prevent them from falling further into a state of disrepair, and study after study has suggested that raising the gas tax is the easiest way to do that in the immediate future. In 2008, the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, a congressionally created blue-ribbon transportation panel, proposed a 40-cent bump to the federal gasoline tax, along with the increased use of tolls and other user fees. A second congressionally created panel, the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission, echoed those finding the following year, backing an increase to federal fuel taxes followed by a transition to a system where Americans are charged for every mile they drive. Support for a gas tax hike isn't reserved for policy wonks either. It also has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, as well as environmental organizations and climate hawks that see it as a way to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Presidents in particular have a long history of being against a gas tax hike until they ultimately sign one into law. Months before Ronald Reagan signed on to a 5-cent increase to the then-4-cents-a-gallon tax, he famously declared that it would take nothing short of a ""palace coup"" for him to do so. George H.W. Bush eventually attempted to sidestep his ""no new taxes"" pledge to raise the tax another 5 cents, although that ultimately crashed head-first into Newt Gingrich and his fellow House Republicans.* Bill Clinton, too, bashed the idea of an increase while on the campaign trail in 1992, before later signing his own 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax hike in his first year in office. But more recent history suggests such days of good policy winning out over good politics are behind us. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta quietly pushed for a series of 2-cent increases beginning in 2005 but ultimately was rebuffed by President George W. Bush. Obama's first Transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, learned a similar lesson but had the misfortune of being taught it in public. Early on in his Cabinet tenure, the former Republican congressman told reporters that it was time for lawmakers to consider either raising the gas tax and tying it to inflation or charging Americans on a per-mile-traveled basis. That suggestion was quickly slapped aside by the White House. ""It is not and will not be the policy of the Obama administration,"" then-White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters. The White House declared this week Infrastructure Week in hopes of drawing attention to the nation's transportation woes. As part of the effort, Obama will give a speech near New York's Tappan Zee Bridge, where he is expected to renew his calls for more funding while studiously avoiding any mention of raising the gas tax. As for LaHood, he ultimately learned to keep his mouth shut, but his views never changed. ""If Congress would have indexed the gas tax in 1993 when it was raised, we wouldn't be having this problem now,"" he said earlier this year. ""We'd have the money."" Update, May 16, 2014: This post has been updated to clarify Newt Gingrich's role in blocking President George H.W. Bush's bid to raise the federal gas tax. (Return.)"	Washington Won't Even Consider This Common-Sense Solution to One of the Nation's Most Pressing Problems
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/monica_lewinsky_in_vanity_fair_millennials_don_t_care_about_the_scandal.html	"Even before the re-emergence of Monica Lewinsky with Thursday's Vanity Fair article offering her latest take on her affair with Bill Clinton and the ensuing constitutional crisis, stories about the world's most famous intern had been hovering in the national news for months. Lewinsky had become a subject of conversation again because of the ongoing debate within the Republican Party over how to treat President Clinton's impeachment if Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016. Back in February, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Monicagate was very much a live issue. Sen. Rand Paul, the supposed GOP youth savior in 2016, also views the Lewinsky affair as a rich line of re-inquiry, having called Bill Clinton a ""serial philanderer"" who displayed ""predatory behavior."" Karl Rove, meanwhile, said talk of anything impeachment-related would only make a potential GOP candidate look petty. Whether or not it's wise to do so, some Republican operatives see a potential Hillary candidacy as an opportunity to reintroduce a new generation of voters to some of the more salacious aspects of the first Clinton presidency. ""A huge portion of the electorate that's going to be her target don't remember the Clinton administration at all,"" said Tim Miller, executive director of the early 2016 super PAC America Rising, in a Talking Points Memo article published a day before Vanity Fair announced its Lewinsky story. ""A lot of the negative stuff about the Clinton era has congealed into like a joke or a historical blip, but people don't remember the details."" Miller, whose group had already begun looking for opposition research on Clinton last year, wants to make sure that these young voters don't have a ""a clouded vision, a nostalgic vision of the Clinton era."" (I reached out to Miller for this story, but he declined to comment.) The idea of the GOP reintroducing Bill Clinton's affair with Lewinsky to younger voters may seem pointless and potentially self-damaging. When you dig deeper, it becomes even dumber. More than any other emotion, the millennial generation that would be offered this introduction to the high crimes and misdemeanors of President Clinton are either bored by the story, or view it with the sort of nostalgia that Miller described. When the ""new"" Lewinsky story came up in the Slate newsroom on Tuesday, there was a millennial cohort that responded with total indifference. ""The whole scandal remains opaque to me to this day,"" said one colleague who was 10 years old at the time. Her main interaction with the affair had been a question on her high school AP U.S. History exam. (She had to guess at the answer; some of her classmates had no idea.) ""It's a black hole of knowledge for me, between my actual current events experiences and study of history. I guess I should read up on it and inform myself, but it just seems so silly in hindsight that I wouldn't waste my time."" The idea that there will be an entire voting bloc in 2016 with limited memory or interest in Lewinskygate is borne out by data. In a Survey Monkey survey conducted by Slate after the Vanity Fair article was announced, we asked several age groups what they remembered about the impeachment saga and how closely they followed it. The millennials in the survey, those aged 18 to 29 years old, have relatively little recollection of it. Only 46 percent of this subgroup said they remember it very or fairly well, compared with 69 percent of the total survey and 76 percent of all other groups. When you look at the younger range of millennials, the numbers become even starker. Only 28 percent of the younger group, between 18 and 24, remembers the story well. (It's understandable--some of them were toddlers!) Ten percent of this group remembers following it either very closely or fairly closely. ""Age is really important,"" in terms of how people view the Lewinsky affair, says Neil Howe, a co-author of the 2000 book Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation. ""As you go younger and younger, it gets more and more sort of lurid and weird."" We were curious how that stacked up against people's memory of other events, namely the Sept. 11 attacks, the O.J. Simpson trial, the Clarence Thomas hearings, the Iran-Contra hearings, Watergate, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy. We found that, except for the major historical events of JFK's assassination and the 9/11 attacks, the age cutoff for having strong memories and having followed big news events is around between 10 and 13 years old. A strong majority of people who were between ages of 11 and 16, about 63 percent, had vivid memories of the O.J. trial in 1995, while only 36 percent of the millennial group, who would have been 10 or younger at the time, remembers it well. That said, 50 percent of the people in the 6-10 age group in 1995 say they have some memory of the O.J. trial. The Clarence Thomas hearing saw a similar result with 14 percent of people in their 30s (7-16 age range at the time) having strong memories, compared with 35 percent of people in their 40s (17-26 age range). The numbers are similar for the Iran-Contra scandal as well, suggesting that those two events were less important to the public consciousness of young people than the O.J. trial. The exception to that early teenage cutoff seems to be big generation-defining events. For example, 82 percent of those older than 50 remember JFK's assassination in 1963, and 74 percent of all millennials said they followed coverage of 9/11 closely, while 85 percent said they remembered it well. Those numbers hold up when you look at the younger group who would have been between 5 and 11 at the time, of which 74 percent said they remembered 9/11 well. Still, for events that didn't qualify as world-shattering news, which the Clinton impeachment apparently did not, that 10-13 cutoff range appears sound. A colleague who was 13 years old at the time says he followed the news closely. ""I feel like people forget how explosive it really was [at the time],"" he said. ""Imagine Obama having a 'blue dress' situation on his hands. It would be unbelievable."" Many of those who were younger than 10 during the height of the scandal don't have any memory of the public outcry at all. They may be familiar with the Clinton impeachment trial, but it's often only because of a class they took in college. ""I never really learned about it in, like, a history class until this year, actually,"" says Ashley Motta, a 19-year-old freshman at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. Motta, who founded Saint Anselm's ""Ready for Hillary"" group--a college affiliate of the national super PAC that is urging Hillary to run for president, said, ""I've obviously learned second-hand and been learning more every day as the scandal keeps coming up."" To Motta, the Lewinsky saga is nothing more than some lurid reality TV precursor from before she was in elementary school that happens to be, strangely, a trending topic on Twitter now. ""Because I was so young when it happened, I see Hillary more as having had her own career separate from Bill,"" she says. ""As far as my campus, I think pretty much everyone feels the same way as me."" Caleb Cavarretta, a 21-year-old junior who co-founded the University of Missouri chapter of ""Ready for Hillary,"" agrees Clinton's impeachment isn't relevant to his life or the lives of his peers, and he also only learned the details because of a college class. ""I don't think there was any time that I ever had a conversation with a person my age about the scandal that wasn't started by a class discussion or something like that,"" he says. Cavarretta, who was 5 years old when the Lewinsky scandal broke, views the story with more bewilderment than anything else. ""The one common idea I've encountered when that's come up in a class has been this was kind of like--there's not a very strong understanding of why it was so significant in terms of how it affected the media."" For the most part, millennials have grown up with a completely different image of Bill and Hillary Clinton than their 1998 versions. They know President Clinton for his post-presidency, not his second-term scandal. Both Motta and Cavarretta note that there have been multiple incarnations of Hillary since the late 1990s--the senator, the presidential candidate, the secretary of state, and the candidate-in-waiting. Those are the Hillary Clintons they know. These views track closely with current poll data on the Clintons. In a Washington Post survey published at the start of this month, 77 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 39--those who would have been 2 to 23 during the height of the scandal--had a net favorable view of the Clinton family. When Howe, the co-author of Millennials Rising, has conducted interviews about Lewinsky, he says the saga is remembered by older millennials with a sort of ""titter"" or with ""embarrassment."" That was the exact response I got when I put the question to my 26-year-old sister's friends on Facebook. ""I have immense nostalgia for this whole event, and while I'm usually not one to pick up a Vanity Fair or be that interested in gossipy tell-alls, I'm really looking forward to reading Monica's piece,"" said one woman, who was 11 years old at the time. ""I mean, childhood in the '90s? Britney Spears, pogs, Nike pump shoes, and the Lewinsky scandal. It's a uniting generational event."" Today, when Beyonce sings about having her gown ""Monica Lewinsky'd"" upon, it's a funny callback for young people to their childhoods and not some hideous moral outrage. Either that, or it's a completely alien subject of little to no interest. ""It just doesn't come up,"" said the journalism and political science student Cavarretta, laughing. ""I don't think any young person takes it very seriously as being newsworthy."" Of course those of us who were following politics at the time remember it as a nearly seminal event. ""In the late '90s it seemed to make sense,"" says Howe. ""There weren't any big political or geopolitical crises to worry about. This is what was there. ... You can be excused for thinking it was very serious [at the time]."" In light of everything that has happened since--Bush v. Gore, 9/11, the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina, the financial crisis, Barack Obama's election--it obviously seems silly in retrospect. But more than that, it seems completely irrelevant as anything other than nostalgia fodder. Rehashing Lewinskygate is rightfully seen by young people as an unnecessary wallowing in a kind of historical embarrassment and curiosity. ""I think it can only be told so many ways,"" said Motta. ""I don't think anything new can really come of it."" Pay heed, Rand Paul."	Millennials Don't Care About Monica Lewinsky. Neither Should the Rest of Us.
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/mary_fallin_is_responsible_for_clayton_lockett_s_botched_execution_the_oklahoma.html	"Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin didn't just support the execution of convicted murderer Clayton Lockett. She wanted it, and she took every step possible to hasten the process. When the state Supreme Court issued a stay of execution so it could evaluate the state's opaque guidelines governing lethal injection, Fallin defied the decision with an order to continue, relying on threats--her Republican allies in the state Senate introduced impeachment resolutions against the offending justices--to strong-arm the court into backing down. The execution was a disaster. Lockett lived for 43 minutes after the initial injection, the first in an untried three-drug cocktail. Witnesses say he said the words ""oh, man"" and ""I'm not,"" while a prison official said, ""Something's wrong,"" before Lockett convulsed and officials closed the blinds. The execution process was eventually halted, but not before Lockett died of a heart attack. It was a horrifying display--a cruel and unusual execution that wouldn't have happened without Fallin's intervention. But rather than take responsibility for the mistake, the Oklahoma governor has lashed out, attacking critics for ignoring Lockett's crimes and making this an issue of tribal loyalty, not competence. ""What these out-of-state pundits consistently forget to mention or even consider,"" writes Fallin in a column published on Monday, ""are Lockett's victims."" After describing the crimes (robbery, kidnapping, sexual assault, murder) and the victims, she concludes, ""The people of Oklahoma do not have blood on their hands. They saw Clayton Lockett for what he was: evil. His execution means he will never again harm or terrorize another person."" But this is beside the point. No one disputes that Lockett was a despicable man who committed monstrous crimes. The problem is with the process that led to his execution. The events leading up to Lockett's death were an unprecedented display of judicial coercion from the executive and legislative branches of Oklahoma. Remember, this process began when a state judge declared unconstitutional a law that blocked public knowledge of the drugs used in lethal injections. The judge's reasoning--that denying the information limits access to the court and risks a violation of the Eighth Amendment--was borne out by previous executions in the state. When inmate Michael Lee Wilson was executed in January, he reportedly said, ""I feel my whole body burning,"" an event similar to Lockett's murmurs and spasms during his execution. But Fallin and her allies rejected this judicial decision. After the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals said it had no jurisdiction in the matter, the state Supreme Court stepped in to stay the execution. At this point, the Court of Criminal Appeals criticized the state Supreme Court for intruding on its territory, and Fallin refused to recognize the order altogether, saying that the court's ""attempted stay of execution is outside the constitutional authority of that body"" and that she ""cannot give effect to the order."" At best, Fallin's action was an improper approach to a delicate problem. At worst, it violated the state's separation of powers and set a dangerous precedent for future controversies. And Fallin is poised to get away with it. Yes, she's commissioned a review of the execution, but it's being conducted by the Department of Public Safety, which is led by a former employee of the governor--Michael Thompson, who worked at the Department of Corrections--who was also at the Lockett execution. Of course, the core issue at stake--what to do about the death penalty--goes beyond Fallin's grisly enthusiasm for the punishment. Lockett's execution wasn't the first botched lethal injection, and it won't be the last. For nearly a year, the United States has faced a shortage of drugs used in executions, and in response, states have turned to new drugs and formulas. A dwindling number of doctors want to participate in the practice, and a growing number of officials administering lethal injections are untrained and incompetent. In Lockett's case, for instance, prison staff failed to insert the IV into the proper artery, injecting drugs into his soft tissue and leaving him in terrible pain. Americans want clean, medical executions, but it's far from clear that these easy, painless deaths are possible. There's no doubt that Lockett was a terrible criminal--he buried his victim alive--but do we want a world where his torturous death is the norm? And if the evidence says we already live in that world--lethal injections have gone wrong in states across the country--are we OK with it? Indeed, of the thousands of men and women who sit on death row in the United States, how many more will die like Lockett? And while we know he was the worst of the worst, we also know that capital punishment is saturated with racial bias, most likely to fall on those with the least resources, and has claimed the lives of innocent people. Some people may deserve to die, and sometimes the system gets it right. But there are no guarantees, and for every person who is ""rightfully"" executed, how many are victims of our broken system? And do we care, or, like Gov. Fallin, are we content to say that--regardless of the circumstances--""Justice was served""?"	Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin Has Blood on Her Hands--Even If She Can't Admit It

There were 20 episodes. Some people called them ""primary debates."" In New Hampshire in January, one debate was held on a Saturday night and another the following Sunday morning, less than 12 hours apart. ""The number of debates has become ridiculous,"" wrote the authors of the post-2012 election GOP autopsy report commissioned to help the party determine what went wrong in the previous election. It wasn't just the quantity of the debates that was a problem. The quality wasn't great either. Because the polls favored candidates who had good theatrical performances, like Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich, the process put a premium on zingers, confrontations, and gaffes. (The lowlights: ""9-9-9,"" ""pious baloney,"" ""Oops,"" ""$10,000 bet."") The networks hosting the debates encouraged this behavior. As they competed to distinguish one bout from another, they hyped the events and inflated the stakes with each debate. Given the trajectory of absurdity, it seemed the next logical step was to arm the candidates with swords and let them go at it. The Republican National Committee is taking a step Wednesday to fix this problem. At the RNC's spring meeting, it will announce the formation of a standing committee on debates. The committee will select moderators, evaluate rules, and determine the number of debates. The total number is likely to be half of the previous cycle, and the committee will likely agree to remove delegates from any candidate who participates in a debate outside the party structure. The move will be a test of whether order can be restored to a primary process that gets more unpredictable every election, and whether grass-roots activists will tolerate the top-down meddling. The Republican Party has to step in because the candidates can't do it themselves. In 2012, campaign managers say they felt compelled to have their candidates participate in every televised debate because if they didn't, their opponents would show up and have a free 90 minutes to trash those who were absent. Various campaigns tried to convince their competitors to band together and agree to slow the pace, but someone always broke off and said yes to a network for the free airtime. Debates are a huge diversion from campaigning and raising money because they require at least a day of preparation, a day to compete, and a day to clean up or celebrate how the candidate did. Multiply that by 20 debates, and that's 60 days that are out of the campaign's control. The reasonable worry from anyone suspicious of party elders is that limiting the number of debates will give an advantage to candidates who have the backing and financial support of the party establishment. Scrappy candidates, or those who start late, who may not have that much money but thrill members of the movement, need debates to increase their exposure. But that's just what worries those who want to change the rules. They fear the party will be hijacked by charismatic but unqualified candidates who perform well in contests that do nothing to test whether a candidate is fit for office. These candidates don't have enough support to win, but they have enough to tear down the party's eventual nominee in a way that weakens him for the general election. The Republican Party wants an orderly process so that each candidate can put his best foot forward. We should all want that too. But those who were involved in the previous primary season say a number of other distractions still exist. Republican donors pressuring the RNC to make even more rule changes want conservatives to do the questioning, not journalists from the television networks. Conservative commentators understand the issues primary voters care about. If the networks want to cover the debates, they can cover them like they would a campaign rally. Critics of the current system also think this would cut down on the show business distractions. The debates have become a marketing opportunity for the networks. That means the shows and the anchors compete with the goal of getting quality answers from the candidates. What the networks want is car crashes, not information. ""It's a little like setting a fire to cover a fire,"" says Stuart Stevens, Mitt Romney's strategist for his presidential campaigns. The RNC is not breaking its relationship with the networks. The public policy reason is that journalists need to do the questioning, so that it doesn't look like the party is micromanaging democracy. The other reason is that debates are expensive for anyone who wants to host one (from $500,000 to $1 million, estimates the GOP autopsy report). Plus, the pool of people who can ask questions, manage the candidates, and keep time in a way that makes a broadcast worth watching is actually pretty small. In exchange for this expertise, the Republican Party will still allow news organizations to run the show but try to convince networks to salt in more conservative voices. But the media don't get all the blame. They're not the only ones who want to put on a good show. Candidates use debate performances to raise money, which is more important than ever to fund increasingly expensive campaigns and fight off super PAC challenges. Money follows buzz, and candidates will still be encouraged to court buzz by being good theater performers no matter how the RNC tries to control things. If the RNC is successful in bringing order to the debates, it will be the latest step in the resuscitation of the political parties. The future influence of the political parties was in question after soft money donations to parties were banned as a part of McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform and the Obama team successfully grew an organization that eclipsed the Democratic National Committee. Now after the Supreme Court's ruling in McCutcheon v. FEC, donations to the political parties are likely to increase. (The RNC is already taking advantage of the new rules.) The RNC is also working like mad to produce a permanent campaign apparatus that targets voters and turns them out to match the one the Obama team has built over the years. If the party creates a permanent structure that candidates can plug into when they run, that will give the party more control of the campaign process. For some, the death of the debate free-for-all may suggest the 2016 campaign will lack excitement. (You can stop practicing with the broadsword, Sen. Santorum.) But the GOP field will be the strongest it has been in recent memory, with five or more governors or former governors and at least three from the Senate. There will be plenty of heated debates."

A month earlier, however, a group of senior U.S. military officers rendered a much harsher judgment in private about the legacy of the 12-year U.S.-led intervention. The officers concluded in a report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Afghanistan's ability to serve its citizens' needs remains directly threatened by a deeply entrenched culture of corruption that not only defied the West's intervention but grew substantially worse because of it. The report, written by a division of the Joint Staff assigned to draw lessons for the future, was based on dozens of interviews with government officials and experts--including 11 flag or general military officers--and its judgments were approved by top commanders, according to a spokesman.
