Bush described the amount of money he could make from post-retirement speaking engagements as ""ridiculous."" He could have also been describing the speaking engagements themselves. Next week, Bush will headline a ""Get Motivated!"" business seminar in Fort Worth, Texas, a touring outfit run by motivational-speaking husband-and-wife duo Peter and Tamara Lowe. That's right--for only $19, you and your entire office can hear the former president of the United States talk about his formula for success! Other speakers include former quarterback Terry Bradshaw, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and former failed presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani. Bush is hardly the first ex-president to talk for money after leaving office. President Reagan once got $2 million from a Japanese manufacturing company for two 20-minute speeches. George H.W. Bush made millions speaking to businesses across the world. Bill Clinton reaped more than $56 million in speaking fees between 2000 and 2008. But unlike his predecessors, Bush is probably the least articulate buckraking ex-president ever. So I called a few motivational speakers to ask what advice they could offer him. Most of the speakers gave the obvious (but no less true for being so) advice: Be yourself. ""The most important thing he can do is to be the genuine, flexible, warm kind of personality that I've seen up close that he has capacity of being,"" says Les Brown, the self-described ""world's leading motivational speaker."" Another professional speaker, Mark Victor Hansen, attested to Bush's vitality in person. ""When no cameras were on, he was winging it--bright, exciting, lively. He actually had a personality."" Translating that personality to the stage means presenting himself as a human being with relatable foibles. ""We know him as a president,"" says Scott Greenberg, a Los Angeles-based ""expert on resilience, leadership and peak performance."" ""We know less about him as a human being having the job of president."" What does that mean in practice? Tell stories. Pull back the curtain. Talk about your mistakes and what you learned from them. Reflecting on lessons learned has not been Bush's greatest strength. In outgoing interviews, he resisted self-analysis. But he is in the process of writing his memoir, and reflection is key to motivational speaking, say experts. ""Most speakers are sharing some of their life experience, what they learned from it, and how we can incorporate that knowledge without having to go through their experience,"" says Brad Montgomery, a ""corporate humorist"" who teaches executives ""how to use levity and lightheartedness to increase their bottom line."" ""He doesn't have to admit he was an idiot to go into Iraq. ... He should talk about small things--the time he goofed protocol with a small country or mispronounced X."" Which raises a separate problem: Bush can't speak. No one expects him to be another Les Brown. But he makes George Bush the Elder look eloquent. ""I'm astounded how bad he is as a speaker,"" says Montgomery, especially considering how often Bush had to give speeches while president. You'd think that, with repetition, he would have gained some skills: ""You can teach any guitar player how to get through 'Hotel California' if you give them enough time. I think President Bush is not really there with 'Hotel California.' "" It's not so much that he has to deliver a stirring speech, says Brown: ""He doesn't have to be a great orator. Whatever worked for him to become most powerful man in the world will work for him here."" Motivational speakers come in different forms. There's the stage-pacing, arm-waving style of Tony Robbins. Then there's the more laid-back teleprompter and podium style. Bush may be the latter, and that's OK. Of course, there's another theory: It doesn't even matter if he's a good speaker, says Greenberg. He's a celebrity. ""There's an inverse relationship between how famous you are and how good you need to be."" Plus, he's got the best material in the world. ""Even if he doesn't tell his stories that well,"" says Greenberg, ""they're gonna be great stories."" Not everyone thinks motivational speaking is Bush's calling. ""I think it's both a poor choice for him and a poor fit,"" says John Di Frances, who calls himself a ""content speaker."" (Content as in substance, not as in happy.) ""They're looking for people who are super rah-rah cheerleader people. George W. Bush is not that."" Indeed, motivational speaking conventions are usually more rock concert than fireside chat, with a heavy dose of infomercial. Bush could risk coming off not just un-presidential, but foolish. ""It's a performance-based thing,"" says Di Frances. ""If you don't have great stage skills, that's not the place for you. They're Barnum & Bailey stuff."" Whatever he says, agreement is near unanimous that he should not discuss current events. ""He should stay away from politics,"" says Brown. ""I think he has to elevate the conversation to who we should be as a people."" Greenberg agrees: ""He should stay out of the policy debate, given that we're still dealing with issues that were part of his presidency,"" like terrorism and a sagging economy. Save that stuff for 2020. There was also consensus that Bush has the potential to be a great presenter. The question is whether arena-based motivational speaking--as opposed to, say, one-on-one discussions followed by a Q&A--is really his calling. Speakers were split, however, on whether Bush should acknowledge his unpopularity. (His approval rating, which sank to 28 percent when he left office, has since risen to 33 percent.) ""I think he needs to speak to that coming out,"" says Brown. Luckily for Bush, it should be a supportive audience. Fort Worth is Bush country, and business owners are Bush people. A friendly audience, a nonthreatening agenda, and a cast of luminaries to back him up: It sounds a lot like a presidential town hall, circa 2004. Maybe this is the perfect venue for Bush after all."	Motivational speaking advice for George W. Bush.

It should also please conservatives who champion states' rights as the highest political ideal. But unlike most policies with such broad support, it might actually accomplish something. The new memo, written by Deputy Attorney General David Ogden, urges district attorneys to defer to local marijuana laws rather than federal law, which prohibits all consumption and sales of the drug. The new policy is remarkably uncontroversial. Two-thirds of Americans think marijuana should be legal for medicinal purposes. Obama promised during his campaign to reduce crackdowns on dispensaries; opposition was minimal. Attorney General Eric Holder said in March that the crackdowns would stop and met with little objection. Monday's memo simply made it official. ""This is a very safe policy,"" says Bruce Mirken of the Marijuana Policy Project. ""There's no constituency for going after sick people."" On the one hand, the decision to defer to state laws means that existing local drug policies--however strict or lax--will remain in place. But on the other, many states take their cues from the federal government when it comes to drug policy. States could take the new policy as a tacit nod from Uncle Sam to go ahead and allow medical marijuana back home. Take California. It has long experience with medical marijuana--voters approved the drug for sick people back in 1996--yet in many ways the state stands as a cautionary tale of what not to do. The main problem is that the California law is vaguely worded: It says patients can use marijuana for medical purposes, they can grow it, and they can buy it. But it doesn't specifically authorize anyone to start a pot business. The law's vagueness has led to roughly 1,000 dispensaries sprouting up in Los Angeles County since 2002. Now local law-enforcement officials are promising to bust them up, arguing that the law allows only nonprofit businesses. Ogden's new memo won't change that. If you run a medical marijuana business in Los Angeles that the state deems illegal, the federal government can't help you. In fact, it can still raid your facility. The only dispensaries that will benefit directly from the new federal policy are those that were raided by the DEA under the Bush administration despite complying with California statutes. (President Bush claimed they violated the Controlled Substances Act, which prohibits the growing and consumption of marijuana.) But if California courts agree with the Los Angeles County district attorney that ""about 100 percent of dispensaries in Los Angeles County and the city are operating illegally,"" those vendors are out of luck. Where the new federal guidelines could have an effect is on states currently considering medical marijuana laws. Right now, 13 states allow some degree of medical marijuana consumption. (There are 14 if you count Maryland, which reduces the penalty if the marijuana you're caught using is for medical purposes.) Another dozen or so have bills moving through their legislature. In many cases, lawmakers have been skittish about OKing dispensaries for fear that the Drug Enforcement Administration would come and shut them down. Now that's no longer a concern. The memo also changes the way the federal government treats marijuana vendors in states that already allow medical marijuana. The drug is technically legal for medical purposes in New Mexico, but the only person with a license to sell it has refused reveal her identity for fear of federal punishment. Without that looming threat, the number of dispensaries is likely to increase. Most states take their cues from the federal government on drug policy. The practice traces back to passage of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which aimed to create a uniform set of drug regulations across the country. During the drug war in the 1980s and '90s, the federal government started awarding grants to help states with law enforcement in exchange for aligning their drug policies with federal guidelines. So when the federal government signals its preference not to pursue medical marijuana users, states may take the cue. First in line is probably New Jersey. Gov. Jon Corzine has said that if a medical marijuana bill landed on his desk, he'd sign it. In a recent debate, his two electoral opponents made the same promise. The state's Democratic leadership now expects a bill to pass the legislature some time in late November. ""We're already getting calls from people in Atlantic City buying store fronts,"" says Allen St. Pierre of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Massachusetts voters could approve a similar bill as soon as 2010, and Gov. Deval Patrick seems inclined to sign it. New York Gov. David Paterson would probably sign a medical marijuana bill, but the chaotic state legislature seems unlikely to produce one. Massachusetts and New York and Ohio have already decriminalized marijuana but haven't gotten around to legalizing medicinal marijuana consumption. The popular will is there--it's just a matter of time. In his memo, Ogden stresses that this is not a small step on the slippery slope toward legalization: ""This guidance regarding resource allocation does not 'legalize' marijuana or provide a legal defense to a violation of federal law."" But the memo is still a strong symbolic deprioritization of low-level marijuana enforcement. Given limited resources, it says, we should focus on serious drug traffickers rather than small-time consumers. The law also sets a precedent for leaving hot-button issues to the states. No one is saying--not yet, anyway--that if the federal government believes it should defer to the states on marijuana laws, then it should also defer to the states on, say, marriage laws. But the argument wouldn't be that much of a stretch. It's just ironic that the debate would take place under a liberal Democratic president."	Will Obama's new medical marijuana directive actually change anything?
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/pig_pile.html	"Swine flu may have an unexpected side effect: political unity. The far left and far right agree that they're sure as heck not getting vaccinated against swine flu. On the anti-government right, swine flu vaccinations are seen as an example of government overreach. Last week, Rush Limbaugh made headlines by announcing that he would not be getting a shot. ""Screw you, Ms. Sebelius,"" he said on his radio show, referring to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. ""I'm not going to take it precisely because you're now telling me I must."" Glenn Beck has declined to say whether he's getting vaccinated. But he's made his position pretty clear, suggesting that the vaccine may turn out to be ""deadly,"" raising the specter of mandatory vaccines (they're voluntary), and saying he wants the ""U.S. out of my bloodstream."" On the left, there are prominent doctors, lawyers, and Hollywood celebrities skeptical of vaccines in general--and the swine flu vaccine especially. In a September article written for the Huffington Post, Dr. Frank Lipman recommended against getting vaccinated, arguing that the virus seems benign and the vaccine is unproven. Earlier this year, Jim Carrey--yes, that Jim Carrey--penned a HuffPost column reiterating the oft-made (and widely discredited) point that vaccines may cause autism. Robert F. Kennedy made a similar argument in a famous (and also largely discredited) 2005 article that appeared in Rolling Stone and Salon. The anti-vaccination movement is hardly exclusive to the left wing, but declines in vaccination rates have occurred in large part because of affluent parents in states like California. Now, thanks to the government's plan to ship 250 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine to all 50 states this month, the two sides have finally found common cause. They may hold different political opinions, but they share a worldview: distrust--of doctors and modern medicine or of government. There's even some overlap. Beck, for example, said that ""you don't know if this is gonna cause neurological damage like it did in the 1970s""--a fear commonly cited by vaccine skeptics. (Claims that the 1976 flu vaccine caused Guillain-Barre syndrome have not been proven.) Meanwhile, those who fear the needle aren't all that confident in their government, either: Dr. Lipman warns that HHS has given the drug companies manufacturing the vaccines immunity from lawsuits. HHS created a ""Myths vs. Facts"" page last week to address both types of qualms. First among them is the concern that swine flu shots are mandatory. ""The federal government's vaccination program for H1N1 flu is VOLUNTARY,"" the site explains, dismissing an online petition that states otherwise as ""simply false."" Lower down, HHS addresses concerns that the vaccine can cause unrelated illnesses like heart attacks, miscarriages, or Guillain-Barre syndrome: ""These events are no more common among people who have received seasonal flu vaccine than in people who have not."" Some of the myths circulating are neither left crazy nor right crazy, but simply crazy. Several Web sites have suggested that H1N1 is a vehicle for the government to implant microchips in our bodies to detect ""bio-threats."" At least one site posits that the vaccine contains a ""Bible Code"" connecting swine flu to prophesies in the Book of Revelation. HHS has yet to debunk this one. (See other common swine flu myths here.) Myth-busting is familiar territory for the Obama administration. In 2008, his campaign created a Web site, Fight the Smears, to counter suggestions that Obama was not born in the United States and that Michelle Obama was caught on video using the epithet whitey. But vaccine fact-checking is different. While most of the campaign-era claims came from the right, HHS has to fend off misinformation from both sides of the aisle. That means not just correcting the record but doing so without offending potential allies. Given the heightened emotion around vaccines, that's not easy. Hence the respectful and straight-faced answer to whether you can get swine flu by eating pork. What explains the bizarre alliance? It turns out anti-vaccine hysteria has always been a bipartisan issue. The last major American vaccine scares occurred in 1976, under a Republican administration. Under both Bushes, many troops stationed in the Persian Gulf refused to take the vaccine against anthrax. Trypanophobia is also common across demographics. A recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that only 40 percent of adults were sure they'd get vaccinated. Among the reasons parents gave for not getting their child vaccinated, No. 3 was that they ""don't trust public health officials to provide correct info about vaccine safety."" Young people are no better, even though they're especially at-risk for contracting swine flu. Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology at Columbia University, recently polled a class of 50 students on who was going to get vaccinated against swine flu. Not a single hand went up. ""I was teaching them about influenza in that lecture, so maybe I didn't do a good job,"" Racaniello recalls. Indeed, there's nothing more universal than fear of shots. ""I just think there are people wired that way,"" says Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic. ""They operate on the basis of emotion and anecdote--what they read at the University of Google--rather than a fact-based or data-driven point of view.""In the 19th century, people thought the cowpox vaccine would cause pieces of cow to grow out of their arms. Canadian medical giant William Osler was widely mocked when he urged British troops at the beginning of World War I to get inoculated against typhoid fever. The French government stopped offering vaccinations for hepatitis B in schools in 1998 while it investigated the relationship between shots and multiple sclerosis. (Subsequent studies found no causation.) Still, the current political climate is a veritable petri dish for swine flu fears. For one thing, the debate over health care reform has already stirred up suspicions that the government will use medicine to hurt the American people. (The charges range from well-intentioned negligence to conspiratorial world domination.) Meanwhile, post-Katrina, lack of disaster preparation is unacceptable. Politicians would rather overreact than underrreact. Then, of course, there's the Internet echo chamber and the vague paranoia surrounding Obama. A caller recently told Glenn Beck that ""if this were five years ago, I'd probably say definitely, I'll take it [the vaccine]."" Perhaps there's a simpler, more elegant explanation for why members of both political extremes refuse to get vaccinated: natural selection."	Why the far left and the far right both oppose swine flu vaccinations.
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/the_wizard_of_oslo.html	"It came a week late, but President Obama did win the gold. Last Friday, the International Olympic Committee stiffed him. Today, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. He should probably leave his schedule open next Friday, because apparently anything can happen. It was the second time in three years that the peace prize went to someone trying to create a new international climate. In 2007, Al Gore shared the prize for his efforts to combat global warming. Explaining this year's selection, the committee credited Obama not for concrete accomplishments but for atmospheric ones. ""Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world's attention and given its people hope for a better future,"" the committee said. ""His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world's population."" Having worked at Time magazine when it occasionally named a Person of the Year who evoked a similar ""Huh?"" reaction, I recognize this language: It is the sound of words groaning for a rationale. The committee can, of course, pick whomever it wants. But in his 1895 will, Alfred Nobel stipulated that the peace prize should go ""to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses."" ""Shall have done,"" seems a tricky piece of language to write around. This makes the committee's statement sounds more like a wish list. It's not that Obama has done nothing. It's that so much about his presidency is preliminary. (I'm not counting the beer summit.) Other recipients--Nelson Mandela, Elie Wiesel, and Lech Walesa--seem more aptly to hit the ""have done"" mark. Others who might not be household names, like Muhammad Yunus, make sense on inspection. On the other hand, Obama may fit the bill more than some other recipients. At least he hasn't actively been engaged in making warfare, as were previous recipients Henry Kissinger and Yasser Arafat. Then again, Obama is considering whether to send more troops into Afghanistan, one of America's two wars. Obama took office less than 10 days before the Feb. 1 deadline for Nobel Prize nominations. It was not a weak field. This year there were 205 submissions, more than ever. Obama was not a part of the pregame speculation, which had centered on human rights activists in China and Afghanistan and political figures in Africa. Human rights activists in China must be particularly miffed, since the Obama administration has downplayed China's bad human rights record. The committee of five Norwegians has a more relaxed standard than Saturday Night Live, which recently poked fun at Obama  for his lack of accomplishments, and Arizona State University, which declined to award him an honorary degree because of his inexperience. Obama is not the first president, sitting or former, to win the award. In 1906, Theodore Roosevelt won the award. In 1919, Woodrow Wilson did. In 2002, Jimmy Carter took home the prize. Today's announcement may test the empathy of Bill Clinton, who has devoted his post-presidency to global health and peace initiatives. The news came as such a shock that White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs responded to CBS News White House Correspondent Peter Maer with one word: ""Wow."" Gibbs phoned the president at 6 a.m. to give him the news. The award has essentially been given for the president's speechmaking ability, which means his political handlers made the right call by sending him to Berlin during last year's election. The prize highlights the juxtaposition between the 44th and 43rd presidents: from a verbally challenged leader who seemed at time to revel in shunning world opinion to a wordsmith who came to office promising to embrace the globe. The award will feed into the automatic sorting mechanism of politics. Conservatives who scoffed that Obama's Olympic defeat meant a drop in prestige should, by the same logic, herald this as an even greater spike in the same. They won't, because no one gets a prize for consistency. Other parties that benefit from the prize are the producers at Fox News, who now know what they're going to talk about this weekend. Pundits win because the Nobel committee has validated the idea that speeches and atmospherics are really important. The award also offers the opportunity for all of us elites to do what we do best, which is miss how regular people might react. While we're talking about how the Nobel committee has jumped the shark, some people might like that a president who they elected, in part, to improve America's image in the world has been rewarded for it. One debate will be whether Obama should turn down the prize, as Slate's Mickey Kaus suggests. That would be a slap to the committee, but since awards are being given for atmospherics, let's consider the atmospherics of such a move. Obama could easily write the justifying language: He's honored and humbled but he has merely articulated the common aspirations of all mankind. As it is mankind's global challenge, no one man can claim a prize with so much work left to be done. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us. (Ben Rhodes and Jon Favreau could certainly find the language.) In the quarters where his speechmaking and diplomatic flair are praised, such a performance will only enhance his reputation. His critics will be dumbfounded. The arrogance rap will fade. Obama would immediately become the favorite for next year's Nobel Prize for Humility."	What will Obama do with his Nobel Peace Prize?
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/the_invasion_of_the_bill_snatchers.html	"The health care reform legislation moving through Congress goes by several names, such as Obamacare and socialized medicine. Soon it is likely to get another: We can call it the AIG bill. This isn't a euphemism; it's the shorthand used in the Senate for the actual bill that will contain the health care legislation Washington has been working on all summer. The AIG bill was not intended to be a health care bill when it came into this world in March. When the House passed it as H.R. 1586, it was meant to regulate the compensation of the executives of firms, like AIG, that received TARP funds. Now, though, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid may scoop out its insides and insert the health care bill. Just in time for Halloween. This isn't quite body-snatching--or, rather, bill-snatching. Creating a ""shell bill,"" as it's called, is a legislative gimmick used by both parties that allows the Senate to work around the language of the Constitution (somewhat like a reverse merger in business). Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution, also known as the origination clause, reads in part: ""All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives."" So if the Senate wants to go first, it has to find a bill that has already passed in the House and make that the vehicle for the new legislation. What usually happens is that a senator offers an amendment that is actually a whole new bill to an existing bill that the House has already approved. The Senate is proceeding in this case because the House isn't yet ready with its health care legislation. That's partially because the House has three bills that have to be melded into one, and it takes time to make such a turducken. House leaders have also been consciously moving no faster than their Senate colleagues because they don't want to pay a penalty for going first. House leaders don't want Democrats to have to make difficult votes on controversial legislation and then get abandoned by the Senate if it never takes up a bill. House Democrats remember when, in the early months of the Clinton administration, they reluctantly backed a proposed tax on each unit of energy consumed--the so-called BTU tax. The Senate ignored it. Republicans seized on the tax, clubbing their Democratic opponents with it as they took control of the House the following year. In the health care debate, House Democrats worry, among other things, that the Senate may not support the surcharge on wealthy Americans that the House version uses to raise revenue. Are Democratic Senate leaders up to something sneaky by using a shell bill? The Framers might think so. The origination clause was created in the careful arrangements made to preserve and enforce the separation of powers. Members at the Constitutional Convention also wanted the power to tax in the hands of those members of the legislature who had to answer directly to the people. (Direct popular election of senators did not come until 1913.) The House can protect its prerogatives by ""blue slipping"" measures the leadership does not approve of. (It's called ""blue slipping"" because the resolution returning the offending bill to the Senate is printed on blue paper. And, we like to think, because their Senate colleagues become sad when this is done to them.) ""I do not deny their [the Senate's] right to send back a bill of a thousand pages as an amendment to our two lines,"" said Rep. James A. Garfield after the House had tabled a Senate bill in 1872. ""But I do insist that their thousand pages must be on the subject matter of our bill."" More recently, in 2006, then-Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas threatened to blue-slip an immigration bill that originated in the Senate. In response, his Republican colleague in the Senate, Majority Leader Bill Frist, scraped out a bill on the Alternative Minimum Tax that had originated in the House and made it the immigration bill. In the last session, the TARP legislation was passed as a shell bill (it started out as the mental health parity bill), as was the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which had once been a green-jobs bill. The definition of what constitutes a ""revenue bill"" is still up for grabs, since the founders left the definition so vague. Over time, the courts and House custom have determined the Senate can perform this switcheroo as long as the Senate does not initiate bills whose primary purpose is raising funds for the general operation of the federal government. The House, often finding the parliamentary procedure in its interest, has objected only a little more than once a year over the last 20 years. Both Republicans and Democrats have used the trick while in the majority. Even in this season of hair-trigger umbrage, Republican Senate leadership aides aren't very worked up that Democrats are going to invoke this standard procedure. You can, however, make the case that the dual-track approach is a part of the general hurry-up strategy that is a blow to transparency and thorough consideration. Administration and Democratic leaders have always believed that any delay in the process gives critics more time to gather strength. If the Senate were not allowed to begin debate until it received the House bill, that would extend the process a few weeks. Some conservatives worry the shell bill might turn into a shell game. Because the shell bill started in the House, it is possible House Democratic leaders could vote on it directly after the Senate is done with its work. That would really speed up the process. There would be no House amendments, no debate about those amendments, and no conference process to reconcile House and Senate versions of the health care legislation. When House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer was asked whether he might take this expedited approach, he ducked, refusing to rule it out, which undoubtedly made many Republicans nervous. But leadership aides in both chambers say this scenario is far-fetched. It would require House Democrats to shelve all of their ideas about health care and remove themselves from the process, which isn't going to happen. That's probably good--because then health care reform would win a name unmentionable in polite company."	How the Senate can finesse the Constitution to pass health care reform.
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/chicago_loses_nerds_win.html	"On Friday in Copenhagen, the International Olympic Committee got Chicago's best shot. President Obama flew in to stump for the city's bid for the 2016 Olympics, joining Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. It wasn't enough: Chicago lost out in the first round of voting, a shocking defeat for the odds-on favorite to win the 2016 games. Back in the Windy City, not everybody is disappointed at Chicago's loss. Despite more than 50 community meetings and a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign aimed at winning over the city through inescapable advertising, the city's Olympics gambit started to lose favor as the IOC's announcement approached. A recent Chicago Tribune/WGN poll pegged public support at 47 percent, down from 61 percent in February. Why the grumbling? The bid's most visible opponents have spent years howling that the Olympics will breed graft and political corruption and bleed an already cash-strapped city dry. Chicago 2016's supporters, by contrast, have argued that the Olympics will improve the city's standing, create jobs, and boost local morale. The debate here wasn't best understood as an honest disagreement over what's best for Chicago. Rather, the rhetoric was indicative of a more fundamental clash: the eternal battle of jocks vs. nerds. For two years, wonks like Ben Joravsky of the  Chicago Reader and Tom Tresser of No Games Chicago have denounced Chicago's Olympics gambit as poorly conceived and wasteful. These stalwarts of the city's nerd opposition have couched their arguments in numbers, rules, and historical precedent, hoping to persuade the Games' supporters through tireless skepticism. Joravsky, Tresser, and their ilk have noted that the city of Chicago hasn't completed a significant construction project on time or on budget in recent memory. On that account, the predicted $3.3 billion cost of the Games can't be taken seriously. It doesn't help that the city's finances are a mess. Chicago's budget deficit has soared from $200 million six months ago to an estimated $500 million next year, and the city has been laying people off and forcing municipal employees to take unpaid furloughs. The Second City's recent parking meter boondoggle, in which it sold its meter stock to a private firm for $974 million less than its estimated value, shows it is incapable of executing a project on the scale of the Olympics, the nerds say. The anti-Olympians also point out that the Olympics won't bring nearly as much money to the region as Chicago 2016's supporters allege. Research from an independent consulting firm estimates the Olympics would bring $4.4 billion in economic benefits to the area, much less than the $22 billion figure Mayor Daley has been promoting. Daley and the bid committee also promised Chicago taxpayers would not be on the hook for covering cost overruns. Yet during a trip to pitch the Chicago bid to the IOC in Switzerland this last June, he agreed to sign a contract guaranteeing the city will cover any losses incurred by the Olympics. According to that recent Tribune/WGN poll, 84 percent of Chicagoans oppose the use of public funds for the Olympics. Yet nearly 50 percent of city residents support bringing the games to the Midwest.  The pro-Olympics crowd has been won over by the jocks of the Chicago 2016 bid committee, a group led by Aon Corp. founder and part-owner of the Chicago Bears Pat Ryan. * The jocks have offered a much simpler message than the nerds: The 2016 Olympics represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show the world how fantastic Chicago really is. The Summer Games, they argue, will boost tourism and improve the city's global standing. Though the Chicago 2016 committee has produced a detailed plan for the IOC that lays out the logistics of paying for and hosting the Games, its message to Chicagoans has emphasized emotion. A recent Huffington Post article by bid chairman Ryan has no numbers. Rather than explain the committee's financial plan, Ryan simply calls it ""strong"" and cautions readers from throwing in with the naysayers who are too afraid of the scale of the Olympics to take them on. Translation: ""Shut up, nerds. The Games are going to be awesome!"" The hard-to-refute fuzziness of concepts like ""the world stage"" and a city's ""global profile"" resonate with large segments of the public. They also drive nerds into a rage by giving them no data to refute. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the two sides are talking past each other, appealing to their constituencies by speaking different languages. We see this same jocks-vs.-nerds conflict play out every time a pro sports team threatens to skip town unless the taxpayers cough up money for a new stadium. The opposition to these arena grabs typically consists of good-government types who argue that the alleged economic impact of the new building is greatly inflated--and wouldn't that money be better spent on education? The jocks play to municipal pride and the desire for the beloved local team to stay in town. And usually, though not always, the stadium gets built. Who in America has the power and the bona fides to end this perpetual jock-nerd standoff? If anyone can do it, it's President Obama. With his professed fondness for comic books and his prowess on the basketball court, he speaks both nerd and jock. And having agreed at the last minute to fly to Copenhagen to stump for the Games, he put himself at the center of the dysfunctional local shouting match. In the end, even the so-called ""biggest celebrity in the world"" couldn't win over the IOC. Now that he's lost out in his bid to bring the Olympics to his adopted home town, he can turn to less intractable matters--health care reform, Afghanistan--than the country's jock-nerd crisis.

That was the rough consensus among the economists who convened Wednesday at the Washington Court Hotel for a conference held by the Center for American Progress and the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities: We absolutely have to do something about this deficit. Just not right now. Their advice is on the merits, but it just so happens to be politically convenient. We wanted to reduce the deficit, the White House and congressional Democrats can say, but the experts told us not to! In economics as in politics, timing is everything. Before the economists gave the politicians permission not to act right away, however, they established the need to do something eventually. Right now, CBPP President Robert Greenstein said, the annual deficit is about 8 percent of gross domestic product, while the national debt--the sum of all past deficits--is about 70 percent of GDP, or $10 trillion. If current policy persists, the deficit will inflate to become 20 percent of GDP by 2050, with a total national debt of 300 percent of GDP. (The main reason for the ballooning deficit is Medicare and Medicaid spending, but Social Security plays a role, too.) If those numbers don't scare you, maybe the practical consequences will. Princeton professor Alan Blinder explored the possibilities. Inflation? ""I don't think we're going to see that in the United States,"" he said, even though it happens all the time in other countries when debt mounts. Skyrocketing interest rates? That's a ""very obvious candidate."" But the most likely risk, he said, is a weakening dollar: ""If the economy cracks, it cracks on the dollar."" A plummeting dollar means less economic influence in the global market, less purchasing power when it comes to foreign investment, and, above all, unhappy creditors. China, which currently has some $2 trillion invested in American dollars, would probably refinance in some other currency. Another possibility, said Blinder, is that the political system cracks first. He cited the New Deal as an example of a good political crackup. What a mountain of debt could mean for our political system, he said, ""I wouldn't even begin to forecast."" A questioner, however, did just that. Recall 1992, he said, when Ross Perot ran on a platform of deficit reduction. Perot didn't win, but his influence--he drew enough votes to allow Bill Clinton to become president--produced a bipartisan obsession with deficit reduction, which occupied much of Clinton's first term. ""It's highly likely we're about to see that happen again,"" he said. So if the stakes are so high and the future so dire, why wait? Why not eliminate the deficit now, while we're talking about it? Because the economy is still fragile. The recession is officially over, sure, but unemployment is still high--it rose to 9.8 percent in September--and a full recovery will take time. As Berkeley economist Laura Tyson put it, ""We have two risks: If we do something too precipitously fast, we undermine recovery ... but if we don't do something,"" we risk the dystopian future described above. The first deficit-reduction measure--health care reform--is already on the table. Health care spending is by far the biggest driver of the deficit, the panelists reminded the audience. ""No path to a balanced budget doesn't go through health care,"" said Harvard professor David Cutler. Bend the curve (""Whoever is responsible for that phrase should be shot,"" said Krugman) and we're well on our way to digging out. Aside from that, we should start thinking about getting ready to maybe soon reduce the deficit. The word Tyson used was pre-commit. The idea: pass now deficit reduction legislation that kicks in as soon as the economy stabilizes. That would reassure creditors now that we're serious about paying off our debt. Robert Reischauer, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, agreed. He called for immediate action, perhaps as soon as next year's budget. However, he said, ""I'm not talking about tax increases. I'm talking about putting in policies that kick in when the economy is stronger."" There's just one problem: Deficit reduction may be politically impossible, now or later. A surprise cameo by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin reinforced the point. Taking the mic, Rubin reminded the panel that in 1993, during his tenure, the Deficit Reduction Act passed by a single vote in the House and required the vice president to break a tie in the Senate. ""Not exactly a dramatic rallying around with respect to fiscal discipline,"" he said. ""So what would make you think that our political system is likely to respond more effectively today?"" Reischauer had similar doubts. ""I think it's very unrealistic,"" he told me in the hallway. ""I'm more cynical about it than anyone in this room."" Our political system is ill-equipped to reduce deficits, he said. Members of Congress are afraid to vote for deficit reduction, since they assume it means losing the next election. That's what happened to Democrats after 1993, and it could happen again. What are they supposed to tell their constituents? We're going to give your tax dollars to foreigners in order to pay off debt incurred long ago for reasons we don't agree with. Unlikely. ""They're not dumb or without courage,"" Reischauer said. ""I would act exactly the same way and you would too.""As a result, short-term self-interest trumps long-term economic well-being, and the deficit keeps growing. How to get around this paradox is an open question. Greenstein suggested incrementalism: a bit of deficit reduction here, a bit there. Once members realize that voting for fiscal responsibility won't kill their electoral chances, the political calculus will change.""My hope is that people don't get punished,"" he said. Krugman strained for optimism: ""What we have to hope is that 10 years from now we will have a much saner political landscape,"" he said. John Podesta, president of the Center for American Progress who lived through the Clinton deficit debate, was ambivalent on whether rewards or punishment awaited deficit hawks: ""The jury's out on that."" Blinder was dubious: ""I don't think Congress will do a thing like that,"" he said. ""But that doesn't stop professors like me from saying what I think Congress should do."""	Liberal economists think we should reduce the deficit. Just not yet.
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/infinite_loop.html	"When Paul Begala came up with the phrase ""the comeback kid"" to spin Bill Clinton's second-place showing in the New Hampshire primary in 1992, he may have been making a deeper observation than he knew. At any given moment, Clinton seems to be winning your admiration, squandering it, or putting every ounce of his energy into regaining it. He's at his best in a corner. But after a while, you begin to notice that it is always the same person who puts him in the corner. There's a Houdini element to the performance. Clinton allows himself to be bound in chains so that he can emerge to amazement and applause. He's like a fireman whose hobby is arson. The Clintonian loop of accomplishment, self-sabotage, and recovery means that whoever you are--a member of the public, a journalist covering him, an aide, his wife--it is impossible to maintain any kind of consistent attitude toward him. If you invest your hopes in him, he will disappoint you. If you fall in love with him, he will cheat on you. And if you decide you're giving up on him once and for all, he will move heaven and earth to get you back. This routine, embedded since childhood, will continue until the day he dies. It played out most recently in the 2008 election. Clinton helped to undermine his wife's presidential chances and infuriated even his most ardent defenders by diminishing Barack Obama's primary victories and dismissing his popularity as a ""fairy tale."" Through the first half of last year, everyone was completely disgusted with him. But the ex-president has been on his best behavior ever since, and we've all forgiven him once again For an inside look at this cycle, enablers can now turn to a curious artifact,  The Clinton Tapes. Taylor Branch, the author of a magisterial three-volume biography of Martin Luther King Jr. and a friend of Bill and Hillary's from the 1972 McGovern campaign, coaxed the president into sitting for 79 recorded interviews spanning his eight years in office. The tapes were made as a historical record for unspecified future use. Clinton expected to draw upon them when he wrote his memoirs and eventually make them available to historians. Because of various sensitivities, the project was kept secret from all but a few essential helpers. Branch would meet the president in the White House residence, often late at night, and gently interrogate him about events of the previous weeks and months. At the end of each session, Branch would hand his recordings over to his subject. Clinton kept the tapes but, true to form, procrastinated for so long on his memoirs that he finally had no time to make much use of them in churning out that windy doorstop. Branch, however, kept his own unofficial record of the unofficial record, dictating a reconstruction of each session immediately afterward, usually while driving back to his home in Baltimore. He draws on his version, for though the new book seems to come with Clinton's tacit blessing, Branch did not have access to the actual tapes. To the mostly paraphrased account, he adds ruminations on his multiply conflicted role--friend, speechwriter, unpaid adviser, historian, journalist, and freelance advocate for Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted and then restored president of Haiti--but only minimal interpretation of his own. A more apt subtitle for the book might have been ""Wrestling with the president to get back to the point."" During his conversations with Branch, Clinton would sometimes stick to the chronicle and sometimes rage or ramble about whatever was on his mind--Bosnia, golf, Maureen Dowd, golf, the Razorbacks, Ken Starr, golf, and the bottomless category of miscellaneous but irrelevant. I did not know that Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, has a higher proportion of trees to landmass than any national capital other than Washington, D.C. Nor did I know that most players use an iron to cross the water hazard on a tricky par-4 hole at Deerfield Beach. At times, Clinton seems like someone trying to win the Trivia Bowl. To wade through nearly 700 pages of such asides, meanderings, and tirades about the press is to relive in miniature the kind-of-interesting-kind-of-boring talkathon that was the Clinton presidency. In one meeting just after the catastrophic defeat of 1994, when the Democrats lost both houses of Congress because of Clinton's tax increase, Branch arrives to find the president dead asleep in the barber's chair. Clinton is roused with difficulty, then nods off some more while a tailor adjusts his suits to accommodate his swelling waistline. Woken again, he ranges brilliantly across matters domestic and international, but ""again and again, he fell asleep while talking,"" Branch records. Clinton's endless stream of table talk has something of the same narcoleptic quality. Yet Clinton wakes us up just as suddenly with fabulous tidbits: a drunken Yeltsin being restrained by the Secret Service outside Blair House in his underwear, yelling for a pizza; the president's explanation of why the nuclear standoff over Kashmir in 1999 was so terrifying; Clinton pushing for his wife to be Al Gore's running mate in 2000; Gore and Clinton shouting about who was to blame for Gore's defeat. Some myths are dispelled for good. No one can finish this book believing that the relationship between the former president and the current secretary of state is anything like a political marriage of convenience, as opposed to a deep and resilient romantic connection. Nor can anyone come away thinking that Clinton is craven or makes decisions according to the polls. Perhaps the most valuable revelation of Branch's marathon sessions is the insight it gives us into the way Clinton understood governing. As president, he does not see leadership as managing a conflict between politics and principle. Rather, he views politics as the essential reality of any society. He and his fellow politicians are hedged in by their constituencies and the exigencies of staying in power, and they fail to recognize that at their peril. He is open with Branch about boundaries he dares not cross--on the Cuban embargo for example, where he acknowledges the impossibility of changing a worthless policy. Great politicians--he names Yitzhak Rabin, King Hussein of Jordan, and Boris Yeltsin--are ones who recognize which boundaries are amenable to adjustment. Clinton takes pride in his own decisions against interest, such as his 1993 budget bill, the Brady gun control bill, the Mexican financial rescue, and military interventions in Haiti and the Balkans. The politicians he disdains are those who pose or pander, fail to seize opportunity, or simply don't have real fight in them. He cannot abide Benjamin Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, Jacques Chirac, or Alia Itzetbegovic, who simply cannot say yes to a deal to end the Bosnian war. Clinton expresses repeated frustration with the late Pat Moynihan's preening self-regard and is fairly scathing about Bill Bradley's decision in 1995 to leave the Senate--""disgusted, in fact,"" Branch writes, ""by Bradley's speeches proclaiming himself detached from both political parties and yet somehow uniquely in tune with the American people."" Colin Powell, Clinton notes in relief after Powell decides not to challenge him in 1996, is fundamentally risk-averse: ""a career staff officer at heart."" Branch recognizes one serious blind spot: Clinton's inability to distinguish between the hostility of the press and the enmity of his political opponents. Clinton fixates on his great error in agreeing to a Whitewater special prosecutor, feeling that in so doing he surrendered to the New York Times and Washington Post. As the meritless accusations mount, Clinton feels victimized, casts blame indiscriminately, pouts, and grows increasingly self-pitying. Monica Lewinsky happened at his lowest moment--he just ""cracked,"" he tells Branch. And so the cycle turns. That low moment, during the government shutdown at the end of 1995, was also when Clinton rediscovered his core liberal principles, his energy, and his voice, setting himself up for a stunning recovery in 1996. What looms as a downfall when the affair is exposed becomes another resurrection as he digs in, fights on, and faces down the threat of impeachment. In Clinton's detached view, the attempted removal is less about him than about the politics of the Republican cloakroom. Once he figures that the underlying dynamic favors him, he loses interest in his own Senate trial. Here, as elsewhere, Branch captures a resilient maximizer of opportunity at work. But like Clinton's presidency, his book ultimately disappoints. This is the fault less of the author than of the subject, who was not willing to share the crown jewels--his actual recorded words--with his Boswell. Unlike the wonderful Kennedy and Johnson tapes, which Branch used extensively in his King biography, we don't hear the president's mesmerizing voice directly and thus--as Branch repeatedly regrets--don't get the full passion and colloquial flavor of his description and analysis. Prolonged indirect exposure to Clinton's insights, his footnotes to history, and his needy narcissism is by turns exhausting and awe-inspiring. Whenever we think he's about to be finished, he's got just one more thing to say."	Taylor Branch's The Clinton Tapes.
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/going_rogue.html	"Sarah Palin's anticipated first memoir, Going Rogue, will be available Nov. 17, with a first printing of 1.5 million copies. The inspiration behind the unique title? Slate's John Dickerson first used the phrase  in an Oct. 20,2008, article questioning whether the former Alaska governor was purposely disagreeing with the presidential candidate. The original article is reprinted below. Has Sarah Palin ""gone rogue""? For the last few weeks, Republicans inside and outside the McCain campaign have speculated about those moments when Palin and John McCain have appeared to disagree: Palin pressed to have the campaign compete for Michigan voters when strategists had given up on the state. She disagreed with McCain's opposition to a marriage amendment. She disagreed with McCain's opposition to removing North Korea from the list of terrorist nations. She thinks the campaign should talk about Barack Obama's ties to his former pastor Jeremiah Wright. Even on Team Maverick, a vice-presidential candidate's job is to agree with the candidate at the top of the ticket. The only exception is when campaign strategists carefully orchestrate a schism--and we know when these moments are coming because everyone in the press is invited to watch. But Palin's disagreements don't appear to be a part of a larger strategy. So, political insiders have started asking whether Palin is simply undisciplined or is intentionally ignoring the playbook. And if it's intentional, the question becomes: Is she putting her own political self-interest ahead of her running mate's? As Obama's fortunes have improved, these questions have grown only more intense. I am sorry to report that I do not know the answers. But that's OK: Neither does anyone else. In fact, any answers you hear will almost certainly speak less to Palin's motivations than to those of the people talking about her. Sunday, Palin appeared to call another audible. While McCain was defending his campaign's robo-calls attacking Barack Obama, Palin was knocking them. She said they were irritating voters and represented the ""old conventional ways of campaigning."" Palin appeared to be joining with Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and other Republicans who oppose the tactic. Plus, she used the word conventional to describe the McCain tactics. That's a word Obama uses to attack. What was Palin up to? The question came up in my political conversations Monday morning. Several Republican veterans thought she was trying to distance herself from campaign strategy, which has been roundly criticized in GOP circles, to maintain her political viability for the future. The transcript, however, shows that Palin doesn't seem to be criticizing the tactic so much as bemoaning the fact that the campaign is stuck in a place where it has to use it. She's not making a moral argument that might burnish her credentials for the future as a reasonable person. She's just off-message. Two weeks before, I was hearing the exact opposite spin: not that Palin was distancing herself from the campaign, but that the campaign was distancing itself from her. When Palin picked up her attacks on Obama, McCain loyalists, and even some inside his campaign, suggested that she'd done so on her own accord. Dressed in camouflage and night-vision goggles, she'd snuck out to hold rallies suggesting Obama palled around with terrorist William Ayers. She'd also told William Kristol that Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright was an appropriate topic of discussion, even though McCain had once said it was not. This spin, the Palin-as-a-lone-wolf story, had the advantage of allowing McCain himself to remain above the fray while his campaign reaped the benefits of Palin's attacks. But if Palin-as-rogue was the strategy--and there's some evidence it was--it was a failure. Polls have shown that voters have a dimmer view of McCain because of these attacks. Obama's stature seems only to have grown. Others argued that Palin's motives for picking up the attacks were not strategic but self-interested. By taking a tougher approach with Obama, she was aligning herself with conservative thinkers who have urged McCain to fight harder. If the McCain campaign is unsuccessful, she could say she was trying to do the right thing but was held back. A similar strategy was supposedly behind her opposition to the campaign's retreat from Michigan. If McCain loses, Palin will have proved that she was in favor of a more vigorous campaign--a useful position to cite if she hopes to run for national office again. And by supporting the gay-marriage-ban amendment, she keeps her ties strong to evangelical voters. Part of this speculation is normal for any vice-presidential candidate. We've forgotten, during the Cheney years, that competing agendas always accompany any political partnership. Cheney had no future political ambitions (sadly), so no one speculated about how he might be positioning himself politically in the last eight years. Also fueling the discussion about Palin's motivations is the brewing conversation that attends any campaign that appears to be on the ropes with two weeks to go. Democrats want to push the idea she's out for herself because it suggests that if the No. 2 on the ticket is looking out for her future, the race must really be over. Aides inside the campaign want to retain their political viability, so they blame Palin for the loss. The ""going rogue"" story line contributes to the idea that she sunk the effort. If they advocated for Palin in the first place, they can try to say (implausibly) that they never thought she'd be as bad as she's turned out to be. Palin and her behavior have become a part of the crucial postmortem (pre-mortem?) for those hoping to affect the next generation of conservative thinking. McCain could still win. But as his fortunes appear to dim, those with the first explanations for his failure stand the best chance of shaping the post-McCain party. Those outside the campaign who were against the Palin pick, meanwhile, want to characterize her as a purely self-interested politician--it's final proof of their prescience. Those who want to blame the campaign strategists paint Palin as a political natural damaged by a ham-handed campaign. One Republican veteran said that when Palin was asked to link Obama to Ayers, she resisted. It was McCain aides who pushed her to pick up the attack. A McCain aide tells me the exact opposite is true. Palin was regularly asking to be more aggressive. With so many permutations and mixed motivations, the Palin saga is starting to feel like a Restoration play. (I hope in the end all the characters come onstage and all is revealed.) What does Sarah actually think? Who knows? Unlike previous vice-presidential candidates and most other politically ambitious people, she doesn't have a political hack who has been at her side for years, protecting her political portfolio and spinning the press to preserve her reputation. If she really wants to have a national political future, now may be the time for her to go out and get herself one."	Sarah Palin took the name of her memoir from this (unflattering) Slate article.
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/tax_dodging.html	"Last week, President Obama found himself caught up in Washington's favorite word game. The rules: Find as many ways as you can to describe your taxlike policy without using the word tax. The policy in question? The requirement in both the House and Senate health care bills that everyone buy health insurance. Anyone who doesn't buy it has to pay a fine--$750 per person if your income is up to three times the poverty level or $950 if you make more than that. ""For us to say you have to take responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase,"" Obama said on ABC's This Week on Sept. 20. George Stephanopoulos responded by whipping out a copy of Merriam-Webster's dictionary and reading aloud the definition of tax. Obama stood his ground: ""Nobody considers that a tax increase."" Unless you count Republicans. Sen. John Ensign of Nevada introduced an amendment to the finance committee legislation that would replace the word fee with tax every time it appeared. The RNC produced a Web video featuring the Stephanopoulos exchange, and Chairman Michael Steele is holding a press conference Tuesday to discuss ""President Obama's proposed health care taxes."" Who's right? Some tax policy analysts dismiss the question as merely academic. ""It's a distinction without a difference,"" says Robert Moffitt of the Heritage Foundation, calling the question a ""metaphysical"" one. ""It becomes semantics as much as anything,"" says Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. Yet there is a generally accepted definition of taxes vs. fees, says Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation: Taxes are used to fund services for everyone. Fees compensate the government for services that benefit a particular group. ""The question is what the revenue is for,"" Henchman says. ""If it goes for providing services for the general public, then it's taxlike. If it's to compensate for the costs of punishing individuals for not buying insurance, then it's feelike."" The Baucus bill would use the payments to help subsidize coverage for the uninsured, which Henchman says would make it more ""taxlike."" Still, those rules have enough exceptions to make them almost useless. Consider the gas tax. It's levied on a portion of the population--drivers--and usually used for a particular service--repairing roads. Yet it's still called a tax. Meanwhile, taxes on fishing and hunting are often used to fund general services but are usually called licensing fees. Perhaps the best people to ask would be the members of Congress themselves. The House bill, for example, refers to the fine as ""tax."" The Baucus bill calls it an ""excise tax."" Plus, the decision to have the Internal Revenue Service collect the payment through its regular methods doesn't exactly dispel the notion that it's a tax. ""I don't know of anything the IRS does to collect money from people that's not a tax,"" says Williams. Obama is hardly the first politician to fudge in order to avoid the T-word. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty proposed slapping a 75-cent ""health impact fee"" on packs of cigarettes in 2005. That way, he wasn't breaking his promise not to raise taxes. Democrats in the California Assembly are determined to call a $1 surcharge on automobile registrations a ""fee,"" while Republicans deem it a ""tax."" In Virginia, meanwhile, the two gubernatorial candidates are quibbling over whether a gas tax is really a tax. Creigh Deeds says when he promised not to raise taxes, he meant he wouldn't raise taxes for the general fund--not dedicated taxes like the gas tax. (Watch him dance here.) All this hemming and hawing occurs for a reason: It does, in fact, matter whether we call the fine a fee or a tax, especially when it comes to health care. First and most obvious is the politics. During the campaign, Obama promised not to raise taxes on the middle class, which he has since defined as any household making less than $250,000 a year. If his opponents can successfully paint the individual mandate as a tax hike that falls squarely on the middle class, they can then bust out their other favorite three-letter word. Played right, this strategy could make Obama look like the second coming of George H.W. Bush. The definition also matters because taxes and fees have different legal meanings. Many states, for example, have special requirements for a tax hike: Some require a supermajority of legislators to vote for it or for multiple readings of the bill. In California, it requires voter approval. The distinction could also matter on the federal level. On Friday, Sen. Ensign pointed out that if the fee is indeed a tax, wouldn't someone who refused to pay it be considered a tax evader and therefore subject to an even larger fine? A representative from the Joint Committee on Taxation said that yes, the penalty for failing to pay the fee could be as high as $25,000 and up to a year in jail. The likelihood of every scofflaw paying that penalty is extremely low, says tax law professor Joseph Bankman of Stanford University: ""There's no reason you'd have to stick with existing penalty structures."" But it shows how a tax vs. a fee is a distinction with a difference. That distinction could even have implications for the constitutionality of health care reform. Some lawyers have raised concerns that the individual mandate may overstep Congress' constitutional authority to regulate commerce and levy taxes. The flipside of that argument, however, is that, in the likely event of a court challenge, the administration wants as many defenses as possible. The first line of defense would be the commerce clause, which regulates the trade of goods and services across state lines. The administration could say that it applies to health care because when people don't buy health insurance, it affects everyone else, even in other states. The second argument, if necessary, would be that Congress has the right to tax the people. In which case, the administration might want to describe the individual mandate as a tax. Naturally, politics will win out. Democrats will fight the ""tax"" label. And with good reason: If the bill can't get enough votes because of fears that it's a tax hike, Democrats won't even get a chance to test its constitutionality. And if a bill doesn't pass, Democrats up for re-election could pay the ultimate fee. I mean, tax."	Is the penalty for not buying health insurance a fee or a tax?
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/green_gas.html	"Bill Clinton's presidency has served as a roadmap for Barack Obama's--a roadmap, that is, of what not to do. Don't try to pass health care reform without congressional input. Don't tackle controversial social issues early in your presidency. Don't alienate the military. Now there's another lesson: Don't promise the world you're going to fight climate change when you can't. In his speech to the United Nations Tuesday, Obama rattled off the administration's energy accomplishments, from tightening fuel emissions standards to tracking greenhouse gas pollution. He praised the House of Representatives for passing climate change legislation last June. But he was careful not to promise a finished bill. That's because, thanks to the long slog of health care reform and the galaxy of political interests that must be appeased, a Senate bill by the end of the year--let alone by the time of the global environmental summit in Copenhagen in early December--is looking unlikely. In 1997, President Clinton was in a similar situation. Under the Kyoto Protocol, by 2012 the United States would have had to lower its emissions level to 7 percent below 1990 levels. Clinton signed the treaty in November 1998 along with 183 other countries. But he never submitted the treaty to the Senate for ratification. ""We didn't have the votes,"" he explained recently. Clinton's signature was supposed to be a symbol of U.S. commitment. Instead, says climate expert Nigel Purvis of the Brookings Institution, ""[i]t was a symbol of inaction. Our standing in the world was significantly damaged."" There are two ways Obama could avoid the same fate at Copenhagen. He could try to force Congress to pass climate legislation before Dec. 7 and then show up to the conference--or send an envoy--with actual leverage. Or he could avoid making promises he can't keep. In his speech Tuesday, Obama did the latter while trying hard to sound like he was doing the former. ""The journey is long,"" he said. ""The journey is hard. And we don't have much time left to make it."" But he stopped short of telling Congress to get it done. ""One committee has already acted on this bill in the Senate, and I look forward to engaging with others as we move forward,"" he said. Moving forward is not what's happening. Sen. Barbara Boxer, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which plays a major role in the Senate negotiations, first promised a draft by early August, then by Sept. 9, then by the end of September. Harry Reid's office then said the majority leader ""fully expects the Senate to have ample time to consider this comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation before the end of the year."" But Reid recently let slip that ""[w]e still have next year to complete things if we have to."" What's the holdup? Two things: moderate Democrats and health care. Democratic senators from energy-producing states--Mary Landrieu from oil-happy Louisiana, Sherrod Brown from corn-fed Ohio, Evan Bayh from coal-friendly Indiana--have voiced concerns about the effects on their states' respective industries. (Not without reason: The Congressional Budget Office says the bill ""would cause permanent shifts in production and employment away from industries that produce carbon-based energy and energy-intensive goods and services."") Democratic leaders have been willing to make concessions. The House bill included provisions for carbon sequestration, credits to farmers who plant trees, and extra pollution permits for coal utilities. The Senate bill will likely do even more to appease moderate Dems and perhaps even a Republican or two. Health care, however, has been the real time suck. You'd think a legislative body could handle two tasks at once. But many of the senators tackling health care reform would also have key roles in cap and trade. The finance committee, for example, needs to sign off on both, since both affect the federal budget. That panel has not distinguished itself with its speediness on health care. A climate change bill could take just as long. The world, meanwhile, is waiting. ""Is the U.S. Senate really expecting all the other countries to make a serious effort on climate change at the Copenhagen Conference in the absence of a clear commitment from the United States?"" said the European Union's U.S. ambassador Sunday. As recently as a week ago, environmental activists were still optimistic that legislation could pass by December. Now, some aren't so sure. ""I think the chances are very low during this calendar year,"" says Robert Repetto, a senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation. ""It's going to set the Copenhagen negotiations back enormously because nobody else is going to bite the bullet until they know what the U.S. is going to do."" Todd Stern, Obama's special envoy for climate change (who also served as Clinton's climate adviser), told reporters Tuesday that the administration wants to see ""maximum possible progress"" in Congress. ""In the event that there's not domestic legislation done by the time of Copenhagen, we will negotiate with that in mind,"" he said. But there may be an alternative, say activists. A nuclear option, so to speak: The Environmental Protection Agency could simply mandate cap and trade. Researchers at NYU Law School concluded in April that the executive branch could impose the policy under the Clean Air Act, which gives the EPA broad discretion to regulate air quality. The head of the Sierra Club reiterated the idea earlier this month as a possible end-run around Congress. That way, the United States could go into Copenhagen with actual clout while saving the legislative process for later. Sure, it would be tough politically. But otherwise, says Repetto, ""Copenhagen is going to be a severe disappointment."""	Barack Obama says he wants climate change legislation. But can he get it?
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/mad_at_max.html	"For advocates of health care reform, Sen. Max Baucus' legislation to transform the insurance industry is like dealing with the insurance industry: 100 hours of haggling, ending in disappointment. When the chairman of the finance committee announced his long-awaited health care reform legislation Wednesday, the opposition from left and right was so consistent that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's communications director forwarded a list of about 20 articles chronicling the discontent. ""The only thing bipartisan is the opposition,"" it read. And the strongest abuse has come from inside the Democratic Party. When President Obama mentioned the Baucus bill on Thursday, he received scattered boos. Howard Dean said it was ""the worst piece of health care legislation I've seen in 30 years."" Delegates at the AFL-CIO's convention in Pittsburgh chanted ""bullshit"" in response to it. ""Max Baucus screws the caucus,"" said a senior Senate Democratic aide, characterizing the reaction of other Democratic senators. The case against Baucus is many-pronged: He shut out other senators. He bowed to corporate pressure by excising the public option. He was too solicitous toward Republicans yet failed to win the support of a single Republican. The disappointment has been compounded by the fact that he took a long time to deliver this soggy result. That delay exposed Democrats and the cause of reform to effective attacks.All of which raises the question: If so many people hate this legislation, why not rip up the bill and start anew? Democrats will try in the coming weeks, as it moves through committee and to the Senate floor. They'll undoubtedly find a way to increase subsidies to help working families  and protect the middle class against a tax increase. But the tinkering can only go so far, because for all of its shortcomings, Baucus' bill is also what Senate Democrats are calling ""the White House bill."" Perhaps some of the fire aimed at Baucus should be redirected at the president. The legislation accomplishes much of what Obama laid out in his speech before the joint session of Congress earlier this month. The bill is not only deficit-neutral, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but it also shrinks long-term health care costs. Both are key Obama pledges. The legislation also includes insurance reforms, expands coverage, and has not upset the careful coalition of industry groups the White House worked so hard to align at the start of this process.It also moves a stalled process forward, which also delights White House aides anxious to make a deal and move on. Now that all the pieces of legislation are on the table, the president can start building support for a final piece of legislation. Or, to put it more coarsely, he can start buying votes. In recent private meetings with senators, the president has been selling the Baucus bill. No, the bill doesn't include the public option, which Obama has advocated in public. But in private meetings, Obama isn't pushing the public option, according to Senate Democratic aides. ""The public option is dead,"" said one. Instead, the president is emphasizing other fixes in the legislation.As a matter of style, Baucus' long and so far fruitless effort to build bipartisan support has looked a lot more like the process outlined by candidate Obama than the one President Obama employs. Republicans claim Obama never really gives them a seat at the table. They can't say that about Baucus. He gave them a seat at the table and a personalized napkin ring. Obama says good policy cannot be crafted on the schedule of the 24-hour news cycle. Baucus worked at a pace from the Cronkite era.Perhaps the idea of bipartisanship is quaint in the polarized politics of the moment. (No lie.) It may also be bad policy, leading to muddled legislation. But the president who leads the majority party talks about it a lot. That Baucus was trying to meet Obama's goals isn't all Baucus' fault. Plus, independent voters--who at 43 percent make up a larger share of the electorate than ever, according to a recent Washington Post poll, and who have been souring on Obama and the Democratic Party--tend to like attempts at bipartisanship. They also have been asking for Obama to slow down.So a long, slow, we're-trying-our-best-to-meet-them-halfway process may help Obama cement his appeal to independents. Even under the worst-case scenario--if all of this delay and outreach fails to attract a single Republican supporter--Obama can point to the Baucus bill process and say they were patient, endured the political hits during delays, and tried to compromise. At least that's the theory. If it works, it won't settle his critics, but it'll earn him the president's gratitude."	A lot of the anger at Max Baucus should be directed at President Obama.
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/get_this_rat_a_lawyer.html	"In 1510, the respected French lawyer Bartholomew Chassenee made his name by serving as legal counsel for a horde of rats. The rats stood accused of eating through the province's barley crop. But the trial was tainted, Chassenee argued, for two reasons: First, the court failed to properly notify the rodents of the trial date. And second, the defendants could not possibly appear in court when getting there entailed risking a run-in with a cat. This scene may have taken place in Medieval Europe. But, if you believe Fox News host Glenn Beck, it could happen here too. Beck has been monitoring the threat for quite some time. ""The day may not be far off, animal lawyers say, when animals are not only present in the court room but participating in the proceedings,"" Beck warned on his radio program in March 2008. He reiterated his concern last Wednesday on Fox. When he was 8 years old, he said, he loved ""Ben,"" Michael Jackson's 1972 tune about a pet rat. ""But do you really want a police officer telling Ben, who's just shown up in your home, 'Ben, you have a right to remain silent. ... If you can't afford an attorney, Ben, one will be provided for you'? The world is upside down!"" And it's Cass Sunstein's fault. A constitutional-law professor at Harvard University, Sunstein was confirmed Thursday as the director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or ""regulatory czar."" Now, according to Beck, the possibility of being dragged to animal court is even higher. The foundation for Beck's vision of a murine judicial system is a paper Sunstein wrote in 2002, in which he argued that individuals as well as the state should be able to file suit for animal cruelty. (Read it here.) Sunstein also gave a lecture on the subject at Harvard in 2007. (Watch it here.) Sunstein is best known for his scholarship on cost-benefit analysis in public policy as well as his work on behavioral economics--the idea that government can use incentives, or ""nudges,"" rather than heavy-handed regulation to drive behavior. But his animal rights article, which later became the introduction to a book called  Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions, has received special attention. Sunstein is now caught up in Beck's anti-czar crusade. (Never mind that czar is just a word used by the media for appointed advisers not subject to Senate approval or that, by that definition, Sunstein isn't a ""czar"" at all.) The Web site StopSunstein.com catalogs statements by Obama's ""radical anti-hunting, anti-gun, animal rights law professor."" Many attendees at Saturday's 9/12 protest in Washington echoed Beck's concerns. ""He thinks rats should have the right to an attorney, to sue humans,"" said Davy Reeves of Kalamzaoo, Mich. ""Rats have no right to live in my house."" Reeves is right about the second part. The first is a little more complicated. What Sunstein says in his 2002 paper is that state animal-cruelty laws get enforced only when a public prosecutor brings charges. And in practice, that rarely happens. To correct this ""enforcement gap,"" he says, people should be able to file civil lawsuits to prevent cruelty to animals. ""The very idea might seem absurd,"" he writes. ""But it is simpler and more conventional than it appears."" Just as a child might be represented by an adult human, so too would an animal. Sunstein also argues that anti-cruelty laws should be applied to animals that suffer because of farming, meat-industry practices, and hunting. ""We ought to ban hunting, I suggest, if there isn't a purpose other than sport and fun,"" he says in his 2007 lecture. ""That should be against the law. It's time now."" Sunstein isn't saying that animals should be autonomous (and thus able to hire an attorney) or that an animal's life is as valuable as a human's. In fact, he rejects these arguments outright. Rather, he says, we should do everything we can to minimize animal suffering. We already have laws that make it illegal to cause distress to animals, he says. We just need to enforce them. Allowing private lawsuits on behalf of animals is one way to do that. What does that mean for rat infestations? ""If rats are able to suffer--and no one really doubts that they are--then their interests are relevant to the question how, and perhaps even whether, they can be expelled from houses,"" Sunstein writes. ""At the very least, people should kill rats in a way that minimizes suffering. And if possible, people should try to expel rats in a way that does not harm them at all."" Sunstein never explicitly says we should have class action suits brought by rats. But it's easy to see where Beck gets it. ""Your dog should have an attorney"" is how he summarizes it. ""I don't know about your dog,"" Beck says, ""but my dog, I don't think he likes attorneys."" Sunstein's defenders make two points. First off, they say, Sunstein is an academic. Academics are supposed to make provocative arguments. ""Their job is to be exploring the bounds of the biggest, hardest questions that our country faces,"" says Kenneth Baer of the Office of Management and Budget. ""That's what they do for a living. There are no attack ads in academia."" Second, they say, he's not actually advocating these policies. It's just legal analysis. That would make sense--if Sunstein made it clear the views were not his. In his paper, he does at times go out of his way to distance himself from his arguments. Rather than saying, ""I reject ...,"" he'll say, ""This position requires rejection of ...."" But other times, he takes a stance. In the last section of his essay, he concludes that ""private suits should be permitted to prevent illegal cruelty and neglect."" As for banning hunting or minimizing cruelty in animal food processing, ""I believe that steps in this direction would make a great deal of sense."" Lost in the heat is the fact that animals already have all sorts of rights. You can't legally beat a dog. You can't work a horse beyond exhaustion. You can't make cocks fight for your entertainment. The reason these activities are banned is that they cause suffering. What, then, is the difference between abusing a dog and crushing a rat with your foot (other than size and cuteness)? Furthermore, animals already have some degree of legal representation. If you kick someone's dog, for example, they can sue you for damages. ""I'm not suing on behalf of their dog,"" says California animal rights lawyer Shannon Keith. ""I'm suing on behalf of them on behalf of their dog."" Nor do they have to be the animal's owner in order to sue: They can sue you even if you kick a stray dog. In 2007, private citizens sued the Los Angeles Zoo to keep the zoo from constructing a new exhibit that would separate the two elephants living there. (A judge dismissed the suit, saying the plaintiffs should take it to their local politicians.) People can also file private suits for animal abuse on grounds of emotional distress--they saw the animal suffering, and they in turn suffered. In California, private suits can even be brought based on criminal statutes, according to Keith. From there, it's a short step to saying I can sue a food company for grinding up baby chicks. At a certain point, the discussion becomes what it was at the start: academic. Sunstein's personal views on animal rights and hunting are not going to influence policy. OIRA doesn't make laws; it coordinates regulation among the different agencies as they apply laws already passed by Congress. Nor are Beck's concerns shared by most conservatives. White House officials point out that Sunstein was endorsed by conservative stalwarts from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to C. Boyden Gray to the Wall Street Journal editorial page. But that doesn't make Sunstein's saga any less important politically. His confirmation was held up first by Sen. Saxby Chambliss, then by Sen. John Cornyn, out of concern about his record on hunting. (Sunstein wrote letters to both affirming his commitment to the Second Amendment.) It also shows that even the most respected scholars in their fields--most law students know Sunstein as the co-author of their Constitutional Law textbook--are not immune to attacks. Sunstein is hardly the first appointee to have his academic writings held up to the cable news glare. Health policy adviser Ezekiel Emanuel was accused of advocating euthanasia in a paper on end-of-life decision-making. (His words were twisted, according to FactCheck.org.) ""Science czar"" John Holdren was criticized for a book he co-wrote in 1977 in which he discussed putting chemicals in drinking water that would sterilize people in order to control population. If you want to work in the White House, the message seems to be, don't tackle any difficult subjects. Then again, Emanuel, Holdren, and Sunstein all squeaked through. The Constitution is still intact. The nation remains stable. And, for now at least, you can kill as many rats as you want, however you want, without fear of retribution."	Glenn Beck says Cass Sunstein wants to give animals the right to sue humans. Really?
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/you_lie.html	"""Angry mob, coming through!"" a protester shouted as he squeezed his way through the crowd at Freedom Plaza Saturday morning. The march from the plaza to the Capitol--the much-hyped ""9/12"" protest trumpeted for months by Glenn Beck and organized by the same coalition of conservative groups that backed last spring's tea parties--wasn't supposed to start until 11:30 a.m. But the plaza was so full that by 10 a.m., the police had closed Pennsylvania Avenue and the marchers were off. A conservative protest is something of an oxymoron--partly because the biggest protests in recent memory (Vietnam, Iraq) involved liberal kids challenging conservative policies. But also because conventional wisdom says that conservatives don't go stirring the pot. After all, it's hard to agitate in favor of the status quo. Then again, maybe it's easier when the Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress. In that case, the conceptual problem facing Saturday's protesters was different: Everyone was against the president, but no one could really agree why. Dave Johnson, who traveled from Woodstock, N.Y., for the protest, didn't necessarily think this was a bad thing. Gesturing toward the parade of signs, he noted that the message of the anti-war movement was simple: ""Get out of Vietnam. This is cap-and-trade, taxes, czars, redistribution of wealth,"" he said. Saturday's protest, therefore, was ""richer in terms of mental involvement."" That's one way of putting it. Another word for it is simply confused. Part of the reason is that many of the protesters were new to the whole mass-demonstration thing, and in some cases, it showed. While most of the chants fit accepted rhythmic structures--""Common sense! Common sense!""--some did not. ""First Amendment! First Amendment!"" one protester cheered. It took a couple of rounds to realize the phrase didn't quite scan. Others got the hang of it quickly. One marcher, spotting the words of the First Amendment carved into the side of the Newseum building on Pennsylvania Avenue, pointed and started chanting: ""Read that sign! Read that sign!"" Some chants were lifted directly from liberal rallies, namely ""The people united will never be divided."" At one point, I inquired about a ""Power to the People"" sign. Its owner, Dana Thomas of Reston, Va., explained to me that John Lennon was really a conservative. ""Have you listened to the words to 'Taxman?' "" (Actually, that was George's song, though John did write this one, which could be interpreted as opposing the public option.) Just as Obama's inauguration was hailed as a historic moment, the tea partiers saw themselves in equally world-historical terms. ""It's great to be part of history,"" said Nick Gingric of Freeberg, Pa. ""I think this is the biggest crowd ever to march on Washington."" Another man, marching nearby, agreed: ""I think this is the greatest American outpouring I've seen in my life."" The size of the crowd was a point of debate. An organizer at one point announced that ABC News estimated the crowd at 1.5 million. Yet the article on ABC News' Web site--as well as the New York Times and other news sources--said ""tens of thousands."" Historical analogies abounded. One woman's T-shirt showed the Founding Fathers with the caption ""Right-Wing Extremists."" Hitler moustaches adorned Obama posters. The tea-party analogy, initially a cute metaphor for conservatives upset about the stimulus package and auto bailout, has become a battle cry. Protesters marched in white wigs tricornered hats. ""Don't Tread on Me"" flags were outnumbered only by the Stars and Stripes. During the rally in front of the Capitol, a video compared Obama's policies to those that incited the Revolutionary War. Now, according to the deep-voiced narrator, ""Lady Liberty faces her greatest challenge."" Most of the themes of the protest were familiar. Demonstrators were upset by TARP, or the stimulus, or health care reform, or cap-and-trade. But some gripes were new. I was especially struck by the tea baggers' obsession with czars. Everyone knew the number of czars Obama appointed: 37. And nobody was happy with them. ""They're socialist radicals,"" said Davy Reeves of Kalamazoo, Mich. ""I don't like the idea of all these czars,"" said Geri Shea of Leesburg, Va. ""It's unconstitutional."" Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, speaking at the rally, picked up on the theme. ""It's people, not czars, that run this country!"" Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, too, reminded the audience that ""nowhere in our Constitution can you find the word czar."" The rally's introductory video pointed out that Obama has appointed ""more czars in his first six months than in 300 years of Czarist Russia."" Conservative hip-hop artist Hi Caliber, who performed at the rally, managed in one song to rhyme czar with Bill Maher. One sign even delivered its anti-czar message in Cyrillic. I asked a few protesters how Obama's czars are different from the unelected advisers every president appoints. ""Every president does have advisers,"" said Kelly Grillo, Northfield, N.J. ""But Obama has way too many."" Van Jones, who resigned recently over comments he made about Republicans as well as a petition he signed alleging government involvement in 9/11, was singled out for special derision. But so, too, was constitutional scholar and recently confirmed ""regulatory czar"" Cass Sunstein. The reason, said Davy Reeves of Kalamazoo: rats. ""He thinks rats should have the right to an attorney, to sue humans,"" Reeves said. ""Rats have no right to live in my house."" Attendees were also adamant that members of Congress read legislation. Betsy McCaughey, after being introduced by the MC as ""the woman who started it all by actually reading the bills,"" appeared at the podium toting her usual binder containing the House health care legislation and proceeded to read from it. (Her claims were similar to ones she made in a New York Post op-ed in July. They have been largely refuted.) ""I think Congress should read the bills, but I'd be happier if some of them read this a little more often,"" said Rep. Pence, brandishing the Constitution. Unfortunately, reading bills rarely resolves anything. Witness this exchange between me and a young man from South Carolina. Him: ""Have you read the House health care bill?"" Me: ""Yes, parts of it.""Him: ""Do you think it covers illegal immigrants?"" Me: ""No.""Him: ""Then you haven't read it!"" The bill does not, in fact, cover illegal immigrants. The protesters I spoke with did not seem especially interested in negotiating with Obama. They weren't there to haggle over whether health care subsidies should be set at 300 percent or 400 percent above the poverty level. What did they want Obama to say? ""I quit,"" said Jack Gillies of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Gillies organizes a group of tea partiers back in Ft. Lauderdale where, every week, 50 to 60 people show up on a corner to wave signs. I asked him if there was any room for compromise. ""Zero,"" he said. ""Everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie."" The protest also made clear how quickly Rep. Joe Wilson has gone from obscure South Carolina congressman to conservative hero. ""Joe Wilson, Truth Czar,"" read one sign. Another said, ""Joe Wilson Should Have Thrown His Shoes."" Protesters largely agreed that Wilson was right to call Obama a liar and should not have apologized. Others took a more nuanced view. ""He should have explained the rationale behind it,"" said Wayne Pearson of Duncan, in Wilson's home state. ""Maybe he should have apologized for breaching protocol, but not for the content."" If Joe Wilson was the star of the show, Fox News was a close second. I approached a woman carrying a sign reading, ""Fox News--America's Only Media!"" As a member of the media, I said, I was offended. ""Fox News and Slate!"" she kindly corrected. She was Kathy Johnson of Woodstock, N.Y., wife of Dave. I asked what brought them there. ""You got an hour?"" she said. Dave said it was everything: health care, taxes, socialism. He warned me of what he called ""DDA"": the deliberate destruction of America. He then made a prediction. As the deficit grows, people are going to divest from the U.S. dollar--""currency flight""--forcing the government to either raise taxes or print money. He has already begun to pull his money out and transfer it to foreign investments. ""I'm betting against the U.S.,"" he said. Nearby, a group of well-dressed men and women, calling themselves Billionaires for Wealthcare, who waved signs--""Less Health, More Wealth,"" ""Let Them Eat Advil,"" ""Do No Harm ... To Our Bottom Line""--and sang songs about how health care reform would destroy their posh lives. Not everyone realized it was a joke. One protester sang along with the song, sung to the tune of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic,"" which had the chorus, ""Let's save the status quo."" Another protester was baffled. ""They spin everything you say!"" she said to me. ""You think they're on your side, but then they're not!"" One volunteer for Tea Party Patriots was convinced they were on his side. ""They're for us,"" he told me. ""They're wealthy, so they're thanking everybody for coming."" That was the closest thing to a counterprotest I saw. At one point, I spotted what looked like an Obama campaign slogan. Two men were wearing T-shirts with ""Fired Up!"" on the front in big block letters. I was approaching them to get a closer look when one of them turned around. On the back: ""You Lie!"""	The Glenn Beck-inspired protesters who descended Saturday on Washington.
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/obamacare_20.html	"Barack Obama must envy Steve Jobs. In a speech Wednesday afternoon, Apple's CEO unveiled several spiffy new product updates, and within hours, on millions of computer screens across the country, little windows popped up asking users if they wanted Apple's new software. If they did, it was seamlessly a part of their lives in just minutes. Several hours later, President Obama spoke to a joint session of Congress promising his own painless overhaul: a retrofitting of the American health care system with no changes for those who like their coverage, coverage for those who don't have any, and all of it paid for. Unfortunately for the president, installation is a nightmare. To make his case, Obama drew from a wide palette. At times he sounded like he was on the campaign trail. Knocking down claims about ""death panels,"" he said, ""It is a lie, plain and simple."" To opponents who might distort his plans, he promised, ""We will call you out."" He dove deep into the details of insurance coverage as if he were presenting to a policy roundtable. He ended with high speechifying that included a celebration of the life of Sen. Ted Kennedy. As for the substance, there were some new nuggets. But mostly the president sought to reiterate what he's been saying for months. ""Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have,"" said Obama in the first of what he described as three main principles of his reform. For the insured, he promised, ""as soon as I sign this bill,"" their lives would be better. It would be illegal to deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition or lose it because of illness. For those without insurance he promised quality and affordable choices. Obama's goal was not to present some perfect plan but to support the best plan that can get the votes. ""There is a path here to get this done,"" a senior administration adviser said before the speech. Obama tried to lay out that path both in detail but also in manner: He played the middleman. He talked about those on the left who want a single-payer plan and those on the right who prefer to leave things pretty much as they are. (This will no doubt infuriate the left more than the right, who will not only claim false equivalence but who might remind the president that before he was using them as a foil, he was courting their support by saying he supported a single-payer plan, too.) He was reminding those independent voters who tell pollsters they disapprove of his handling of the health care issue that he's the reasonable, unradical guy they liked during the election. ""I believe it makes sense to build on what works and fix what doesn't, rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch."" Twice Obama referred to Republican ideas. He praised John McCain's idea of providing catastrophic care for those who've been denied insurance because of a pre-existing condition. He also said he was looking into medical malpractice reforms considered by George Bush. He made a detailed appeal for the public option, a favorite of liberals, but then downplayed it, saying it would cover only 5 percent of the uninsured. The president was not met with a similar considered tone. Rep. Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina, shouted out ""You lie"" when Obama suggested illegal immigrants would not be covered. (Which still doesn't make him the most unruly South Carolina congressman in history). Wilson later apologized. White House aides hope that merely by describing his plan, Obama will see a bump in public support. Previewing Obama's remarks, a senior administration official cited polls in which support for health care reform increases by 20 points to a sizable majority when voters simply see details of the president's plan. Said a senior administration aide: ""This is about providing clarity."" As allies had hoped, Obama portrayed insurance companies as the villains of this tale. He did it in every way possible. In the box of seats reserved for first lady Michelle Obama sat Nathan from Colorado, Katie from Montana, and Laura from Green Bay, whose stories of suffering at the hands of insurance companies have provided the emotional punch for his health care speeches on the road. For the home audience, the White House made heartbreaking videos. Obama told his own tales of brutal, deadly insurance company malpractice. A man from Illinois lost coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found he hadn't reported gall stones that he didn't even know about. A woman from Texas saw her policy canceled because she forgot to declare a case of acne. ""That is wrong and no one should be treated that way in America,"" said the president. Obama offered a new plan--sort of. He isn't offering legislative language, but on a Web site put up in conjunction with the speech, there were some new details. Obama's plan will cost $900 billion (though oddly the Web site doesn't say so). That's less than the $1 trillion-plus experts say is necessary for comprehensive reform, but also less than the $1 trillion opponents have said is too much. ""In the end this is about getting this passed, "" a senior administration official said, explaining how the administration reached the figure. Another new idea was what aides are calling a ""fiscal trigger."" Obama pledged that he will provide additional spending cuts if the savings he's promised don't materialize. The details of the trigger are still fuzzy. To have teeth, a trigger should initiate mandatory action. The one offered by the bipartisan policy center plan's calls for automatic policies that would achieve savings. On Obama's trigger, the discipline is not automatic but left in the president's hands. We just have to take the president's word that he won't wiggle out of the pledge. (Of course, since the budget window we're talking about is 10 years, Obama won't be around to face some of the potential overruns.) The trigger is aimed at those who worry that expanding health coverage will increase the deficit. It's also an attempt to address one of the fundamental problems Obama and other reform advocates have faced selling reforms. ""They may like what we're offering,"" said one senior Democratic aide on the Hill. ""But they don't believe we can actually deliver."" The trigger makes it seem like Obama is not just promising but locking himself into the promise. People want change in the health care system but also fear the change of reform. Obama made the careful case that reform will be incremental, safe, and effective. After months of Congressional back and forth, it was a sweeping effort to take control of the substance and the politics of a debate that has been slipping away from him. Now he'll have to see if his plan and his speech can survive the congressional process to come, where each of his carefully worded sentences and balanced middle-way approach will get buffeted about by competing interests. Obama ended his speech with a flight of rhetoric. He read from a letter written by Ted Kennedy that the Massachusetts senator asked be released after his death, in which Kennedy argued that health care was ""above all a moral issue."" Obama argued that Kennedy's passion for the issue had grown not from his ideology but from his big-heartedness and concern for others. It was the opening chords of what would become Obama's full-organ-music rendering of the American character. He called on the country and the legislators before him to keep faith with America's principles of tolerance, limited government, and fellow-feeling. A speech that had been so specific, so incremental, and so earthbound headed to such rhetorical heights that when the president concluded with the traditional ""God bless you and may God bless the United States of America,"" it sounded like a drop in altitude."	Did Obama's speech succeed in recasting the debate over health care reform?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/good_deeds.html	"In their first prime-time debate last week, Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds derided his opponent, Republican Bob McDonnell, as ""smooth talker."" But now Deeds is getting help from two of the party's smoothest talkers: Terry McAuliffe and Bill Clinton. Next week, President Obama himself will make an appearance. It's only a state race, but Democrats really don't want to lose Richmond. On Tuesday, about 500 people squeezed into a low-ceilinged room to see the three men speak at the Deeds headquarters in McLean, Va. With two weeks to go before the election and Deeds trailing McDonnell--the latest poll has him down 49 points to 41 points--it was time to bring out the big guns. The location was a little awkward: The office space was formerly rented by the McAuliffe-for-governor campaign, which lost to Deeds in the primary. McAuliffe acknowledged as much. ""Let me say personally it is great to be back in my old headquarters,"" he told the audience, laughing. ""It's not how I thought I'd be back, but I can tell you it's great."" If McAuliffe had any reservations about Deeds--during the primary, McAuliffe dismissed his opponent's critiques as ""divisive politics of destruction that people are sick and tired of""--he hid it well. ""Nov. 3 is gonna be the greatest comeback in the history of American politics, folks,"" he said. And as a former frontrunner in the Democratic primary, he would know. ""I can tell you from experience,"" said McAuliffe, ""don't pay attention to the polls."" McAuliffe soon yielded the podium to Bill Clinton. ""I am here for about three reasons,"" Clinton said. He proceeded to list seven--in no obvious order: ""I tried to help Terry McAuliffe beat Creigh Deeds. And we failed."" ""I respect people who win and who win fair and square."" ""I'm a lifetime Democrat."" ""I like this guy. I like Creigh Deeds."" ""I think he'd be the best choice for the Commonwealth of Virginia."" ""I know what kinds of diff a gov can make"" when it comes to the economy. ""All the things Terry said."" As for the nervous-making poll numbers, Clinton explained them this way: ""Are the polls right? The answer is yes, no, or maybe."" Yes, he said, because they're an accurate representation of a certain segment of public opinion. No, he said, because that segment is ""not close to the profile of people I know who voted in the primary or in the general election in 2008."" And ""the maybe is the thing that matters: The maybe is you. The maybe is what you do in the next two weeks."" Clinton also landed a few jabs--another advantage of not being up for election. ""My daughter's generation has a slogan: Denial is not just a river in Egypt. It's [also] apparently the political platform of the Republican Party in Virginia."" Today's event was part of an 11th-hour push by top Democrats in both Virginia and New Jersey, where they know the tight gubernatorial elections will be seen as bellwethers for the nation's political mood. Indeed, the temptation to see the Deeds-McDonnell race as a referendum on Democrats is strong. In 2008, Virginia swung for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1964. Losing New Jersey would be a major disappointment. Losing Virginia would be a symbolic reversal of the Obama wave. The big question for Deeds has been how much to hug Obama. He has been careful not to tie himself too closely to the Democrats' most controversial policies, particularly on climate change and health care reform. McDonnell, meanwhile, has done everything he can to link them, claiming that Deeds supports cap-and-trade and challenging him to denounce the administration's plan to overhaul health care. It has also been rumored that Deeds' middle name is Hussein. Then again, why distance yourself from the man responsible for turning Virginia blue? Democrats' fears can be summed up in one word: turnout. Obama won the state by mobilizing an unprecedented number of young people as well as liberals and moderates from Northern Virginia. It's hard to imagine the same turnout in an off-year for a candidate with about as much star power as Barack Obama's hangnail. Hence the last-minute celebrity injection. Clinton and McAuliffe bring the spotlight this week. Obama will appear at an event with Deeds next Tuesday at an undisclosed location. Perhaps some of their charm will rub off on Deeds. According to many in the room, it worked. ""I think he was fantastic,"" said Faye Bazemore of Reston. ""Within the last few weeks, people have really taken notice."" Deeds has also milked the Obama mojo on a more indirect level. Earlier this month, he crisscrossed the state on a ""hope and opportunity tour."" ""Are y'all fired up?"" asked Steve Shannon, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, at today's rally. ""Are you ready to go?"" And Deeds' Web site owes an obvious debt to Obama's, from the font to the colors to the overall look. But over the next two weeks, Deeds may need the double down on the Obama playbook. He can't match Obama's legendary get-out-the-vote operation, but he'll need to come close. A little smooth-talking can't hurt, either."	Can Bill Clinton help Creigh Deeds get elected as Virginia governor?

If it doesn't lower costs, he will suggest spending cuts to make sure the deficit doesn't grow. That's a promise he says he will keep. But what about future presidents and members of Congress? The question is not exactly a hypothetical: Today's rush to send money to seniors gives us a pretty good idea of the answer. For the first time since 1975, the Social Security Administration has announced, seniors will not receive an annual cost-of-living adjustment in their Social Security benefits. The move makes good policy sense--the formula used by the SSA shows the cost of living has not increased in the past year. But it's also politically unpopular. That's why members of Congress and the president are trying to give seniors more money. When the Congressional Budget Office determined that the Senate finance committee's health care legislation would not add to the deficit, reform supporters heralded the news. Further, said the CBO, the bill would meet another important Obama priority: It would start to chip away at long-term health care costs. Budget watchdogs were skeptical, though. Former CBO director Douglass Holtz-Eakin was even more so. ""What they're saying is: 'Your fantasies add up. I could say to CBO: 'Hi, I'd like to make 5 million a year and live in a 125-room mansion. Does it work?' And CBO says 'yes,' but that isn't going to happen."" The former policy director for the McCain campaign, now with the Manhattan Institute, wasn't quibbling with the CBO's math. He just didn't think future politicians would keep the promises the bill was holding them to. According to one proposal, for example, if health care savings don't materialize in the coming years, automatic cuts in health care funding will kick in. Holtz-Eakin, not unreasonably, sees this as unlikely. Budget experts also worry that Congress will not reduce payments to providers as scheduled or follow through with planned Medicare cuts. ""There's been discussion of taking behavioral economics into account when assessing health care reform,"" says Marc Goldwein, policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""We also have to take into account behavioral politics. Political history teaches us that it's unlikely that there will be nominal cuts."" If Congress faces pressure from voters or from powerful lobbies like doctors, it could buckle and pass legislation that gets around the law (as it has repeatedly in saving doctors from cuts in payments). It's not so far-fetched: It's happening right now with Social Security. Cost of living increases are meant to help seniors maintain purchasing power, not increase it. Deflation and other factors actually mean that seniors should get a negative COLA, but law prohibits the COLA from being less than zero. So even holding the benefit steady means seniors will see a real increase in their payments. But that's not good enough. Members of Congress have submitted bills to pass a COLA increase, and the president has endorsed a $250 payment to 57 million seniors. ""It's money we don't have, spent on people who don't need it for reasons that aren't real,"" says Goldwein. Why is the $14 billion program likely to go forward? Despite the president's desire to reduce the deficit, seniors are a powerful political force. They are a crucial voting bloc. They turn out in off-year elections, like the one scheduled for a year and a few weeks from now. And their support for health care reform has been weak, so its supporters--in the White House and in Congress--don't want to risk ticking them off at this crucial moment. The president and his aides say this payment is merely a one-time infusion and that the money has nothing to do with the lack of a COLA. The payment is a part of the stimulus package passed months ago. Providing help just as the COLA news is being announced seems too convenient to chalk up to mere coincidence, however. There's always a rationale handy when political pressure is applied. In a tight spot, Congress finds a way around the law. That's likely to be as true about health care in the future as it is about Social Security in the present."	Why health care reform will cost more than Congress and Obama say it will.
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/nobel_rationale.html	"Say what you want about whether President Obama deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. His acceptance speech in the Rose Garden was an effective combination of humility--""I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments""--and political savvy. From now on, everything he does will have the stamp, however indirect, of the world's most prestigious prize: President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama will meet this morning with his Cabinet to discuss strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This afternoon, President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama will host a picnic for United States Secret Service employees and their families. Later in the day, President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama will go to the gym, check Facebook, and tuck his daughters into bed. The prize's vagueness helps. In his speech, Norwegian Nobel Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland gave only abstract justification for picking Obama. ""We are not awarding the prize for what may happen in the future, but for what he has done in the previous year,"" he said. ""We would hope this will enhance what he is trying to do."" The committee's statement wasn't much more specific, alluding only to his ""vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons."" In his speech, Obama used this vagueness to his advantage. If the Nobel committee wasn't going to explain the award, then Obama would: ""I will accept this award as a call to action,"" he said, ""a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century."" He then proceeded to summarize his ambitions for the United States and the global community, touching on nuclear disarmament, climate change, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, religious persecution, and the fight against poverty and disease. He even mentioned the war in Afghanistan, which, whatever its goals, is still a war. The result was a choose-your-own acceptance speech. Thus was Obama able to give the impression that the Nobel committee wasn't blessing any one aspect of his agenda, be it health care reform or nuclear cutbacks or cap-and-trade. It was blessing everything. Anything he does will now have some added symbolic heft: In an international climate where President doesn't have much gravitas anymore, President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner does. Whether it's asking India to step up emissions controls, negotiating sanctions with Iran, or discussing free trade in Latin America, Obama now has added prestige, if not authority. Then again, the prize is unlikely to persuade critics who disagree with Obama's diplomatic approach to international problems. And by enhancing his image as the darling of the European left, the prize plays perfectly into the right's attempt to portray Obama as, well, a darling of the European left. Sen. Orrin Hatch, speaking on Fox News after the announcement, summed up the sentiment: ""Hopefully, this will help the president realize he represents everybody, not just the far left."" Nobel controversies of years past--most notably Yasser Arafat and  Jimmy Carter--provide plenty of precedent to dismiss Obama's nomination as yet more Scandinavian twaddle. Politically, however, the prize is unlikely to hurt Obama that much. For most Americans, being liked by the rest of the world is a good thing. And in international relations, Obama could actually use the prize to be more hawkish. Even Nobel Prize winner Barack Obama thinks we should bomb Iran, could be a talking point three years from now. Think of it as a deposit of political capital--only from the international left rather than the American center. Obama made sure to spread the wealth around: ""This award is not simply about the efforts of my administration--it's about the courageous efforts of people around the world. And that's why this award must be shared with everyone who strives for justice and dignity."" Which of those strivers for justice and dignity he will share the $1.4 million prize money with is another question. AP Video: Obama Reacts to Winning Nobel Peace Prize"	Why did Obama win the Nobel? Since the committee didn't really say, he can.
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/the_obama_recession.html	"As job losses climb, President Obama faces two related questions. The first is more like a riddle: How do you pass a new round of stimulus measures without tacitly admitting that the first round didn't work? (Answer: Don't call it a stimulus.) The second is harder: When does the economy become his own instead of his predecessor's? (Answer: sooner than he'd probably like.) It was only July when White House aides said it was premature to discuss a second round of measures to boost the economy. But now, with unemployment pushing 10 percent in September and projections that it will go even higher in 2010, Obama and the Democratic leadership are exploring new ways to reduce the pain. What to do? The low-hanging fruit would be simply to extend provisions already included in the original stimulus package. For example, continuing the unemployment benefits that are set to expire in November--a ""no-brainer,"" says Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, since people with low income tend to spend their extra cash--and make sure laid-off workers keep getting health insurance. Extending these policies should be easy politically as well, since they can be billed as social safety measures rather than stimulus. (Democratic leaders today introduced a bill that would extend unemployment benefits another 14 weeks.) Trickier would be passing a new batch of policies that weren't part of the original deal. The proposal that has gotten the most traction this week is a tax credit for businesses that hire new employees. The logic is simple enough: Reward companies that create jobs. The problem is implementation. The government could simply give every employer a payroll tax credit and hope it hires new workers. While that would be a windfall for companies, they might not use the money to expand payroll. ""You wouldn't get a big bang for the buck,"" says Ted Gayer of the Brookings Institution. Another option would be to give companies the bonuses only after they hire new workers. But that arrangement would be vulnerable to manipulation, says Gayer, since companies could twist the definition of ""new"" worker. Other ideas that haven't quite made it onto the president's desk: re-upping on the stimulus money given directly to states; paying employers to lower the number of work hours so they can hire new workers, per Dean Baker; and boosting small-business loans, as proposed by Mark Zandi of Moody'sEconomy.com. These proposals face the same questions as the original stimulus: How many jobs would they create and at what cost? The question is moot for policies like unemployment insurance, which isn't supposed to create new jobs. Two economists estimate that the employer tax credit, however, would cost $20,000 for each job created. Now compare that with the original stimulus package: The administration originally promised that it would save or create 3.5 million jobs. (So far, the administration says, the stimulus package has saved or created about 1 million.) At $757 billion, that's about $216,000 per job. Of course, money from the stimulus package was used for other things as well. But, politically, that was the tradeoff. With that precedent, $20,000 per job may be an easy sell. Even Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican whip, doesn't seem opposed. ""There is a lot of traction for this kind of idea,"" he told the New York Times. ""If the White House will take the lead on this, I'm fairly positive it would be welcomed in a bipartisan fashion."" But taking strong action on the economy comes with political risks. For one thing, a second round of stimulus implies that the first round didn't work--a claim made by economists from across the political spectrum. ""They put forth a package that by their own numbers wasn't going to be able to fully deal with the problem,"" says Baker. (Council of Economic Advisers Chairwoman Christina Romer thought the bill should have been $1.2 trillion, not $800 billion.) Republicans, meanwhile, point to the 8 million (and climbing) jobs lost since December 2007 as evidence that the president's plan isn't working. And that's just Obama's point: Since 2007. When he wasn't in office. Obama has often bemoaned the fact that he inherited ""a trillion-dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession."" Discussing the economy last week, Vice President Joe Biden said the administration ""inherited an awful lot of baggage."" But at some point, Bush's economy will become Obama's economy. And the more the Obama administration tinkers, the nearer that moment draws. Hence the urge to play down a second round of stimuluslike measures. Are we there yet? Probably not. Polls suggest that Americans are still giving Obama the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the economy, although in steadily decreasing numbers. The latest survey to address the question directly was Rasmussen, which found last week that 55 percent of Americans still blame Bush for the economy. (And that's coming from a polling outfit known for tilting toward conservatives.) Another proxy for blame is whether people think Obama's economic policies are working. Back in April, most people thought it was too early to tell, according to Pew Research Center. Now, fewer than half do--suggesting that people are finally holding Obama responsible for the current economy. And the people getting off the fence say Obama's policies are making things better rather than worse--in other words, siding with Obama more than with Bush. How long before Obama is responsible for the shape we're in, good or bad? ""I don't think there's a point with a switch flipping,"" says Mark Blumenthal of Pollster.com. It will be a gradual evolution, he says, and ""I don't think we're there yet."" One possible landmark will be Obama's one-year anniversary. ""Once you get past November--certainly by January--I think that' s a psychological benchmark for people,"" says Gayer. ""If we don't see improvement by spring, my sense is people will blame the administration."" Another possibility: whenever the stimulus was supposed to kick in. The problem is, the stimulus has been ""kicking in"" since February, and will continue to do so through 2011. So the administration could always argue that it's premature to judge the recovery package when only half of the money has been spent. That's no excuse, says Baker: More important to the economy than the total amount spent is the rate of spending, which won't get much higher than it is now. When will the Bush economy become the Obama economy? Whatever the polls say, we won't really know until the only poll that really matters--Nov. 2, 2010."	When should we stop faulting Bush for the economy and start blaming Obama?
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/all_quiet_on_the_afghan_front.html	"Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates recently said that those advising the president on Afghanistan should keep quiet in public. This has been interpreted as a direct message to Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan, who was asked last week whether a more limited counterterrorism effort would succeed in Afghanistan. He replied: ""The short answer is: no. You have to navigate from where you are, not where you wish to be. A strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position is probably a short-sighted strategy."" Gates said Monday: ""It is imperative that all of us taking part in these deliberations provide our best advice to the president candidly, but privately."" But Gates wasn't just talking about those under his direct command. ""Those who are reading this as a rebuke to McChrystal are reading it too narrowly,"" says Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell. ""This applies to everyone involved in the process."" That means White House aides. Administration aides have also been speaking, anonymously, about the general and his report on Afghanistan. In a Washington Post story two days after a secure three-hour meeting on the topic of Afghanistan, several administration sources expressed skepticism about McChrystal's thinking. ""A lot of assumptions--and I don't want to say myths, but a lot of assumptions--were exposed to the light of day,"" one senior administration official told the Post. One of the key assumptions exposed, according to the Post, was the contention that the return to power of the Taliban would mean a new sanctuary for al-Qaida. Any kind of thorough review tests even the most basic assumptions. The link between Taliban insurgents and al-Qaida is long-standing, so it is perhaps a sign of how rigorous the Obama process is that even this premise is now open to question. On Sunday, National Security Adviser Jim Jones was so wary of making the al-Qaida/Taliban connection that when asked on Face the Nation whether a return of the Taliban would mean a return of al-Qaida, he ducked the question. But asking whether the connection exists is not the same as saying the connection is a myth that must be ""exposed to the light of day."" Plus, if McChrystal is laboring under a false assumption that the Taliban's success would bring a new sanctuary for al-Qaida, then his commander in chief has been harboring the same assumption. It's been at the center of Obama's worldview from March, when he announced the new strategy, to as recently as August. Two months ago, Obama said, ""If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which al-Qaida would plot to kill more Americans."" Where does Obama stand on this issue today? Tuesday he spoke to the employees of the National Counterterrorism Center. ""We know that al-Qaida and its extremist allies threaten us from different corners of the globe--from Pakistan, but also from East Africa and Southeast Asia; from Europe and the Gulf."" What country is missing? Afghanistan, the country where, for months, Obama has talked about ""al-Qaida and its extremist allies,"" which previously had meant the Taliban. It was clear Monday at a George Washington University forum that Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton believe that the connection still exists. ""The thing to remember about Afghanistan is that that country, and particularly the Afghan-Pakistan border, is--is the modern epicenter of jihad,"" Gates said. ""It is where the mujahedin defeated the other superpower. And their view is, in my opinion, that they now have the opportunity to defeat a second superpower, which, more than anything, would empower their message and the opportunity to recruit, to fundraise and to plan operations."" Gates also tipped his hand on another key question in Afghanistan: whether to send more troops. ""The reality is that, because of our inability and the inability, frankly, of our allies, to put enough troops into Afghanistan, the Taliban do have the momentum right now."" It's the kind of comment that lets you know what he thinks without him saying anything directly. Does Gates favor sending more troops? If so, it's something he's saying to the president only in private."	Robert Gates wants all Afghanistan advice to the president to stay private.
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/10/the_deliberator.html	"President Obama came into office promising he wouldn't be captive to groupthink. He would test the assumptions of his advisers by seeking outside voices. As if to prove he meant it, he has already spoken to his predecessor at least once. He may want to do so again as he puzzles through what to do in Afghanistan. The call wouldn't be for strategic advice--Obama has kept much of the Bush military team in place, and he can hear from them directly. But there's only one other person on the planet who has an understanding of what Obama is going through--the conflicting military advice, the squabbling advisers, the condolence letters to the families. Obama's liberal allies are still cataloging Bush's strategic failures including the neglect in Afghanistan that has made the situation so bad there. They'd cringe at the idea of the president's choice of counsel. But Obama is smart enough to know that you can learn from the mistakes of your predecessors. (That's why he talks to the Clintons about health care reform.) It was during the inauguration that Obama told Bush that he hoped he'd be able to call on him from time to time. According to a former Bush aide, Bush told Obama he'd be happy to help in any way that he could but that the new president would have so many people advising him it would be all he could do to keep up with the official voices. That certainly seemed true Wednesday, when Obama convened a meeting to discuss Afghanistan. About 20 people were in the room. The meeting lasted for three hours. According to aides, it never touched on whether to send more troops. The next big meeting is next week. Obama's insistence on slow deliberations on Afghanistan contrasts with the policy tempo on other fronts. Obama has been a president of action. Economic collapse? Here's a government program to address it. Car companies failing? Here's a program to help them. Want the Olympics to come to your town? Obama can help--tonight in Copenhagen he plays his role of chairman of the Chicago Chamber of Commerce as he pitches that city to the International Olympic Committee. Even while policy was being debated, the message always was: Action is coming. On Afghanistan, however, we're watching the president in an extended period of cogitation. Before yesterday's meeting he'd talked to Stanley McChrystal, his top general in Afghanistan, only once. The questions about what to do next in Afghanistan are on the table, but Obama is not making the call. This has led to at least one odd role reversal in which a NATO secretary general has tried to stiffen the resolve of an American president. The White House calls this being careful and thorough. Republicans, including Karl Rove, call it wavering. Early in Obama's tenure, Defense Secretary Robert Gates talked about his new boss's thought process relative to the man who preceded him. In a Meet the Press interview, he said: ""I think that probably President Obama is somewhat more analytical. And he makes sure he hears from everybody in the room on an issue. And if they don't speak up, he calls on them."" Obama has been talking to people outside his circle. He has talked to Colin Powell. He also discussed the matter with John McCain, though not as much as McCain would have liked. McCain and fellow Sens. Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman had requested a meeting with Obama to talk about the situation. A person familiar with the president's thinking says that, unsurprisingly, his biggest concern is the unreliable Afghan government and particularly its president, Hamid Karzai. Aside from the policy question of what to do in Afghanistan, there is the political question of how the president goes about coming up with it. This is an issue that deserves   lots of deliberation. Gut-level decision-making is what caused so much trouble for the last administration. Bush's constant conversations with commanders on the ground, Obama's aides say, interrupted the chain of command. At one point, President Bush turned a briefing into a public press show. Obama, says an aide, thinks maintaining the chain of command has benefits. There are three others Obama talks to before McChrystal--Defense Secretary Gates, Gen. Petraeus, and Adm. Mullen (though Mullen, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, isn't directly in the chain of command). One Pentagon source said Obama has maintained an ""abnormal distance"" from his commander in Afghanistan. Another called it simply a ""difference in style"" from Bush. Another stylistic difference is that Obama's counselors in the Situation Room on Wednesday included his top political mind, David Axelrod. Karl Rove, who played a similar role for Bush, was not allowed in that setting (though he was deeply involved in the issue). President Obama was elected in part because he promised he would be a commander who wouldn't go rushing into deep and dangerous commitments. Officials at the Pentagon and White House counsel that even at Obama's deliberative pace, he'll still be moving faster than Bush did when he made his ""surge"" decision in 2006. Plus, the public is not screaming for more troops. In fact, if Obama does choose to send more troops, he can point back to all the thoughtful meetings that went into his decision."	Why Obama may want to ask Bush what to do in Afghanistan.
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/a_primer_on_racism.html	"More than a few naive souls hoped that the election of Barack Obama signaled a new era of racial harmony. Instead, alas, American race relations have entered a bizarre new phase in which tension is ubiquitous and almost anyone can claim to be the victim of racism. Former President Jimmy Carter lamented that ""there is an inherent feeling among many in the country that an African-American should not be president,"" in reaction to Rep. Joe Wilson's now-infamous outburst during President Obama's congressional address. Also of late, the Rev. Al Sharpton and many others cried racism over a tasteless New York Post cartoon, Cambridge police were accused of ""racial profiling"" after arresting   Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. at his home, and Newsweek asked ""Is Your Baby Racist?"" And although conservatives have long complained of unwarranted accusations of racism, two of their henchmen, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, have been shamelessly playing the race card. Politicians and pundits on both the left and right abuse the term racism to tar their political enemies. But decent people with good intentions also overuse the term as they struggle to draw attention to racial injustices that do not involve overt bigotry. With the R-word used to describe so many different things, it no longer has a clear and agreed-upon meaning. Attorney General Eric Holder has urged Americans to talk bravely and openly about race, but how can we when we aren't speaking the same language? In the interest of democratic dialogue, I offer this rough-and-ready primer on racism for the not-so-post-racist era. Below, I'll define several of the more commonly cited types of racism and offer my humble opinion as to whether they deserve the label. Institutional racismMany businesses, schools, clubs, and other organizations are racially homogenous or segregated, even though no one deliberately excludes racial minorities or tries to prevent them from succeeding. For instance, although roughly half of all college football players are black, only about 5 percent of head coaches are. Retired NBA star Charles Barkley made headlines when he claimed that his alma mater, Auburn University, was racist after it hired a white candidate--Gene Chizik--over a black candidate--Turner Gill--who had a better coaching record. But the larger problem is probably the college booster networks that help raise money for college sports. If a white coach can more easily establish a rapport with alumni than a black coach--whether the underlying reason is cultural similarities, long-standing social networks, prejudice, or some combination of the three--the college might prefer him for a reason that has nothing to do with race. Namely, money. On the other hand, if alumni prefer white coaches because of their race, then racism is still the root cause. And even if no one involved is a bigot, many scholars and activists would insist that this is a form of institutional racism. The term institutional racism suggests moral fault and culpability when often the racial inequity is unintentional. But, intended or not, practices that create ""built-in headwinds"" for minority groups are a serious injustice. Cultural racism Studies have shown that employers prefer resumes with conventional names to otherwise identical resumes with stereotypically black names like DeShawn or Shaniqua. Some employers may be weeding out blacks, but others may dislike not individual black people but what might be called ""black culture."" Employers who would be happy to hire a preppy Cosby kid might worry that people with ""black names"" are more likely to use ghetto slang, dress in gangster fashion styles, or cop a tough or sassy attitude on the job. Is this racism? Maybe not. In a notorius speech, Bill Cosby lambasted poor blacks for contributing to their own misfortunes by using slang, dressing badly, and giving their children ""names like Shaniqua, Taliqua, and Mohammed and all that crap."" Cultural misunderstanding and hostility is a serious problem in today's increasingly cosmopolitan society. But when Cliff Huxtable can be called a racist, it's probably time to rethink our terms. Unconscious racismHarvard psychologist Mahzarin Banaji has developed a test designed to smoke out unconscious racial bias. The test requires the subject, under intensive time pressure, to match black and white faces with value-laden terms such as good, smart, and diligent or bad, stupid, and lazy. If you find it easier to match white faces with good terms and black faces with bad terms, you have exhibited what Banaji calls an implicit association between race and merit or virtue. Although she scrupulously avoids using the term herself, almost everyone else has predictably described the results of her research in terms of unconscious racism. And the results are disquieting: Almost 90 percent of whites exhibit some unconscious racism against blacks, while around half of all blacks exhibit anti-black bias. Banaji's research suggests we have a way to go before we get to a post-racist utopia. But she warns against using the test to try to prove individual bias; in fact, she has pledged to testifyagainst anyone who tries to use her work to prove discriminatory intent in court. Other psychologists have questioned the whole approach. For instance, U.C.-Berkeley psychologist Phillip Tetlock thinks that Banaji's test doesn't prove anything about discrimination in real-life situations: ""We've come a long way from Selma, Alabama, if we have to calibrate prejudice in milliseconds,"" he argues. Environmental racismAfter the levees broke in New Orleans, it was hard to miss the overwhelming number of black victims of Hurricane Katrina. Some suggested that blacks suffered after the storm because of racially biased disaster-relief efforts. But the real problem was neighborhood segregation. Most blacks lived in the less-desirable low-lying areas of the city, which suffered the worst damage from the flooding. Almost every metropolitan area in the United States is home to such segregated minority neighborhoods, many of which are located next to environmental hazards such as garbage dumps, heavy industry, oil refineries, sewage-treatment facilities, and areas abandoned due to toxic contamination. Community and environmental activists have found common ground in condemning this pattern as environmental racism. The term environmental racism refers to a serious problem, but like institutional racism, it muddies the issue by implying that bad people acting with racial animus are behind it, when poverty, bad urban design, and segregated residential patterns put in place many years ago are really to blame. Reverse racismGlenn Beck took the fear of anti-white racism to new extremes when he accused President Obama of being a racist, but political hacks have for decades used accusations of reverse racism as part of a well-documented, cynical political strategy.  For instance, in 1990 North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms turned the polls around in his race against challenger Harvey Gantt * by playing the reverse race card. In Helms'  advertisement, a pair of white hands crumples a rejection letter while ominous music plays and a voice-over intones, ""You needed that job ... but they had to give it to a minority."" There are real instances of anti-white racism, such as Louis Farrakhan's crude diatribes against ""white devils."" But they are relatively few and rarely amount to more than impotent blustering. Affirmative action--often tarred as reverse racism by its opponents--doesn't qualify. Affirmative action is an imperfect but pragmatic effort to promote integration in the face of the effects of past and ongoing discrimination. There's plenty of room for legitimate criticism, but suggesting that affirmative action is a form of racism is disingenuous and turns what should be a level-headed debate into a shouting match. Racism is still a force to be reckoned with in American society. But we should think twice before jumping to the convenient conclusion that people who don't agree with us must be bigots. And we should call the bluff of people who play the race card for rhetorical advantage or political gain, whether they're leftist agitators or right-wing blowhards. There may never be consensus on what counts as racism and when it's in play. But this lexicon should give you a place to start for deciphering the many conversations about race that will no doubt continue. Correction,  Oct. 1, 2009: The original sentence misspelled Harvey Gantt's name. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	A primer on the word racism.

Meg Whitman went a step further: She didn't even go to the polls on Election Day. This is the latest charge against the California Republican gubernatorial candidate and former CEO of eBay, who first registered to vote in 2002, despite being eligible since 1974, according to a recent report by the Sacramento Bee. Whitman had previously acknowledged failing to vote ""on several occasions"" but had not revealed quite how many. ""[I]t's surprising, and of some concern, that someone so seemingly uninterested in politics would suddenly want to govern what is perhaps the most ungovernable state in the union,"" opined the Los Angeles Times. Whitman has apologized profusely. ""Every citizen should take time to vote, and on more than one occasion, I didn't,"" she told GOP activists at a state convention earlier this year. ""Voting is a precious gift handed down by generations of Americans. I regret not having delivered my vote on several occasions."" Whitman should save her breath: There is actually a good case for not voting. Many economists have long argued that voting is, on the individual level, irrational. The main reason: Your vote does not matter. As statisticians love to point out, you're more likely to be struck by lightning on the way to the polls than to have your vote actually decide the election. Steven E. Landsburg explained the numbers in Slate in the context of the 2004 presidential election:"	Meg Whitman shouldn't apologize for not voting.
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/playing_health_care_politics.html	"Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., has taken a lot of heat from both left and right ever since he unveiled his health care reform bill two weeks ago. The latest attack comes from the left: A new political ad accuses him of caring more about campaign contributions from insurance companies than a constituent with a serious heart defect but no insurance. Why? He's not supporting a government-backed insurance option. [Update, 4:50 p.m.: Baucus voted against it twice on Tuesday in the finance committee hearing, arguing inclusion would kill health care in the Senate. ""My goal is to get a bill out of this committee that gets 60 votes,"" he said.]  Liberal groups, like those that paid for the ad (they call themselves the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy for America, if you're keeping score at home), say that only a public option will create true competition with insurance companies and thus lower costs. Ostensibly, since President Obama supports a public option, these groups are his allies. But Max Baucus is also his ally. As chairman of the Senate finance committee, he has fashioned a bill Obama is relying on to advance his health care reform plans. So liberals who helped Obama get elected to end the influence of special interests are now attacking Obama's key man in the Senate for being so influenced by special interests that he's killing a top Obama priority. Objections to reform from Republicans or free-market conservatives are at least expected and (relatively) straightforward. As we approach the end game on health care reform, Obama's more delicate task will be managing opposition from within his own party. The ad won't influence the debate. There's not much money behind it, and it comes too late in the process. (It was just unveiled yesterday, and the Senate finance committee will vote on amendments to include a public option today. [Update: The committee voted down two versions of a public option today, 15-8 and 13-10.]) But the fracas is significant in a larger sense--as the latest salvo in a battle among factions in the Democratic Party over the shape of health care reform. And it will be the task of the president, who is leader of the party, to get everyone in line. In the ad, Bing Perrine, one of Baucus' constituents, describes how last year he collapsed because he has congenital heart disease. As a result, his medical costs have skyrocketed. A public option would help hold down those costs, Perrine explains, and then asks: ""Senator Baucus, when you take millions of dollars from health and insurance interests that oppose reform and oppose giving families like mine the choice of a public option, I have to ask: Whose side are you on?"" The message is pretty tough: Baucus is so craven he doesn't care about sick people. But the message is also muddled. The ad makes a point about the public option, but Perrine's plight could just as easily be used to illustrate the need to prohibit insurance companies from rejecting people who have pre-existing conditions. Perrine says he owes $100,000 because he couldn't get insurance, but if the Baucus bill (or any of the others) passed, insurance companies would have to cover him. In fact, regardless of what happens with the public option--and there are still three chances   it could become a part of health care reform--under any of the bills now being considered in the House or Senate, insurance companies would not be allowed to deny Perrine coverage. In his joint address to Congress on health care, the president vowed, ""If you misrepresent what's in this plan, we will call you out."" He's not about to do that here. Nor is he (or a White House aide) likely to stand up for Baucus, who is working hard to carry the president's water. He could easily argue that, given opposition in the Senate to the public option, progressives should rally around building support for fights that are winnable, such as increasing subsidies for working families or making sure insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions. That last option might be a nice thing to do. But it could be costly. Liberals don't think the public option is dead. They point to public polls that regularly show support for such a plan. Plus, fundraising for the ad has been brisk  and spiked after Tuesday's finance committee votes against the public option. If the president appeared to take Baucus' side, he would unnecessarily inflame passions in a sizable bloc of his party. At any rate, administration officials argue this ad and other efforts to target Democrats are mostly the kind of thing that concern party elites, not regular people. The president will have a lot of disputes to adjudicate as this legislation reaches its final stages. Why expend political capital now? Better to let liberals blame conservative Senate Democrats instead of President Obama for killing the public option. The president has never worked too hard to stop these intraparty attacks, and he's not about to start now. He's asked that liberal groups not attack their own. Chief of staff Rahm Emanuel has, too. The groups haven't listened. This isn't the first of these ads. Moveon.org and the Progressive Change Campaign targeted Democrats and earlier this month organized to put pressure on the White House. Perhaps none of the outside groups are afraid because there's not that much pressure. Arshad Hasan, executive director of Democracy for America, says no one from the White House or Obama's political group, Organizing for America, has ever directly asked them to stop. Staying out of the fight not only preserves the president's political capital; it also gives him room to maneuver. He gains with moderate Democrats by making public comments calling for liberals to lay off. But he also benefits by having liberal noise makers. He can point to them as evidence for the need for concessions like increased subsidies or some kind of public-option-like instrument--ideas that he supports anyway. Whether the president's hands-off approach has worked will be determined in the coming weeks. With nearly all Republicans opposed to the president's plan, the last stages of negotiations will be among Democratic factions. Obama came into office promising to bridge the partisan divide in Washington. But the outcome of the health care debate may depend more on his ability to bridge the divides in his own party."	Health care reform may depend on Obama's ability to mend fences in his own party.
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/just_skim_it.html	"Just when you thought the debate about health care reform couldn't get more obscure--is a co-op a public option? Will the CBO rescore the chairman's mark?--the Senate finance committee turned Wednesday morning to an even more arcane subject. It spent more than an hour arguing about whether to use ""conceptual"" or ""legislative"" language in the bill they will, one day, perhaps even in the year 2009, vote on. This may sound unimportant. Or, like discussions about fonts, it might seem deeply important to a fevered few. It's not. The debate touches on a familiar complaint that members of Congress don't read the legislation they vote on. Just because it's familiar, however, doesn't mean the complaint has merit. By custom, the finance committee uses ""conceptual language""--also known as plain English--for a couple of reasons. One, at least in this case, the legislative language doesn't yet exist: There are 500-plus amendments to the bill, and they aren't yet in final form. Two, it uses plain English because the issues it is talking about are complicated and technical. (See an example here.) So using ""conceptual language"" (found here) actually makes it more likely that members (and the public) can understand what's being debated. After everyone agrees, the concepts are sent to the Legislative Counsel's office and put into legislative language, which is debated and voted on. This process has been followed regardless of whether Republicans or Democrats are in the majority. But on the health care bill, Republicans on the committee wanted the final bill to be written in legislative language before they voted. Democrats called this demand a delaying tactic that would stall the bill for three weeks. The longer a bill sits dormant, the greater chance it will die (which is the whole reason the White House has been hurrying along health care legislation as much as it can). The concepts being discussed, they point out, have been under debate for more than a year, in great specificity. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, has been in intense discussion--more than 60 meetings lasting more than 100 hours. Nothing will be further illuminated by putting the bill into more complicated language. Republicans claimed it was a matter of simple common sense. ""I truly do not understand the skepticism about this request, the reluctance and the reticence. This is about doing our job,"" said Snowe. ""If it takes two more weeks, it takes two more weeks. We're talking about trillions of dollars in the final analysis. What is the rush? Is there's something happening in two weeks?"" Republicans argue the delay is necessary because there can be a slip between the agreement and the way it gets interpreted by the lawyers. After you've met with the architect, you still want to make sure the builder is faithful to your exciting idea for a pool table in the Jacuzzi. Politically, having Snowe make the go-slow case is a problem for Democrats. Until now, she's been portrayed as the reasonable Republican, and she may be the only Republican to sign onto health care reform in the end. Why is she suddenly so unreasonable? Partisans would prefer the idea be associated with Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky. He's eccentric and occasionally offensive. (They can also make cracks about him wanting more time so he can get in more shut-eye.) Republicans have been bringing up the reading problem outside the committee room, too, when talking about the broader push for health care reform. ""The era of the 1,000-page bill is over,"" said Lamar Alexander of Tennessee recently. ""We've proven we don't do comprehensive legislation well in these 1,000-page bills that nobody reads."" The remedial-reader charge is a winner as a political tool because it has both highbrow and lowbrow appeal. The working man wonders why the lazy senator can't meet his minimum job requirements. The elite woman with a graduate degree not only thinks it's lazy--after all, everyone in her grad-school seminar was expected to do the reading--but it also confirms her dim view about congressional curiosity. To independent voters, being unable to read the legislation suggests an unnecessary rush that leads to sloppy work. To everyone, it's as galling as the blowhard uncle at Thanksgiving who talks and talks without knowing what he's talking about. It's a bipartisan complaint usually made by the party in the minority. Sen. Obama complained about it during the Bush presidency. It works doubly well for Republicans, though. The lengthy bills are all the proof they need that government has grown too large. (The adherence to careful consideration does not apply when issuing press releases, however. When Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., put out the 200-plus pages of his chairman's ""mark"" last week, Republicans were denouncing it within minutes.) Though the politics of the complaint are irresistible, it doesn't make much sense. Just because lawmakers read legislation doesn't mean they understand it. The reverse is also true: Just because they understand it doesn't mean they've read it. Drafting and reading legislative language is an art form. Staffers who know how to read it and write it are hired to translate the language. They get down in the weeds so the legislators can stay focused on the big principles. Plus, members of Congress have a hard enough time knowing where they stand on the big things. That's why they're always accusing one another of flip-flopping. Let's not confuse them by making them puzzle over something like this: ""For purposes of extension of an agreement with a qualifying ACO under subsection (g)(2), the Secretary shall treat receipt of an incentive payment for a year by an organization under the physician group practice demonstration pursuant to section 1866A as a year for which an incentive payment is made under such subsection, as long as such practice group practice organization meets the criteria under subsection (b)(2)."" Think of it like buying a house: I want to buy this house at this price. I make an agreement with the seller. A month later I sit down in a lawyer's office and go through page after page of legal jargon with someone I trust--not just to have the expertise to explain it to me but to protect me from anything I don't want in there. I could study real estate law, read the contract, and make my own determination--but I have a job and a family. If there's a problem with the final language of the contract, my lawyer alerts me and modifications are made (or I back out). That's what finance committee Democrats say Republicans will be able to do when the health care language is crafted into final language that will come up for a vote on the Senate floor. Whether members of Congress are able to read the legislation is a separate issue from whether they are given enough time to consider it. When Obama aides crafted the stimulus bill, it was being pasted together so quickly even members who were on the committees authorized to write the legislation didn't know what was in it. That kind of rush to completion is likely to happen this time with health care. That  should embarrass President Obama, who talked about transparency so much during the campaign, but every indication suggests the White House will be untroubled by this inconsistency. I am also not making an argument for stupidity or laziness. Just because a member of Congress hasn't read a bill doesn't mean he is excused from knowing what's in the bill. A good senator follows the principles of good management, learning how to delegate and then demanding results from those he's tasked with sifting through the legislative language. Walking out of a meeting with a senator last night, I encountered half a dozen policy aides headed in to brief him. I had no doubt from the previous off-the-record conversation that the senator knew the details of policy proposals, not because he'd read all the legislative language but because he quizzed his staff. His questions were informed by other kinds of reading--expert testimony, academic journals, and even news articles, which, one hopes, dear reader, are worth sticking with all the way to the end."	The case for not reading the legislation you're voting on.
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/hes_no_alec_baldwin.html	"""Children! Children!"" Stephen Baldwin is shouting across a room full of kids at the Values Voter Conference on Friday night in Washington. The room goes instantly quiet. Baldwin seems surprised. When he talks ""like your creepy parents,"" he says, ""you guys listen."" Baldwin sounds nothing like anyone's creepy parents. Quite the opposite: He's the cool dad they never had. The one who has 18 tattoos and likes skateboarding. The one who lets them stay up late and eat ice cream and crack jokes about Joe Biden. Which is exactly what they're doing right now. A few dozen young people, roughly between the ages of 12 and 25, have gathered in a big room at the Omni Shoreham Hotel after a long day of speeches, panels, and general right-wing team-building. Some have come to the Family Research Council's annual convention with their schools. Others came with their parents. (For many, school and home are the same thing.) Caterers in tuxedo shirts are scooping vanilla and chocolate and strawberry ice cream out of giant vats, while Baldwin and Kevin McCullough, with whom Baldwin co-hosts a weekly conservative radio show, brief the kids on the night's activities. First up: The drafting of what McCullough describes as the ""largest letter ever sent to Barack Obama from people 25 and younger."" On one side of the room stand four easels supporting four giant sheets of paper, each of which says at the top, in big writing, ""Dear President Obama."" Each sheet has a different theme. There's one for social and moral issues, one for national security, one for the environment, and one for health care. Over the next hour, the students are supposed to grab a marker and fill each page, which will then be delivered directly to the White House. Meanwhile, Baldwin and McCullough lead the room in a Joe Biden-themed version of ""Two Truths and a Lie."" The gist: They read three statements about the vice president, and the kids guess which one is false. For example, which of the following is a lie? A) Joe Biden was the longest-serving senator from Delaware. B) He was once the second poorest senator. C) He voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. Whoever gets it right (C) moves onto the next round. Putting a Baldwin in charge of a roomful of children might strike many parents as a terrible idea. When the words ""Baldwin"" and ""parenting"" appear in the same sentence, they usually refer to the ugly incident in which Alec Baldwin berated his daughter over the phone. Stephen is a different story. For years, he was the worst role model since, well, Alec.He's the youngest of the four Baldwin brothers but hardly the least. (Most people can name three of them: Alec, Stephen, and Billy. The last one--the one you're trying to think of right now--is Daniel.) Stephen started acting in films in 1988. His career peaked seven years later, when he landed a role in The Usual Suspects. Things went downhill from there, as Baldwin recounts in his memoir,  The Unusual Suspect: My Calling to the New Hardcore Movement of Faith. His life descended into a godless vortex of drugs, sex, and Bio-Dome. It wasn't until after 9/11 that Baldwin decided to clean up. Since then, Baldwin has dedicated himself to spreading his own brand of family-friendly gospel, especially to young people. Aside from his radio show, he writes books--his latest is a murder mystery--appears on talk shows, and has founded a network of 200 ""skating ministries,"" or groups of Christian skateboarders. It's easy to see why Baldwin, or as he calls himself, ""Stevie B.,"" targets youth. He communicates on their level. ""This guy is gnarly,"" he says, posing for a photo with 15-year-old Luke Peeler of Triangle, Va. When I ask if I can record his comments, he jokes, ""As long as you promise to use these comments against us in our political futures. ... Badum-bum!"" While playing ""Two Truths and a Lie,"" Baldwin playfully struggles to read one of the facts: ""Biden is the first--what is that word?"" ""Delawarean!"" say the kids in unison. ""Is that really a word?"" Baldwin asks. ""Biden is the first""--he pauses again--""Duuueeeeaaahhh to become vice president."" Everyone laughs. Talking like a tween has its drawbacks. When he went on Fox and Friends to promote his new book during the Republican National Convention, host Steve Doocy said, ""You walked up to the set, and you were absolutely effervescent in talking about Sarah Palin last night."" Baldwin stared at him. ""I was what-ey what-ey?"" Of course, his unpretentiousness is part of his appeal. Baldwin has the number 330 tattooed on the back of his neck. ""John 3:30,"" he says. ""I must decrease so that God may increase in my life. It's about humility."" That's one way of looking at it: to declare yourself a tool of God is to suggest that you're merely a tool of God. There's also another way: to declare yourself a tool of God is to say, I'm a tool of freaking God. Everything I do is meant to be. This seems to be Baldwin's way. ""I believe it's by the grace of God and God's perfect will that we've all had this success,"" he told an audience Friday afternoon, referring to his and his brothers' careers. ""For me, in retrospect, it's completely understandable that the Lord would use me now with that platform to do his work in these times. I'm very grateful for that opportunity; it's a privilege."" God was also the force behind his radio show. McCullough had been in New York radio for a few years when Baldwin called in to his show one day. The two hit it off and became friends. Then God told them to start their own show, which launched in July 2008. ""Without trying to sound too hocus-pocus-y,"" recounts McCullough, ""we had an experience where we heard God saying to the other, to us, that we're supposed to work together."" McCullough has known Baldwin only since 2004, but by all accounts, he says, Stephen is a different person from the tabloid-fodder Hollywood star. ""What his brothers will tell you is, they may not like his politics, but they can't argue with the fact that he was once a womanizer, a drug addict, an alcoholic, an addictive personality who has been set free from all of those things."" What most people see as a plummeting career--few would recognize any of his 30 or so movies since Half-Baked--has in fact been a deliberate rejection of Hollywood, according to McCullough. ""When he came to faith, he still could have done the 'Here, show your butt cheek and make love to this woman, and we'll pay you $4 million.' "" But he didn't. Instead, he has dedicated himself to more Christian-themed movies. And in the Omni Shoreham Hotel on Friday night, at least, Baldwin is still very much a celebrity. Stephen Baldwin at the Values Voter Conference is a lot like Alec Baldwin at, say, Netroots Nation. The difference is that Alec's fans have actually seen his movies. Of the dozen or so Baldwin fans I spoke with, not one had seen The Usual Suspects. ""The Genius Club,"" says Luke Peeler when I ask him which Baldwin movie was his favorite. It's a 2006 film about a group of geniuses brought together to stop a madman from nuking Washington. Like many of Baldwin's recent films, this one has Christian overtones: The protagonist is a seminary student who quotes scripture and has the initials ""J.C."" Baldwin is also a powerful speaker, and onstage he has adopted the rolling cadences of an evangelical pastor. ""The dream for me is being confident in what I hope for, and believing in what I cannot see,"" he tells the audience. ""Preach it,"" deadpans McCullough. Sometimes the free association comes out borderline nonsensical: ""In order for the spirit of the Lord to operate through us--to allow to that to be imparted into our politics, culture, society, is that we need to be in the place in our experience in that dynamic that allows for the spirit of the Lord to do it through us."" Baldwin has not abandoned showbiz altogether. In recent years, he has harnessed his B-list celebrity on reality TV, appearing on Fear Factor (he won), Celebrity Apprentice (he placed third), and I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! (he came in fifth), the last of which turned him temporarily into a parasitic host. After getting bitten by 185 bugs in one day, another bug laid eggs in the pus of one of the bites. When he returned home, he was pregnant--McCullough's word--with thousands of baby bugs. Meanwhile, he has nursed a career as a budding pundit. He endorsed Mike Huckabee in the 2008 presidential election and in turn got Sarah Palin's endorsement as her ""favorite Baldwin brother."" He appears semiregularly on Fox News, and he and McCullough participated in Glenn Beck's 9/12 march on Washington this month. Christianity is his message, but he clearly pays attention to the cable-driven minutiae. ""Listen, however the media does or does not cover certain realities and/or how they spin it, over a million people marched on the Capitol for that event,"" he told me. (That number is highly disputed, and the the person who originally cited ABC as reporting that 1.5 million people showed up for the protest, Freedomworks president Matt Kibbe, has since recanted and apologized.) As for health care, TARP, the auto bailout, and the rest of Obama's policies, says Baldwin, ""Our message is simply this: Who should decide what's best for you? You or your government?"" He distances himself from the birthers and those who question Obama's religion. ""I don't think that's fair,"" he says. ""I don't think it's anybody's right to judge whether or not somebody called themselves a Christian. But actions speak louder than words."" McCullough elaborated: ""The president could help himself by not going to Cairo University and saying America is a Muslim nation. By not saying that our values are the same as Islam. He could help himself in those areas by making a stronger distinction."" Both hosts reject the idea that the tone of the debate is getting out of hand. Divisiveness isn't ruining the country, says McCullough: ""That's what this country was built upon. In the First Continental Congress, one of the senators beat another over the head with a cane because they disagreed over a founding principle."" Baldwin chimes in: ""Whereas we attempted to beat Barack Obama over the head with John McCain! But it didn't work. Badum-bum!"" I ask Baldwin if he'd ever considered political office. ""This question keeps coming up,"" he says. ""You know it was Alec Baldwin who said to me four weeks ago, 'I've had a revelation: All the things you're doing are positioning you to run for political office in the future.' "" At this, Stephen Baldwin erupts into laughter. ""I can tell you now there will never come a day where I run for political office."" ""To be honest with you,"" says McCullough, ""I'd be frightened for America if that finger was on the nuclear arsenal."" As the ice cream social winds down, Baldwin and McCullough glance over some of the kids' letters to the president. ""This is a Christian event,"" says McCullough, ""so anything that doesn't represent a Christian message or tone, we're gonna take down."" That appears to be quite a lot of it. While some students wrote long paragraphs arguing against government intrusion or politely explaining why Joe Wilson's outburst wasn't racist, some were less genteel: ""Dear Loser: UR Health Care plan sucks!"" ""Obama Lies, Grannie Dies"" ""BABY KILLER!"" Others were more universal: ""Obama, I want a PS3."" And my favorite: ""Please don't let I Am Legend to happen."" When no one is looking, one of Baldwin's daughters, 12, grabs a marker and scrawls a message in the lower corner of one of the sheets: ""Obama makes a boo booBaby go 'bye bye'Poo poo to you Obama. Liar!"" As her father might say, Badum-bum!"	Stephen Baldwin talks God at the Values Voter Conference in Washington.
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/its_all_about_them.html	"President Obama has spent a lot of time lately speaking on behalf of imperiled or embattled enterprises, such as Wall Street, General Motors, and his own health care plan. Another beleaguered institution could use his help: the United States Congress. It's a very unpopular bunch--and its bad reputation is hurting the president's plans for health care reform. After the August recess, a senior Democratic congressional aide explained one of the lessons Democrats had learned during the summer. They left Washington armed with a list of goodies health reform would deliver to regular people: protection from insurance companies that would deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, protection from insurers who would drop coverage on a whim, and the security that comes from knowing some form of health insurance would always be available. Their constituents were highly skeptical. It wasn't because people didn't want those things--they desperately do. Poll after poll shows it. They just didn't trust Congress to deliver them. In fact, if you believe the polls, most people don't trust Congress to deliver a sandwich. A recent Pew Research Center study found 37 percent with a favorable opinion of Congress, while 52 percent hold an unfavorable view. Positive opinions of Congress have declined by 13 points since April and are now at one of the lowest points in more than two decades of Pew Research Center surveys. It's not that people worry Congress can't pass legislation. It's that the legislation unleashes a host of unintended consequences that water down promises or create other problems. Or that legislation today is undone by legislation tomorrow when the political situation changes. On the health care issue, Congress is back in control. Obama's speech last week to the joint congressional session was designed, in part, to make the issue his own. And for good reason: According to the Pew poll, 56 percent of Americans have at least a fair amount of confidence in his handling of the issue. Only 45 percent have the same view of Democratic congressional leaders, and only 39 percent say that about Republican leaders. Despite the president's efforts, however, the health care debate is basically back where it was before the August recess. The story is about what provisions are going to make it into what bills. The president talks about ""his plan,"" but such a thing doesn't exist in Congress, where the business of making health care legislation is taking place. So the White House is once again reacting to what's happening on the Hill. White House aide David Axelrod was back on the Hill on Tuesday meeting with Democrats, as he did just days before they left for the August recess. In the House, liberal Democrats are demanding that the president insist a public option be included in legislation. In the Senate, the topic didn't even come up, according to Sen. Ben Nelson. Said a senior leadership aide: ""That's because everyone knows the public option is dead on arrival up here."" The daily news narrative is now going to be about the skirmishes and developments in Congress. Two of the key players were beset by swarms of reporters Tuesday after Senate Democrats met with Axelrod. One, Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the finance committee, said the bill he will release tomorrow ""is essentially what the president outlined."" At the center of the other scrum was Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a champion of the public option who sits on the finance committee. He has said he cannot vote for the Baucus bill. Republicans are happy to play on Congress' low reputation and the confusion that inevitably surrounds these massive acts of legislation. ""The era of the 1,000-page bill is over,"" said Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. ""We've proven we don't do comprehensive legislation well in these 1,000-page bills that nobody reads."" In the end, there's not much that the president really can do to improve Congress' standing. And, given some of the early polls relating to Obama's salesmanship of health care reform, members of the House and Senate might not want the help. In the latest Washington Post/ABC poll, 54 percent said the more people heard about the president's health care plan, the less they liked it. (Forty-one percent held the opposite view.) That may be a temporary condition for reform, but given the public mood about Congress, a slip would give its members the same standing as an even more distrusted institution: the media."	On health care reform, Obama needs to get Americans to trust Congress.
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/pollster_heal_thyself.html	"How did President Obama do in his big health care speech last week? Let's judge using the White House's measuring stick. Before the speech, aides pointed to a few key goals. They wanted to inform people who were confused, persuade those with insurance that they would benefit, explain that the president's plan would not increase the deficit, and reassure seniors they wouldn't suffer. Sounds simple enough. Unfortunately, there's no way to assess Obama's performance without using polls--and three polls taken after his speech show mixed, if not contradictory, results. Good News: A CBS poll shows that the president's approval rating on the issue of health care increased 12 points to 52 percent. When asked whether the president had clearly explained his plans for health care reform, 42 percent said yes--an improvement of nine percentage points. So he gets good marks on clearing up the confusion. Among those who actually watched, the results were even better: Some 58 percent said he had been clear, and 60 percent liked what they heard. Thus we have some evidence of the president's ability to make impressions on those who actually hear his message. He'll be talking a lot about health care in the coming weeks, and this suggests that if people hear him, he has the opportunity to win their support. Obama also rallied Democrats: 85 percent approve of his handling of the issue, according to CBS. In an ABC/Washington Post poll, 88 percent of liberal Democrats support the reform plan as is, and 81 percent still support it even if a government-run portion is not included. Middling News: According to the ABC/Post poll, the president also seems to have made some headway in convincing people that their insurance won't change. Half of the insured now see that it's possible legislation would allow individuals to keep their coverage without changes, up from 37 percent in June. The president still has work to do, though: In a separate question, majorities still think changes to the health care system would hurt or not improve their insurance coverage, their costs, and their overall care. Bad News: The president could not persuade even those who listened to his speech that there was something in health reform for them. Many analysts believe that unless people believe their lives will improve, they'll offer only lukewarm support for the president's plan, even though they may support the broader notion of reforming the system. In the CBS poll, 31 percent of those who watched the speech said the reform would benefit them, only a five-point increase from before the speech. Some 27 percent thought the reforms would hurt them, and 39 percent thought they'd have no effect. So about two-thirds of those who heard the president make the case weren't convinced. As a point of comparison: In February, after Obama gave a speech on the economy, 51 percent who listened thought his economic policies would help them personally, a 15-point jump from before the speech. (Of course, this may say less about Obama's ability to persuade and more about the difficult nature of the health care issue. Or it may simply reflect the fact that he's now six months into an administration rather than in a post-inaugural honeymoon glow.) Obama also still has work to do convincing people that reform will not add to the deficit. Although he added a new promise in his speech--he would lock himself in to finding additional funds in future years of the plan if initial savings didn't materialize--the audience hasn't signed on yet. Almost two-thirds, 65 percent in the Washington Post poll, said Obama's plan would increase the deficit a great deal or somewhat. According to a CNN survey, three-quarters of those polled said they think his plan will lead to an increase in the federal deficit. According to CBS, among those who listened to the speech--60 percent of whom generally approved of what they heard--reaction was mixed: Half believed the president's claim that the deficit would not grow; half didn't. Seniors, another key audience Obama was talking to, are also tough to crack. The president made a direct appeal to them in the speech, emphasizing that Medicare would not be negatively affected by reforms. But after the speech, 56 percent of seniors told the Post they thought Obama's reforms would weaken Medicare. Finally, the Post analysis of their poll shows a deadlock with 46 percent in favor of proposed reforms and 48 percent opposed. A program without a government plan--the much-discussed ""public option""--appears to increase support for reform by four points and weaken opposition by six. The improvement of support without the public option seems to contradict another of the poll's findings in which 55 percent say they support a public option. A whopping 76 percent support a public option if it is limited only to those unable to get private insurance--which is Obama's plan. What accounts for the discrepancy? Nate Silver says the Post's methodology, but one explanation may be that the split is another example of the well-documented divide between the way people think about reform in general and reform as it applies to their situation. A June CBS poll showed that 77 percent were satisfied with their own health care but only 48 percent were satisfied with health care for the country as a whole. Pollsters suggest that what may be happening in this case is that people like the public option in the abstract as something that might fix America's larger health care problem. Or when it's discussed as a way to pressure unpopular insurance companies (as it was in the Post's question), they like that competition in the abstract. But when they're asked about an overall reform package, they start thinking about themselves more and figure that a public option will disrupt the system and interfere with their care. That sentiment reminded me of a finding in a New York Times/CBS poll from June in which 72 percent said they would support a Medicare-like government option--but 68 percent also said they thought it would limit their access to tests and treatments. The president's aides repeatedly insisted before the president's speech to a joint session of Congress that the health care debate would not be changed in one night. The numbers prove they were right. Now, the test will be whether public support can be changed by sheer repetition. Since the big speech, Obama has held two health-care-related events and sat for interviews with 60 Minutes, Bloomberg, and CNBC. He has another town hall on the topic this week and on Sunday will appear on five news programs. Hillary Clinton was the last politician to perform that grueling cycle of talk in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Obama hopes that health care reform is not as insurmountable an obstacle as he turned out to be for Clinton."	Trying to make sense of the public's contradictory feelings about health care reform.

Members of Congress make a statement every time the president does--only with their feet instead of their mouths. (Although sometimes they use that too. Just ask Rep. Joe Wilson.) President Obama's health care speech at the Capitol Wednesday night had more up-downs, cheers, jeers, and heckles than any State of the Union in recent memory. But behind every hoot, holler, and ovation was a complex, lighting-quick decision-making process. Let us break it down. The pseudoscience of ovation-ology suggests that the president's speech was equal parts Democratic red meat and bipartisan overtures. By my count, the Democratic caucus alone stood and applauded 10 times during Obama's speech. Most applause occurred after determined or uplifting statements like ""I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs can find them"" or partisan red meat like his quip that ""too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for."" But Republicans applauded, too. The number of bipartisan standing ovations, with both sides of the House and Senate leaping to their feet, was nine. And once--after Obama's nod to medical malpractice reform--Republicans gave their own ovation. Sometimes the appropriate response is obvious. When Obama said he wanted affordable insurance for everyone, GOP members rose to their feet, lest they risk being seen as churlish. When he mentioned medical malpractice, the Republican section responded with applause and hoots more likely to be heard in a beer hall than the halls of Congress. When he promised to ""make sure that no government bureaucrat ... gets between you and the care that you need,"" they had to applaud--the words could have been Sen. Mitch McConnell's. Other times, Republicans were visibly conflicted on whether to clap or not. When Obama said that ""our health care problem is our deficit problem,"" Democrats rose along with one Republican, Rep. Paul Ryan, who stood there with his lower lip thrust out as if to say, ""Fair point."" When the president made overt (some might say patronizing) attempts to reach across the aisle--""We should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have""--the GOP side applauded, if grudgingly. The Republicans with the toughest jobs were the moderates: The senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, rose several times along with the Democrats, staring straight over the heads of their GOP colleagues. Some individual members were animated throughout. When Obama said that slowing the growth of health care costs by one-tenth of 1 percent would reduce the deficit by $4 trillion, deficit hawk Paul Ryan rolled his eyes and grimaced, as if doing the calculation in his head. Republicans were also quick to laugh--a little too hard, perhaps--when Obama understated that ""there remain some significant details to be ironed out."" But the guy who stole the show, of course, was Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina. When Obama said that health care reform will not cover illegal immigrants, Wilson shouted, ""You lie!"" Heads snapped, and the member next to him gestured for him to quiet down. Obama paused slightly and pointed, but seemed unfazed. (When the speech was over, Wilson vanished.) Other members came equipped with props. When Obama said he would listen to the GOP ""if you come to me with a serious set of proposals,"" a dozen members on the right waved aloft paper-clipped stacks of paper--bills, presumably. ""Right here! Right here!"" shouted one member. Others brought signs scrawled on the back of 8 1/2 x 11 sheets of paper. One GOP member alternated between flashing signs that read ""What Plan?"" and ""What Bill?"" The speech was long--47 minutes--so members could be forgiven for zoning out. That seemed to be the case with John McCain, who took a long few seconds to perk up, smiling, after Obama praised one of his campaign ideas. Democrats, for their part, had a much easier job: applaud as much as possible without making a fool of yourself. Most enthusiastic by far were Rep. Al Green of Texas, who shouted ""That's right"" when Obama said health care was a ""moral issue"" and waved his hand like an Atlanta Braves chop during lengthy ovations, and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, whose regular ""mmm-hmm""s could be heard all the way from the balcony. Do the ups and downs matter? Yes--for about five minutes. (Or, if you're Joe Wilson, until the next election day.) But for those five minutes, the outbursts, calculated or not, provide a brief glimpse into the opposition's psyche."	How members of Congress decide when to sit, stand or heckle at a president's speech.
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/situation_almost_critical.html	"In his back-to-school remarks Tuesday, President Obama told America's schoolchildren to pay attention. By Wednesday, when he speaks to a joint session of Congress about health care reform, he hopes the message will have trickled up to their parents. Cutting through the fog surrounding the issue may be the president's biggest challenge of the evening. In a Pew poll taken in early September, 67 percent of Americans say the health care debate remains hard to understand. That's about the same as the 63 percent that said the issue was hard to understand in mid-July. Despite August's carnival (and sometimes gothic) atmosphere, the president has not lost the public. It increasingly disapproves of his handling of the health care issue, but in general it still supports reform. According to a recent CBS poll, more than 70 percent say the system needs a major change. As Obama put the final touches on his speech, the president appears to have already achieved one goal. He's spurred the Senate finance committee to quicken its pace. Chairman Max Baucus provided an 18-page framework to the other members of the ""Gang of Six"" trying to find a bipartisan basis for agreement. Last week, a senior administration official said of the committee's long process of coming to consensus, ""If there's a thing in this process that deserves to be called a death panel the [Senate] Finance Committee is it."" But this new development has caused a slight reappraisal. Maybe the committee's work might be useful in forging a compromise after all. The president's aides say he will get specific Wednesday about the areas of common agreement--from insurance reform and regulation to measures for controlling health care's skyrocketing costs. The argument will be simple: We're so close on so much of this, and the public wants it. We can't turn back now. The more specific the president gets, the better he'll be able to clear up public confusion. The White House hopes that once people hear the facts, they'll start believing that the big changes they say they want won't harm their individual health care. Clarity also helps supporters in search of political cover. If Obama backs it, it's safer for them to back it. When health care reform is associated with Congress, the public has a less-favorable view. Fifty-five percent of Americans say they have either a great deal or fair amount of confidence in the president when it comes to dealing with health reform, about 10 percentage points more than those who say they trust Congress on it, according to a recent Pew poll. The president has actually been pretty specific, as he argued in a July interview with Karen Tumulty of Time. It's very possible it won't seem like there's much new in his remarks. But even if he repeats himself, he will be repeating himself in a highly charged moment at which people are paying more attention. According to a recent Pew poll, 56 percent of Americans say they plan to watch the speech. We saw an example of how the old can seem new on Monday when the president spoke to the AFL-CIO. He used his campaign voice, and the speech was heralded for its emotional tone. Obama gave a nearly identical speech, lending the same emotion to the cause and calling out his critics, more than two months ago at a campaign rally for New Jersey Gov. John Corzine. The DNC mailed a clip of it to supporters to fire them up for the August fight. The question is whether the president will now keep using that same tone not only to rally supporters to the cause but to also warn opponents about the political consequences of doing so. The mere notion that the president is willing to put the weight of his office and his rhetoric behind the cause is what made Monday's speech so appealing to supporters. It's why they're optimistic when they hear that he's going to get more specific Wednesday. On Monday, he sharpened his remarks about insurance companies ""raking in the profits"" while denying people coverage. He suggested they benefited from a fundamental unfairness in the current system. This heartened reform proponents, who believe that Obama has to make insurance companies more obvious villains in order to explain the value of reform for those who already have insurance. ""Right now the fear of the unknown is trumping the fear of insurance companies,"" says one strategist involved with a third-party group advocating for reform. The other key question for supporters is whether the president will really get more specific about his support for an increased government role in health care--the so-called ""public option."" At the Labor Day rally, after using all of the flashes of campaign style that worked so well in his race against McCain, Obama then said this about his support for a government role in the insurance market: ""I continue to believe that public option within the basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs."" That's a statement of belief, not a commitment of energy. The debate has reached the point at which Obama needs to ""draw lines in the sand,"" to use one of the official cliches of the 2009 Health Care Reform Debate, because after he leaves the Capitol, Congress will go back to its messy work of making legislation. The president has to be clear enough to avoid having the public debate hijacked by the day-to-day congressional process as it was during June and July. If he merely explains and describes rather than advocates the clear contours of what he supports, he'll merely be drawing pictures in the sand. Those might be pretty, but they don't demand attention."	Obama's latest attempt to reshape the health care debate.
