During a news conference, Ramos stood and peppered Trump with questions on his immigration plan, which calls for mass deportation. Trump dismissed him--""Go back to Univision""--and a guard for the candidate removed him from the room. Ramos eventually came back to the room, where Trump took his questions. The whole exchange was dramatic, riveting TV--illustrative of Trump's aggressive disdain for journalists, and a notch against him for the millions of Hispanic Americans who watch and respect Ramos, sometimes called the ""Walter Cronkite of Latino America."" The most interesting moment of the news conference came a little later, however, when Trump was talking about money, and fundraising in particular. Here's what he said:"	Democrats Should Steal This Brilliant Method of Wooing Working-Class Whites from Trump

To these Democrats, Clinton isn't a strong bet, and worse, there isn't a strong alternative. Bernie Sanders? Popular, but too far to the left to unify a broad and diverse national party. Martin O'Malley? Not exciting. Enter Joe Biden. The sitting vice president is the third-most visible Democratic politician behind President Barack Obama and Clinton. The Wall Street Journal reports he's moving closer to a run: He has sat with political allies, talked with family, and even met with influential Democrats like Elizabeth Warren. Yes, if he ran he'd start from behind, but he's popular and could build a formidable primary campaign with the right backing and staff. There's also something to the idea of a Biden run. Even as the favorite, Clinton needs an effective sparing partner on the trail. A Biden run might be good for her skills as a candidate--a point I've argued before. But it's worth stepping from the horserace to ask a different kind of question: Would a run be good for Biden? Large parts of the Democratic Party--including a confrontational activist movement--are committed to de-escalating the war on drugs and moving crime policy away from the approach of the 1980s and 1990s, an approach that Biden pioneered. This is more than trouble for his still-hypothetical campaign; it's trouble for his legacy. A large part of running for president is intense scrutiny on personal history and political records. But once you're in office, that scrutiny subsides. Once you've left, it almost disappears. Right now, Biden is beloved, an avuncular and light-hearted figure who contrasts the president's stoic cool and adds a touch of heart to the seemingly mechanistic Obama White House. Forgotten (at least, outside academia and a few corners of political media) is Biden's earlier persona: a leader in America's drug war. For a generation, Biden was at the front of a national push for tough drug laws and police militarization. If you consider her time in Bill Clinton's White House, that's true for Hillary, too. The difference is that she was first lady--an advocate for her husband's policies, but not a lawmaker. That's why she's able to meet face to face with members of the Black Lives Matter movement and not look disingenuous when she says she has changed her mind on the subject. Biden's Senate career, by contrast, was defined by his aggressive and vocal support for the drug war. Here are the highlights of that history: In 1984, he worked with Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond and the Reagan administration to craft and pass the Comprehensive Control Act, which enhanced and expanded civil asset forfeiture, and entitled local police departments to a share of captured assets. Critics say this incentivizes abuse, citing countless cases of unfair and unaccountable seizures. In one case last February, Drug Enforcement Administration officers seized $11,000 in cash from a 24-year-old college student. They didn't find guns or drugs, but they kept the money anyway. In 1986, Biden co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which created new mandatory minimum sentences for drugs, including the infamous crack-versus-cocaine sentencing disparity. A crack cocaine user with only five grams would receive five years without parole, while a powder cocaine user had to possess 500 grams before seeing the same punishment. The predictable consequence was a federal drug regime that put its toughest penalties on low-level drug sellers and the most impoverished drug users. Biden would also play an important role in crafting the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which strengthened mandatory minimums for drug possession, enhanced penalties for people who transport drugs, and established the Office of National Drug Control Policy, whose director was christened ""drug czar"" by Biden. His broadest contribution to crime policy was the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, commonly called the 1994 Crime Bill. Written by Biden and signed by President Clinton, it increased funds for police and prisons, fueling a huge expansion of the federal prison population. As journalist Radley Balko details in The Rise of The Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces, it also contributed to the rapid growth of militarized police forces that used new federal funds to purchase hundreds of thousands of pieces of military equipment, from flak jackets and automatic rifles to armored vehicles and grenade launchers. The ""crime bill"" also brought a host of new federal death penalty crimes, which Biden celebrated in his defense of the bill. ""Let me define the liberal wing of the Democratic Party,"" he said to Sen. Orrin Hatch, ""The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties ... the liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells."" It's true that much of this--especially the most egregious and ill-conceived measures--was a response to extraordinarily high crime rates that devastated urban communities. Many of Biden's allies, in fact, were black Democrats from communities where violence was common and pervasive. But Biden would keep this approach, even as violent crime declined through the 1990s and into the 2000s. He would continue to vote for strong anti-drug efforts, going as far as to push for a federal crackdown on raves, citing ecstasy distribution. While Biden has shifted on some drug issues, he remains a staunch defender of his record on crime, even as Bill and Hillary Clinton have expressed their regret for the consequences of the 1994 crime bill and other anti-drug policies. Joe Biden, in other words, is the Democratic face of the drug war. ""There's a tendency now to talk about Joe Biden as the sort of affable if inappropriate uncle, as loudmouth and silly,"" says sociologist Naomi Murakawa in an interview with the Marshall Project to discuss her book The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America. ""But he's actually done really deeply disturbing, dangerous reforms that have made the criminal justice system more lethal and just bigger."" In a Democratic primary that increasingly turns on these issues, having to defend or walk back those positions is a bad place to occupy. His opponents--whether Clinton or Bernie Sanders or Martin O'Malley--will use his record against him, and millions of Democrats will begin to see him like Murakawa does: as someone who widened the path to prison for countless young men of color. The end result for Biden would be a newly tarnished reputation and--in all likelihood--another failed presidential campaign. Which is to say that, if Biden thinks Hillary needs an opponent of her stature, he's probably right. But before he makes the jump, he should ask himself: Is a campaign worth the damage it will do to him personally? After years in public life, is this how he wants to end his career?

Donald Trump isn't threatening to round up Irish immigrants in Boston who entered the country illegally or to build a wall between us and Canada; he's threatening Latinos and tapping into an ugly strain of racist nativism. It's why ""anchor baby""--slang for the American-born children of unauthorized immigrants--is such a charged term. To many, it's racial code for often brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking children. Of course, rhetoric aside, America's immigrant community goes beyond Latino and Hispanic Americans. It includes Africans, Europeans, and Asians, one of the fastest growing groups in the country. Not all Asians are tied to the immigrant experience--more than a quarter are native-born, with long and durable ties to the United States. But the large majority are foreign-born, with roots in a variety of different countries, from China and Japan to Korea, Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh. Moreover, they're a rising share of the electorate--in 1996, just 1.6 percent of voters were Asian. In 2012, it was 3.4 percent. As second- and third-generation Asian Americans take the stage in national life, that voting block will increase. When Republicans attack immigration--and increasingly, immigrants--we know it alienates Hispanic and Latino voters. Indeed, between Trump and his chorus of imitators, the party has all but abandoned its outreach to that community. But in this analysis, we shouldn't ignore Asian Americans. This rhetoric matters to them too, and if Republicans aren't careful, they're set to lose two groups and likely seal their fate for next November. How do we know that Asian voters care about immigration? Let's look back to the previous presidential election. So little of how Barack Obama won in 2012 was a surprise. He captured young voters and cleaned up with single women; he struck gold with Latinos and won the entire black vote, again; and he was weak, as expected, with most white Americans. However, there was one shock: Obama scored an enormous win among Asians. His 73 percent share of the Asian vote was a significant increase from the previous election and a bright spot in his overall performance. It would have been one thing if, like blacks, Asians were Democratic stalwarts. But they weren't. A solid 44 percent supported George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, and a sizable minority--35 percent--voted for John McCain in the 2008 election. The reason is straightforward: As a whole, Asians are closer to the social and economic mainstream than other minority groups. They are the ""highest-income, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the United States,"" notes the Pew Research Center. ""They are more satisfied than the general public with their lives, finances and the direction of the country, and they place more value than other Americans do on marriage, parenthood, hard work and career success."" In 2012, Asians were primed to follow the national trend and vote a little more Republican. But they didn't. Just 26 percent voted for Mitt Romney, the lowest GOP total in 20 years. What happened? What turned a small Democratic edge into an outright advantage? Again, the answer is immigration, and specifically, the sense of exclusion that came from the GOP. In the 2012 primary, like this one, Republicans were torn over immigration policy, with candidates having a strong incentive to oppose comprehensive reform. Throughout the primary process, candidates fought to surpass one another with draconian solutions for dealing with unauthorized immigrants, with Romney touting ""self-deportation"" in his pitch to Republican voters. He won the nomination, but the phrase was an albatross on his general election campaign. In a 2014 study, researchers at Vanderbilt University measured the impact of that rhetoric on Asian voters. How would they react to feeling excluded or questioned on their citizenship? ""The simple intervention of making an Asian subject feel excluded with respect to 'Americanness' and being suspected of not being a U.S. citizen increased negative dispositions towards the Republican Party and increased positive views of the Democratic Party,"" write the authors. Put simply, when confronted with exclusionary rhetoric, Asian voters tied the Republican Party to racial discrimination. Last year, in the midterm elections, it looked like Republicans recovered from their 2012 rout with Asians. In exit polls, 50 percent voted for Democrats, versus 49 percent for Republicans. If that's accurate, then the picture isn't as bad as it seems. But there's always been a midterm swing toward Republicans, and several polls--including in-language surveys from polling firm Asian American Decisions--show a larger Democratic advantage than appears in that exit poll. Indeed, in its recent probe of party affiliation, Pew found an almost 3-to-1 divide among Asians: 65 percent identified with the Democratic Party, 23 percent with the GOP. Still, outreach isn't hopeless, especially in an open election year without an incumbent on the ballot. But that assumes that Republicans can get their base under control, or at least behind rhetoric that doesn't antagonize immigrant groups and those with ties to immigrant communities. This could happen, but because of Trump, it looks like a long shot. Trump isn't just popular; he's shaping Republican policy, and several candidates have even turned against birthright citizenship--a historic achievement of the once-party of Lincoln. Maybe this won't matter for 2016. After all, most Americans aren't paying attention to the race thus far. But that's small consolation. Democrats are watching the Republican primary. They are recording and polling and testing. Come next year, they will blanket immigrant communities with the greatest hits of Republican rhetoric, and over the course of the campaign, countless people--teachers, factory workers, small business people, and others--will remember the comments about ""illegals"" and ""anchor babies."" And they'll act accordingly. In turn, this will leave Republicans in a tight spot. To win without minorities, they'll have to find and mobilize even more white voters: men and women who aren't as tied to the political system, people who are angry and disaffected from their leaders. Trump supporters. On Friday, a writer for the Federalist--a conservative website--asked if the GOP was the ""party of freedom"" or the ""party of white identity."" If the party keeps moving on its present path, there will be no answer but the latter. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 election."	Is the GOP Angering Asian Voters and Dooming Itself With Its Latest Nativist Turn?
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/how_the_republicans_can_win_the_election_court_ethnic_contrarians_like_me.html	"One of the more frustrating aspects of racial politics in America is the way in which vast, variegated groups come to be defined as monoliths. For example, I'm an Asian American, a South Asian American, a person of eastern Bengali descent, and a Brooklyn Nets fan. Though I'm not religiously observant, the Islamic religious tradition was an important part of my upbringing, and it's drawn me closer to the views of orthodox Christians and Jews on more than a few social issues. I'm a free-market enthusiast who believes in the safety net, and I'm an urban-dwelling nondriver who'd like to cut the federal tax on gasoline. Like most people, including most people of color, I embrace a mishmash of identities and I have lots of half-baked, contradictory views. Because of the magazines I read and the ZIP code in which I live, I'm the kind of voter a conservative candidate might easily overlook. But the issues that matter most to me place me on the right, and I'm guessing that there are other misfits who might be willing to vote as I do if the right candidate were to make the right pitch. Republicans need to start chasing the voters I think of as my fellow ethnic contrarians--the blacks, Asians, Latinos, and American Indians who zag when other members of these megagroups zig. I call this strategy No Vote Left Behind. To appreciate why this strategy is so important to the GOP's hopes of winning the White House, it's helpful to understand the rising importance of the black electorate. The Democratic Party is not quite a majority-minority coalition. But it's closer than you might think. In the 2012 presidential election, an overwhelming 88 percent majority of Mitt Romney's vote came from non-Hispanic whites. By contrast, only 56 percent of President Obama's votes came from non-Hispanic whites, while 24 percent came from blacks and 14 percent from Latinos. Black voters turned out at a higher rate than non-Hispanic white voters in 2012, as they did in 2008. Will that be the case in 2016? For Democrats, this is a vitally important question, and it is a big part of why the party's leading presidential candidates are being forced to take the politics of racial justice very seriously. If Democrats fail to motivate black voters, and if they fail to secure the near-universal support among black voters they secured in 2012 and 2008, their candidate's path to the White House will suddenly get much narrower. Republicans face a parallel challenge. In 2012, Romney won 59 percent of the non-Hispanic white vote. You can imagine a GOP candidate maintaining Romney's share of the white vote, or even improving upon it slightly. But increasing it by a substantial margin will be challenging, and increasing it in ways that have the side effect of further reducing Republican support among Latinos (a dismal 27 percent in 2012) or blacks (an even more dismal 6 percent) might put victory even further out of reach. This is where the contrarians come in. Conservatives have long believed that there are many black Americans who vote for Democrats in presidential elections despite holding conservative positions on issues like abortion, gun rights, and taxes. But rather than devote meaningful resources to identifying these voters and persuading them to back the GOP, conservatives have largely neglected them. When Republicans have reached out to black voters in recent years, they've often done so by focusing on an issue like criminal justice reform, as in the case of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Whatever the merits of criminal justice reform, however, it is not obvious that black voters who consider it their top priority will ever be inclined to back Republicans. Embracing criminal justice reform might be worthwhile on its own terms, but it is foolish to think of it as a linchpin of black outreach. Why is that? Consider the political impact of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has garnered enormous media attention over the past year. There is reason to believe that the movement has already had a meaningful effect on public opinion. Earlier this month Gallup released a survey that found that the share of whites satisfied with how black Americans are treated in the United States has fallen from 67 percent in 2013 to 53 percent in 2015. The share of blacks who feel the same way fell from 47 percent to 33 percent over the same period. Given this shift, it should come as no surprise that Bernie Sanders' and Hillary Clinton's campaigns have responded to Black Lives Matter, and that they've both taken its brand of racial pessimism seriously. Conservatives, even ones like Paul, who use progressive language to make the case for reducing the country's prison population, are not well-positioned to win the hearts and minds of these disaffected voters. But what about the 33 percent of blacks who take the contrarian view that their community is treated satisfactorily in the United States? These women and men have been rendered almost entirely invisible. I'm hesitant to make any sweeping claims about this subset of voters. Perhaps some of these respondents believe that the challenges facing black Americans are not primarily a reflection of racial bias, and that what we really need to secure black progress is Sanders-style socialism. But some others might be pro-business moderates in the Bill Clinton mold, who find racial pessimism counterproductive. Indeed, it could be that the rise of Black Lives Matter has hardened this view among some blacks. We can't know more without a serious effort to understand these voters, and that serious effort won't be forthcoming as long as we pretend that these voters don't exist. The failure to appreciate that as many as a third of black voters take an essentially optimistic view of racial progress in the United States is particularly harmful to conservatives, as this is the universe of voters that could, in theory, be open to the right Republican candidate. Because Republicans are starting from such a low base--John McCain won 4 percent of the black vote in 2008 and Mitt Romney won 6 percent of the black vote in 2012--even modest inroads into this constituency could make an enormous difference for the GOP. To make these inroads, however, Republicans have to dispel the perception that they are hostile to black progress. In January the Pew Research Center surveyed the views of blacks and whites on a variety of questions. It found that while 46 percent of whites felt that government should do ""a lot"" to reduce poverty, 78 percent of black voters felt the same way. Only 8 percent of black respondents felt that government should do little or nothing to reduce poverty (compared with 17 percent of whites). Similarly, while 79 percent of blacks felt that ""a lot"" more needs to be done to achieve racial equality in the U.S., 12 percent of blacks believed that somewhat more needs to be done and 8 percent believed that little or nothing needs to be done. There is a large minority of blacks reporting that the government should do less than ""a lot"" to reduce poverty and who feel the same way about achieving racial equality, yet Republican candidates are struggling to get close to a double-digit share of the black vote. I would argue that instead of embracing the Black Lives Matter critique of American society, conservatives should endeavor to connect with black voters who believe that society should take ""some"" action to reduce poverty and to achieve racial equality. Rather than embrace the libertarian condemnation of the prison state, conservatives could offer a more balanced approach that emphasizes the importance of crime control while also calling for curbs on excessive punishment. Republicans should also embrace more pragmatic policies on taxes and safety net programs. Instead of talking about the flat tax, Republicans should emphasize middle-class tax relief. Rather than talk about ""phasing out"" Medicare, they should talk about shoring up safety net programs to ensure that they can meet the needs of future generations. There appears to be a nontrivial share of black voters who are open to a center-right message. Winning them over will mean decontaminating a GOP brand that many blacks associate with extremism. The logic of appealing to contrarians extends well beyond black voters. In 2004, for example, Latino evangelicals were far more likely than other Latinos to back George W. Bush's re-election, though as Henry Olsen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center has observed, they also have a more favorable view of government than your typical GOP voter, so might be receptive to a less uncompromisingly hard-right candidate. Similarly, U.S.-born Latinos are quite a bit more conservative on issues like immigration than foreign-born Latinos, and they're also more likely to vote--they're another promising target for a 2016 GOP candidate. Recognizing these cleavages can mean the difference between winning 27 percent of Latino voters (Romney's showing in 2012) and something much closer to 44 percent (George W. Bush's share in 2004). In a similar vein, Asian American evangelicals appear to be more winnable than their Buddhist and Muslim counterparts. According to one survey from the left-wing Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, 96 percent of Bangladeshi Americans backed Obama in the last presidential election. Why shouldn't the next GOP candidate win, say, 5 percent? Republicans can't afford to leave any votes on the table."	The Overlooked Voters Who Could Hand the White House to the GOP
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/black_lives_matter_and_bernie_sanders_why_the_protesters_are_so_hard_on.html	"Let's look at the Bernie Sanders plan for a fairer economy. Crafted in his years as the ""socialist"" Independent senator from Vermont, the proposal is at the center of his surprisingly robust campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. If elected president (with a Democratic Congress), Sanders would end tuition for public colleges and universities, raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour, invest in new infrastructure--providing jobs and skills throughout the country--expand Social Security benefits, and make Medicare a national single-payer health insurance system. Add an ambitious plan for climate change--centered on a carbon tax--and new Wall Street regulations meant to stop another financial crisis, and you have a wide agenda for redistribution that rivals Roosevelt's New Deal, Truman's G.I. Bill, and Johnson's Great Society. You can read this as a left-liberal wishlist, but for Sanders and his supporters, it's much more than that. To them, it is a serious plan to strike a powerful blow to inequality, from the wide gap between rich and poor, to the yawning divide between black and white. ""To be honest with you,"" explained Sanders in a June interview on ABC's This Week With George Stephanopoulos, ""given the disparity that we're seeing in income and wealth in this country, it applies even more to the African-American community and to the Hispanic community."" Partisans for the senator are even more forceful. ""Closing the racial wealth gap is probably the single most effective thing that any politician could do to help advance the cause of ending structural racism in America,"" writes Hamilton Nolan for Gawker, in praise and defense of Sanders. ""This is because promoting progressive economic policies that work against the extreme concentration of wealth in small groups of people is something that politicians can actually do that has actual real world effects on racial inequality."" Of course, none of this would address racism, full stop. (And despite his clumsiness with racial conversations, neither Sanders nor his campaign has ever claimed it would.) It wouldn't end bias in hiring or other forms of employment discrimination, nor would it address concentrated poverty, residential segregation, housing affordability, or the broad problem of police violence. But in a world where the Sanders plan was law, racial minorities--and blacks in particular--would have more and greater opportunity. Couple this with his outline for reducing race discrimination in criminal justice--crafted as a direct result of protests from Black Lives Matter activists--and Sanders has built an ambitious plan for tackling racial inequality across American society. But, for the senator's supporters and other observers, all of this just raises a question: If Sanders is the most racially progressive candidate in the race, then why is he a target for Black Lives Matter activists, even after he addressed core concerns over police violence and criminal justice reform? Last week, for instance, protesters associated with Black Lives Matter interrupted a Sanders rally in Seattle. As with the first interruption, in July, this sparked days of intra-left debate and disagreement. Here's Nolan, again: ""For those perceptive enough to separate pretty slogans from actual policy prescriptions, it is clear that Bernie Sanders is the candidate most aligned with the group's values,"" he wrote, critiquing the demonstrators. ""Stifling his voice only helps his opponents."" On the other side are writers like New Republic editor Jamil Smith, who are much more sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter activists. ""I'm not against criticizing activist tactics,"" he wrote, ""but the idea that Black Lives Matter protesters are hurting their cause by challenging candidates, even those considered allies, is based in the notion that the burden of making change is on them. It isn't."" Part of the problem in this debate--and why it's so frustrating to its participants--is that no one has tried to answer the ""why"" question. Instead, the argument is over tactics, excess, and the prerogatives and responsibilities that come with protesting. Should Black Lives Matter go easy on Sanders? Is the message more important than the particular tactic? Set those questions aside, however, and you have an easy answer for why Sanders gets the brunt of Black Lives Matter activity, at least among Democratic presidential candidates. Unlike his competitors, Sanders is simply the best available vessel for bringing activists' concerns to the mainstream of the Democratic Party. The picture might be different if Sanders were more marginal and on the periphery of the nomination fight (like former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb). As it stands, the Vermont senator is the leading alternative to frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. He earns almost 20 percent or more in most national polls of the race, and is effectively tied for first in New Hampshire. He also dwarfs any other candidate for president--in either party--in terms of shear crowd size: 27,000 in Los Angeles, 28,000 in Portland, Oregon, and 15,000 in Seattle, where his speech was interrupted last week. At the same time, Sanders doesn't have the tightly closed-down campaign of Hillary Clinton. He is accessible, as evidenced by the ease with which activists have reached him on stage. And while he's been clumsy in these incidents, he also hasn't lashed out. In both cases, he ceded the mic. Compare that to the attempted Black Lives Matter protest at a Clinton rally in New Hampshire. Activists reached the event, but they couldn't get past security to announce their presence. In this environment, if you're trying to make a splash, you go with Sanders, especially when he's more open to change and adjustment than the alternatives. Disrupting Sanders gives you more bang for your buck: It keeps you in the news and puts indirect pressure on other campaigns that know they'll have to answer to the movement's questions. To that point, the New Hampshire demonstrators couldn't crash the Clinton rally, but they still met with the candidate--quietly--and discussed their concerns. In all likelihood, the pressure on Sanders has forced Clinton--the likely nominee--to devote more time to Black Lives Matter, in a bid to protect her flank. And in turn, this brings their issues up the ladder, closer to the top of the party's agenda. Black Lives Matter isn't a single organization--it is a loose collection of groups and individuals, unified by a common cause, under a single banner. While there's coordination, there's no guarantee that different groups of activists are working together. But that doesn't mean the movement isn't rational or strategic. And if we look at it as both, then its approach to the Democratic primary begins to make sense, even if it's messy. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Black Lives Matter Is So Focused on Bernie Sanders and How It's Paying Off
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/donald_trump_s_alpha_male_appeal_what_explains_the_loutish_billionaire_s.html	"After every loutish performance, political analysts pronounce Donald Trump's presidential bid finally dead. Surely he cannot recover, they insist, from libeling all Mexicans, denigrating the military heroism of Sen. John McCain, or making crude insinuations about the popular Fox News host Megyn Kelly. But somehow, his predicted demise fails to materialize. Instead, new polls appear showing the billionaire property mogul to be more popular than ever. By most measures, Trump now leads the Republican field by a substantial margin. What could possibly be the attraction of this puffed-up billionaire buffoon? The first thing to say about the Trump phenomenon is that a mutually gratifying symbiosis with the press drives his popularity. Polls at this stage in the election cycle essentially track how much news coverage a candidate receives. Media attention propels Trump's numbers, and his numbers justify more coverage. His candidacy makes the primaries into a remunerative and enjoyable story, even though everyone knows it is guaranteed to fall to pieces by the time the primaries get fully rolling in February. But being a nonviable choice does not mean that Trump is not going to affect the outcome of the presidential race. Pat Buchanan, another unelectable Republican protest candidate, arguably cost President George H.W. Bush re-election in 1992. And should he choose to run as a third-party candidate after being denied the nomination, Trump would more or less guarantee victory for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, much in the way that Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000. Another obvious explanation for the Trump phenomenon is that he appeals to people who dislike politics. Professional politicians often claim they are not professional politicians. Trump genuinely isn't one. Politicians try to make friends, build constituencies, and avoid gaffes. Trump does the opposite, seeking out land mines in order to detonate them. At the point when any ordinary outsider candidates would begin conforming to conventions of political behavior, he continues to flout them. Playing an ego and ratings game while his competitors are playing a policy and votes game injects an entertaining element of zaniness and unpredictability into the proceedings. But Trump is not merely a clown stumbling into a drama and playing it for laughs. His success speaks to two species of resentment that appear intermittently in American political life. The first is xenophobia. The men who are perhaps the most plausible Republican nominees, Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, identify with or as Latinos and appreciate that their party faces a dim future without them. Trump, who crashed the gate without an invitation, couldn't care less what happens to the party. This frees him to insult Mexicans as rapists and drug dealers, slandering not only illegal immigrants but all Hispanics. Americans who share his prejudice against foreigners have no other advocate who speaks so openly. The second form of resentment Trump channels concerns social class. The last effective exponent of this political undercurrent was Sarah Palin, before she quit her job as governor of Alaska to make money as a celebrity. What is curious about the Palin-Trump style of cultural populism is that it has little to do with the growing economic disparities in American life. The resented betters are social elites in the media, politics, and Hollywood, whom less educated, lower-middle-class Americans regard as behaving in a condescending or hypocritical way. By contrast, Trump's relationship to his own wealth conveys an honesty that his followers say they like. Though he built his empire out of his father's empire, he has never suffered from the sense of decorum or noblesse oblige that sometimes accompany inherited money. His style isn't even nouveau riche so much as it is last-week-lottery-winner. To Trump, being a billionaire means plating everything in gold and slapping his name everywhere in huge block letters. It means that he gets to say whatever pops into his head and never has to say he is sorry. His celebrity ""brand"" is an alpha-male fantasy of wealth and power, revolving around the pleasure he takes in firing and suing people who displease him. He is the only 69-year-old white guy in America who gets to live like a rap star. Rather than creating envy, the public role Trump enacts validates the aspirations of his admirers. His popularity is an expression of reverse identity politics, which turns white males from defendants into plaintiffs in the contest of victims. He and his followers fixate on political correctness that disallows their grievances about the social transformation under way. His braggadocio and misogyny speak to male privilege lost. His male supporters regard his crude sexism not as juvenile behavior but as a transgressive political statement. In all of this, Trump's closest point of comparison is less to any previous American politician than to Silvio Berlusconi in Italy. Both boast about their wealth, their brilliance, and the beautiful women they attract. The key difference is that Trump does not take himself all that seriously as a demagogue, lacking the self-discipline and long-range calculation. He is essentially a narcissist taking his ego out for a joy ride. It won't last forever, so enjoy the trip. A version of this article appeared on FT.com."	Why Trump's Alpha-Male Routine Is Winning With Republicans

To think so, or to think they'll change the race, is to say that scandal will override partisanship; that an otherwise liberal voter will walk into the ballot booth and mark the box for Jeb Bush or Gov. Scott Walker or Sen. Marco Rubio because of digital mismanagement. I liked what Clinton said about early childcare, thinks our hypothetical voter, but sending government email on a private server makes her unfit for the White House. At the same time, Clinton's email isn't irrelevant. For journalists and other observers, it offers an important look at how she operates. That Clinton used private email at all shows her flexible approach to rules and regulations and a secretive reflex for conducting official business. ""Using a personal email account exclusively is a potent prescription for flouting the Federal Records Act and circumventing the Freedom of Information Act,"" explained Daniel Metcalfe, former director of the Justice Department's Office of Information Policy, to PolitiFact. ""And there can be little doubt that Clinton knew this full well."" It may not matter to voters, but it's important to know if Clinton plans to carry this secrecy--and public evasiveness--to the Oval Office, if she's elected president. (Here, it's worth noting that, as Florida governor, Jeb Bush also conducted business from a personal account, and didn't release his correspondence for seven years.) To that point, there's a new plot point in the ongoing drama of Clinton's email account. On Tuesday, reported the New York Times, Clinton ""directed her aides to give the Justice Department an email server that housed the personal account that she used exclusively while secretary of state, along with a thumb drive that contained copies of the emails."" This follows testimony from I. Charles McCullough, inspector general for the intelligence community, who told Congress that Clinton had ""top secret"" information in two emails among the 40 private messages received from the State Department, which has access to a full trove of 30,000 messages. Since March, when her private account was uncovered, Clinton has denied the presence of classified information in her account. ""I am confident that I never sent or received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received,"" she said in July. ""What I think you're seeing here is a very typical kind of discussion, to some extent disagreement among various parts of the government, over what should or should not be publicly released."" By handing her server to the Justice Department, Clinton opens her email to renewed investigation, as well as to new questions on the overall security of her account. Politically, it's not hard to see what happens next. Republicans will slam her for skirting the rules and look for ways to make this a long-term vulnerability. ""She cannot be trusted to keep America's secrets or its citizens safe, and therefore cannot be trusted to be commander in chief,"" said Walker in a statement released Wednesday. The Wisconsin governor called her email use ""a serious and potentially criminal offense that proves [she] put her own personal convenience ahead of the safety and security of the American people."" This isn't a bad strategy. What's important about the email story--what makes it so damaging for Clinton--is that it highlights a key weakness (her secrecy and evasiveness), suggests misconduct, and is ongoing. So far, there's no end to the email saga, just a series of small revelations. Each one prompts a day's worth of coverage, and each one gives Republicans a chance to emphasize her least appealing qualities. If this were a full-fledged campaign, it might not matter to her standing; when voters are energized, they tend to ignore faults on their side. It's how Mitt Romney could recover from his comments about the ""47 percent""; those were damaging, but not so damaging that Republican-leaning voters would abandon the party. But we're still far from the general election, and that campaign effect--intense partisan loyalty--isn't on the table. Which makes this story more damaging than it might be next year, when--if the nominee--she'll be buoyed by Democratic enthusiasm. So what does that mean, in the short term? In all likelihood, Clinton's overall favorability will continue to slide, as voters encounter the same, negative story on a semi-regular basis. Already, a majority of Americans say she's untrustworthy. That won't change. And among Democrats? She'll be fine. But if some start to rethink her electability, I won't blame them. The press distrusts Clinton and holds her to a different standard than other politicians, while Republicans just despise her. Given that, she should have used her official email account, as a way to prepare for the worst and avoid undue scrutiny. Put differently, the choice to use a private email account was an obvious blunder with consequences that have marred her campaign, even if they don't ever end it.

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/the_republican_party_shouldn_t_worry_about_donald_trump_the_state_of_the.html	"At last Thursday's GOP presidential debate--the first of the season--Fox News and the Republican Party tried to embarass Donald Trump out of the game. ""Is there anyone onstage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person?"" asked Bret Baier, beginning the debate. Trump had answered that question before, but that night it was clear for the viewing public. Megyn Kelly called attention to his misogyny--""You've called women you don't like 'fat pigs,' 'dogs,' 'slobs,' and 'disgusting animals' ""--and Chris Wallace pressed Trump for substantive answers, ignoring the rest of the field, even as they dodged direct questions. Likewise, in the weekend after the debate, Trump took further fire from Republican politicians and conservative activists. On Friday, Erick Erickson--editor in chief of RedState--lobbed a trident at Trump and ejected him from the site's annual conference, citing his sexist attack on Kelly. ""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,"" Trump had said in an interview Friday on CNN. (Erickson has his own history of misogynist rhetoric.) Bush called on Trump to apologize, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry slammed Trump for a ""serious lack of character and basic decency."" The great irony of this is that, as Trump is someone who draws from the most anti-establishment parts of the Republican Party, these attacks could help Trump as much as hurt him. To that point, there's no evidence he's paid a price with Republican voters since the debate, and small signs he's just as popular as he was before. In a post-debate online survey from NBC News, 23 percent of Republicans endorsed Trump. Jeb Bush, the modest front-runner in cash, organization, and endorsements, won just 7 percent support. And looking among Republicans in Iowa, Public Policy Polling found Trump with a solid lead of 19 percent, to 12 percent for Ben Carson and Gov. Scott Walker, and 11 percent for Jeb Bush. Conservative and Republican leaders are worried: The higher Trump's star, the more damage he might do to the GOP's presidential hopes. ""We will not gain the White House,"" said Erickson about Trump and his supporters, ""if we're screaming at people, calling them whores and queer and the N-word."" In the same vein, the New York Times reports that ""prominent Republican women said they were worried about how female voters would respond to Mr. Trump's prominence on the debate stage, where he defended imprecations like 'fat pigs' and 'bimbo' to describe women--and his rivals did not chide him."" Trump is a toxic figure, and Republicans are right to do everything they can to push him out of the race. At the same time, Republicans shouldn't worry too much about Trump's effect on their presidential prospects. Yes, there are real dangers to Trump-mentum: The longer Trump stays in the game, the greater odds that voters will associate him with the Republican Party itself. In general, that's a problem. When it comes to the specific case of Latino voters--an important part of any Republican election plan--it's dangerous. Trump could become the ""self-deportation"" of the 2016 race: a concrete symbol of anti-immigrant and anti-Latino animus. And of course there's the real (if small) risk that Trump holds his support, makes a third-party run, and dooms Republican White House ambitions. We can't predict if Trump will run for president as an independent, and it's difficult to say how he'll influence broad perceptions of the Republican Party. But if the 2012 election taught us anything, it's that the shenanigans of the primary don't necessarily influence the general election. Conventional wisdom notwithstanding, Mitt Romney wasn't harmed by the extremism that blossomed through 2011, and into the first voting primaries. If anything, in fact, the opposite happened. As Lynn Vavreck and John Sides note in The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election, ""compared to Obama, Romney was ideologically closer to more voters all along."" By the end of the 2012 campaign, according to research from YouGov, ""52 percent of voters placed themselves closer to Romney than Obama, while 38 percent placed themselves closer to Obama."" How did voters miss that Romney was a self-proclaimed ""severely conservative"" governor? They didn't see it in the first place. From this point in the process until the conventions, the only people paying real attention are political diehards and otherwise informed people. But the most politically informed Americans are also the most partisan ones, with firm positions and clear allegiances to one party or the other. Twenty-four million people may have watched last Thursday's debate, but there's a strong chance those viewers had already made up their minds: They were either Republicans interested in the process, or Democrats with a taste for schadenfreude. If most voters don't pay attention until late in the process, and if those who do aren't up for grabs, then how do we explain Romney's apparent weakness in 2012? Easy: Mitt Romney didn't lose because of party baggage or his penchant for gaffes; he lost because he was running against an incumbent president in a growing economy. Which is just another way to say that--given worse growth in 2012--there's a strong chance we would be writing about Romney's upcoming re-election campaign. Trump won't help the GOP's eventual nominee, but--barring a third-party run--it's hard to imagine a world in which he's dispositive. Trump might pull down the party's popularity or put the nominee in an awkward spot, but a qualified nominee and a strong campaign should neutralize any ""Trump effect"" on the electorate, by mobilizing supporters, activating partisans, and persuading (some) undecideds. As always, the most important variable for the election--and for Republicans in particular--is the economy. If it's good, and if it pulls Barack Obama to a strong finish in 2016, then Republicans can expect another four years in the wilderness. If it's weak, then they can look forward to a win. As it stands, the economy is just OK, and the public is itching for a change. Even with Trump in the mix, that's a good sign for the GOP."	Why the Republican Party Shouldn't Worry About Donald Trump
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/donald_trump_why_the_republican_candidate_isn_t_going_away_anytime_soon.html	"To understand the rise of Donald Trump, you'd do well not to fixate on the fact that he's running under the Republican banner. During Thursday night's Fox News debate, Trump made it clear that failing to secure the GOP nomination wouldn't stop him from exploring an independent candidacy. And honestly, he'd be crazy not to. Trump is very far from a Republican regular. He represents an entirely different phenomenon, one that bears little resemblance to garden-variety American conservatism. That's why Republicans shouldn't fool themselves into believing that one lackluster debate performance will send him packing. Go to almost any European democracy and you will find that the parties of the center-right and center-left that have dominated the political scene since the Second World War are losing ground to new political movements. What these movements have in common is that they manage to blend populism and nationalism into a potent anti-establishment brew. One of the first political figures to perfect this brand of politics was the very Trumpian Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media tycoon who rose to power as part of a coalition of right-of-center parties in the mid-1990s, and who has been in and out of power ever since, dodging corruption charges and worse all the while. More recently, the miserable state of Europe's economies has fueled the rise of dozens of other parties. Britain's Labour Party has been devastated by the rise not only of the leftist Scottish National Party, but also by UKIP, a movement of the right that has been growing at Labour's expense by campaigning against mass immigration, and by largely abandoning what had been its more libertarian line on the welfare state. UKIP's leader, Nigel Farage, has a penchant for bombast that endears him to his working-class base, which might sound familiar to you. The Danish People's Party went from the far-right fringe to become Denmark's second-largest party by combining anti-immigration sentiment with a commitment to protecting social programs that serve native Danes. In neighboring Sweden, the Sweden Democrats are trying to pull off a similar feat, which is challenging in light of the party's neofascist roots. France's National Front has been a major player for decades, yet under its current leader, Marine Le Pen, is on the verge of a major electoral breakthrough, despite near-constant infighting. The most successful populist movements in southern Europe--Podemos in Spain, the Five Star Movement in Italy, and Syriza in Greece--are generally on the left rather than the right, yet they're just as aggressively anti-establishment as their right-wing counterparts. So what does any of this have to do with Trump? As a political outsider, Trump has the freedom to say or do almost anything. While every other Republican on stage Thursday night made an effort to demonstrate their conservative bona fides, justifying this or that heresy by invoking the Bill of Rights or the memory of the sainted Ronald Reagan, Trump had no compunction about breaking with ideological orthodoxy. When asked about his past support for a Canadian-style single-payer health system, Trump didn't back down. Instead of repudiating his past position, or apologizing for it, he said that ""as far as single-payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here."" Why didn't Trump reverse himself? It could be that he recognizes that there are many GOP voters who are just as passionate about defending Medicare as they are about protecting America's borders, and that the prospect of Medicare-for-all might not faze them. Or it could be that he realizes that the forces that have pushed him to the top of the GOP primary fight are far bigger than just the Republican Party, and he need not toe the line to keep his candidacy alive."	Why Donald Trump Isn't Going Away

On the surface, this seems unremarkable. It's almost cliche, but the Florida senator is a gifted, empathetic communicator with a knack for blending policy with his personal story. But it's one thing to use those skills on the stump or during a meet and greet with supporters; it's something else to show them in the cramped confines of a presidential primary debate, especially when there are nine other candidates, at least one of whom is a wild card--Donald Trump--who could derail the entire conversation with a single tangent. But Rubio shined. Despite limited time--overall in the 2-hour debate, he had 6 minutes and 49 seconds to speak, compared with 11 minutes for Trump--he gave strong answers to the sharp questions from the Fox News moderators, and Megyn Kelly in particular. Take immigration, which consumed a huge chunk of the first hour of the debate. Jeb Bush began with a rote answer, meant to thread the needle between his past support for comprehensive reform and his present opposition. ""I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family,"" he said. ""But we need to control our border. It's not--it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in."" But while Bush spoke first, he didn't set the tone of the segment. That fell to Trump, who railed against the alleged danger of unauthorized immigrants: ""The fact is, since then, many killings, murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly."" After huge applause, moderator Chris Wallace pressed him for evidence of immigrant crime--one early indication that the Fox News team was trying to undermine Trump as much as possible--but the reality television star had an answer for that, too. ""The Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them."" No candidate matched Trump in vehemence--although Texas Sen. Ted Cruz tried as hard as he could--but several candidates tried to walk a similar, if less bigoted, line. Even Ohio Gov. John Kasich--a relative moderate--praised Trump for ""hitting a nerve"" with the country on immigration. Enter Rubio. In substance, he's not far from his more mainstream colleagues. But he didn't indulge Trump's affect. Instead, he gave a fact check and a strong answer on border security and the realities of the immigration process:"	Why Rubio Won
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/the_first_republican_primary_debate_had_plenty_of_punches_it_was_exciting.html	"What a show the first GOP debate was! A rock 'em, sock 'em affair full of heated exchanges, punches, and counterpunches. It was entertaining and informative, for which viewers can thank the Fox News moderators and Donald Trump. If Republicans were hoping the first debate would help them winnow the field, there's always next time. None of the top 10 candidates in the prime-time debate had a gaffe. Almost all of them had at least one distinguishing moment. In the undercard debate, Carly Fiorina did well enough that she may have just become the  11th candidate in the mix. Donald Trump gave the debate passion because he has increased the peril for the other candidates, who are trailing him in the polls. The real estate tycoon has excited the desire for candor in the electorate, and other candidates are trying to show their own version of it. The spark may also be there because he's insulted so many of his opponents and they want to take him down. At the start of the debate, the question was whether Trump would play it safe or bring the bombast. There was very little analysis about what he would do with his hands, but right off the bat his hand raising caused an uproar. Trump refused to pledge to support the eventual nominee of the party. He did say that he would support himself. He also declined to pledge that he wouldn't run as an independent, something many Republicans believe would guarantee a Democratic victory. ""I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage,"" said Trump. When the audience booed, he brought up both hands as if to say, ""What?"" It wasn't the only time he'd do that during the evening in which he called the nation's leaders stupid and occasionally stopped to school his questioners. ""Let me just tell you about the lenders,"" he said when asked about the $1 billion that he lost in his Atlantic City investments. ""First of all, these lenders aren't babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK?"" The Republican front-runner received a mix of boos and applause throughout the evening. No surprise there. He's ahead in the polls but also leading his competitors when people are asked which candidate they'd never vote for. So Trump's challenge was to figure out how to lift the iron ceiling that caps his vote total. There was nothing in his debate performance that suggests he accomplished that. Trump took it on the chin early. He was on the defensive over his descriptions of women, his donations to Hillary Clinton, and his bankruptcies. Perhaps the hardest problem for him was the underlying question, ""When did you actually become a Republican?"" Trump reached with bravado and no apologies. The answer that showed both his strength and his vulnerability was when he was asked about some of his comments regarding women. He was reminded that he'd called women he didn't like ""fat pigs,"" ""dogs,"" ""slobs,"" and ""disgusting animals."" Female voters are kind of important, especially against a Democratic nominee who is likely to be a woman. That's a general-election liability--a glaring one. Trump responded by taking a stand against political correctness. ""I don't frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either."" That is the kind of answer that thrills his supporters but doesn't solve the underlying problem. In fact, it may worsen it. Only Sen. Rand Paul took on Trump directly, but it was mostly lost in the crosstalk. Later, Trump dismissed Paul, ""You're having a hard time tonight."" Gov. John Kasich defended Trump, even joking that he'd take a donation from him when the questioning turned to the donations Trump had given various candidates. ""Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve,"" said Kasich. ""People are frustrated, they're fed up, they don't think the government's working for them. And for people who want to tune him out, they're making a mistake."" The question after the debate was whether Trump's act is wearing thin or becoming more attractive. Will the candidates have to take him on more directly? The other great non-Trump-related bit of theater was an exchange between Paul and Gov. Chris Christie over the use of surveillance techniques. Christie, who pointed out he'd used the Patriot Act as a federal prosecutor, said Paul was just blowing ""hot air"" in committee rooms. Paul then was in a position to deliver a set-piece line about giving too much power to the president: ""I don't trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead."" Christie shot back: ""Sen. Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on Sept. 11."" He then accused Paul of using his Senate speeches to raise money. It was exciting. Perhaps the excitement came from two candidates trying to pull themselves up from the bottom of the polls. Perhaps it was a display of genuine passion about issues each man cares about and that are important to the electorate. We could do worse than that. Who got the better of the Paul-Christie exchange? It was probably a draw, but Christie has the chance to benefit more because he has more room to improve with a larger group of voters. Paul's defense of the Fourth Amendment was passionate, but he's already got the constituency for whom that is an abiding concern. Christie may have been able to use the exchange to show people that he's tough on national security and would let nothing slip on the fight against terrorists. That's a larger group in the Republican Party. On entitlement reforms and national security, Christie was more commanding than blustery. All those policy speeches he has given have paid off. He sounds like he has a command of the material. Kasich, the hometown boy, had several good moments. Defending his Medicaid program, he spoke about the obligation to care for those in the shadows of society. When asked about how he would explain his opposition to same-sex marriage if one of his daughters said she was gay, he gave a big-hearted and inclusive response. The Cleveland audience loved it. By the end of the debate, Kasich had thoroughly captured the ""compassionate conservative"" label. Sen. Marco Rubio had two strong moments. One was when he explained why he can go toe to toe with Hillary Clinton: ""If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck."" Later he took a question about immigration, which will be a tough issue for him since he worked with Democrats on comprehensive immigration reform, and turned it into a defense of those who try to come to America legally. ""And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates: the people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in. And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally."" But Rubio has no executive experience and he looks young. His answers were delivered with force at times, which will test a proposition David Axelrod talked about during Obama's campaign: If you sound assertive and in command, will people grant you the leadership skills that you've never displayed in your career? Jeb Bush hopes to be there at the end of this battle, the safe, calm, respectable choice. He played that role Thursday night. His best answers were defending his education record and explaining why Donald Trump's tone mattered. He said he called out Trump because ""I want to win."" He was more passionate than he had been all evening. He had to articulate his argument for his campaign with energy--and because Trump forced him to by acting out and putting him in a position where he had to actually spell out what's at stake. Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson each had a moment. Huckabee passionately argued against President Obama's deal with Iran, and Carson offered an appealing defense of his outside wisdom, as well as a pitch for a colorblind society that appeals to conservatives. ""When I take someone to the operating room, I'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn't make them who they are. The hair doesn't make them who they are. And it's time for us to move beyond that."" That leaves us with Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz. Their supporters won't be disappointed. Walker was cautious, offering snippets of his stump speech. Cruz was familiar in his articulation of his principled stances. But neither had a particular breakout moment. The debate was held in the Quicken Loans Arena, the same one where next summer the GOP will meet to elevate the party's next nominee. One of them was standing on the debate stage Thursday night. The chances are slim that it will be Donald Trump, but how the party gets there is a long way from being clear. But if Thursday is any indication, the path back to the arena will be action-packed.

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/republican_party_s_2016_scapegoats_the_gop_s_first_debate_suggests_its_likely.html	"The first debate of the 2016 Republican presidential primaries is in the books. Only the lower tier of candidates participated in this undercard event, so it's just a partial glimpse of the campaign ahead. But already we have some early signs of who will be the scapegoats in this election. 1. Muslims. This one's easy. We're at war with ISIS, we've had several domestic jihadist attacks, and Republicans hate the deal with Iran. Also, American Muslims don't yet have enough political power to fight back. So it's a free-fire zone. Thursday night's assault opened with Gov. Bobby Jindal castigating President Obama for daring to ""criticize medieval Christians"" while refusing ""to say that Islam has a problem."" Shortly afterward, George Pataki was asked whether conservatives' stated concern for ""religious liberty"" should extend to Muslims. The question was: ""Would you put mosques, for example, potentially, under surveillance?"" Pataki replied that ""religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad."" He said people who ""radicalize other Americans"" must be ""shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching, or in mosques preaching."" He also pledged to ""shut down their Internet capability."" The limits of these pledges, in terms of the content of the speech being targeted, were left unclear. The Muslim issue returned out of nowhere a few minutes later, when Sen. Lindsey Graham, answering a question about public assistance, turned the conversation to ISIS and then abruptly exclaimed: ""If I have to monitor a mosque, I'll monitor a mosque."" When candidates are reaching for your group to score points on totally unrelated questions, that's a pretty strong indicator that you're in for a long, rough ride. 2. Immigrants. Three months ago I flagged Rick Santorum for pushing the immigration debate into new territory. Other candidates were complaining about illegal immigrants, but Santorum was forthrightly denouncing legal immigration as a flood of foreigners taking American jobs. Thursday night's debate, in conjunction with other recent comments by the candidates, suggests that the rest of the GOP field may be following Santorum's lead. In recent forums there's been more talk from other Republicans about reining in legal immigration. Thursday, Santorum tried to reassert his status as the trailblazer on this issue. He pointed to the support Donald Trump has won from activists and in polls by targeting immigration. Of Democrats, Santorum said: ""All they care about is votes. They don't care about American workers. They just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can."" Illegal immigrants can't vote, so when Santorum complains about immigrants voting for Democrats, it sounds like he's talking about people who are here legally. He continued: ""I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually going to reduce immigration, actually going to do something to help the American worker."" Santorum didn't say ""reduce illegal immigration."" He said ""reduce immigration."" But immigration, as an issue in the GOP primaries, isn't just about economics. It's also about culture. Jindal made that clear in his closing statement. ""We must insist on assimilation,"" said Jindal. ""Immigration without assimilation is an invasion. We need to tell folks who want to come here: They need to come here legally, they need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves, and get to work."" This wasn't in response to a question, mind you. This was the issue Jindal elected to close on. And he wasn't talking about securing a border. He was talking about a cultural ""invasion."" When the candidates were asked about families who would be broken apart by deportation or other efforts to purge illegal immigrants, they had no answers. Santorum changed the subject to ""unskilled workers"" who were immigrating legally and ""flattening wages."" Rick Perry also ducked the question and talked instead about his favorite subject: securing the border. 3. Planned Parenthood. Abortion is a favorite issue in Republican primaries, especially when you're trying to knock off a candidate who seems squishier than you. Carly Fiorina was the first candidate Thursday night--but probably won't be the last, by the time the second debate has concluded--to use the issue against Trump. She tartly remarked: ""Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care, and on abortion, I would just ask: What are the principles by which he will govern?"" The tricky aspect of this issue is standing up for babies without looking as though you're targeting women. Planned Parenthood seems to solve that problem. The recently released videos of Planned Parenthood officials chatting coolly about late-term abortions and procuring fetal body parts have given Republicans a fat target for their anti-abortion message. The videos focus the debate on late-term abortions, and they put a large, government-funded organization--not individual women--in the rhetorical crosshairs. The candidates seem to have learned from Jeb Bush, who got himself in trouble earlier this week by suggesting that too much money was being spent on women's health care. Thursday, Graham made clear that any government money not spent on Planned Parenthood should stay with women: ""I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies. Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn."" But there's a catch. Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortions. It provides contraception, pregnancy tests, exams for sexually transmitted infections, and many other reproductive health services. So when Republicans go after it, they risk wandering into territory that could provoke a backlash. Jindal, for instance, said in his closing statement: Under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood. This is absolutely disgusting and revolts the conscience of the nation. Absolutely we need to defund Planned Parenthood. In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate. We just earlier this week kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract. They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana. When Jindal says Planned Parenthood doesn't provide any abortions in Louisiana, that's not because of Jindal's order. It was true before he acted. As the Wall Street Journal notes, Jindal ""announced his state will end its Medicaid contract with the nonprofit, even though Planned Parenthood doesn't provide abortions in the state."" So watch out, Republicans. Scapegoats aren't safe targets forever. One of these days, you might discover you're in a country with too many Muslims, Hispanics, or women who like having accessible, affordable health exams. If you're not careful, that day will arrive next year. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	Republicans May Have Already Found Their Favorite Scapegoats for 2016

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/_14_republican_candidates_hold_a_debate_in_new_hampshire_the_gop_field_lacks.html	GOFFSTOWN, New Hampshire--Fourteen of the Republican candidates running for president participated in a campaign forum in New Hampshire Monday night. It was a fascinating view of an alternate universe where there are no insults, talking points reign over candor, and everyone plays by the slow-moving, old rules of politics. In short, Donald Trump wasn't there. It wasn't just that the forum was a sleepy affair--interrupted only by a few titters from the audience but no spontaneous applause--the somnolent two hours were free from any stirring remarks by the candidates. Rather, it was like a speed-editing contest where candidates listened to the questions and then rushed to find the paragraphs in their stump speeches that conveyed what they wanted voters to hear without making it appear as though they had ducked the underlying question. That's the way it normally goes at these things. We scratch our rake across the barren desert of these gatherings for a moment of candor or a flash that gives us some insight into the candidates. We're pushy. Voters are less so, and for them the event offered some basic introductory information. They got to hear the biography of some candidates--former CEO Carly Fiorina started out as a secretary, and Sen. Ted Cruz's father fled Cuba--and they heard the boiled-down rationale for each candidate--Gov. Scott Walker fought for conservative policies in a purple state, and Gov. John Kasich balanced budgets while thinking about people on the margins of society. But this isn't the speed at which this race is being run right now. Trump is way out in front. In the latest CBS poll, 24 percent of Republican voters support him. Jeb Bush, the closest competitor, is at 13 percent. Walker is at 10 percent. That's roughly the way things sort in most of the polls. Trump's candor is contributing to his poll position. People are so starved for something that sounds authentic that they'll reward the candidate with the most of it, regardless of the content. In the CBS poll, 79 percent of voters say Trump says what he means. For all the other politicians, that number is about 50 percent. Of the questions asked in the poll, that is the only area where Trump holds that kind of dominant lead over his opponents. This is what made Monday night's forum seem so antiquated. There was very little candor to be found, though to be fair, candidates weren't given much opportunity. There were so many of them, they had to be shuttled onstage and offstage for questioning that lasted no longer than the duration of a full-service stop at the filling station. While someone was being questioned, all the other candidates sat in the first row with attentive gazes, aware that they would be caught in cutaway shots on C-SPAN. The public's love of candor explains why Trump is doing well with groups who you would expect to balk at him. He leads among Republican primary voters on both sides of the immigration debate, though he's been criticized for his comments about Mexican immigrants and supports deporting all undocumented workers. He leads with conservatives, though he has supported single-payer health care and has given financial donations to Democrats. He leads with evangelical voters, though he was pro-choice, has been married three times, and said he has never asked God for forgiveness. Even among non-Tea Party voters, Trump is only trailing Bush by a little. Trump's candidacy still has serious flaws in the long term. Like in other polls, the CBS poll shows that Republicans like him and continue to like him, but the larger pool of voters do not. Republicans say the more they hear from Trump, the more their opinion of him improved (23 percent) than has gotten worse (12 percent). The exact reverse is true, however, among registered voters, a larger pool that more closely approximates the general electorate. Those general election voters are likely to say that their views of Trump have worsened the more they've heard from him. Among registered voters, 59 percent have an unfavorable opinion of Trump. That's the highest of any human seeking the presidency at the moment. What are the non-Trump candidates going to do about their candor problem? When candidates get hot, their competitors try to copy them. In 2008, Democrats all started to talk about the poor when John Edwards' poverty policies gained traction. When Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan became popular, all his GOP rivals had to come up with one. But that's much harder to do when the candidate is gaining traction because of the way he behaves. Are the other candidates going to start saying things that make voters think they're being candid? That's dangerous and hard to do because it is a posture with which they are unfamiliar. Plus, no one is going to out-Trump Trump. The polls show that the second choice for Trump voters scatters across the other top-tier candidates. There is no heir apparent who scratches that same itch, though Govs. Kasich and Chris Christie come closest on the candor scale. So, in order to advance, perhaps candidates are going to have to hope that the race returns to the one that they took part in Monday night, a race in which Donald Trump is nowhere to be found.	Republicans Prove That a Debate Without Donald Trump Is Boring
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/joe_biden_s_emotional_appeal_and_authenticity_won_t_win_the_white_house.html	"A discussion about whether Vice President Joe Biden should run for president gets deep pretty fast. Any talk about ambition, a life's purpose, and the end of a career must take into account of all the woe Biden has had to face in his life. At age 30, a few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, his wife and 1-year-old daughter died in a car accident. Eighteen days later, he took the oath of office standing at his 3-year-old son Beau's hospital bedside, where he was being treated for injuries sustained in the crash. In 1988 Biden had two surgeries to address the effects of cranial aneurysms with only a 50 percent chance of success. Two months ago, he buried his 46-year-old son, Beau, the victim of brain cancer. It is supposed to be the other way around. Sons are supposed to bury their fathers. We talk about authenticity a lot in politics. Voters look for some view into the interior of a candidate where they can make a connection with something real. When Sen. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump demonstrate authenticity, voters swarm them. Usually we have to peer pretty hard to find a true thing. With Biden, if you look too long, you might have to look away. Sen. Lindsey Graham was brought to tears recently describing Biden. During the 2008 race, I listened to a conversation picked up on a microphone of Biden talking to a voter who had also lost his wife, and I shared Graham's reaction. People have been calling Biden for months and telling him he should run. Normally staffers must sort these kinds of calls through a series of normal filters--sycophancy, self-dealing, dislike of the current frontrunner, and activity stirred up by reporters looking for a story. In this case, Biden and his political advisers have to engage in emotional screening: what's emotion and what's a genuine sign that there's a path forward for Biden. Enthusiasm for a run may be overamplified, coming from supporters displaying the human desire to do something for a friend they see suffering. Over the weekend, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd amplified the emotional resonance by reporting that Beau pleaded with his father to run as he was dying.* Biden has wanted to be president for a long time. But as the deadline for his ""end of summer"" decision gets closer, he must come to terms with the fact that it's not likely going to happen. Who--as a staffer, friend, or adviser--would want to throw cold water on the public talk of a candidacy before Biden makes that call himself? Why not let him enjoy the urging from the crowd? Those calls of support contain genuine respect, admiration, and gratitude. At the very least the Biden boomlet is a balm. Despite all of the emotion, those close to Biden say that he understands the difference between the call to run and the actual brutality of the run itself. The big obstacle is that once you strip away the sentiment, Biden doesn't have a clear rationale for replacing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee. He is not of a new generation, nor does he have a particular ideological advantage. He would trade away the Democratic Party's gender advantage in the general election. He isn't a clean break from the Obama years, nor is he so much more identified with Obama than Clinton that he would get a bigger boost than she would if the economy starts to soar heading into November 2016. That isn't to say that Biden couldn't win; it just would require the Clinton campaign's total collapse. Absent that, Biden would have to out-campaign her. Biden's previous campaigns don't suggest that he is a flawless politician on the stump. He'd also have to build a financial and get-out-the vote operation to compete with Clinton's, which would be an extraordinary organizational challenge. Clinton has a core of passionate supporters. Biden doesn't have that--emotional affection for a person's life story is not the same as passion for the cause of his candidacy. Clinton is also still quite popular in her own party. In the most recent Quinnipiac poll, only 9 percent of Democratic voters say they would never vote for her. Six percent said they would never vote for Biden. That's not enough room to launch a thousand ships. Clinton, while stumbling as she runs without any serious opposition, would almost certainly get better with a focused target she could hit. That means Biden would have to hit back. Would he really be up for that? He'd turn a campaign that started on such an emotional note into a gutter fight over Clinton's private email server and trust issues--the kinds of subjects he'd have to exploit to win in the close combat that would be inevitable. The Democratic presidential campaign is now going through a Biden moment. Those who have his political interests at heart will see if that flickering flame can grow into anything else as the public responds to Joe-mentum. It's not unlike what happened with Mitt Romney earlier in the year. In the end Romney saw that the emotional outpouring that was elevating him from loser to wise man was not the same as a commitment to back another presidential run. So he settled for just being a party wise man. Now Joe Biden, who by all accounts is still emotionally raw from his son's death, must sort through a far harder set of emotions. *Correction, Aug. 3, 2015: This article originally misstated that Maureen Dowd reported Beau Biden pleading from his deathbed for his father to run for president. She reported that the younger Biden pleaded for the campaign as he was dying. (Return.) Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/donald_trump_is_killing_scott_walker_s_presidential_campaign.html	"On paper, Scott Walker is a winner. He doesn't just govern a blue state--a win in its own right--he's transformed it, making Wisconsin a vanguard for conservative causes, from right-to-work laws and public education cuts, to voter ID and strict limits on abortion. He's done all this with affirmation from Wisconsin voters; he beat a recall attempt in 2012 and won re-election in 2014. Even better, at least for his national ambitions, is his affect. He's not a firebrand and he doesn't alienate ordinary Americans. Instead, he looks and sounds like a middle manager; an ordinary, almost boring guy who just wants to save you money. Walker, put simply, appears tailor-made for a Republican presidential primary--an ideal blend of mainstream experience and conservative politics. But in his months as a presidential candidate, Walker hasn't been the dark horse we expected--the strongest challenger to Jeb Bush's dynastic candidacy. He's been, instead, a non-presence. He doesn't flicker, let alone catch fire, and when it comes to issues and answering voters, the Wisconsin governor has been awkward, clumsy, and flat-footed. Yes, he has money and yes, he has an organization. But that doesn't make up for skill, or a lack thereof. So far, he just isn't good, and it shows. Take immigration. For all of his nativism and prejudice, Donald Trump has put things in sharp relief, and forced opponents to clarify their beliefs and articulate their stances on the issue. Bush, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich--Walker's main rivals--have stepped up to the challenge, with conservative positions that still have space to the right, and room to the left, should they get to the general election. Rubio, as we saw during the first Republican presidential debate, won't take Trump's anti-immigrant bait. He also consistently backs birthright citizenship, a provision of the 14th Amendment that grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States. Kasich, likewise, has stuck to his plan: The ""11 or 12 million who are here, we ought to find out who they are,"" Kasich told CNN. ""If they've been law-abiding over a period of time, they ought to be legalized, and they ought to be able to stay here."" What's more, he wants to complete a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border and establish a guest worker program, positions that can be sold to moderates and conservatives. Bush has been a little muddled--going as far as to defend the term anchor baby--but his policy stance is clear: ""There should be a path to earned legal status for those that are here--not amnesty--earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time,"" he said during the Republican debate. As for Walker? Trump has him shook. On birthright citizenship, the Wisconsin governor has had three different answers. At the Iowa State Fair, he told MSNBC's Kasie Hunt that he wanted to curb the practice. ""To me it's about enforcing the laws in this country. And I've been very clear, I think you enforce the laws, and I think it's important to send a message that we're going to enforce the laws, no matter how people come here we're going to enforce the laws in this country,"" he said. The following Friday he told CNBC that he wouldn't take a stance on the issue. And this past Sunday, he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he doesn't want to repeal or alter the provision at all. It's clear, at this point, that he just doesn't know what to say. In fairness to Walker, Trump overlaps with his base--working-class and downscale whites. To a large degree, Walker has been shut out by Trump's rise; with Trump in the race, it's hard to get a hold with these voters, who prefer the flamboyant reality television star to the staid Midwestern politician. But even without Trump, it's not clear that Walker could sail the rocky waters of a presidential campaign. At the GOP debate, for instance, he gave an answer on abortion that--if he's the nominee--could come back to haunt him. After moderator Megyn Kelly asked if he would ""really let a mother die rather than have an abortion,"" Walker dodged the question entirely. ""I've got a position that's consistent with many Americans out there in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there,"" he said. ""And I've said many times that that unborn child can be protected and there are many alternatives that would protect the life of the mother."" That dodge--and the implication, to some ears, that he would let the mother die--is fertile ground for any Democrat who wants to use it. There's also the question of Walker's electoral success. Of his three statewide wins, two were in midterm years, when Republicans have the advantage. Other than the recall race--which took place in the summer of 2012, well before that November's national elections--he's never run during a presidential year, when--in the last two cycles--Democrats have had the advantage. His rhetoric aside, he may not be as electable as he looks. None of this means Walker is doomed. If he improves in debates, learns to answer questions, begins to capitalize on missteps from his opponents, and otherwise boosts his performance, he could soar. The raw material is still there. And he wouldn't be the first presidential candidate to go from a listless start to a strong and successful finish. But right now Walker looks like he's on the wane. He's not quite Tim Pawlenty--the doomed Minnesota governor who quit the 2012 Republican primary after poor showings in polls and onstage--but he's coming uncomfortably close."	From Abortion to Immigration, Scott Walker's Presidential Campaign Is Tanking
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/hurricane_katrina_10th_anniversary_how_the_black_lives_matter_movement_was.html	"On the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, in 2010, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu preached unity. ""With the rising water, differences and divisions were washed away,"" he said, asking the audience to listen to each other, and embrace their common aspirations. ""We will hear and we will learn the beautiful truth that Katrina taught us all,"" he declared, ""We are all the same."" With this, Landrieu invoked our national memory of the hurricane--a catastrophe that devastated New Orleans for all of its residents. In his own address on the fifth anniversary, President Obama struck a similar tone, with a message of rebuilding and harmony. ""Five years ago we saw men and women risking their own safety to save strangers. We saw nurses staying behind to care for the sick and the injured.  We saw families coming home to clean up and rebuild--not just their own homes, but their neighbors' homes, as well."" With the 10-year anniversary this week--Katrina's storm surge breached the levees a decade ago on Saturday--we'll soon see similar rhetoric from politicians and those seeking to pay respect to the storm's victims. Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst disasters in American history: It killed more than 1,800 Americans, displaced tens of thousands more, and destroyed huge swaths of New Orleans. While the government couldn't stop the storm, it could have prepared for the damage. But it didn't. The days and weeks after Katrina were marked with scandalous mismanagement, as the federal government made history with its incompetence and failure. Thousands of New Orleans residents who weren't evacuated and couldn't escape the city were left with inadequate aid and shelter, all but abandoned by officials who couldn't, or in some cases wouldn't, help them. In our current remembrance, Katrina is a synonym for dysfunction and disaster, a prime example of when government fails in the worst way possible. It's also a symbol of political collapse. George Bush never recovered from its failure, and ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job"" stands with ""Mission Accomplished"" as one of the defining lines of the administration and the era. But there's a problem with this capsule summary of Katrina and its place in national memory. It assumes a singular public of ""Americans"" who understand events in broadly similar ways. This public doesn't exist. Instead, in the United States, we have multiple publics defined by a constellation of different boundaries: Geographic, religious, economic, ethnic, and racial. With regards to race, we have two dominant publics: A white one and a black one. Each of them saw Katrina in competing, mutually exclusive ways. And the disaster still haunts black political consciousness in ways that most white Americans have never been able to acknowledge. White Americans saw the storm and its aftermath as a case of bad luck and unprecedented incompetence that spread its pain across the Gulf Coast regardless of race. This is the narrative you see in Landrieu's words and, to some extent, Obama's as well. To black Americans, however, this wasn't an equal opportunity disaster. To them, it was confirmation of America's indifference to black life. ""We have an amazing tolerance for black pain,"" said Rev. Jesse Jackson in an interview after the storm. Rev. Al Sharpton, also echoed the mood among many black Americans: ""I feel that, if it was in another area, with another economic strata and racial makeup, that President Bush would have run out of Crawford a lot quicker and FEMA would have found its way in a lot sooner."" Even more blunt was rapper Kanye West, who famously told a live national television audience that ""George Bush doesn't care about black people."" In his book Is This America? Katrina as Cultural Trauma, sociologist Ron Eyerman writes that Katrina ""left an indelible mark on American collective memory, not merely as a severe storm but as a social disaster, a catastrophe which revealed the nation at its worst."" For blacks, this was especially true. In barbershops, at church, and around dinner tables, black people discussed the awful images from New Orleans, where black survivors begged for help from rooftops, and where black bodies floated through streets. When we look at the first 15 years of the 21st century, the most defining moment in black America's relationship to its country isn't Election Day 2008; it's Hurricane Katrina. The events of the storm and its aftermath sparked a profound shift among black Americans toward racial pessimism that persists to today, even with Barack Obama in the White House. Black collective memory of Hurricane Katrina, as much as anything else, informs the present movement against police violence, ""Black Lives Matter."" Among the first images of New Orleans after the storm were shots of low-income black Americans, stranded and desperate to escape the floods and debris. In the narrow sense, they were there because the city's evacuation plan--which didn't account for massive traffic out of the region--fell apart. Rather than bring remaining New Orleansians out, officials sent them to the Superdome and the convention center, which were quickly overcrowded and undersupplied. In a much broader sense, however, they were there because in a city defined by decades of poverty, segregation, and deep disenfranchisement, poor and working-class blacks (including the elderly, and children) would largely shoulder the burden of the storm. To black Americans around the country, this looked like neglect. In an ABC News and Washington Post poll taken shortly after the hurricane, 71 percent of blacks said that New Orleans would have been ""better prepared"" if it were a ""wealthier city with more whites,"" and 76 percent said the federal government would have ""responded faster."" A Newsweek poll confirmed this sense among black Americans that the government responded slowly because most of the affected people were black. ""I, to this day, believe that if that would have happened in Orange County, California, if that would have happened in South Beach, Miami, it would have been a different response,"" said then Mayor Ray Nagin in a speech to the National Association of Black Journalists, a year after the storm. One study--""Feeling the Pain of My People: Hurricane Katrina, Racial Inequality, and the Psyche of Black America""--tests the claim that blacks had a heightened and racialized response to Katrina. The authors conclude that ""Despite geographic and socioeconomic differences, black Americans throughout the country ... identified with Hurricane Katrina's primarily African American victims."" More so than white Americans, they write, ""blacks were deeply angered and depressed by the events surrounding the hurricane."" Support for the racialized view of Katrina can be seen in the way news outlets and commentators talked about the victims. One study, published a year after the storm, found a connection between mentions of race in news stories and references to survivors as ""refugees,"" a description opposed by many black commentators at the time. Analyzing stories from the period, researchers found exaggerated claims of violence among Katrina victims, as well as grossly inaccurate reports of crime and disorder. In one infamous example of skewed coverage, an Associated Press photo shows a young black man wading through water that has risen to his chest. He's holding a case of soda and pulling a bag. The caption says he had just been ""looting a grocery store."" A second photo, this time from AFP/Getty Images, shows a white couple in the same situation. The caption says they are shown ""after finding bread and soda from a local grocery store."" Even worse than this were comments from conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, who denounced the ""poor in New Orleans"" as ""drug addicted"" and ""thugs""--with the inescapable conclusion being that they deserved their fates. It should be said that black alienation wasn't inevitable. Even with the polls and the coverage, views may have changed if white Americans also perceived black treatment during and after the storm as unfair and racially biased. But that's not what happened. Instead, white Americans discounted claims of racial bias. According to the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of whites said the government response would have been the same if the victims had been white, and only 32 percent said the event showed that racial inequality was still a major problem (for blacks, 66 percent believed the response would have been faster had the victims been mainly white and 71 percent said it demonstrated racial inequality). Other polls confirmed these findings. In addition to disbelief that Katrina was a racial story, research and polling also showed a white public that held survivors in contempt. In a 2006 study that examined white and black attitudes toward Katrina victims, political scientists Leonie Huddy and Stanley Feldman found that 65 percent of white respondents blamed residents and the mayor for being trapped in New Orleans. In a CNN/USA Today survey, half of all whites said that people who broke into stores and took things were ""mostly criminals,"" compared to 77 percent of blacks who said they were ""mostly desperate people"" trying to find a way to survive. (Pew had similar findings.) If you turned to right-wing media, you'd find unvarnished disdain for those left behind in the city. The idea that black Americans had a legitimate grievance was dismissed. The result was a collapse in black racial optimism. The year before Katrina, according to Gallup, 68 percent of blacks said race relations were either ""somewhat good"" or ""very good."" The year after Katrina, that declined to 62 percent. The next year, it declined to 55 percent, the lowest point of the decade. In broader surveys from the Pew Research Center, the period after Katrina is an inflection point, where the percentage of blacks who say they are worse off finally overtakes the percentage who say their lives have improved. Black optimism stayed on a downward trajectory for the three years after Katrina. In another Gallup trend-line, black satisfaction with society dips from a steady 41 percent in 2005, to 37 percent in 2006, to 30 percent in 2007. With the recession, there was every sign these trends would continue. But then, Barack Obama made his historic run for the White House, a tangible sign of racial progress. Public opinion tells the story. In June 2007, just 11 percent of black Americans said they were satisfied with the state of the nation and 30 percent said they were satisfied with the way blacks were treated. Just four months before the election, 78 percent of blacks said racism was widespread. A year later, blacks were far rosier about the future. ""Despite the bad economy, blacks' assessments about the state of black progress in America have improved more dramatically during the past two years than at any time in the past quarter century,"" noted Pew, in a survey that showed black optimism at a high of 39 percent, nearly double what it was two years earlier. The black/white gap in how race relations are viewed also narrowed considerably in the immediate aftermath of Obama's election. There is a natural question in all of this. If Barack Obama sparked such a significant shift in black opinion, isn't his election the key point in black political consciousness and not Katrina? The answer is straightforward: No, because the euphoria didn't last. Since 2012, but especially since last year, a rapid and steady succession of high profile shootings has moved black opinion to its pre-Obama, post-Katrina state of pessimism. Between the incidents and the outcomes--where shooters escape with little punishment or sanction--blacks have become more pessimistic about their place in American life. From 2009 to 2013, notes a Pew survey taken on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, the percentage of blacks who felt a sense of progress dropped from 39 percent to 26 percent. As of this summer, reports the New York Times, just 28 percent of black Americans say race relations are generally good, which is in line with where they were in the months before Obama's election. The Obama surge in black optimism is over. Now, black Americans are back to their post-Katrina consensus; a deep sense that America is indifferent to their lives and livelihoods. Indeed, when read in that light, a movement like Black Lives Matter seems inevitable. The disaster of Hurricane Katrina, and its impact on the collective experience of black America, sowed the ground for a reckoning. Yes, Obama's election postponed it for a time, but the recent eruption of black death--at the hands of the state--gave it new urgency. And now, as we can all see, it's here."

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/trump_s_campaign_hat_making_america_great_again_starting_with_this_hat.html	"In late July, while touring the Mexican border in Laredo, Texas, Donald Trump wore a baseball cap. This might seem a less-than-noteworthy development. One assumes Trump wore the hat mostly just to corral his cotton-candy hair on a windy day. Yet the online reaction was swift and torrential. Some wondered why a man worth more than TEN BILLION DOLLARS chose a hat that looked to cost about $5.99. Many others, meanwhile, wondered where they could buy one for themselves. The Trump campaign store in Manhattan sold out of the hat within hours, and his website scrambled to make them available for order. One online retailer rushed to fill the void with a line of knockoffs. Why did the donning of casual headwear become a subject of national fascination? It helps that The Donald is piping hot at the moment, a figure who spurs endless curiosity. Everything he touches turns to tweets. And oh, that photo: the pursed-lipped, squinty-eyed Trump frowning under his new chapeau. Juxtapose almost anything with Trump's sour puss, and you've got yourself an indelible image. But the fuss was in large part about the hat qua hat. Its text, ""Make America Great Again""--a shameless rip-off of Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign slogan ""Let's Make America Great Again."" (Note how Trump tweaks it to be both less inclusive and more bossy.) The hat's foamy front--apparently made from a repurposed beer koozie. The double divots framing the central peak. And of course the braided rope that elegantly stretched across its brim. The ""rope hat"" style is on trend these days. Gnarly skateboard periodical Thrasher Magazine sells them in several colors, highlighting--in rather Trumpian language--the ""classy woven rope"" that distinguishes its design. Urban Outfitters offers a circa 1992 Wu-Tang rope hat. Vintage rope hats routinely show up on Etsy. In June, a bit more than a month before Trump wore one for the cameras, Golf Digest asked, ""Are rope hats back to being cool?"" after one appeared atop the head of 26-year-old PGA tour pro Harris English. This was no mere trucker hat. The rope is a distinctive touch. There's a fine line here between retro chic and just, like, dorky 9-hole golf course wear. But Trump manages to walk this tightrope with ease. He's got that quirky, aging rich guy cool--the same kind that turned grandfatherly, 74-year-old Patriots owner Robert Kraft's fetish for Nike Lunar Force 1 sneakers into a minisensation in New England last year. And then there's the matter of the hat's lettering. Rendering Trump's slogan in all caps may actually reduce its legibility, since the lack of shape contrast slows down readers. But so what? ""Donald Trump is an all-caps kind of guy,"" says Steven Heller. Heller, co-chair of the MFA in design at New York's School of Visual Arts, recently analyzed Trump's typography choices for Wired--beginning with the giant, brass-colored, ""TRUMP TOWER"" sign over the entry of Trump's flagship Fifth Avenue building. Heller notes that the sign's typeface, a slab serif style that is likely either Stymie Bold or Lubalin Graph, is very similar to the one Playboy used for its gentlemen's clubs in the 1960s. Classy. Luxurious. Heller authored Iron Fists: Branding the 20th-Century Totalitarian State, so he is an authority when he describes the all-caps, chunky serif aesthetic of the hat as ""imperial."" There's a hat on sale in the Hillary campaign shop that nicely highlights the differences between the two candidates. The Hillary hat has a complicated stitching pattern and colorful underbrim and looks like it was lovingly designed by professional milliners. I've repeatedly asked the Trump campaign for their hat's origin story, and they've not yet gotten back to me with an answer, but to my eyes the Trump hat looks to have been thrown together last-second by a frazzled intern. Which seems par for the course. Everything about Hillary screams ""careful preparation"" while everything about Trump screams ""winging it."" Jerry McLaughlin, co-founder of Branders.com, spent 15 years making merchandise for political campaigns. In his eyes, the purpose of all this swag is not for the campaign to make money. ""Generally, they might end up making a few bucks,"" he says. ""But this is not a meaningful source of revenue for them. It's not a commercial enterprise. It's more, 'Let's not lose money doing this.' "" Even the Obama campaign's reported $40 million revenue from its high-fashion 2012 merchandise line was a drop in the bucket, to McLaughlin's thinking. ""It's still small numbers compared to the billion dollars it takes to run a presidential campaign."" And that's when you have Anna Wintour shaping your products. Surprisingly, McLaughlin doesn't even consider campaign merch a form of advertising. He doesn't think seeing a Hillary hat on someone else's head will turn you into a Hillary voter. ""It's more that it cements the wearer closely to the candidate,"" he argues. ""I wear your hat and, because I've announced publicly my affiliation with you, I find myself more committed. I'll take more actions on behalf of you. Subconsciously, by wearing the gear, we get ourselves more deeply involved."" This is key when it comes to squeezing more volunteer work out of supporters or further donations as the election approaches. I don't think Trump has put nearly that much thought into his hat. But that's the beauty of Trump. The hat is random and startling, and so is the Donald, and therein lies the key to much of the media coverage both get. Trump's current hold on America's attention derives mainly from two sources: 1) the angry conservatives who genuinely admire his alpha-dog persona (the sorts of voters who might earnestly wear hats much like this one); 2) the amused gawkers who can't get enough of his ringmaster antics (the sorts of voters who might ironically wear hats much like this one). It's working for him so far, publicity-wise. But we'll see how long this fragile coalition can hold. Heavy is the head that wears the mesh-backed, adjustable crown."	"The Real Reason Trump Is Selling Those ""Make America Great Again"" Hats"
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/donald_trump_immigration_plan_the_gop_candidate_s_plan_to_make_america_great.html	"Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign with an ugly tirade against Mexican immigrants--""They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.""--that shot him to the top of the GOP polls. He's been there ever since, despite racism, sexism, and open disrespect for combat veterans. Now, Trump is the center of gravity in the Republican race for president, and his antics affect every candidate, from mainstream picks like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, to more direct rivals like Scott Walker and Ted Cruz. On Monday, his pull got a little stronger. Trump published his first set of proposals, a plan for immigration reform titled in the style of the candidate's signature slogan: ""Immigration Reform That Will Make America Great Again."" Neither detailed nor precise, it still stands as the most comprehensive immigration plan yet released in the Republican presidential race. And together with Trump as its spokesman, the plan is poised to move the GOP conversation on immigration from simple restrictionism to something more punitive and cruel. Despite his rhetoric, Trump wouldn't deport unauthorized immigrants en masse. Instead, in line with Mitt Romney's ""self-deportation"" strategy from 2012, he would push ""attrition through enforcement"" to make life intolerable for unauthorized immigrants and their families. To start, he would triple the number of immigration enforcement officers, and empower them with greater authority to track down and deport unauthorized immigrants across the country. His White House would ask Congress to defund ""sanctuary cities"" and create a nationwide ""e-verify"" system for employers. He would increase penalties for immigrants who overstay a visa, including criminal prosecution, and he would end ""birthright citizenship,"" a provision of the 14th Amendment that gives automatic citizenship to anyone born in the United States and its territories. Originally written to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott, it now stands as a testament to American openness. And while Trump doesn't say that he would strip citizenship from the 4.5 million Americans born to unauthorized parents, many of them children, the implication is that he would. If so, it would be, as Ezra Klein notes for Vox, an astonishing act of collective punishment. And it continues. To pay for all of this--including a wall across the southern border of the United States--Trump would seize all remittance payments to Mexico (from both legal and unauthorized immigrants), increase fees on all temporary visas, border crossing cards, and NAFTA worker's visas, and raise tariffs on goods from Mexico. In addition, Trump would limit visas to high-skilled workers, and limit the number of refugees and asylum seekers who come to American shores. The overriding goal, again, is to keep new immigrants out of the country--regardless of status--and punish the ones that are already here. Trump might be a joke, but his plan is not. If implemented, it would bring tremendous suffering to millions of Americans--native-born, naturalized, or otherwise. But because it speaks to the Republican base--in a new CNN poll, 44 percent of self-described Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agree with Trump on ""illegal immigration""--it's getting a fair hearing from serious conservatives. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said his immigration plan was ""similar"" to Trump's; that he would support building a wall along the Mexican border; and that he would consider ""changing the rules"" on birthright citizenship. Other candidates, like Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie, have echoed Trump's views on birthright citizenship.* Likewise, the editors of National Review called it a ""good start"" that's ""sensible in its basic outline and better in many respects than the ideas presented by his rivals."" Nearly three years ago, after the 2012 election, Republican leaders urged a new approach for the party on immigration. They urged inclusive rhetoric and policies to match. They didn't get far, and a grassroots backlash killed the GOP plan for reform. Now, with Trump, they've come full circle. Outreach and persuasion is out for good. Antagonism is the new plan. Correction, Aug. 20, 2015: Due to an editing error, this article misstated that John Kasich echoed Trump's views on birthright citizenship. He did not. The reference to Kasich has been replaced with a comparison to Bobby Jindal, who did echo those views. (Return.)"	Trump's Astonishingly Cruel Immigration Plan Is Getting Rave Reviews From the GOP
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/voters_are_angry_about_american_politics_today_but_are_they_willing_to_do.html	"Look around the landscape of American politics, and one thing is clear: Voters are furious. On one side, they're angry about Barack Obama, immigration, and the perceived impotence of their elected officials. On the other, they're angry about Wall Street, economic inequality, and a government that has--in their view--been captured by billionaire plutocrats. This anger, notes Philip Rucker for the Washington Post, is key to the puzzle of summer 2015, where political life has come to resemble a hackneyed episode of The West Wing. As of this week, real estate tycoon and reality television star Donald Trump commands press attention and (not coincidentally) a strong lead in the Republican presidential primary, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders--a self-described socialist on the periphery of American politics--is the leading opponent to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic contest, with a tentative lead in the New Hampshire primary. Here's Rucker with analysis from party strategists and other campaign professionals: ""There's a longing for real authenticity in politics today,"" said Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who is advising Sanders. ""People feel that the candidates are too manufactured, there's not enough spontaneity. They want someone who, even if they don't agree with them, is telling it like they see it, really leveling with voters. I see that with Bernie and I think with Trump, too. It's resonating very powerfully."" ... ""There's a disquiet, discomfort, and angst that so many people are feeling,"" said GOP pollster Whit Ayres, who advises Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.). ""They're scared economically, they're scared about what's happening with our adversaries, and it makes them really, really uncomfortable with where the country's going and where the leaders are going."" To a degree, this is boilerplate. In an environment like this one--or the 2012 Republican primaries, where candidates like Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich had their time in the spotlight--voters are angry with the status quo is the only explanation that makes sense. At the same time, that doesn't mean it's true. Yes, Sanders and Trump are unexpectedly popular, but how angry are American voters, really? Are they unsatisfied with the status quo, or is this just sound and fury, signifying nothing? Judging from what we hear, the answer is yes, voters are angry, and even outraged. Just 19 percent of Americans trust Washington to ""do what is right"" either most of the time or all of the time. The remainder, 81 percent, are deeply skeptical. The same goes for trust in Congress. In 2014, according to Gallup, 15 percent of Americans approved of Congress--the second-lowest rating in 40 years of polling. The lowest rating was the year before, when 14 percent of Americans approved of Congress. And in a CNN poll from last year, before the midterm elections, 30 percent of Americans said they were ""very angry"" with the direction of the country, while 38 percent said they were ""somewhat angry."" But instead of polls, let's judge from what we see, and specifically, how voters act. For as much as Americans hate politicians, they never seem to throw the bums out. On Election Day 2014, Americans sent 396 incumbents back to Washington out of 416 who ran for reelection, for an incumbency rate of 95 percent. In 2012 the rate was 90 percent for House members and 91 percent for senators, and in 2010 it was 85 percent and 84 percent, respectively. You have to go back to 1986 for a Senate re-election rate that isn't at or near 80 percent. The House is even worse; since 1964, at least 80 percent of incumbents have been re-elected. The presidency is different, but Americans have never lacked for alternatives or unusual choices. And yet, in every presidential race since 1972--from the primaries to the general election--voters have looked to mainstream candidates to lead parties and govern the country. None of this means voters aren't sincere about their anger or their disdain for Washington. But it does suggest, strongly, that this anger is a little performative; that--when push comes to shove and Americans have to choose a president, and not just show their disapproval--they go with what they know. Are voters angry? Yes. Will it matter for the election? Probably not."	Voters Are Angry. But Are They Willing to Do Anything About It?

But at this stage, the polls are meaningless, or at least, they don't tell us much. What counts are the less glamorous parts of election season: endorsements, fundraising, and policy. On policy, the Democratic field has been active. The front-runner, Hillary Clinton, has made proposals for reducing college debt, defending the right to vote, and raising middle-class incomes. In the wake of protests from Black Lives Matter and other activists, her immediate challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has issued a robust program for ""racial justice,"" ranging from criminal justice reform to greater redistribution, with an eye toward shrinking disparities in wealth and education. Even the least visible candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, has released a thorough plan for police and criminal justice reform. Between the three contenders, Democratic voters have clear choices for the kind of liberal governance they want. With 17 candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, you'd think Republicans would enjoy an even greater quantity of ideas and policies. But as Darren Samuelsohn found for Politico, that's just not the case:"	The Republican Party Has a Lot of Candidates and Almost No Ideas
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/the_u_s_government_is_putting_americans_on_its_no_fly_list_on_a_hunch_and.html	"In the movie Minority Report, Hollywood depicts a future Washington, D.C., in which people are arrested by a special police force called Precrime, based on predictions that they will commit murders in the future. These predictions are not based on science, but on near-infallible psychics. Precrime asks for deference from judges, and gets it. The film's preventive policing model achieves a form of perfect safety, which is appealing: The number of murders goes down to zero, terrible tragedies are averted, and the federal government considers implementing Precrime nationwide. Until things go horribly wrong. Even in Hollywood, there are major issues with a crime prevention system that presumes future guilt without the ability to prove innocence. The U.S. government's reliance on ""predictive judgments"" to deprive Americans of their constitutionally protected liberties is no fiction. It's now central to the government's defense of its no-fly list--a secretive watch list that bans people from flying to or from the United States or over American airspace--in a challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. Court filings show that the government is trying to predict whether people who have never been charged, let alone convicted, of any violent crime might nevertheless commit a violent terrorist act. Because the government predicts that our clients--all innocent U.S. citizens--might engage in violence at some unknown point in the future, it has grounded them indefinitely. They are far from alone. Based on a leaked government document published by the Intercept last August, there were approximately 47,000 people on the no-fly list, of whom about 800 were U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. In all likelihood, the numbers are higher now. Worse, the U.S. government launched its predictive judgment model without offering any evidence whatsoever about its accuracy, any scientific basis or methodology that might justify it, or the extent to which it results in errors. In our case, we turned to two independent experts to evaluate the government's predictive method: Marc Sageman, a former longtime intelligence community professional and forensic psychologist with expertise in terrorism research, and James Austin, an expert in risk assessment in the criminal justice system. Neither found any indication that the government's predictive model even tries to use basic scientific methods to make and test its predictions. As Sageman says, despite years of research, no one inside or outside the government has devised a model that can predict with any reliability if a person will commit an act of terrorism. When predictions of dangerousness are made and upheld in our courts, the government generally has to show that the particular individual has been charged with or convicted of a relevant prior crime. Even in that context, there are major concerns about the reliability and fairness of future threat assessments and their potential for arbitrary and discriminatory use. The same concerns exist in our case; our clients are all American Muslims. Applying basic scientific principles, our two experts found that the no-fly list's rate of error is extremely high, meaning that the government is blacklisting people who will never commit an act of terrorism. It gets worse still. Because the government's predictive model results in the blacklisting of people who are not terrorists, individuals on the no-fly list need a meaningful method of redress--a fair way to demonstrate their ""innocence"" of crimes they will never commit. The government refuses to provide these safeguards in its current so-called redress system, which violates the due process guarantees of the Constitution. It refuses to tell our clients all the reasons the government has for predicting future misconduct, leaving them to guess. It won't provide the evidence underlying those reasons, including government evidence that would undermine its predictions. And it refuses to provide a hearing for our clients to press their case to a neutral decision-maker and challenge government witnesses' hearsay or biases. Without these basic requirements of a fair process, our clients can't meaningfully challenge the government's predictions. For example, the only reason the government provided to one of our clients is that he traveled to a particular country in a particular year. That's perfectly lawful conduct, no basis for predicting violence, and not enough information to challenge whatever other basis the government might have. In another case, the evidence the government is relying on--but not producing--includes information from FBI agents who unlawfully detained our client in East Africa for four months, abusing him and threatening him with torture and disappearance. The government also appears to be relying on electronic surveillance, without disclosing the legal basis for the surveillance or the results. According to the government, national security requires this secrecy, even though Congress and the courts have devised time-tested tools used every day in national security and other cases to protect the government's secrets while providing individuals meaningful ways to challenge government deprivations of liberties. We have asked the court in our clients' case to strike down the government's current redress process as unconstitutional. Otherwise, dystopian science fiction will become reality."	The U.S. Government Is Putting Americans on Its No-Fly List on a Hunch
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/mexican_illegals_how_the_hart_celler_act_and_its_conservative_supporters.html	"As Fox News debate moderators reminded America last week, Donald Trump believes that ""the Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people""--including drug dealers and rapists, who are ""doing the raping""--into the United States as illegal immigrants. Trump nonetheless wants to make clear that he has no problem with legal immigration. ""Many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it,"" Trump wrote in a July statement. ""But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally."" Almost all conservative politicians who believe illegal immigration is a problem make the same distinction: Ted Cruz's website, for example, says the senator ""celebrates legal immigration,"" while Marco Rubio used a debate answer to praise the patience of immigrants who wait their turn for a visa. Trump said during the debate that he wants to build a wall on the border but would include ""a big beautiful door in that wall"" for legal entry. It wasn't always this way. Fifty years ago a substantial number of conservative United States senators openly supported severe restrictions on legal immigration, influencing a bill that helped create the modern Mexican ""illegal"" immigration ""crisis"" as we know it. In 1965, President Johnson backed a reform proposal called the Hart-Celler Act (aka the Immigration and Nationality Act), which proposed to eradicate the ""national origins"" immigration quotas that had been in place since the 1920s. Those quotas prohibited vast non-white portions of the world population (e.g. almost all Africans and Asians) from immigrating to the U.S. while restricting the number of visas allotted to European countries, like Italy and Poland, whose natives were considered ethnically inferior to those from England, Scandinavia, and the like. Under the new system proposed by Hart-Celler, every country outside the Western Hemisphere would have the same basic quota of 20,000 visas. Legal immigration from the Western Hemisphere (i.e., North, Central, and South America) was to remain uncapped--as it had always been, even during the height of the 1920s anti-immigration movement, out of diplomatic respect for our nearby neighbors and because a treaty related to the military takeover of the Southwest had already declared that ex-Mexicans were eligible for citizenship. But some conservative senators were skeptical about altering the ""national origins"" system. They argued, as South Carolina Republican Strom Thurmond did, that the imperative ""to preserve one's identity and the identity of one's nation"" justified restrictionist policies that favored Western Europeans because they could more easily assimilate into the existing (white) culture. These opponents furthermore added that uncapped Western Hemisphere immigration was itself a looming threat to the United States' identity and stability. ""The day is not far off when the population explosion in Latin American countries will exert great pressures upon those people to emigrate to the United States,"" said West Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd. One of the hesitant Southerners was the influential Sam Ervin of North Carolina, a Democrat who led subcommittee hearings on the bill. (The debate over Hart-Celler was taking place before most of the South's racially conservative Democrats defected to the Republican Party--Thurmond himself had just switched a year before.) To win the support of Ervin and Illinois' Everett Dirksen, another key conservative vote, the Johnson administration agreed to a basic annual cap of 120,000 on total Western Hemisphere immigrants. The bill soon passed the Senate 76-18. In 1976 a further restriction was enacted that limited each Western Hemisphere country to basic caps of 20,000. The country most affected by the new Western Hemisphere rules: Mexico. Until it became a bargaining chip between LBJ and the Senate, the U.S.'s southern neighbor had played almost no part in the discussion of Hart-Celler or in the decade-plus immigration-reform movement that had preceded it. In her book Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America, Columbia University historian Mae Ngai notes that John F. Kennedy's pro-reform history A Nation of Immigrants, first published in 1958, ""devoted all of two paragraphs to Asian and Latino immigration."" And a 900-page 1950 Senate report about pressing immigration issues didn't mention illegal Mexican immigration at all. The lack of national interest in Mexico did not necessarily reflect a lack of activity at the border, as Ngai documents in her book. In the decades before Hart-Celler was passed, as many as 450,000 Mexicans had been legally entering the United States each year using temporary work permits issued by the ""bracero"" program, which supplied a migrant workforce for farms in California, Texas, and elsewhere. On top of that huge influx, some 50,000 Mexicans annually entered the U.S. as permanent residents. Conditions were still far from ideal for Mexicans from a civil rights perspective: Farm employers often didn't live up to the terms of their contracts, underpaying bracero workers and housing them in grim conditions, while even legal Mexican-American citizens were subject to discrimination, segregation, and hostility. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of so-called ""wetbacks"" did enter the country illegally (often because of promised jobs) and were subject to raids and deportations. But the significant majority of Mexicans who came into the country did so under legal auspices. All that changed when, within a matter of a year, the bracero program was terminated and Hart-Celler's Western Hemisphere immigration cap passed. The end of the bracero program was actually supposed to be a liberal reform that put an end to the systemic exploitation of Mexican workers. But once Hart-Celler went through, there were less than half as many visa slots allotted to the entire hemisphere as had been received in some previous years by Mexican migrants alone. (Liberal reformers do deserve some blame here, it should be said, for helping eliminate the temporary bracero visas and then immediately acceding to a compromise that drastically reduced the number of other legal options for entry.) You likely already know what has happened in the half-century since Hart-Celler. Jobs for immigrants didn't disappear and in fact opened up in a number of industries besides agriculture. The Mexican workers who wanted those jobs didn't stop coming. (Princeton sociologist Doug Massey and his collaborators have found that ""initiation of undocumented migration from Mexico is driven primarily by the pull of U.S. labor demand."") They simply arrived without immigration papers and instead of moving back and forth between Mexico and the U.S. as they often had in the days before strenuous border control, they began to settle here. (Roughly 50 percent of Mexicans making their first undocumented trip to the U.S. in 1970 returned to Mexico within a year. By 2005 that number was approximately 10 percent.) The ""illegal"" immigrant population, of which Mexicans make up more than half, rose steadily and peaked at an estimated 12.2 million in 2007. (One of the multiple ironies of Donald Trump's hysterical position on immigration is that because of deportation and emigration, the number of undocumented individuals residing in the U.S. has actually been falling for several years.) Politically, meanwhile, the same kinds of Mexican immigrants who'd been participating in legal migration for years became targets of criticism, villainized for supposedly disrespecting American laws and mooching off the American social safety net. Conservative rhetoric on immigration now treats our legal quotas on Mexican immigration--which were created more or less arbitrarily, without regard to the labor demand being created by our economy--as sacrosanct limits that deserve Mexicans' respect. But those legal limits were put forth in the first place to accommodate conservative senators who wanted to make it more difficult for Mexicans to move to the United States legally. If only all these Latino immigrants were legal, modern conservatives say, we'd be fine with them. Had it not been for Trump and Cruz and Rubio's predecessors, they might be."

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/republican_presidential_candidates_admit_to_some_inconvenient_truths_in.html	"In the Republican Party, you're expected to adhere to certain orthodoxies. You can't admit that public assistance is good for people or that the Iraq war was a mistake. You're supposed to pretend that single-payer health care is socialism, that we could balance the budget by cutting pork, and that with a little more backbone, we could make Iran utterly capitulate. But with 17 candidates running for the party's presidential nomination, somebody, now and then, is bound to blurt out the truth. That's what happened in Thursday night's debates. Here are some of the heresies that slipped out. 1. The Iraq war was a mistake. Jeb Bush has waffled on this, but on Thursday he decisively bit the bullet. He said he had equivocated because ""it was difficult for me"" after talking to families of dead soldiers who believed that their loved ones ""did not die in vain."" But Bush concluded: ""Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in."" 2. We created ISIS. Fox News' Bret Baier challenged Sen. Rand Paul for having ""blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks."" Baier quoted Paul's criticism of the hawks: ""Everything they've talked about in foreign policy, they've been wrong for the last 20 years."" In the debate, Paul stipulated that ISIS was solely responsible for its atrocities. But he also blasted ""Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars' worth of U.S. Humvees. ... We shouldn't fund our enemies."" 3. We couldn't sustain international sanctions on Iran. Nearly all the Republicans have maintained the proud fiction that if Congress were to reject the nuclear agreement with Iran, or if the next president were to renounce it, we could stiffen the world's resolve and get a better deal. As Gov. Scott Walker put it in the prime-time debate: ""You terminate the deal on Day One, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same."" But in the undercard debate, Carly Fiorina confessed the truth: ""I hope Congress says no to this deal. But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing. China and Russia have never been on our side of the table. The Europeans have moved on."" That's the unpleasant reality: We got as good a deal as we could, given the difficulties of our coalition. 4. You can't cut the deficit without cutting entitlements. Republicans love to pretend they can balance the budget by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse. Paul's favorite target, for instance, is origami condoms. But on Thursday night, Gov. Chris Christie rebuked his colleagues with some basic math. ""Seventy-one percent of federal spending right now is on entitlement and debt service,"" said Christie. ""We have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29 percent and no time on the 71 percent, and that makes no sense. Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security."" When Mike Huckabee replied that Congress should cut its own retirement program instead, Christie retorted, ""We can't fix the problem just by ending Congress' retirement."" Gesturing to show how meager the savings would be, Christie scoffed, ""That's worth about this much."" 5. People need Social Security. Economic stratification and wage stagnation have made several Republicans surprisingly vocal about defending checks from the government. ""Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham observed in Thursday's undercard debate. In the prime-time debate, Huckabee chimed in: ""Sixty million Americans are on Social Security--60 million. A third of those people depend on 90 percent of their income from Social Security."" Huckabee complained that politicians in both parties try to balance the books ""off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money."" 6. Payroll taxes are unfair. Huckabee complained, ""One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. ... Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and capital gains."" To shore up the program, Huckabee proposed a consumption tax that ""is paid by everybody."" He claimed it would hit ""illegals, prostitutes, pimps, [and] drug dealers."" But it would also hit people who get their income from capital gains and spend it on yachts. 7. Welfare is an economic opportunity problem, not a cultural problem. Twenty years ago it was popular to depict welfare recipients as lazy or pathological. The recession has changed that. When the debate moderators asked whether ""Americans have become too reliant on assistance or too willing to take assistance,"" Rick Santorum--who used to talk more about his role in welfare reform--focused instead on fixing the economy: ""If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way ... [than] putting people back to work in manufacturing."" George Pataki agreed: ""Do we have to have a cultural change? The answer is no. ... Good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency. ... We put in place mandatory workfare, but we allowed people to keep health care. We put in place child care support."" 8. Illegal immigrants are good people. Donald Trump may call them rapists, but Bush is standing by his declaration that their migration is ""not a felony, it's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family."" On Thursday, Bush reiterated, ""The great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family."" Instead of ""talking about this as a wedge issue,"" Bush called for ""a path to earned legal status."" 9. Medicaid helps people regain their productivity. Fox's Megyn Kelly pressed Gov. John Kasich about his choice to expand Medicaid in Ohio, as well as his statement that God cares more about helping the poor than about cutting government. Kasich replied, ""President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times."" He continued: I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio. To do what? To treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year to keep them in prison. I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life. Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community, and the recidivism rate is 10 percent, and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is threatening their very families. So we're treating them and getting them on their feet. And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet. That's the kind of logic--helping people help themselves--that Bill Clinton used to preach. Now we're hearing it from one of the Republicans who voted to impeach him. 10. Single-payer health care would be more efficient. Baier reminded Trump: ""Fifteen years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system."" Trump insisted he's now for ""a private system."" But he couldn't resist pointing out: ""As far as single-payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland."" For good measure, Trump excoriated the current health insurance market: ""The insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians."" It sounds as though Trump the businessman thinks single-payer would be smarter, even if Trump the Republican candidate has to parrot the party line. 11. Human activity is causing climate change. Fox's Bill Hemmer asked Graham how Republicans could trust him, since Graham has ""worked with Democrats and President Obama when it came to climate change."" Graham, who accepts the scientific consensus on climate change, embraced it as a selling point. ""When I get onstage with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions,"" he said. ""In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment."" If you're rooting for sanity in the GOP, the good news from Thursday night is that somewhere in this field of candidates, you're going to find it. The bad news is that you'll only hear it in bits and pieces, sometimes from this candidate and sometimes from that one. Orthodoxies exist for a reason. The Republican Party, as presently constituted, isn't willing to nominate someone who's open to reality and reform on most of these issues. And until it is, it will be the party that declaims and denounces, not the party that governs. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/jeb_bush_s_first_gop_debate_why_the_former_florida_governor_has_the_most.html	"CLEVELAND--All eyes are on Donald Trump for the first GOP debate, but if you can manage a sideways glance, you might want to take a look at Jeb Bush. For Bush, the first Republican debate will be a welcome relief from the one he has been having with himself. For the past two days, the former Florida governor has been trying to clean up the wreckage from his comment that ""I'm not sure we need a half a billion dollars for women's health issues."" Bush posted a statement on his website an hour after he questioned the funding of women's health programs saying that he misspoke and meant only to question the $500 million in federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Bush has had to revise and extend his remarks a few times already in this campaign, most notably regarding his views on the Iraq war, workers' hours, and Medicare. It would be tempting to say he shares his brother's and father's misadventures in public speech, but these are not idiosyncratic malapropisms or miscues. Bush is his own man (as he has told us). He's just shanking the ball in his own particular way. The candidate's repeated troubles along these lines are the rap against him, the most consistent thing Republican lawmakers, voters, and political hacks talk about when assessing his campaign. Bush is playing the long game, his aides say. These momentary episodes don't mean a thing in the scope of a campaign. The things his team is working on--money, organization, and winning delegates to get nominated--are the most important. They're probably right. These Jeb-in-the-rabbit-hole moments  are mostly ""you didn't build that"" episodes, where the candidate shorthands something or misstates it altogether and his opponents seize on it, the way Republicans leapt on President Obama's comments about business in 2012. (The exception is Bush's comments about the Iraq war, where he didn't demonstrate a lot of thought about the invasion's legacy.) But at some point Bush must show skill in the service of his larger campaign argument. The debate would be a good, high-profile moment to do that. To some, it looks like Bush enters the debate on his heels, but the first contest on the stage offers a huge opportunity: a chance to expel a problem in the time period closest to its reappearance. Bush is never going to get on the right side of his stumbles by articulating what he really meant to say. (It's not clear any politician can in the modern era.) Plus, when Bush is arguing on women's health ground, he's playing on the turf where voters most trust Democrats. But a strong performance in a debate, where everyone is watching, would ease some doubts about whether Bush can inhabit the general election posture his campaign is founded on. Bush's pitch is that he is the adult in the room, the candidate who can go the distance against the likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He's also arguing that he can attract a new kind of voter for Republicans, and he's promising to lift voters with his sense of optimism. All of these claims require that he move with speed and skill in future combat. Other Republican candidates are offering something very different. They are arguing that they can win in the general election by growing the conservative vote by being pure conservatives. Despite campaign stumbles, they can still point to their conservative credentials. Bush is making a case that he can steal part of the electorate from Democrats--a more ambitious gamble that requires finesse. He can't just assert he's going to do it. He has to show he can do it (as writing teachers everywhere remind their students). What was problematic about Bush's recent stumble was not just that it was an unforced error--a comment made in a formal setting and not some gaffe in response to a gotcha question--and not just that it showed him rusty in the cut and thrust of the modern campaign, but that he handed his likely opponent an opportunity. ""He's got no problem giving billions of dollars away to super wealthy and powerful corporations,"" Hillary Clinton said, ""but I guess women's health just isn't a priority for him."" Clinton didn't just jump on Bush's remarks because she disagreed with them. She used them as a ladder out of her current problems. The message she was sending Democrats--particularly female voters--is that she will be a fast-acting fighter for them. Her campaign keeps pushing the idea that she's a fighter, and oh look--here's a chance for her to run around the ring with the gloves on. Bush has said that he will come to Thursday night's Cleveland debate with his ""big boy pants on"" in case he gets into a tangle with another candidate--particularly Trump. But for the moment, he should probably just focus on putting them on one leg at a time."	Why Jeb Bush Has the Most to Prove in the First GOP Debate
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/how_to_save_the_voting_rights_act_voting_rights_shouldn_t_rely_on_parsing.html	"In 2010, the Simpsons featured a news helicopter emblazoned with the logo: ""FOX News: Not Racist, But #1 with Racists."" That slogan might be applied to today's Republican Party, which in recent years has actively passed voting laws that make it harder for poor and minority voters to vote. Whether to label the Republican Party ""racist"" isn't an academic exercise. The question is actually at the heart of lawsuits over the future of voting rights in Texas and North Carolina. It's also a question with historical resonance, particularly on the eve of the Voting Rights Act's 50th anniversary this week. The five-decade history of the Voting Rights Act is told masterfully in Ari Berman's new book, Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America. Berman starts around the time of the Selma, Alabama, marches, but unlike the movie Selma, Berman goes on to give us the rest of the history: the expansion of voting rights protections in 1970 and 1975 to include Latinos, Native Americans, and others over the objections of racists, many in the Democratic Party; the important 1982 rewriting of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, providing additional protections for minority voters nationally, and (now Chief Justice) John Roberts' key role for the Reagan administration in unsuccessfully fighting against the expansion; hot disputes over voting rights in Florida in the 2000 election; the controversial renewal of the expiring ""preclearance provisions"" of the act in 2006 that continued to require states with a history of discrimination to get federal approval before changing their voting laws; and the ongoing ""voting wars"" that accelerated when Roberts led the court's conservatives in striking down the 2006 preclearance renewal in Shelby County v. Holder. Berman's book, like Jim Rutenberg's excellent cover story for the New York Times Magazine on the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, views the struggles over voting rules primarily through the lens of race. And although that is an essential lens to apply, it downplays the growing role of partisan politics in this story, a partisan struggle that is having profound ramifications for the newest wave of court cases involving voting restrictions. Put simply, the Republican Party has reasons unrelated to racial animus to push new voting restrictions. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, the Democratic Party was dominant in the South, and the Republican Party still had many liberals in its ranks. In part thanks to the Voting Rights Act, which was tremendously successful in fostering the registration and turnout of blacks in the South, the political parties began to realign. Today, the Republican Party is the party of conservatives, and in the South that means primarily white conservatives, and the Democratic Party is the party of liberals, and in the South that means primarily blacks. Many of the ideological leaders of the Republican Party, especially outside the South as it emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, were conservatives but not racist. Think of Roberts, who adheres to a ""colorblind"" vision of the Constitution and who seems to believe that racism isn't a major problem in American society anymore. While acknowledging that racism still exists, he wrote in his Shelby County opinion that ""things have changed in the South."" But while most Republican leaders are not themselves racist, they have long promoted policies that build on white racism, resentment, and fears of losing dominance in American society. From opposition to busing and affirmative action in the 1970s and 1980s to calls to ""take our country back"" in more recent years, the Republican Party is certainly the No. 1 party of racists, even if it is not racist itself. And this brings us to Republican electoral strategies, especially in the South. This past term the Supreme Court decided a redistricting case out of Alabama in which the state's Republican legislature shoved black voters into fewer districts. The court sent the case back to the district court to determine if race was the predominant factor in creating these districts, which would make the districts unconstitutional. One view of the redistricting is that the Alabama legislature was motivated by race. Another is that the redistricting was about securing Republican Party advantage: Put blacks--the state's reliable Democratic voters--into fewer districts and you end up with more Republican districts. But the plaintiffs alleged that Alabama legislators were up to something a bit more subtle: Make sure all the Democratic districts have black representatives so that white racist voters would think of the Democratic Party as the ""black party."" Thinking about whether the Republican Party is motivated by race or party matters not only for these ""racial gerrymandering"" claims. It is also key to the Voting Rights Act disputes currently in the courts. Since 2000, we have seen a wave of Republican legislatures passing rules to make it harder to register and vote. One of the lessons of 2000, as both Berman and I have recounted, is that changes to voting rules matter in close elections. So far, attacks that new Republican voting restrictions violate the Constitution because states should not burden voters without good reason have mostly failed. So civil rights activists and Democrats have attacked the laws as Voting Rights Act violations. In the case of Texas' strict voter identification law--which made concealed weapons permits sufficient identification for voting but not student ID cards--a federal district court found that Texas enacted its law with a racially discriminatory intent. Texas has defended itself by saying it had good policy grounds for enacting its laws, but at most its laws were partisan, not racist. The case is currently on appeal. In the North Carolina voting trial over a restrictive set of laws that the state enacted just after the Supreme Court eliminated its preclearance requirement in the Shelby County case, the Justice Department and voting rights activists are trying to prove the law violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It is a tough claim to bring given the standards of Section 2. The best way for the plaintiffs to win the case is if they can prove that North Carolina had a racially discriminatory intent, but there's usually no smoking gun to support such claims. Why can't those suing just point to the North Carolina legislature's bad partisan intent? After all, most observers recognize that the state's claim that its law is necessary to prevent voter fraud and instill voter confidence is bogus and that this is all about gaining partisan advantage in the next election. The problem is that the Supreme Court hasn't recognized partisan intent as reason enough to strike down voting restrictions. It upheld Indiana's law in 2008 even though it appeared it was passed for partisan reasons. So we are left with the impossible situation of trying to untangle racial and partisan motives and effects. Especially in the South, with its conflicting racial and party overlap, this is a losing exercise. Nevertheless, civil rights lawyers' best bet is to attack these laws under the Voting Rights Act and to put the emphasis on race. So in both Texas and North Carolina, the claim is that the Republican legislatures acted as racists. It isn't clear if the Supreme Court will go along, even if the lower courts continue to make such findings, or if the court will read Section 2 broadly enough to make new voting restrictions illegal absent racial intent. As we think about what we need best to protect voting rights going forward, the time has come to add protections for all voters. Today, Republicans see the Voting Rights Act as protection for Democrats, not racial minorities. Although Republicans overwhelmingly supported the 2006 renewal of the Voting Rights Act, Senate Judiciary Committee members issued a report that all but declared the law unconstitutional. The Republican Party will not bite on increased protections for racial minorities; efforts to come up with a new preclearance formula after Shelby County have received very little Republican support. A strengthened Voting Rights Act should start with this proposition: When the state has no good reason for making it harder for people to register and vote, doing so should be illegal. If we can get Congress to acknowledge this fundamental point, we won't have to worry about parsing racial or partisan intent, and voters throughout the country will be protected. Voting rights will be protected without having to prove Republican racism. We will protect not just minority voters but student voters, military and overseas voters, poor voters, and voters who move around a lot and lose their registrations. I'm not holding my breath that this will happen anytime soon, but a colorblind amendment to the act seems like the only path through a Republican Congress to adding voting rights protections for the next 50 years of the Voting Rights Act."	How to Save the Voting Rights Act
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/08/the_ferguson_anniversary_michael_brown_s_death_12_months_ago_led_to_america.html	"On Aug. 9, one year ago, Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown after a brief scuffle in the middle of a small street in Ferguson, Missouri. There wasn't any video of the encounter, but many bystanders and local residents saw the aftermath. For four hours, Brown's body sat in the summer sun, slumped and face down, blood pooling in the street where he was killed. Neighbors, shocked at the violence and the police's disrespect for Brown's corpse, took photos and shared video. ""They killed him for no reason ... they just killed this n--er for no reason,"" said one man in a video recorded just after shooting. ""Do you see a knife? Do you see anything that would have caused a threat to these motherf--kin' police? They shot that boy because they wanted to shoot that boy in the middle of the motherf--kin' day in the middle of the motherf--kin' street."" But Brown wasn't the first unarmed black person killed by police officers in 2014, although he was the first to inspire mass demonstrations, riots, and an unprecedented, draconian police response of armored vehicles, automatic weapons, and tear gas. He wasn't even the first unarmed black person killed that summer. That was Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who was killed a month earlier. In the video of his arrest and death, he's surrounded by police, arguing. ""I didn't do nothing,"" he tells an officer. ""Every time you see me, you want to harass me, you want to stop me."" An officer puts him in a chokehold, while others hold him face down on the sidewalk. He pleads, ""I can't breathe,"" but police continue the arrest. They turn over his unconscious body. An hour later, he's pronounced dead. Garner's death sparked outrage. It even produced protests and demonstrations. But it didn't cause anything like the events in Ferguson. What was different about the death of Michael Brown? Part of it was the place where Brown died. St. Louis County, shaped by decades of redlining and white flight, was segregated and thick with racial tension. Worse, in small towns like Ferguson, municipal governments were openly predatory, extracting heavy fees from black residents through overpolicing and an opaque system of municipal courts. Yes, Brown's confrontation with Wilson was fraught and complicated. Just minutes before, Brown and a friend had stolen a pack of flavored cigars from a nearby convenience store, and forensic evidence showed a clear struggle between Brown and Wilson. Insofar as there's an accurate picture, it's of a police stop that escalates into a fight and then a shooting, with bad judgment on both sides. As the Department of Justice concluded in its investigation, ""There is no credible evidence that Wilson willfully shot Brown as he was attempting to surrender or was otherwise not posing a threat."" But no one knew that on Aug. 9, 2014. On that Saturday, the only thing anyone knew was what they saw and heard: An unarmed teenager was dead in the streets, with little word from the police. And in that moment, the powder keg of Ferguson and St. Louis County erupted. People wanted answers. Why did police leave Brown's body in the street? Why, later, did they bring guns and dogs to confront protesters and concerned citizens? Frustration boiled over into anger, and anger boiled into protests and disorder, which were met with heavily armed, militarized police. Across the country, on cable networks and through social media, Americans watched armored vehicles move down small-town streets as military-clad police officers shot tear gas into crowds of peaceful demonstrators. There was more to Ferguson than violence, however. There was activism. Two now-prominent activists, Deray Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie met in Ferguson, where--writes Jay Caspian Kang for the New York Times Magazine, they were ""radicalized,"" and where they honed a new kind of advocacy centered on social media. ""Their innovation has been to marry the strengths of social media -- the swift, morally blunt consensus that can be created by hashtags; the personal connection that a charismatic online persona can make with followers; the broad networks that allow for the easy distribution of documentary photos and videos,"" writes Kang, ""with an effort to quickly mobilize protests in each new city where a police shooting occurs."" Thanks in part to Elzie, Mckesson, and activists like Alicia Garza, the events provoked by the death of Michael Brown would coalesce into the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement, which--a year later--is one of the most vibrant protest movements in recent memory. But this just takes us back to our first question: What was different about Michael Brown? Why was he the catalyst for protest and conversation, as millions of Americans began talking about race, racism, and policing in ways we haven't seen since Rodney King was beaten by Los Angeles police officers in 1991? It's anti-climatic, but the answer has a lot to do with timing. With two police shootings in the weeks before, the world was watching--and thinking--when Brown was gunned down. Just two weeks after Garner died in a police chokehold, there was John Crawford, 22, who was killed while carrying a pellet gun in an Ohio Wal-Mart. A customer called 911, telling dispatchers that Crawford was pointing the gun at customers. (He later recanted.) Police arrived on the scene, and fatally shot Crawford while he was on his cellphone talking to the mother of his two children. And each incident compounded the other. Conversations about police violence after Crawford's death built on ones around Garner's death, and the entire discussion of Michael Brown was informed by those previous cases, and soon, subsequent ones. For example, two weeks after Brown died, Kajieme Powell, 23, was shot and killed in St. Louis after stealing snacks from a convenience store. Cops claimed he attacked them with a knife, which forced their hand. Americans didn't just hear about these incidents. They saw them as raw video, collected by cellphones and surveillance cameras, and broadcast by social media. And in almost every case, what they saw ran counter to what the police claimed: Crawford wasn't threatening anyone; Powell, in reality, wasn't even near the police when they killed him. For the first time, at least since Rodney King, Americans who distrusted the police had clear evidence for their beliefs, and Americans who typically placed their faith in law enforcement were newly challenged in their trust. With that as the backdrop, it's no wonder that Ferguson--already troubled with inequality, segregation, and unfair policing--was the town that eventually burned. Brown's death was the final spark in a summer of violence against black Americans, exacerbated by police misconduct and the attacks on Brown's character, meant to minimize or even excuse his death. And in turn, this explosion inaugurated a new, more urgent phase in the national argument over racism. You could see this in the White House's response. At various points in his presidency, Barack Obama had been forced to address race: When Henry Louis Gates was arrested at his home in Cambridge; when Trayvon Martin was shot on a quiet Florida street, and when George Zimmerman was acquitted in the killing; and when Jordan Davis was shot dead in a parking lot for listening to loud music. But for as much as Martin and Davis' deaths were traumatic, they were also in a different category than Garner or Brown. Gates was arrested, yes, but he wasn't harmed. And neither Martin nor Davis were killed by police officers--they were killed by private citizens. And while that provoked a conversation about black lives and bias, it was distinct from the policy questions evoked by police shootings. With Ferguson, President Obama was more reticent to broaden the conversation from policy to racism and bias. But his administration took action in a way that wasn't true in the previous cases. Then-Attorney General Eric Holder visited the town, while the Department of Justice launched an investigation of police practices in Ferguson and other municipalities. Wide coverage from major media outlets put the events on the national radar beyond social media. And unlike past incidents, that attention wouldn't break. We had entered a new reality. Here, the brutal beating of Rodney King 24 years earlier is a useful contrast. When he was beaten, raw video was unusual. It, plus cable news, is why Americans were jolted into national debates over police violence. Put differently, King wasn't the first person assaulted by the Los Angeles Police Department. But he was the first one whom millions of Americans had ever seen. For the victims of police brutality, and blacks in particular, it was vindication of pervasive mistreatment at the hands of law enforcement. And for white Americans who were skeptical--or more likely, indifferent--it was a shock to the conscience. Now, of course, that kind of video is ubiquitous, so much so that we aren't even interested in who took the footage. (By contrast, we know who took the Rodney King video: George Holliday.) And in the months after Ferguson, Americans viewed a steady stream of images from police stops gone wrong. The victims were almost always black, the offenses were almost always minor, the outcomes were often death, and--most importantly--police accounts never quite matched the footage. That September, Americans watched video from the dashboard camera of South Carolina State Trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a black motorist, Levar Jones, after he tried to comply with the trooper's request. As Jones reached down to grab his wallet and driver's license, Groubert, who is white, shot him. ""I just got my license! You said get my license!,"" yelled Jones, who was shot several times but remarkably survived. Groubert was fired and charged with felony assault and battery. That November--several weeks after a St. Louis grand jury declined to indict Officer Wilson in the death of Brown, sparking riots and protests in Ferguson and surrounding areas--Cleveland police officers Frank Garmback and Tim Loehmann killed Tamir Rice, 12, while he stood in an empty park, holding a lifelike toy gun. In their account, Officers Garmback and Loehmann say they approached in their car, shouted for Rice to drop his weapon, and fired when he reached for his waistband. Surveillance footage, on the other hand, showed a different story. Rice was standing in the park, bored and aimless. Without warning, a police cruiser barreled onto the scene. Officer Loehmann leapt out of the car, and started shooting. Seconds later, Rice was on the ground, dying. ""Shots fired, male down,"" said one of the officers to dispatch. ""Black male, maybe 20, black revolver, black handgun by him. Send E.M.S. this way, and a roadblock."" Neither officer gave first aid. Rice's death was followed, this past April, with the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina. According to the official report, Officer Michael Slager stopped Scott for a broken taillight, and Scott resisted arrest, taking control of Slager's Taser. Fearing for his life, Slager used his weapon, killing Scott. But there was a bystander, and in his recording, Scott wasn't a threat. Yes, he struggled with Officer Slager, but then he ran away. Slager didn't pursue him. Instead, he stopped, raised his gun, and fired eight times. He then cuffed the bullet-ridden Scott and placed the Taser near his body. The city took action and fired Slager, while Scott joined the growing roster of black Americans killed by police, with deaths broadcast to the world writ large. One week later, in Baltimore, police arrested 25-year-old Freddie Gray. In the video, cops are dragging an incapacitated Gray to the police van. There--according to an official autopsy--he was hogtied and banged against the walls, as officers drove back to the station. The ""rough ride"" severed his spine, and he was taken to a hospital, where he died. As with Brown and Ferguson, Gray's death sparked violent unrest from a city that, like St. Louis, is defined by segregation and deep inequality. After Baltimore, there was McKinney, Texas, where police arrested a 14-year-old girl for allegedly trespassing at a pool party. In a bystander's video, she's held to the ground. When two other teenagers, both black, come to assist her, the officer--who is white--points a gun at them. After McKinney, there was Prairie View, Texas, where a state trooper stopped Sandra Bland, 28, for a minor traffic violation. When she refused to put out a cigarette, the officer escalated the situation, threatening her with a stun gun and detaining her for ""resisting arrest."" She was arrested and sent to jail, where--three days later--officials found her dead in her cell, of an apparent suicide. The June massacre in Charleston, South Carolina--where a young racist gunman killed nine worshippers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, including the pastor, State Sen. Clementa Pinckney--isn't related to police violence, but it resonated nonetheless. In the same way that Ferguson and Baltimore are tied to long legacies of segregation and discrimination, Charleston was irrevocably tied to our history of racism and its presence in modern America. The attack was on a historic black church, and the alleged killer, Dylann Roof, saw his act as a blow for white supremacy. The unavoidable role of racism in inspiring the Charleston killings forced conversations that we often avoid, from the rapid and successful push to remove the Confederate flag from public buildings to President Obama's remarkable eulogy for Rev. Pinckney, in which he addressed American racism head-on. ""None of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight. Every time something like this happens, somebody says we have to have a conversation about race. We talk a lot about race. There's no shortcut. And we don't need more talk."" Each incident generated new coverage, new protests, new stories, and new activism. Put another way, in 1992, Americans eventually stopped talking about Rodney King. But because of the steady drip of incidents and evidence, we have never stopped talking about Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, and we won't stop talking about Freddie Gray, Clementa Pinckney, Sandra Bland, and all of the others. Their lives are part of a new, wrenching, and unprecedented argument about race and racism in today's America. Often--maybe most of the time--it's hard to step back and place proceedings in their proper context. Fights that feel major often look minor in the eyes of history, while small events can have lasting significance. In the 12 months since Ferguson, there's no question: It's just as important as it seems. We've had a national reckoning with race and racism that surpasses the debates over Rodney King and the Los Angeles riots, or the controversies around Hurricane Katrina and the botched evacuation of New Orleans. More Americans are skeptical of police claims than they were before Ferguson; more Americans think racism is a pressing issue for the country than they did before Brown's death; mainstream institutions like Starbucks (which tried to begin conversations about race) and MTV (which has commissioned research and aired a documentary on white American identity) are confronting questions of racial privilege; and more politicians are wading into issues of racial justice, pushed by belief, circumstance, and the vocal demands of the public and activists alike. A year ago, ""Black Lives Matter"" was a hashtag. Now, it's an important part of the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination. Leading leftist candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders harmed himself when he couldn't answer activist concerns about ending police violence against black Americans. Now he's embraced their rhetoric at campaign events across the country. Likewise, Hillary Clinton--the likely Democratic nominee--has stepped forward with speeches on racism and several proposals for police and criminal justice reform. The candidate who once shied away from race and gender in her 2008 presidential run has, early in the Democratic primary, openly criticized racism and bias among whites. ""Our problem is not all kooks and Klansmen. It's also the cruel joke that goes unchallenged. It's the offhand comment about not wanting those people in the neighborhood,"" she said in a speech after the Charleston shooting. ""Let's be honest, for a lot of well meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear."" And President Obama has become increasingly forthright on bias and racism. ""[T]he legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives: That casts a long shadow,"" he said in an interview with comedian Marc Maron. ""And that's still part of our DNA. That's passed on. We're not cured of it--racism. We're not cured of it. And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public."" In terms of policy or politics, it's hard to say what will follow, although ""Black Lives Matter"" and other activists have added urgency to the drive for criminal justice reform. But what we can say, with near certainty, is that this conversation will continue, driven by more footage of more black people killed or injured in confrontations with police.
