Written by Joy Masoff--an author, but not a trained historian--she deals with the usual founding facts of commonwealth history: Jamestown, Colonial Williamsburg, Thomas Jefferson, and the Revolution. But when Masoff gets to the Civil War, she goes off the rails. ""Thousands of Southern blacks fought in Confederate ranks,"" she writes, ""including two black battalions under the command of Stonewall Jackson."" Historians in the state were appalled. Not only was there little evidence of mass voluntary participation among blacks in the Confederate war effort, but the Jackson line is pure fantasy. In fact, Masoff copied the claim from the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that insists on the reality of black Confederate soldiers, and whose in-house historian, Charles Kelly Barrow, argued the point in a book called Black Confederates. Mainstream historians dismiss the claim, but it's easy to see how it persists. In a world where black soldiers willingly fought for the Confederacy, your beliefs are vindicated. Suddenly, the Confederate cause is noble--a fight for freedom against invaders, not a struggle in defense of slavery. Or, as Yale historian David Blight told the Washington Post, ""This isn't just about the legitimacy of the Confederacy, it's about the legitimacy of the emancipation itself."" History education doesn't matter because of particular names and dates; it matters because history is one way we understand ourselves and our place in the world. If the Sons of Confederate Veterans believe in the myth of the black Confederate, it's because they also believe in the nobility of their predecessors, and the two are connected. Likewise, if historians want to strike Masoff's sentence from the record (which they eventually did), it's because they're committed to giving kids a fuller--and sometimes unflattering--story of Virginia's history. But history has always been a clash for control of the narrative--a place where we fight to define our identity. Given the stakes, conflict is inevitable, even when the tweaks are minor. Take Advanced Placement United States history. A university-style course for ambitious high-schoolers, it's managed by the College Board, which prepares the year-end test and issues guidelines for teaching the course. Last month, the College Board released a new ""curriculum framework"" to help teachers shape material and prepare their students for the test. ""In line with college and university U.S. history survey courses' increased focus on early and recent American history and decreased emphasis on other areas,"" explains the College Board, ""the AP U.S. History course expands on the history of the Americas from 1491 to 1607 and from 1980 to the present."" The particular change is a greater focus on women and minorities, with thematic questions like ""How have gender, class, ethnic, religious, regional, and other group identities changed in different eras?"" and ""How and why have moral, philosophical, and cultural values changed in what would become the United States?"" At the end of the course, students are expected to do things like ""Explain how conceptions of group identity and autonomy emerged out of cultural interactions between colonizing groups, Africans, and American Indians in the colonial era"" and ""Explain how the U.S. involvement in global conflicts in the 20th century set the stage for domestic social changes."" History teachers aside, most of the rest of the world shrugged. But conservatives noticed, and they were furious. The framework, resolved the Republican National Committee, is a ""radically revisionist view of American history that emphasizes negative aspects of our nation's history while omitting or minimizing positive aspects."" ""Instead of striving to build a 'City upon a Hill,' as generations of students have been taught, the colonists are portrayed as bigots who developed 'a rigid racial hierarchy' that was in turn derived from 'a strong belief in British racial and cultural superiority,' "" wrote conservative groups American Principles in Action and Concerned Women for America in a joint open letter to the College Board. ""The new Framework continues its theme of oppression and conflict by reinterpreting Manifest Destiny from a belief that America had a mission to spread democracy and new technologies across the continent to something that 'was built on a belief in white racial superiority and a sense of American cultural superiority.' "" National Review has been on a crusade against the new guidelines, with Stanley Kurtz warning, ""This Framework will effectively force American high schools to teach U.S. history from a leftist perspective,"" and that the guidelines can ""only be interpreted as an attempt to hijack the teaching of U.S. history on behalf of a leftist political and ideological perspective."" He continues: ""The College Board has drastically eroded the freedom of states, school districts, teachers, and parents to choose the history they teach their children."" In the latest shot against the test, Tennessee lawmakers have urged the state board of education to review the framework and materials. ""There are many concerns with the new [AP U.S. history] framework, not the least of which is that it pushes a revisionist interpretation of historical facts,"" said Senate Education Committee Chairwoman Dolores Gresham in a statement on Tuesday. ""The items listed as required knowledge have some inclusions which are agenda-driven, while leaving out basic facts that are very important to our nation's history."" Sixty years ago, an academic focus on women and minorities was radical. Then, for instance, students learned a ""Lost Cause"" history of events like the Civil War, where ""states' rights"" were the aim and Reconstruction was a corrupt, wrong-headed disaster. Today, after decades of revision and correction, it's banal. To say--as the College Board does--that the British system of slavery was ""reinforced by a strong belief in British racial and cultural superiority"" is to cover territory mined and accepted in the 1970s. The same goes for the description of Manifest Destiny. In What Hath God Wrought, his contribution to the Oxford History of the United States, historian Daniel Walker Howe describes the 19th-century slogan as a justification for policies that were ""permeated"" with the ""assumption of white supremacy."" ""It never occurred to U.S. policymakers,"" notes Howe, ""to take seriously the claims of nonwhite or racially mixed societies to territorial integrity."" Teaching this is an assault on historical standards if your goal is a pleasing hagiography of the United States, not a serious look at our national actions and collective beliefs. With that said, the standards are still filled with traditional history. The claim that students are losing the core ideas of American history education is false. In the AP U.S history practice exam, students are asked to read quotes from Capt. John Smith, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Ronald Reagan. They discuss topics like the Great Awakening and American intervention in World War II, and have to grapple with rhetoric from Thomas Paine. The essay questions deal with democracy, the American frontier, national identity, and global American leadership. The guidelines are long, but I recommend you read the test, or even take it. I did, and I found a balanced look at the full scope of American history, not a left-wing tirade against the nation's sins. Indeed, if you were going to go the Howard Zinn route, you'd have a course dedicated to the slave-owning hypocrisy of the Founders, the extermination of Native Americans, the gross oppression of women, the brutality of the Confederacy, the anti-black terror of Reconstruction, the anti-Chinese mobs in California, the labor suppression of the Gilded Age, the bloody occupation of the Philippines, the lynchings and white race riots of the early 20th century, the Japanese internment, and the general extent to which white supremacy was the ruling ideology of American elites for the better part of 200 years. Conservatives are angry with the College Board standards? They'd have rage strokes at what actual lefties would do to American history curriculums. But then, so would I. For as much as those are important facts of history that deserve a full accounting in classrooms, a course devoted to our moral failures is as blinkered and unsatisfying as a course devoted to a morality tale of American goodness and American freedom. What students need--and what the College Board has tried to give--is a history that tells a fair and complex story of America, a country born of lofty goals that it still struggles to fulfill. As adult citizens, we should want the same. The fairy tales of our youth may feel good, but a real grappling with our history is what we need to move forward."

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/woodland_hills_youth_development_center_the_dark_secret_of_juvenile_detention.html	"Thirty-two teens escaped from a Tennessee juvenile detention center late Monday night, taking advantage of an overnight shift change to leave the building before slipping underneath a chain-link fence to freedom. By the next evening, all but seven had either been caught by police or turned themselves in. ""Was [the escape] a fluke? Was that planned? We don't know yet,"" said Rob Johnson, a spokesman for the state's Department of Children's Services. It wasn't the first time that teens at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center made a break for it. In May, a half-dozen escaped their bedrooms early one morning and made it to the facility's outdoor courtyard before being convinced by staff to return to their rooms. It's too soon to speculate about what motivated the kids to escape. But while we await details, now is the perfect time to recount the troubling history of staff sexually abusing children in facilities like Woodland Hills. That's not to suggest that misconduct is what motivated the kids to flee--we don't know if it even played a role. Woodland Hills does, though, have a well-documented record of alleged sexual misconduct. This sort of abuse happens outside the country's field of vision, behind fences and closed doors, where authorities can too easily brush aside allegations from troubled youth. That's all the more reason to give the abuse a fuller accounting whenever news from a facility like Woodland Hills spills over (or in this case, under) its walls. So, what has been going on at Woodland Hills? A 2010 investigation by the Tennessean found a series of allegations that had gone largely uninvestigated and unpunished by authorities. One of the facilities' kitchen employees, the newspaper discovered, had reportedly given a 17-year-old boy chlamydia, and later lived with a different male juvenile who she had been accused of abusing while he was in the facility. The woman was cleared in four separate state investigations despite failing a lie detector test. She was ultimately convicted only after she turned herself in to police. In another case uncovered by the paper, a different female guard went on to marry a former inmate after he was released from the facility. The woman kept her job even after her marriage came to light. Such incidents are sadly common inside our juvenile justice system. In the most recent federal survey of detained juveniles, nearly 8 percent of respondents reported being sexually victimized by a staff member at least once in the previous 12 months. For those who reported being abused, two things proved overwhelmingly true, as they were in Woodland Hills: They were teenage boys, and their alleged assailants were female employees tasked with looking out for their well-being. Nine in 10 of those who reported being victimized were males reporting incidents with female staff. Women, meanwhile, typically make up less than half of a juvenile facility's staff. These were not one-time occurrences. Among those who said they were abused by staff, 86 percent reported more than one incident in the previous year; 20 percent of those who reported sexual misconduct said it happened at least 11 times over that period. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics survey, the use or threat of force was present in only one in five victims. Instead, the research suggests that female guards are more likely to establish a relationship with the boys, writing them letters, giving them gifts of alcohol or even drugs, or granting them special favors to build their trust. Such activity--often called ""grooming""--not only sets the stage for the abuse that follows but also makes the teens less likely to report their abusers after the victimization happens--or even to consider it abuse in the first place. Consider, nearly one in five of the victimized youth reported that they ""always"" made the first move, while an additional 46 percent said they ""sometimes"" did. Even if the teens are of age--and at least some were likely over the age of consent--that changes nothing: No one being kept in custody can consent to having sex, regardless of age or gender. The Justice Department first documented the surprising prevalence of female staff sexually abusing male juveniles in 2010 after surveying a limited sample of detention centers and group homes. Three years later the DOJ released a second report with a broader sample, finding the same trend. While there is cautious hope that the problem will be addressed through policy changes required by the Prison Rape Elimination Act--which bans guards of the opposite gender from performing body searches or otherwise being present when a juvenile is undressed, among other things--the issue remains largely off the nation's radar, popping up on those rare occasions when a parent of a victim contacts the press, but then quickly receding back into the darkness that so often envelops our justice system. In that regard it is not unlike what happens in the nation's adult prisons, where routine sexual assault among inmates is often unfairly brushed aside as simply part of the punishment. For the young males in juvenile homes, that it-happens-but-what-can-you-do-about-it attitude comes with a twist: It's the boys who are being abused who often receive much of the blame. In an interview with ProPublica last summer, Reggie Wilkinson, a former director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, conceded there is no such thing as consensual sex in a detention center. He followed that by saying, ""[T]he reality of it is that some of the guys in prison are very persuasive and some of the women are very persuasive."" ""Sadly, again and again, we still have corrections officials talking about manipulative youth,"" says Lovisa Stannow, the executive director of Just Detention International, a human rights organization dedicated to ending sexual abuse in prisons and jails. ""Stop and think about that: We're talking about troubled kids who need help turning around their lives. This is not rocket science: If you are a corrections officer, you need to abide by the law."" The attitude that these boys bear some blame, however small, is dangerous in a vacuum. It's downright reckless when we know that 90 percent of reported incidents involve male juveniles and female guards. ""That minimizing of a serious crime is really contributing to the crisis,"" says Stannow, ""and we are talking about a crisis here."""

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/child_migrant_crisis_the_number_of_unaccompanied_minors_being_arrest_has.html	"Earlier this summer, as unaccompanied Central American children poured into the United States at a rate of more than 350 per day, President Obama and Republicans agreed: This was a crisis that Washington needed to address immediately. And then nothing happened. Surprising almost no one, the least-productive Congress in history went home for the summer without striking any kind of deal. Obama was left without the extra $3.7 billion he said he needed to deal with the situation at the border, and the existing immigration law that both the president and his conservative critics blamed for the calamity remained untouched. Two months later, the number of minors being arrested at the border has dropped significantly. But what was a problem then remains a problem now. The big difference is that the summer's ""humanitarian crisis,"" once the subject of innumerable press conferences and op-eds, now goes mostly unmentioned in Washington. To be sure, one major reason for the relative silence is that our attention has been pulled to Ferguson, Missouri, and the Middle East. But given the rhetoric and handwringing on display in June, late August's relative silence is staggering. Obama did touch on the topic briefly during a press conference this Thursday, in the context of how the crisis will affect his plan to reshape the nation's immigration system through executive action. As the president noted, the flood of migrant children has slowed substantially in recent weeks. According to the most recent data from the Department of Homeland Security, the border patrol apprehended 5,508 unaccompanied children in July--nearly half the total of the previous month and the fewest since February. Still, these are huge numbers. The amount of unaccompanied minors from Central America arrested at the border last month was more than the number of Central American minors taken into custody in a typical year as recently as a half-decade ago. While Obama suggested the downward trend has continued this month, it's too soon to say whether it will continue. One reason why is that it remains unclear exactly what's behind the decrease. The administration, relatively quietly, took partial credit for the drop earlier this month, but two of the actions they touted--a crackdown on the criminal smuggling rings operating in Central America and ""productive discussions"" with the presidents of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador--happened toward the end of July, casting doubt on how much credit they deserve. Complicating matters further is that, in a larger sense, it's not even clear whether the decrease in children coming to the border is a good thing. There's nothing to suggest that the root problems that drove many of the children from their homes in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala have been solved. All three nations have been ravaged by gang violence and remain among the most dangerous countries in the world. Boys who remain often have to decide between how they want to die: either at the hands of a gang they refuse to join, or at the hands of one of its rivals or the police if they do. Girls are often spared that choice, but too often nothing else. As one child who fled to the United States explained to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees: ""In El Salvador they take young girls, rape them, and throw them in plastic bags."" Obama has touted a strategy of ""aggressive deterrence,"" one centered around the idea that if Central American parents know for certain that their children will be sent home almost as soon as they arrive, they'll decide against sending them in the first place. Many immigration and child-rights advocates, though, believe Central American kids can make a legitimate legal claim to asylum if they reach U.S. soil. It's difficult to feel good about cutting down migration, then, by telling the kids and their parents that they likely won't receive asylum when it's possible that's just not true. If you place the crisis within the narrowest possible frame--as Washington largely has--and limit it to what's happening in the United States, things are still far from rosy. The recent trend aside, tens of thousands of the children are already in the system and are likely to remain stuck in immigration limbo for the foreseeable future. According to The Hill, the average immigration proceeding takes upward of 500 days. The White House is moving the Central American children to the front of the line, but it's unclear how quickly they'll cut through the existing backlog. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, 37,477 of the child migrants have been released to a relative, family friend, or other adult sponsor already living in the United States. Several thousand more are currently living in one of a number of longer-term shelters spread across the country. Even if most of these kids are no longer stuck in overcrowded shelters near the border, the government still has a massive problem on its hands. Under federal law, those children are eligible to attend public school while they remain in the United States, regardless of their immigration status. Communities that receive only a handful of children will likely be able to absorb the extra costs. But others--states like California, Florida, and Texas with large Central American communities--won't have it so easy. The Miami-Dade County School District has already asked the federal government for more funds. Others are likely to do the same as school districts around the country find out how many children will be added to their rosters. As Washington awaits the executive actions that Obama promised earlier this summer, the president remains in an awkward position. On one hand, he's promising compassion for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. On the other, he's continuing to tout his tough-love approach for the tens of thousands of children who have arrived at the border. Obama's ""aggressive deterrence"" approach was centered on the notion that lawmakers could rewrite legislation to allow federal border patrol agents to quickly deport a migrant child if it isn't immediately obvious that she will likely be granted asylum. In the absence of congressional action, his administration has taken whatever smaller steps it can to send that message, such as diverting resources to speed up the lengthy removal process and increasing the frequency of flights returning migrants home. That awkwardness was on full display in June during a meeting with a dozen or so immigration groups that had been clamoring for Obama to take executive action. After the president delivered the message that the advocates had long waited to hear, that those actions were in the offing, the celebratory mood was quickly dampened when the issue of the migrant children came up. ""Sometimes, there is an inherent injustice in where you are born, and no president can solve that, Obama said,"" according to The Atlantic's well-sourced tick-tock of that meeting. While Washington appears eager to put this summer's crisis in its rearview mirror, voters might not let that happen. The migrant children have proved to be a hot-topic at town hall meetings across the country, where conservative voters have criticized lawmakers for not doing enough to send them back home. Things for Obama, meanwhile, haven't gone much smoother. On Thursday, the same day that the president largely brushed aside what remains of the crisis at the border, more than 140 immigration activists were arrested outside the White House in a choreographed stunt. The aim of that stunt: to pressure the president to go big with his executive actions and to stop the deportation of the Central American children."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/the_permanent_campaign_when_did_the_2014_election_season_begin.html	"Labor Day was once the unofficial start to the fall campaign season, but now it's more like Angelina Jolie's marriage to Brad Pitt--a milestone in an engagement that has been going on so long it's hard to think of a time when it wasn't. Labor Day was never a marker of the first moment of campaign activity, but a rough approximation of the time when the pace quickened. So when was that moment in this campaign? The answer depends on how you see this race unfolding, in a year where Republicans have tremendous national advantages and Democrats are trying to keep the races local. Here are a few possibilities of where to drop the needle: The day after Election Day 2012: Republicans had a chance to retake control of the Senate in 2010 and 2012. After the second missed opportunity, strategists, wealthy backers, and other members of the GOP establishment focused on recruiting candidates who could unite the GOP coalition but who most of all were good politicians unlikely to make career-ending gaffes. April 2013--Democrats launch Bannock Street Project: Both parties are boasting about their unprecedented efforts to turn out voters. That's another reason campaigns start earlier. As technologies and science of voter identification and mobilization have improved, the parties and their allies have started hunting down voters earlier and earlier. In 2001 the Republican National Committee boasted of a ""72-hour task force"" before Election Day. Now, the RNC boasts of its Victory 365 Program, a permanent grassroots field operation that will run all year long. But Democrats face a higher turnout hurdle than Republicans. Voters that made up a key portion of Obama's winning coalition--single women, minorities, and young voters--don't usually participate as much in nonpresidential elections. That's why last spring, Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Michael Bennet to outline the Bannock Street Project, a $60 million, 10-state effort to reverse that historical trend. Named after the Denver field headquarters of Bennet's successful 2010 campaign, it will be crucial in keeping the Senate in Democratic hands. Oct. 1--Launch day of healthcare.gov: Perhaps the biggest reason campaigns start earlier than ever before is that super PACs, which raise mountains of money, can put ads on television early and keep them there. Campaigns, by contrast, must husband their resources, which are harder for candidates to raise. In advance of the launch of the open-enrollment period for federal health care exchanges, Americans for Prosperity launched ads targeting the Affordable Care Act. Then, when the website collapsed and some customers were not allowed to keep their insurance, as the president had promised, AFP started running television ads attacking Democrats for their support of Obamacare. ""It was the earliest, most comprehensive ad campaign that we've ever seen,"" says Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president of Kantar Media Ad Intelligence. ""The ads didn't just dribble out. It was a well-organized, unprecedentedly funded ad campaign."" The ads and the extended collapse of the website put Democrats so on the defensive that Senate Majority PAC, the lead outside group defending them, had to launch its ad campaign early to beat back the assault. The airwaves have remained stuffed ever since. President Obama's health care plan is not the white-hot issue it was late last year, but one lasting benefit Republicans have already banked from that time is the recruitment of good candidates in states that might not otherwise have been competitive. Strategists say that it was easier to persuade GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner to run in Colorado and Scott Brown in New Hampshire because the ad campaign had so battered Democrats in those states. Those GOP recruits also knew from the money being spent on those ads that if they got in the race they'd have a big bank account behind them. Dec. 1--The day healthcare.gov recovered: If Democrats are able to survive in this tough election cycle, it will be because they kept the election focused on their opponents and local issues instead of national ones. Though they have been tested on a range of national issues from the systemic problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs to foreign policy challenges, there was no greater national distraction for Democrats than the protracted collapse of the president's health care website. When the website started humming and the health care law moved from being such a contentious issue, the air cleared, and Democrats were allowed to focus on their own campaigns and local messages. June 24--Sen. Thad Cochran beats Chris McDaniel in Mississippi's GOP primary runoff: ""We thought McDaniel would be this year's Akin,"" says one top GOP strategist, referring to Todd Akin, the former Missouri Senate candidate. Akin's remarks about ""legitimate rape"" during the 2012 cycle not only sunk his chances, but tarnished the GOP brand in other races. Despite this year's efforts to shut out exotic candidates, the campaign season started with seven Republican incumbents facing Tea Party challengers. All of those candidates were beaten back. In open seats, Republicans nominated candidates who were best positioned to win in a general election. In many cases, the victors simply learned to appeal to Tea Party voters. In some cases, though, Republicans dodged a bullet. If Steve King had decided to run in Iowa, he would have been far more polarizing in that purple state than the current Republican nominee Joni Ernst, who is now neck-and-neck with her Democratic opponent. The worry with McDaniel was not that he would put Mississippi in play, but that his past comments about women and black Americans would have created problems for the party as a whole and energized those two key Democratic groups. Labor Day has not lost its role completely in the modern campaign cycle. There are some structural reasons the race will change in the days to come. By law, television stations must offer the lowest available rate for advertisements to candidates in the last 60 days of a campaign, which means we'll start to see different kinds of ads on television. Debate season is also coming, which could mix up things. Partisans may have been locked up earlier than ever before because of absentee and early voting, which in some places starts well before Election Day, but last-minute undecided voters are also still out there. In close races, even a small number of them will matter. One strategist suggests that because the campaign has started earlier, last-minute voters are more turned off to the noise than ever, meaning they may not pay attention until October. (Columbus Day is the new Labor Day!) And, of course, there could always be a surprising last-minute national event that could throw the entire race into turmoil. We won't know until after the election which one of these moments will emerge as the turning point that either changed control of the Senate or not. But once analysts and pundits fix on a reason, new campaign strategies will be launched for the next campaign, since strategies for the next campaign, like the Bannock Street Project, are born from the successes of the previous ones. Given the pace of things, those 2016 strategies will probably be launched not long after Election Day."	When Did the Election Season Begin?	['Reid', 'Cochran', 'Bennet', 'Gardner']	['healthcare']
4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/hillary_clinton_on_ferguson_protests_and_michael_brown_s_killing_the_former.html	"After almost three weeks of silence, Hillary Clinton has finally spoken on the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Toward the end of her paid remarks at a tech conference in San Francisco, Clinton shifted gears to address the shooting and its related issues. ""I applaud President Obama for sending the attorney general to Ferguson, and demanding a thorough and speedy investigation,"" she said. ""That's both thorough and necessary to find out what happened, to see that justice is done, and to help this community begin healing itself."" On criminal justice reform, she echoed President Obama's comments from last week's press conference. ""We cannot ignore the inequities that persist in our justice system,"" she said, ""inequities that undermine our deepest values of fairness and equality."" Clinton also condemned the draconian police response to peaceful protesters. ""Nobody wants to see our streets look like a war zone,"" she said. ""Not in America, we are better than that."" From there, Clinton addressed racial prejudice and inequality. But unlike Obama--whose comments were limited to banalities and ""both sides"" posturing--she had something smart to say. ""Imagine what we would feel and what we would do if white drivers were three times as likely to be searched by police during a traffic stop as black drivers, instead of the other way around,"" she said, ""if white offenders received prison sentences 10 percent longer than black offenders for the same crimes, if a third of all white men--just look at this room and take one third--went to prison during their lifetime. Imagine that. That is the reality in the lives of so many of our fellow Americans and so many of the communities in which they live."" The few times President Obama has made serious comments on race, he's been candid, personal, and conciliatory. He's either tried to universalize his experience--as he did in his 2008 Philadelphia speech--or contextualize the particular experiences of black Americans, as he did in his 2013 remarks on the George Zimmerman verdict. Put simply, being black lets Obama empathize with black Americans in a way unique to his presidency. At the same time, it acts as a limit on what he can say. Or, as I noted on Tuesday, Obama can't address racial issues without polarizing the public along racial lines. He tiptoed around Ferguson, but given the rancor caused by his comments on Henry Louis Gates' arrest or Trayvon Martin's killing, it was the smart path to take. Clinton's statement is neither candid, personal, or especially conciliatory. Instead, it's a little blunt, and in a good way. She asks for understanding and doesn't give her listeners a rhetorical escape. ""Imagine that,"" she says, pushing her audience to conjure a world where white men were targets for law enforcement, and where their lives were routinely derailed for trivial offenses. There's also the optics of the audience. When most white politicians talk on race or racial subjects, they go to a black audience. Hence Ken Mehlman's 2005 apology to the NAACP for the GOP's ""Southern Strategy,"" or more recently Reince Preibus' comments on Republican outreach at this year's convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. I'm sure there were black people in the audience in San Francisco, but this was Silicon Valley. Clinton was talking to white people. And she was asking them, as white people, to show empathy and concern for the conditions of their black fellow citizens. I wouldn't say this is unprecedented, but it is rare. Especially since there's no attempt to deflect or blame black Americans for their own problems. Clinton doesn't mention ""black-on-black crime"" or give a brief respectability lecture. She simply says, Look at how we treat them, and imagine if it were you. In 2012, political scientist Daniel Gillion found that in his first two years in office President Obama spoke less on race than any Democratic president since 1961. And judging from his relative silence since then, I expect that when Obama leaves office, he will have said less on racial questions than most recent presidents, period. For Americans who wanted Obama's voice on race, this is disappointing. At the same time, there's a decent chance we'll get Hillary Clinton's voice on race, and while the modern presidency brings political limits on what any president can say, that might be the better alternative. In the same way that only a hardline anti-communist could go to China and only an arch-conservative could raise taxes, it might be that it takes a white person in the White House to have real candor with white people on race."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/suicide_by_cop_the_dangerous_term_that_stops_us_from_asking_hard_questions.html	"Last week, roughly four miles from where Michael Brown had been killed by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer, two St. Louis officers shot and killed a 25-year-old black man who allegedly came at them brandishing a steak knife. ""Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me now, motherfucker!"" Kajieme Powell can be heard yelling at the cops in a cellphone video of the fatal incident. Seconds later, the officers complied with Powell's request. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, local authorities were quick to describe it as ""suicide by cop."" In some respects, the video supports such a conclusion. Powell refuses to obey the officers' commands as he moves toward them, then dares them to shoot. But the problem with the term suicide by cop is that it suggests the man's death was inevitable--that the police have no agency and could do nothing else but fire their weapons until Powell was dead. That's just not true, and we need to stop tossing around a phrase that implies that it is. The term suicide by cop was coined in 1983 by a police officer-turned-suicide hotline operator. ""As a cop, I knew of a number of cases where it appeared that people had actually forced police officers to shoot them,"" Dr. Karl Harris explained to the New York Times in 1998. ""In the suicide business I saw all the different ways people attempted suicide, and it occurred to me that maybe some people were actually forcing cops to shoot them because they wanted to die."" In the decades since, Harris' neologism has become the default description any time someone appears to goad an officer into opening fire. In 2011, authorities used it to describe an incident in which four Florida officers shot Cedric Telasco, a 21-year-old man with schizophrenia, 20 times at his front door after he called 911 to report that a man with a knife was standing in his doorway. He gave a description of himself and told the dispatcher ""just come and do what you have to do."" In 2013, a prosecutor in Washington state came to a similar conclusion after police shot and killed 28-year-old Patrick O'Meara, a suspect in a theft who was holding a metal cap gun when he died. In March, officials likewise cited suicide by cop as a motive in Sacramento after police shot and killed an unidentified 51-year-old man on the city's light rail when he allegedly lunged at them with a knife. The phrase has become so ingrained that it even comes up when cops take a suspect into custody unharmed, as they did in Centerview, Missouri, this past January after a ""highly intoxicated"" 63-year-old threatened to shoot a cop and himself. ""What I think it was, was a 'suicide by cop,' "" Sheriff Chuck Heiss told the Daily Star-Journal, describing what he believed to be the suspect's motive. It should come as no surprise that there is little concrete data available on just how many suicides by cop (or police-assisted suicides, as they are also known) occur in a given year. After all, there isn't even a definitive tally for how many total Americans the police kill each year. Still, research suggests that such incidents make up a significant slice of police shootings. In a 1998 paper published by the FBI, a trio of criminal justice experts claimed that 16 percent of all police shootings were cases of suicide by cop. A more recent study, published in the Journal of Forensic Studies in 2009, examined more than 700 officer-involved shootings in North America and classified 36 percent of them as suicides by cop. The paper also suggested that the frequency of such incidents was on the rise. Dig a little deeper into that 2009 study, however, and you see that the term is incredibly slippery. Only 30 percent of the shootings classified as suicide by cop were found to be preplanned by those who were ultimately shot by police. The remaining 70 percent were determined to be the product of a spontaneous decision made during an encounter with police. If we're considering all of these shootings to be suicide by cop, that means there is no difference between a person who, in the moment, refuses to surrender and someone who actively seeks out the police as a means to end his life. That's a distinction that absolutely has to be made. Otherwise, the phrase suicide by cop serves as a blanket excuse, a shrug of the shoulders when confronted with the worst possible outcome. In reality, these are the police encounters that need to be examined the most closely: ones in which a life may have been saved if officers made a different decision. For law enforcement and for outside observers, it can be extraordinarily difficult to determine when it's necessary to pull the trigger. That's especially true when dealing with people suffering from mental illness, as Kajieme Powell may well have been judging by his erratic, unsettled behavior. Interactions with individuals who are mentally ill are more likely to result in the use of police force, according to research cited by the FBI. It's likely no coincidence, then, that suicide by cop entered our vocabulary at the tail end of a deinstitutionalization trend that began in the 1960s. As the New Republic's Rebecca Leber and others have already detailed, police officers are typically trained to establish authority upon arriving at the scene. According to mental health experts, this is a terrible approach when dealing with someone with a mental illness. At best, standard police procedure does little to help officers deal with mentally ill suspects, victims, and ordinary citizens. At worst, the disconnect between typical law enforcement behavior and the preferred protocol for interacting with the mentally ill can turn difficult situations into tragic ones. There are special training programs to help officers deal with mentally ill people in the field. The programs--known as Crisis Intervention Teams--typically instruct officers to give such individuals more space and time than they'd normally afford suspects, and to generally use a softer touch by engaging in conversation instead of shouting commands. But to date, such programs have only been implemented in an estimated 2,700 of the nation's 18,000 police departments. And while the early returns suggest the programs help, the training can't guarantee a shooting won't happen. The Metropolitan Police Department in St. Louis told New York magazine that one of the two officers who shot Powell was indeed CIT-certified. Still, the footage of Powell's shooting suggests that this wasn't a kill-or-be-killed situation for police. While allegedly armed with a knife, Powell was not carrying a firearm. Even so, it took officers less than 16 seconds to open fire from the time they left their car. While the video of Powell's death is disturbing, I'm choosing to embed it here so you can watch it yourself and make your own judgments about the officers' actions. Given what little information they had upon arriving at the scene, it makes sense that they would have drawn their guns immediately upon their arrival. It's less clear why they opted to use their firearms instead of a nonlethal weapon like a Taser or why they didn't initially simply back away in hopes of avoiding a confrontation with a man who was not within striking distance of anyone. Police officers are put in similar positions all too often. Consider what played out this past weekend in Ottawa, Kansas, where police shot and killed 18-year-old Joseph Jennings in the parking lot of a local hardware store. Jennings was said to be suicidal and, according to his aunt, had been treated for an overdose at a nearby hospital shortly before he was killed. While the shooting is under investigation, local authorities say their officers responded appropriately given that they believed Jennings was armed. ""They reacted based upon the training that they've been given from the academy,"" Ottawa Police Chief Dennis Butler said during a weekend press conference. ""We were thankful that no officer was injured from protecting themselves from risk of great bodily harm."" The teen's family tells a different story. ""[The officers] knew him,"" Jennings' aunt, Brandy Smith, told the local paper. ""They dealt with him the day before. He was suicidal. He had only been out of the [psychiatric] hospital for three hours when they shot him. I was screaming at the top [of my] lungs, 'That's Joseph Jennings! You know him, don't shoot him!' "" We're still missing crucial details from the Kansas case--most notably whether Jennings was actually armed as the responding officers believed he was in the moment. And without a video or a fuller accounting of what happened, it's too early to pass judgment on whether the cops were justified in their use of force. But history suggests that in a case like this one, authorities will never have to differentiate between a justified shooting and an unavoidable one. That's the danger of thinking of a shooting like this one as suicide by cop: It means that nobody has to answer the difficult questions that should be asked. It's also worth pondering whether the mere existence of the term suicide by cop could play a role, however small, in these sorts of shootings. That language doesn't just take police officers off the hook in the aftermath of potentially avoidable deaths. It also gives the false impression that if police have a reason to shoot you, they automatically will. Such a notion could encourage people who are indeed suicidal to place themselves in risky, dangerous encounters with the police. As Smith said of her nephew: ""I think he was on a suicide mission."" To be clear, police officers do sometimes have little choice but to use lethal force. And we should have tremendous sympathy for those who are put in that horrible situation: Research suggests that those officers who take a life in the line of duty are more likely to suffer PTSD-like symptoms and to retire early from the force. Take the story of Los Angeles County Sherriff's Deputy Glenn Vincent, who shot and killed a 30-year-old woman who pointed a gun at his chest from close-range. Police would later discover a note in the women's car that read, in part: ""Please forgive me. My intention was never to hurt anyone. This was just a sad and sick ruse to get someone to shoot me. I'm so very sorry for pulling innocent people into this. I just didn't have the nerve to pull the trigger myself."" Cases of this sort are all the more reason to do away with a term that puts too many disparate types of police shootings on equal footing. That was a suicide by cop. The Kajieme Powell case was not. It's time we understood the difference."	"""Suicide by Cop"" Is a Horrible, Misleading Phrase. We Need to Stop Saying It."	['Harris']	['guns']

If you answered yes, then a Koch-funded think tank has exactly what you need. And it won't cost you or your school a penny. The Edvantage, a project of the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, bills itself as an online ""curriculum hub for pioneering educators."" The website offers high school teachers and college professors educational videos, articles, and podcasts on topics including economics, history, and philosophy. But as people might expect from a think tank whose board is chaired by billionaire libertarian Charles Koch, most of the project's economics content features two common themes: vilify government, promote the free market. For example, teachers using Edvantage can find economics videos explaining how the Environmental Protection Agency is bad for the environment, how sweatshops are good for third-world workers, and how the minimum wage costs workers jobs. Content featuring opposing viewpoints, however, is sparse. ""The minimum wage is supposed to help the poorer, less-skilled, and younger workers in the economy,"" says the narrator in ""The Truth About the Minimum Wage,"" a video produced by the libertarian Foundation for Economic Education and featured on Edvantage. ""But it doesn't. It gets them fired."" According to its website, Edvantage is funded by the John Templeton Foundation, whose core funding areas include ""individual freedom and free markets."" Program director Daniel Green said through a foundation spokeswoman that the two-year, $739,000 grant is meant ""to further Sir John Templeton's objective of supporting education about the enhancement of individual freedom and free markets."" In addition to funding free-market initiatives, the foundation--founded by the billionaire global investor and mutual fund pioneer--supports a variety of other causes, including ones related to science and religion. The Institute for Humane Studies, which is housed at George Mason University's campus in Arlington, Virginia, is funded largely by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. The think tank, whose mission is to advance ""a freer society,"" received $12.4 million from the Charles Koch Charitable Foundation from 2008 to 2012, according to annual tax documents. The Koch brothers appear to be on a mission to spread their libertarian message to high school and college students. In July, the Huffington Post published a story headlined, ""Koch High: How the Koch Brothers Are Buying Their Way Into the Minds of Public School Students,"" which detailed how a Koch-run nonprofit called Youth Entrepreneurs is recruiting teachers and crafting curricula favorable to the Koch's political agenda. And as the Center for Public Integrity reported in March, two of the six private charitable foundations the Koch brothers control and personally fund combined in 2012 to pump more than $12.7 million into colleges and universities. The Edvantage officially launched in October, but this is the first time it will be available to teachers for the beginning of a school year. It is unclear how many teachers and professors have used Edvantage. Scott Barton, a director of the project, declined to be interviewed for this story. In an emailed statement, he wrote, ""Resources are curated with the help of our academic editorial board to present ideas from diverse ideological perspectives."" But teachers who use Edvantage won't find much ideological balance while researching content on the website's economics pages. The educational materials selected by Edvantage for economics lessons are overwhelmingly anti-government and pro-free market. For example, a page of videos and articles on economic regulations includes videos that lament occupational licensing laws, explain how regulations are burdening food truck owners, and argue that free markets regulate product safety better than the government. Content found on pages about fiscal policy, entrepreneurship, and price controls is similarly dominated by libertarian perspectives critical of government regulation. The videos offered on the website are often clever, funny, and well-produced. Many videos are produced by Learn Liberty, a separate project of the Institute for Humane Studies that calls itself ""a resource for learning about the ideas of a free society."" One animated Learn Liberty video, titled ""How Food Regulations Make Us Less Healthy,"" explains how government red tape results in less competition and higher food safety risks. ""Is government the best way to promote food quality, health, and nutrition? I say no,"" the narrator says in the video. ""A freer market without distortions would allow consumers to buy cheaper, healthier food."" Another video features libertarian Jeffrey Tucker recalling a heart-wrenching personal story about how a small increase in the minimum wage caused his mentally disabled friend, Tad, to lose his job at a department store. ""People want to know why I'm against the minimum wage,"" a teary-eyed Tucker says in the video. ""It's because of Tad and all of the millions of other Tads out there."" Edvantage editorial board member Gailen Hite says he's ""very pleased"" with the website, but the Columbia University economics professor acknowledges that the editorial content ""is not completely balanced."" ""It's fair to say that most of us have a libertarian and market orientation,"" he said, referring to Edvantage's board members, all of whom are economists. The site's content is certainly heavy on free-market perspectives, he added, ""but that's sort of consistent with the values of the organization."" Besides, Hite said, college students could use a lesson in libertarianism. ""I don't think the libertarian perspective gets that much of an airing on college campuses,"" he said. ""We would like to have our story told, too."" This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C."

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/protest_for_robert_mcculloch_s_recusal_the_st_louis_prosecutor_is_accused.html	"CLAYTON, Missouri--Spencer Booker wants Robert McCulloch gone. ""The goal of this demonstration was to send a clear message to the governor: We don't want Mr. McCulloch on this case. Let's get a special prosecutor, and let this investigation take its course,"" said Booker, a reverend at a nearby African Methodist Episcopal church. Julia Davis was a little more emphatic. ""He's biased. He don't like us. And we will not allow another executioner, murderer to go free."" Both Davis and Booker were part of a demonstration Thursday afternoon, demanding that Gov. Jay Nixon remove McCulloch--the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County--from the investigation into the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. The protest was small--a little more than 100 people had gathered at McCulloch's Clayton, Missouri, office--but it came with wide support: Protesters and local groups have already collected 70,000 signatures calling for the prosecutor's removal. Given the essential role McCulloch will play in what is to come, these demonstrations may now be the most important protests for the people of Ferguson. McCulloch, who has held the office since 1991, insists he'll conduct a fair, evenhanded investigation. ""I appreciate and understand the concerns of those who honestly believe that I cannot or will not be fair to all in the gathering and presentation of the evidence pertaining to the tragic death of Michael Brown,"" he wrote in a statement released Thursday. ""Although I understand the concerns, and do not take lightly the demands that I recuse myself from this case, I also recognize that I have a responsibility to the family of Michael Brown, the people of Ferguson and the entire community."" But supporters of the Brown family are skeptical, pointing to McCulloch's personal and professional history. To start, he has a close familial connection to violence. In 1964 his father--a police officer--was shot and killed by a black man in a public housing complex, which critics say affects his judgment of police brutality cases. In particular, they point to a case in which McCulloch declined to bring charges against two detectives accused of excessive force in the killing of two unarmed black men. ""McCulloch's decision not to charge officers who murdered two unarmed African-American men in 2000 by shooting into their car 20 times,"" writes state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed in a letter attached to the petition, ""gives us no confidence that his office can provide a fair and impartial investigation into this current matter."" Recent comments from McCulloch add fire to the criticism. Last Thursday he blasted Nixon for replacing St. Louis County police control of the Ferguson protests with officers and leadership from the Missouri State Highway Patrol. ""It's shameful what he did today, he had no legal authority to do that,"" McCulloch said. ""To denigrate the men and women of the county police department is shameful."" And on Monday he praised police for how they've handled protests. ""The abuse that they took on that line was incredible,"" he said, in reference to the SWAT and riot teams on call in Ferguson in the early days of the protests. And while he added a caveat that the show of force may have been unnecessary as the week progressed, he didn't think police behavior was beyond the pale. ""The use of force, while they were doing it under the circumstances, I don't think was excessive,"" he said. At the moment there's no sign Nixon will replace McCulloch with a special prosecutor. ""You have a democratically elected prosecutor,"" Nixon said in a Tuesday interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""At times of stress to democracy, you need to look at the process that has served our state and country well."" And after questions over McCulloch's involvement at an impromptu press conference on Thursday, Nixon told reporters, ""[T]he best thing we could do is stay in our lanes and do our jobs."" With that said, there's a chance Nixon would bow to public pressure. After all, even with the disorder, sustained protests on West Florissant worked to force a response from the governor's office, as well as other state and federal officials. Consistent calls for a special prosecutor--in addition to regular demonstrations--could force Nixon to act. For my part, benching McCulloch makes sense. Given Missouri's extremely high bar for prosecuting police officers, odds are good for disappointment in the grand jury investigation, which began Wednesday and will conclude in the fall. Still, a world where McCulloch declines an indictment looks a lot worse to the Ferguson community than one where someone else does the same. For the sake of public peace, a special prosecutor might be worth whatever political price it costs. Read more of Slate's coverage of Ferguson."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/why_the_media_is_siding_with_the_ferguson_protesters_reporters_and_demonstrators.html	"Anyone tuning in to the nightly coverage of the protests in Ferguson has seen the reporters on the ground becoming part of the story. On Monday night, they could watch (and follow along on Twitter) as CNN's Don Lemon was shoved by police and as his colleague Jake Tapper fled tear gas. The night before MSNBC's Chris Hayes was threatened with mace and, in one of the more troubling moments caught on film since the demonstrations began, Mustafa Hussein, a journalist who has been live-streaming the unrest for Argus Radio, was warned by an officer to turn off his camera light lest he be ""shelled."" Those reporters' experiences aren't unique and in fact are less threatening than what some of their colleagues have encountered (never mind the people of Ferguson, who have faced the greatest dangers by far). At last count, at least 11 journalists have been arrested or detained in Ferguson while covering the unrest, including the Washington Post's Wesley Lowery and the Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly, who were the first high-profile media arrests when they were taken into custody while in a McDonald's. On Monday, Getty photographer Scott Olson was arrested after he ventured outside one of the pre-approved media pens that police have used to sequester reporters. All this despite President Obama twice publicly urging local authorities to let journalists do their jobs. So it comes as little surprise that some media-watchers are beginning to argue that the reporters on the ground have lost their objectivity and are now, consciously or not, aligning themselves with the protesters and against the police. As Politico's Dylan Byers put it Tuesday, ""Any journalist who stands on the front lines will inevitably be pushed, prodded or find themselves on the receiving end of a rubber bullet or tear-gas canister. In such an environment, it becomes near impossible not to identify with the protester."" Hot Air's Noah Rothman, whose piece prompted Byers' post, had gone even further. It is ""clear that the press is no longer serving as objective chroniclers of the proceedings,"" Rothman concluded after offering a few caveats about the media's right to challenge authority. ""In many ways, the media appears to believe that it is an active participant in the events in Missouri."" Those worries are valid. But missing from such handwringing about the reporters' ostensible loss of objectivity is the fact that the media had left the sidelines long before Lowery and Reilly were handcuffed. The very reason that national reporters--including Slate's Jamelle Bouie--packed their bags for Ferguson was to get answers. Answers to why a member of the Ferguson Police Department opened fire on an unarmed black teen in broad daylight. Answers to why city officials originally refused to identify the cop involved in the shooting or even say how many bullets he had fired. Answers to why police were responding to what originally were largely peaceful protests with military-grade riot gear. In short, the media descended on Ferguson looking for the same thing that had led protesters to take to the streets: the truth. That's the real reason the media is siding with the protesters: What the people in the streets of Ferguson want is the same thing the journalists were sent there to find. Depending on events, that shared goal may last for many more days or it may be fleeting. The two sides are starting to part ways slowly as an increasing (yet still small) number of protesters turns violent, a parting that will likely accelerate if and when the protesters start making specific demands. But for now, the protesters and the press have, to varying degrees, risked arrest and injury to force local authorities to be honest about what happened to Michael Brown 10 days ago. Reporters who appear to side with protesters may be failing some impossible litmus test of journalistic objectivity, but at least they're being honest about why they're there.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_protests_over_michael_brown_won_t_end_soon_the_black_community.html	"FERGUSON, Mo.--Talk to anyone in Ferguson and you'll hear a story about the police. ""One of my friends had a son killed by the Ferguson Police Department, about 10 years ago,"" said Carl Walker, a Vietnam veteran and former parole officer who came to show his support for demonstrators in Ferguson. ""They wouldn't release the name of the officer who killed him. Why wouldn't you release the name?"" ""The cops said he shot at them--case closed,"" said Al Cole, referring to a cousin who was killed by Ferguson police in 2000. ""Even as a teenager, 13 or 14 years old, I've been slammed on police cars ... now I try to avoid riding through Ferguson."" ""Some police say they saw me at a house, pulled me, said I fit a description, locked me up, and found out I was on parole,"" said Craig Beck, who was watching demonstrators under the shade of a burned-out QuikTrip convenience store. ""They said I threw a plastic baggie, which they didn't have when they took me into custody."" He continues: ""I beat the case, but you know, this isn't new. This happens every day."" Everyone--or at least, every black person--can recall an incident. Everyone can attest to friends and relatives who have been harassed, assaulted, or worse by the police. Perhaps one of the most disturbing cases was last year's shooting of Cary Ball Jr., a 25-year-old black student at St. Louis Community College-Forest Park. The official police report is that Ball crashed his car after a high-speed chase, ran away, and aimed his weapon at officers after they confronted him. Witnesses say Ball had thrown his gun to the ground and was walking toward police--hands up--when he was shot and killed with 25 rounds. A federal investigation cleared the officers. Likewise, that February, surveillance video from a casino showed St. Louis police slamming a black man's head into the bumper of a vehicle, after a dispute over gambling and trespassing. And in March of this year, a video showed St. Louis police officers beating a mentally disabled man in his home, after the family called police for help. These weren't isolated events. A 2012 report from University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist David Klinger found that, from 2008 to 2011, St. Louis police officers fired their weapons 98 times. ""Any comparison across cities right now is still missing the lion's share of circumstances in which people are shot by the police,"" Klinger said to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""There are only a smattering of cities that report their officer-involved shootings, and when compared against them, St. Louis is on the high end."" The data on police violence is incomplete, as there is no federal effort to pull together information on unjustified homicides. But the anecdotes of brutality and excessive force out of St. Louis  and St. Louis County are rampant and often startling. In 2009, for example, a man was wrongly arrested, beaten by police, and subsequently charged for bleeding on their uniforms. This abuse is so ubiquitous that the shooting of Michael Brown might seem like static against a backdrop of awfulness. But even for the area, Brown's death was brutal. Which is why--in an otherwise quiet town in an otherwise quiet area--we're dealing with an explosive fire that shows no signs of ending. By now, if you've followed the news, you know the story has two sides. Police say Brown resisted arrest and assaulted an officer. ""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" said St. Louis County police Chief Jon Belmar during a press conference after the shooting. In the official narrative, a routine stop turned into a struggle with two men, Brown and his friend. As officer Darren Wilson tried to leave his vehicle, one of the two pushed him back into the car and lunged for his gun. During the struggle, one shot was fired, and soon after, Brown was shot multiple times on the street. To the eyewitnesses, this story is nonsense. Dorian Johnson was with Brown at the time of the encounter. He was the ""other man."" In his account, the two were walking down the middle of the street, having a conversation, when Wilson--the shooter--drove down and told them to ""get the f--k off the street."" They continued, he drove off, and a few seconds later, he reversed his car in their direction and opened the door. As Johnson describes it, ""He was so close to us that [the door] ... bounced back toward him. At that point, he reached out the window and tried to choke my friend. We were trying to get away, and he tried to pull my friend into the car."" A few moments later, Wilson pulled out his gun and shot Brown, injuring him. ""We look at [Brown], he was shot and there was blood comin' from him. ... We took off running, and I hid because I feared for my life. My friend took off running, too,"" explained Johnson. Wilson then stepped out of the car, weapon drawn, and shot again. ""Once my friend felt that, he put his arms in the air, and he started to get down, but the officer still approached with the weapon drawn, and he fired several more shots, and my friend died. He didn't say anything to him, he just stood over him and kept shooting."" Another witness described a similar scene. ""I know he shot that child, and when he shot him, the little boy fell, then he shot him six more times,"" said one woman in an interview with local newscasters. To residents of Ferguson, in other words, the situation is simple. Michael Brown was executed by an angry cop. You can hear their shock and fear in a video recorded just after the shooting. ""They killed him for no reason ... they just killed this n---er for no reason,"" said one man. ""Do you see a knife? Do you see anything that would have caused a threat to these motherf--kin' police? They shot that boy because they wanted to shoot that boy in the middle of the motherf--kin' day in the middle of the motherf--kin' street."" A forthright police department could have calmed these nerves. They could have answered basic questions: Who was the shooter? How many times did he fire? What was Brown stopped for? And why did officers let his body sit in the street for four hours? Instead, led by Chief Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson Police Department stonewalled at every turn, refusing cooperation and transparency. And when residents began to gather near the site of Brown's shooting to demonstrate and memorialize, police responded with guns and dogs, sparking a cycle of protest and repression. Nightly demonstrations from residents were met with tear gas and rubber bullets by aggressive, militarized police, which sparked larger, more aggressive demonstrations and harsher, more draconian responses, justified by reports of looting and violence. After an especially bad night of clashes on Sunday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon sent the National Guard to Ferguson to attempt to keep the peace. Given frustrated residents and a recalcitrant Ferguson Police Department--which has yet to release its autopsy report--it's hard to know if calm is possible. Insofar that there's new information, it's from a private autopsy report, released on Sunday, which shows Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. And on Monday, demonstrations took another turn for the worst, as police fired tear gas into crowds, and a handful of protesters returned fire with live rounds. But while calm is hard to predict, one thing is clear: The events in Ferguson--from the shooting to the police response and everything since--are a product of familiar forces and stem from a familiar history. Put another way, the area's long-bottled racial tension has burst, and it's difficult to know if it can be resolved, much less contained. Like many American cities, St. Louis can't be untangled from segregation. In 1916, it became one of the first places to formalize racial segregation by designating particular ""Negro blocks"" where blacks would be concentrated and legally forbidden from leaving. The Supreme Court struck the ordinance in 1917, but private real estate agents and other groups responded with informal means of enforcing segregation. In 1923, the St. Louis Real Estate Exchange created zones in the city's black neighborhoods to limit the extent of black housing. Real estate agents could sell to black families inside the zones, but would lose their licenses if they sold homes outside the zones. In 1941--bolstered by federal housing discrimination--real estate agents combined these zones into a single district and adopted ""racial covenants"" that restricted or banned the sale of properties to black families outside of the district. As professor Colin Gordon of the University of Iowa wrote, ""Both the City's Real Estate Exchange and the Missouri Real Estate Commission routinely and openly interpreted sales to blacks in white areas as a form of professional misconduct,"" and by the 1940s, ""almost 380 covenants covered large and strategic swaths of the City's residential property base."" The G.I. Bill and the end of World War II sparked a massive move to the suburbs. Between 1950 and 1970, close to 60 percent of whites had moved to suburbs in the western parts of St. Louis County. Blacks --pushed by ""urban renewal"" and other policies--also moved, but restrictive covenants limited mobility to northern parts of the city and county. As the area entered the 1980s, racial succession had taken hold, as blacks entered older, inner-ring suburbs and whites left for the far reaches of the county. Depopulation accelerated--the city of St. Louis lost more than a third of its residents--and the suburban ""color line"" had drifted to include most of the North County suburbs. ""Ghetto spillover,"" said one local, noted by Gordon, ""now stretches almost all the way across the county in a northwesterly direction."" In 1990, Ferguson was 74 percent white and 25 percent black. Now, at 67 percent black and 29 percent white, it's nearly reversed. As of 2010, 42 years after Congress passed the Fair Housing Act, greater St. Louis was one of the most segregated areas in the United States. And segregation comes with a familiar set of problems. Middle-class neighborhoods--and thus middle-class services--are few and far between, with most wealth concentrated in the farther, whiter reaches of the county. As the New America Foundation's Dana Goldstein finds, the schools are in bad shape as well. Michael Brown attended Normandy High, where he was one of the 58 percent of students who graduated this year (compared with a statewide average of 80). In 2011, 98 percent of the 1,064 students at the school were black, and 74 percent were low-income. Most tellingly, 45 percent of Normandy students were suspended that year, and--given what we know about the area--there's no question some were funneled into the criminal justice system. With broad housing inequality and entrenched segregation, it shouldn't be a shock to learn that banks targeted North County--and other predominantly black areas nationwide--with subprime loans. The result was a community hit hard by the 2008 recession. The unemployment rate for blacks there is three times as high as it is for whites, and among black men aged 16 to 24, the unemployment rate is a whopping 47 percent. This high inequality is exacerbated by intense sprawl, which separates low-income residents from potential jobs. Which is to say that the same patterns of housing segregation that impede black wealth in cities like Chicago and Detroit--which top the list of segregated cities--are also operative in St. Louis. ""We're continuously economically depressed, chronically unemployed, voter participation is typically low, and on any measure of health and viability, we would be at the bottom in the most deplorable ways,"" said Etefia Umana, who sits on the board of Better Family Life, a local nonprofit, and hopes the Michael Brown demonstrations lead to broader social action. All of these ills are made worse by the absence of black political and civic representation in many of the area's 90 independent municipalities. For example, as has been widely reported, Ferguson has just one black city council member and three black police officers out of a force of 55. The mayor is white, the school superintendent is white, and the police chief is white. The disparity is easy to understand. ""North County is becoming more transient, and you have a lot of people who are moving in temporarily and moving right out,"" said Wesley Bell, a local law professor and prosecutor who ran for a seat on the St. Louis County Council this year. ""Therefore, they may not get registered, they may not get involved in local politics if they're just moving through."" Moreover, as New School professor (and former St. Louis politician) Jeff Smith explained for the New York Times, overwhelmingly white labor organizations and other groups run effective get-out-the-vote operations, which bring thousands of voters to low-turnout elections and ensure white dominance in local political bodies. It also helps that area municipal elections are held in the spring, on off years, a Progressive-era election reform that dramatically lowers turnout. In the 2012 presidential elections, turnout for Ferguson blacks was 54 percent. The next year, in municipal elections, turnout had dropped to 6 percent. An overbearing police presence is a defining feature of life in Ferguson and the rest of North County. Last year in Ferguson, 86 percent of stops, 92 percent of searches, and 93 percent of arrests involved blacks, despite the fact that police found more ""contraband"" stopping white residents than black ones. I spoke to several young men in Ferguson--all teenagers or in their early 20s--who said they were stopped on a weekly basis. At a makeshift Michael Brown memorial, I asked one 20-year-old how many times he's stopped by police, ""About 10 times a month,"" he said. Again, the forces in St. Louis are familiar. And when it comes to police, what we see in Ferguson is a microcosm of the long and contentious relationship of black Americans to law enforcement. During the first Great Migration of blacks in the early 20th century, a nascent group of black academics, lawyers, and other professionals began to study and report police violence toward blacks, prompted by the growing use of crime statistics to justify urban segregation--like the kind we see in St. Louis. ""They saw police officers as a form of state authority, and the most consistent form of government interaction for African-Americans,"" says Khalil Gibran Muhammad, director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and author of The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America. For them, police weren't civil servants as much as they were vectors for brutality, meant to isolate and contain black communities. ""Blacks were the easiest targets of the police; their rights were the least respected, and they had only a modicum of political influence to hold officers accountable,"" Muhammad wrote in his book. Criminality was well-distributed among the ethnic and racial groups of the North, but blacks were disproportionate targets for police. The result was a perception of black criminality despite the lack of clear evidence it actually existed. That trend continued into the middle of the century. ""African-Americans throughout the country confronted repressive police departments that were threatened by black demands for equality after World War II and intimidated by an expanded black populace as whites fled to the suburbs,"" University of Texas professor Leonard N. Moore noted in Black Rage in New Orleans: Police Brutality and African American Activism From World War II to Hurricane Katrina. He continued: ""[A] cursory examination of black newspapers in the postwar period reveals articles ... detailing cases of police brutality. Likewise, the archives of local and national civil rights organizations are filled with thousands of affidavits and letters relaying first-person experiences of police brutality."" One incident, the 1961 killing of 11-year-old Allen Bruce Foster in New Orleans, stands out for its brutality. As one witness described it, ""I saw the child running toward a red automobile. Just as he reached it he was shaken violently as bullets tore into his body. The boy let out a piercing scream--one I shall never forget and fell to the ground. A policeman then stooped over the boy and said, 'Why didn't you stop when I told you to halt?' The boy never answered, never moved. I never heard anyone tell the boy to halt."" What's important to understand is that these incidents and interactions reflect upon themselves. ""Too often the policeman's club is the only instrument of the law with which the Negro comes into contact,"" wrote Howard University criminologist Kelly Miller in a 1935 op-ed. ""This engenders in him a distrust and resentful attitude toward all public authorities and law officers."" If you're trying to grasp the looting that has struck Ferguson throughout the demonstrations, there's some of your answer. For as much as there are bad apples and provocateurs in any mass gathering, it's also true that there's a deep distrust of law enforcement across the black community that stems from decades of unfair treatment. ""That's our life. We black. We get pulled over everyday,"" said two young demonstrators who declined to give their names, but were adamant--as chants of ""Hands up, don't shoot"" filled the air--that they were ""out here for Michael Brown"" and ""they would do it however they [the police] wanted to do it."" Perhaps the closest analogue to the Michael Brown shooting is the Trayvon Martin killing. Both were young men in their teens, and both sparked discussions of profiling and racism. But there's a key difference. Martin wasn't killed by a police officer; his shooter was George Zimmerman, a neighbor. Which meant that, for supporters of Martin, there was a concrete goal and a clear hope: Bring Zimmerman to trial and hope he's convicted. Zimmerman wasn't convicted, but his trial brought a measure of closure to the situation. It's possible that Darren Wilson will also be arrested and go to trial. But even if he's convicted--even if the Brown family finds a measure of procedural justice--we will still be left with an unequal, segregated Ferguson in an unequal, segregated St. Louis County. The underlying problems of white flight, discrimination, and disinvestment will remain, and--absent a dramatic and unexpected change--they'll persist into the next generation. We may never see another ""Trayvon Martin"" in Sanford, Florida, but I'm positive we'll see another ""Michael Brown"" in Ferguson, Missouri. Or somewhere else. Soon enough, demonstrators will be chanting the name of another young black man killed by another agent of the state charged with containing blacks, not protecting them. We want it to be one way--a world where the police are here to serve us all--but it's the other way, a world where black bodies are the chief targets of American fear. On last Thursday, the scene West Florissant, the main site of the demonstrations, was jubilant. The streets were thick with people chanting slogans and demanding ""justice,"" while cars drove by honking in support. A gospel choir sang, and Capt. Ron Johnson--the Missouri Highway Patrol chief tasked with maintaining order--mingled with the crowd, going so far as to march with the demonstrators. By the next night, everything had fallen apart. Despite Johnson's promise, police used tear gas against protesters, prompting more anger and more destruction. On Sunday and Monday, the chaos repeated itself, with more gas and more rubber bullets. In all of the live streams and videos, one scene caught my eye. A mother stands with her son, who has just been hit with tear gas. He's 8 years old."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_national_moment_of_silence_2014_solidarity_protest_in_washington.html	A series of vigils in more than 90 cities across the country last night memorialized blacks killed by police action. Online activist Feminista Jones organized the protests, collectively called National Moment of Silence 2014, in response to the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In Washington, more than 1,000 people--brought together almost entirely through social media--chanted, shared the stories of those who have died, and debated, often heatedly, the merits of nonviolent protest against police brutality. The crowd that gathered in Meridian Hill Park (also known as Malcolm X Park) was remarkably diverse--an assembly one might call a vision of post-racial America if it weren't for the fact that it was called into being by the bluntest possible reminder that race relations in America remain fraught. The organizers there were not interested in erasing race. They were interested in creating an America where one's racial identity need not be a death sentence. As protest demands go, theirs was fairly simple: Police officers and those who imagine themselves to be police should stop killing innocent black people. As the event went on, some members of the crowd loudly voiced conflicting ideas about how to make that happen. One of the speakers berated military veterans now on police forces for staying on war footing at home. An Iraq veteran in the crowd yelled back his dissent. At several points, some voice from an unseen corner accused all assembled of cowardice and called for violent action. A newsstand of Marxist pamphlets for sale materialized. Through it all, the majority of attendees who came voiced their commitment to nonviolence and talked with strangers who often shared little else with them but the shock and grief felt watching this past week's events in Ferguson.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_police_officers_should_be_forced_to_videotape_themselves_for_our.html	"If you've ever had the distinct displeasure of calling a customer service hotline, you've probably heard a soothing voice tell you that ""this call may be monitored for quality assurance purposes."" It can be comforting to know that there is, in theory, at least, someone out there monitoring customer service representatives who make life more difficult rather than less. Customer service representatives dealing with abusive customers can take comfort in this kind of monitoring too, as it can shield them from false accusations of bad behavior. By reviewing recordings of calls gone wrong and calls gone right, meanwhile, trainees can learn from the sometimes trying experiences of others. What's not to like? Thankfully, the stakes of customer service interactions tend to be pretty low. You might think that getting a small instead of an extra-small in the mail is a bona fide calamity, but no one else does. The same can't be said about interactions between armed police officers and civilians, which can be a matter of life and death. The turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, vividly reminds us that while most of these interactions go smoothly, far too many of them spiral out of control. We know little about the exact circumstances surrounding the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. But had the police officer who shot and killed Brown been obligated to wear a video recording device, there is at least some reason to believe that Brown would still be alive. Over the past few years, the idea of requiring that police officers make use of so-called ""body cams"" has gained currency. Note that this is quite different from simply allowing civilians to record on-duty police officers, a right that shouldn't even be in dispute. Instead of waiting for a world in which every civilian records every encounter with the police, at least some students of law enforcement have argued that police forces themselves should move in this direction. Last fall, Guardian correspondent Rory Carroll reported on the small southern California city of Rialto, where the local police department has affixed small body cams to all of its officers. The results were dramatic. Carroll cites a jaw-dropping study, which found that in the year following the introduction of the body cams in February 2012, public complaints fell by 88 percent while officers' use of force fell by 60 percent. The success of the Rialto experiment makes intuitive sense. When we know that we are being observed, it affects our behavior in all kinds of ways. We become more aware of how others might judge our behavior, so we feel a not-so-subtle pressure to act in socially acceptable, rule-following ways. Moreover, the existence of a video recording allows police officers to revisit exactly how they performed in high-pressure situations. Our capacity to remember past events is notoriously faulty. There is a universal human tendency to fixate on some things while neglecting others. Video recordings can help correct for these deficiencies. In instances where something does go wrong--due to malice on the part of the police, a civilian, or something else entirely--the video provides a record that can help investigators sort out how things really came unstuck. In politically sensitive cases, in which all sides fear getting railroaded, a black box of this kind would be a godsend. Granted, Rialto is not a major metropolis, and some will no doubt dismiss the success of its body cam initiative as a fluke, or one not easily repeatable in a big, bustling city. Even Bill de Blasio, the New York City mayor who came to office on the strength of his opposition to heavy-handed stop-and-frisk policing, has hesitated to require that NYPD officers wear body cams, insisting that ""it's not something that has been perfected yet."" The American Civil Liberties Union, however, has endorsed the idea, giving it much-needed liberal street cred. And now the Michael Brown shooting has led a cavalcade of commentators, mostly but not exclusively on the left, to speak out in favor of the idea. Given time, it's easy to imagine body cams becoming standard-issue for police officers in the near future. But why stop at video recording the police? While I will happily concede that video recording is particularly important for the police, in light of their ability to use deadly force, there are many public servants who have considerable power over others and who are shielded from scrutiny in the absence of video recording. Public school teachers and administrators are the most obvious example. In March, the Justice Department issued an alarming report on racial disparities in school discipline policies. For example, while black children represent only 18 percent of all children attending preschool, 42 percent of all preschool students suspended once are black, as are 48 percent of children suspended more than once. Video recordings could surface whether teachers are systematically biased against black students, if they are disciplining students in an entirely race-neutral way, or if the truth lies somewhere in between. Investigators could identify patterns that could help inform how teachers are trained to manage their classrooms. What's more, video recording could allow teachers to evaluate their own progress, and to share their experiences with other teachers who can help them think through how to improve their performances. Teachers unions and their allies, however, are not keen on the idea of video recording. In light of the collapsing cost of collecting this data, it's hard to understand why they'd be opposed to it, particularly if the recordings are used primarily for professional development. If anything, video recording could help teachers beat back shrill accusations of incompetence and top-down, one-size-fits-all schemes for measuring effectiveness. Many teachers have, for good reason, resisted the concept of value-added assessments that rely heavily on standardized tests, preferring instead classroom evaluations that involve occasional visits from outside observers. Video recording every class session would give observers far more data to work with, thus giving them a fairer and more complete picture of how well a given teacher is doing day in and day out--not just a brief snapshot drawn from an hour or two. Some readers will surely be offended by the idea of video recording cops and teachers. You might even invoke the specter of mass surveillance or the spread of CCTV cameras, or some other outrage. I see things differently. Privacy is a wonderful thing, but on-duty police officers and teachers in classrooms are not in fact private citizens living their lives as they choose. They are public servants charged with, well, serving the public. Video recording is nothing more and nothing less than a tool for accountability. Those who use their power responsibly and who make a good-faith effort to do their jobs well have much to gain from video recording. Those who abuse their power and who otherwise cut corners will either have to shape up or answer for their actions. If you come across an argument against video recording that doesn't sound like an attempt to avoid accountability, fill me in. Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the protests in Ferguson."

Mike Huckabee did not have much to say about Iraq. It was John McCain's issue, Ron Paul's issue. The most memorable comment Huckabee had about America's war was that it had been, indeed, worth starting, and that when it came to the missing WMD, ""just because you didn't find every Easter egg didn't mean it wasn't planted."" When he arrived at the Iowa FAMiLY Leader's annual summit for social conservatives on Saturday, though, Huckabee summoned his inner hawk. Huckabee closed a half-hour speech by asking where the Obama administration had been while the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria burned through Iraq. ""There are 40,000 believers who are sitting on top of a mountain at the top of the Kurdish territory of Iraq without food or water,"" thundered Huckabee. ""And the best we have [is] a C-130 flying over, dropping a few gallons of water and some MREs. If we had good sense we would arm the Kurds, as we said we would!"" The thousand-odd social conservatives in attendance social conservatives broke into cheers--not as loud as their cheers when Sen. Ted Cruz had called for the repeal of Obamacare, but plenty loud. ""Those people, the only friends we've got in the region apart from Israel, we've left them with their pants around their ankles,"" continued Huckabee. ""We do nothing but stand back and watch ISIS use the weapons that we created. Where is the outrage in this country that we have not kept our promises to those Kurdish people?"" After a swipe at Iraq's prime minister, a ""liar,"" Huckabee praised the Kurds some more: ""They stand there tonight battling with little more than the hopes that America will once more be a nation that values people who love freedom and who love God. And why aren't we there?"" Huckabee, whose connection to the evangelical voter is near-telepathic, had found a way to describe the case for foreign intervention in a way that these voters--who also happen to be the first presidential caucus goers in the country--hadn't heard before. It had taken a while for Iowa to turn against the Iraq War, but in 2006 Democrats captured two congressional seats thanks to the backlash, while Barack Obama and John Edwards defeated Hillary Clinton in no small part because of the war. Since then, the Republican party's libertarian, America-first segment has also found fertile soil in Iowa. Ron Paul nearly won the 2012 caucus vote, and his forces went on to take over the delegation and--until this year--the whole state party. But the renewed hostilities in Iraq have rattled conservatives. At events in Iowa and at the summit this past weekend--Huckabee was joined there by fellow prospective 2016 GOP nominees Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, and Rick Santorum--Republican politicians and evangelical thinkers tried to fold the ISIS situation into various grand theories of foreign policy without bringing up how the war had started. For Huckabee, it was obvious that America had failed Christians. ""What we should and could do is help have the Kurds have their own independent country,"" Huckabee told reporters after the speech. ""What we should have [done] was a Status of Forces Agreement, which we never put it into place. The only other time we've done that was after Vietnam. It's a recipe for disaster. We should have learned that before."" Was Huckabee saying there should have been more American troops in Iraq after 2011? No, and he wasn't calling for them now. But he worried that the administration had not considered what would happen to an Iraq run by revived sectarian interests--and what had already happened. ""In 2003 there were 1.5 million Christians in Iraq,"" Huckabee said. ""Today, there are less than 400,000. It's just a terrible situation."" Did that raise any questions about whether America should have invaded Iraq? Definitely. But that's not what the gathered Republicans with national ambitions wanted to discuss. The day before the summit, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal had campaigned at a supporter's home in Knoxville, where some of the voters said they had lost friends or relatives in Iraq and feared that they'd sacrificed for naught. But Jindal avoided any talk of the origins of Iraq's latest woes. ""It is not acceptable for this radical terrorist group to, one, occupy land in Iraq and Syria and, secondly, be threatening to slaughter Christians and minorities in Iraq,"" said Jindal. Jindal ran through all of the ways the Obama administration had emboldened America's enemies. ""What I worry about,"" he said, ""is that Iran, just like Putin, just like these other countries, is watching this president's inaction."" By the weekend, this had emerged as the safest way of describing what went wrong in Iraq. It could be marched into the parade of Obama administration missteps. To do otherwise was risky--recent polling by PPP shows that Americans are glad that we didn't leave troops in Iraq. Joni Ernst, the highly touted Republican Senate candidate (and Iraq War veteran), told ABC News that what ""she would have supported is leaving additional troops in Iraq longer"" and that the Obama administration had not ""followed guidance from military leaders."" By the time Ernst got to Ames, and away from scheduled interviews, she was saying absolutely nothing about Iraq. Those who did discuss Iraq, like Huckabee, fit it into a story of Obama-driven weakness. ""Sadly, what's happening in Iraq is the latest manifestation of the failures of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy,"" said Cruz to reporters. ""The Sunnis and Shiites are fighting a sectarian civil war that has been raging for 1,500 years. They have been battling since 632. For the president to think that we can somehow cause the Sunnis and Shiites to lay down their arms, embrace, and sing 'Kumbaya' is the height of hubris and ignorance."" Like Huckabee, Cruz was deploying one of the arguments against invading that had originally been used--and dismissed--at the start of the Iraq War. (Cruz ignored a follow-up question about whether the war had been worth it.) Meanwhile, the idea of ""independent Kurdistan,"" which was poison when Democrats supported it, had now become a perfectly mainstream position to flog in Iowa. It was hard to tell what else was mainstream, though. Tony Krebsbach, a 26-year-old accountant who had been part of the Ron Paul takeover of the state party argued that what we were seeing in Iraq was predictable blowback. ""If I was living over in that country, and someone came over to 'free' me, and my family got bombed as a result, I wouldn't be sitting there okay with the whole deal,"" he said. ""That would call me to action, and not in a good way."" There was even more fatalism from the people outside the libertarian camp. During a break in the summit, over boxed lunches, a Kansas couple named Pidge and Skip Talley (nicknames, they clarified) wondered whether the airstrikes--which they agreed with--would be futile. They were both diehard fans of Joel C. Rosenberg, an author who publishes a dramatization of the end times almost every year, and they related his themes to the current situations in Iraq, Russia, Iran, and China. ""This has been going on for 3,000 years,"" said Skip Talley. ""It will go on until Christ returns."" In his own speech to the summit, Rosenberg had assured the Iraq cynics that they were right. It was not a coincidence that the ancient cities of the Levant were under attack. ""All roads seem to lead to Israel and Iraq these days,"" he said. ""In your lifetime, end times prophecy is coming true."" This was cold comfort for the people who'd been convinced to support the Iraq War more than 10 years ago. They'd backed the president. They'd been convinced of a just cause that would save lives. It was still too much to think of it as an inevitable waste. ""I honestly, truly believe there were weapons of mass destruction,"" said Pidge Talley, opening the water bottle from her lunchbox. ""The guy had seven years to move them. But I wouldn't say [we] weren't Bush fans either. We wanted Reagan reincarnated."" Talley laughed at what she'd just admitted. ""This is a Christian thing! I shouldn't say that! No, but we want Reagan cloned."""	The 2016 GOP Hopefuls Criticize Obama Over Iraq, Decline to Mention How the War Started	['Israel', 'Clinton', 'Cruz', 'Ernst', 'Paul', 'Obama']	['god']

The reddening was about at least three things at once: I felt chastened, but also puzzled and frustrated. Rosner singled out three American Jewish commentators, Jonathan Chait, Ezra Klein, and Roger Cohen, and took them to task for saying, as he put it, ""that the brutal war in Gaza has made them question their Zionism."" In the supposedly offending columns, Chait, Klein, and Cohen declared themselves Jewish supporters of Israel worried by the force used in Gaza and the lack of progress toward a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, which they attribute in part to Israel's right-tilting government. ""I want to see Israel succeed. I want to see it thrive. And that makes this moment in Israeli history painful to watch,"" Klein wrote. Chait relied on this account of the unraveling of peace negotiations to conclude that either pressure from the right or the preferences of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kept him from making a deal, and says the failure of the talks marginalized the moderate Palestinian leadership. ""Viewed in this context, the campaign of Israeli air strikes in Gaza becomes a horrifying indictment,"" he wrote.

That amounts to nearly 1 out of every 10 TV ads in the 2014 battle for the Senate, according to a new Center for Public Integrity analysis of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking service, covering spending from Jan. 1, 2013, through Sunday. The total includes the six most active nonprofit groups in the Koch brothers' coalition: Americans for Prosperity, the American Energy Alliance, Concerned Veterans for America, the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Generation Opportunity, and the 60 Plus Association. Their prominence has led to denunciations by Democrats, and praise from Republicans, as they've bombarded incumbent lawmakers with negative ads and exulted conservative challengers. No other right-leaning coalition has been as active. Even the two main big-money committees co-founded by GOP strategist Karl Rove--American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS--have only aired about half as many ads to date as these six Koch-connected groups. In all, Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers' flagship political operation, alone has aired more than 27,000 ads in a combined nine battleground states, according to Kantar Media/CMAG. Koch-connected groups reportedly intend to spend $290 million to help Republicans make gains in Congress this November. Thus far, Kantar Media/CMAG spending estimates indicate the groups have invested at least $14.5 million. That amount is undeniably a conservative estimate, as it includes only TV ad buys--not production costs or expenditures related to radio ads, online ads, direct mail, canvassers, or other activities. These so-called ""dark money"" nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their funders to federal election regulators, unlike candidates, parties, political action committees, and super PACs. And although election-related advocacy can't be the ""primary purpose"" of these groups, they've nonetheless established themselves among the nation's most powerful political forces. In Alaska, the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce has accused Democratic Sen. Mark Begich of ""standing with insurance companies"" by supporting President Barack Obama's health care reform law. Meanwhile, Generation Opportunity, a Koch group focused on millennials, has argued that Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Kay Hagan of North Carolina are ""forcing"" young adults to ""buy health insurance."" And Democrat Gary Peters has been slammed by Americans for Prosperity for supporting Obamacare, which the group contended was ""making things worse"" for Michigan families. The top six Koch-connected nonprofits have hammered Democratic Senate candidates on an ever-expanding geographic field. Through the end of August, this spending spree has included about 8,600 ads in North Carolina, 6,900 ads in Louisiana, 5,800 ads in Iowa, 4,900 ads in Michigan, 4,700 ads in Arkansas, 4,600 ads in Colorado, 3,600 ads in Alaska, and 2,400 ads in Oregon, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of Kantar Media/CMAG data. Democrats have responded in kind, using secretive nonprofit vehicles of their own. They're led by big-spending Patriot Majority USA, a ""social welfare"" nonprofit run by a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid--a pre-eminent Koch brothers naysayer who even maintains an anti-Koch page on his official Senate website. Bill Allison, editorial director of the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in government and tracks political advertising, said the Koch network is trying to make the Democratic candidates ""unacceptable to voters before Labor Day."" Allison continued: ""You only get one chance to make a first impression."" When TV viewers see these ads, said Louisiana State University political science professor Johanna Dunaway, they may not yet be ""primed enough to recognize"" the names or agendas of these conservative groups. Her own research has found that ""ads sponsored by unknown interest groups are more persuasive than those sponsored by candidates or known interest groups."" These groups' names sound ""benign and credible,"" said Dunaway. ""There's a real advantage to defining your candidate positively and your opponent negatively as early as possible,"" added Chris Mann, a political science professor at Louisiana State University. Ads from noncandidate groups, Mann continued, can help ""offset the incumbent advantage."" In more than a dozen states, the Democratic Party finds itself on the defensive, as Republicans seek to wrest control of the U.S. Senate away from them. To do so, the GOP must pick up six seats from Democrats, whose candidates, generally, have amassed a financial advantage and whose allies have fought back with TV advertisements of their own. As of midsummer, the five incumbent Democratic senators in the most contested re-election races had collectively raised more than $60 million, according to federal campaign finance filings. Their GOP opponents had collectively raised about $30 million. The most prolific of these fundraisers was Hagan of North Carolina, who, as of the end of June, had raised nearly $17 million--about 31/2 times the amount raised by her GOP opponent, Thom Tillis. Meanwhile, both Udall of Colorado and Alaska's Begich had each raised between double and triple the amounts of their Republican rivals. As of June 30, Udall had raised nearly $14 million, compared with about $5 million raised by Republican Cory Gardner. And Begich had collected roughly $8 million as of July 30, compared with about $4 million by Republican Dan Sullivan, who won a contested GOP Senate primary in late August. Koch-linked outside groups have helped Republicans cultivate support--in a profound manner. In an interview with C-SPAN last month, Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, acknowledged that ""it's very difficult to beat a sitting United States senator."" ""The incumbent Democrat senators who are up, their only chance is to make this about personalities or politics,"" he continued. ""If it's on the issues or their performance, they're probably goners."" In these battleground states, many Republicans are grateful for the outside assistance. Kermit Parks, chairman of Union County Republican Party in Arkansas, called the anti-Obamacare ads from Americans for Prosperity that criticize incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor ""money well spent."" Steve Lux, chairman of the Saline County Republican Party in Arkansas, agrees. ""Obviously everybody says they hate negative ads, but they do have an effect,"" Lux said. Democrats, though, remain defiant. ""Sen. Pryor has withstood this unprecedented onslaught and remains in a good position to win this race,"" campaign spokesman Erik Dorey said. These big-money conservative groups, Dorey added, ""don't have Arkansans' best interests at heart.""

At the forefront is the nonprofit Patriot Majority USA, which is providing Democrats with a countervailing force against the political machine of conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch. This election cycle, Patriot Majority USA has spent more than $7 million on political advertisements, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. That makes it the largest Democratic-aligned dark money operation in the country. Every dollar has fueled negative messages that call for the defeat of Republican politicians, who are seeking to pick up six Senate seats in November to win control of Congress' upper chamber and who have generally seen more support from dark money groups. The union-backed Patriot Majority USA is led by a staunch ally of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has demonized the Koch brothers as ""un-American"" and railed against ""hidden dark money which is corrupting our elections."" The Senate races raging in Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina are of particular interest to Patriot Majority USA, which has run more than 11,000 TV ads across the three states, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking service. The group has accounted for about one out of every nine ads aired in the Arkansas Senate race, one of every eight in Louisiana, and one of every 13 in North Carolina. That approaches--though does not yet match--the number of ads aired by the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity. ""They want to spend their money in places where they think they can do some good,"" said Charles Prysby, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Unlike candidates, parties, and political action committees, nonprofits such as Patriot Majority USA and the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity are not legally required to disclose their donors. But these nonprofits, frequently dubbed ""dark money"" groups, are allowed to fund advertising barrages that overtly call for the election or defeat of political candidates--or simply praise or criticize them. In Arkansas in particular, Patriot Majority USA has for months branded Rep. Tom Cotton, the GOP's Senate nominee, as ""a politician we just can't trust"" and criticized him for voting against the farm bill. Arkansas Democratic Party spokesman Patrick Burgwinkle welcomes Patriot Majority USA's participation. ""Our side will be outspent in this race,"" Burgwinkle said. ""That's why it's important to have groups hold Congressman Cotton accountable to his reckless positions."" A spokesman for Cotton did not respond to requests for comment, but the Republican has said he supported the farm bill but voted against it because Democrats included food stamp funding in the legislation. He argued the two issues should be voted upon separately, which won him praise from the conservative Club for Growth, which, at the time, said all lawmakers should vote against the ""bloated proposal."" By law, election-related expenditures cannot be the ""primary purpose"" of so-called social welfare nonprofits, such as Patriot Majority USA and Americans for Prosperity, which are organized under section 501(c)(4) of the U.S. tax code. However, thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling in 2010, they are free to spend huge amounts of money advocating for the election or defeat of federal candidates. These nonprofits are also allowed to keep the identities of their donors secret, unless a contribution is meant to fund a particular ad--something that rarely happens. Between January 2011 and December 2012, Patriot Majority USA raised roughly $26 million, according to tax records. The source of most of that money is not publicly known. But a Center for Public Integrity review of Department of Labor, FEC, and Internal Revenue Service filings shows that 13 contributors have combined to give Patriot Majority USA about $4.7 million since January 2011. Among the newly identified contributors: the Partnership for Quality Home Healthcare ($500,000), the International Longshoremen's Association PAC ($50,000), the American Health Care Association ($25,000), and the American Association for Justice PAC ($10,000). Patriot Majority USA's top known donor is the Alliance for Quality Nursing Home Care, which gave $1.25 million over two years. That health industry trade group--which last year merged with the American Health Care Association--was first identified as a contributor to Patriot Majority USA by the Center for Responsive Politics. Greg Crist, a spokesman for the American Health Care Association, declined to comment, saying, ""As a general practice, we don't comment on our political giving strategies."" Patriot Majority USA has also collected seven-figure sums from at least two labor unions: $1.14 million from the Service Employees International Union, including $280,000 from the SEIU's state council in Pennsylvania, and $1 million from the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. These large labor union contributions were first reported by the Huffington Post. In all, federal records show that labor unions have donated at least $2.5 million to Patriot Majority USA since January 2011. Craig Varoga, the president of Patriot Majority USA, declined to answer specific questions from the Center for Public Integrity, but ahead of the 2012 election, he issued a stark admonition in a column published in the trade magazine Campaigns & Elections about the post-Citizens United world. ""It does not matter whether any of us agree or disagree with current campaign finance laws, or court interpretations and FEC rulings on these laws,"" Varoga wrote. ""This brave new world is here."" Earlier this year, he reiterated to the New York Times that his group would not ""unilaterally disarm."" And as to the issue of donor disclosure? In 2012, Varoga told the Huffington Post that the funders of his organization would not be ""particularly surprising,"" but, nevertheless, they would not be revealed. Varoga himself is a veteran political strategist and longtime ally of Reid, the Senate's top Democrat. During the early 1990s, Varoga served as Reid's communications director, and in 2010, he led an independent group that helped Reid win re-election. He's also worked on the presidential campaigns of Democrats Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and John Kerry, among others. Patriot Majority USA's other directors, according to tax documents, include political consultant Joe Householder, who once worked as Hillary Clinton's communications director in the Senate, and Bill Burke, the former head of the Foundation for the Future, a Democratic-aligned group that was active in redistricting fights. Casey Mann, executive director of the North Carolina Democratic Party, understands that her party faces a dilemma over dark money. On the one hand, Mann says it is ""unfortunate"" that liberal groups like Patriot Majority USA have entered the fray to help the state's incumbent Democratic senator, Kay Hagan, ""even if it is a reaction to the conservative dark money groups."" On the other, she says she is ""grateful for their actions,"" including Patriot Majority USA's $1.7 million TV ad blitz slamming Republican candidate Thom Tillis. ""These are the rules that are set before us,"" she continued. ""You have to actually win first ... to get the kind of policies you want to see."" Mike Brown, the chairman of the Benton County Democratic Party in Arkansas, agrees. There, Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is locked in a close race with Cotton, his Republican challenger. ""You lay out rules about what's fair in a fight,"" he said. ""But if the other side starts doing it, you have to answer tit for tat."" Nevertheless, both the Pryor and Hagan campaigns have repeatedly criticized the Koch brothers' nonprofits for spending big in their Senate races. ""We can't let our Democratic Senate be bought,"" pleaded one recent fundraising email from the Pryor campaign. ""I would prefer our elections Koch-free,"" wrote Hagan in a recent campaign email of her own. ""You can't buy a democracy. But Koch-backed groups are sure giving it a try."" Ann Clemmer, a former Republican state lawmaker who now teaches political science at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, says it's ""pretty disingenuous for Democrats to cry foul"" about Republicans' big-money allies ""when there's plenty of it on their side as well."" Nevertheless, she understands Democrats' desire to fight back. ""You can't let one side do it and not answer,"" she said. ""You don't want to let charges go unanswered.""

No, no, no."" That is how Mitt Romney replied to Ashley Parker of the New York Times when she asked if he'd subject himself to the hellish torment of running for president for a third time. Despite those 11 noes, and a whole lot more in various other interviews, there is renewed speculation that Romney is at least considering another presidential run. And I for one am delighted. Though I'm not quite ready to bust out my Romney 2016 kazoo, there is a case to be made that it's time for another Romney campaign. I realize that not everyone feels this way. Ramesh Ponnuru, an old friend and colleague for whom I've been mistaken on more than one occasion, is singularly unenthusiastic about a third Romney go-around. The problem with Romney, according to Ponnuru, is that ""he never seemed to grasp the reasons the Republican Party has performed poorly in recent years,"" the main one being that many middle-income voters don't believe that the GOP cares about their economic interests. Ponnuru reminds his readers that after the 2012 election, Romney explained away the result by saying that President Obama had offered voters ""gifts,"" implying that there is something ignoble about appealing to citizens' wants and needs. Ponnuru is right. The GOP won't succeed until its candidates convince Americans that their policies will deliver upward mobility for all Americans, and not just the rich. Romney was pretty much the worst possible ambassador for a more populist conservatism, having made his fortune in the arcane world of financial engineering. When Mother Jones released a recording of Romney telling a room full of rich donors that ""there are 47 percent of voters who will vote for the president no matter what"" because they are ""dependent upon government"" and because they ""believe that they are victims,"" he profoundly damaged the conservative cause by confirming the worst suspicions of its critics. More to the point, his remarks betrayed a failure to understand that most of the ""dependent"" Americans he was writing off aspire to economic self-reliance and are exactly the kind of voters Republicans should be wooing.  Despite all of this, I have a soft spot for Romney, who has always struck me as a likable nerd, a man who spent his 20s and 30s raising a family instead of drinking and carousing. His main indulgence: eating multiple bowls of sugared cereal. Though his 47 percent remarks showed him in his worst light, his decades of charitable giving paint an entirely different picture. I tend to think that Romney's struggles in 2012 flowed from his defensiveness and his fear of alienating Tea Party conservatives he didn't truly understand. When Romney was himself, as he was during his first debate with the president, he seemed solid and self-assured. If Romney did indeed decide to run again, he'd be wise to jettison his old playbook and to instead detail how he, as a practitioner of creative destruction and disruptive innovation and all the rest, can help make these powerful economic forces work for all Americans. He could build a new presidential campaign around the need to reform and renew America's safety net, to make it fiscally sustainable while also making it more effective. Imagine if Romney, having been caricatured as a cat's-paw of the Wall Street overclass, decided to rail against the outsize power of the megabanks and in favor of a more competitive and inclusive capitalism. If we let Romney be Romney, we might find the populist the party needs. To be sure, all evidence points to the Mormon paterfamilias par excellence enjoying a long and fruitful retirement, surrounded by his ever-expanding roster of towheaded grandchildren. Indeed, if you believe Tagg Romney, the oldest of Mitt's colorfully named brood, the elder Romney didn't even want to run for president in 2012. So when Romney praises various other Republicans who are considering presidential bids of their own, we can rest assured that it's not false modesty at work. Romney really, really wants to pass the torch. But consider why Romney ran for president the last time around. Tagg suggested to the Boston Globe's Michael Kranish that his father felt that there was no other Republican contender who was capable of taking on the job of president. The GOP bench had been thinned by a series of disasters that befell several of its popular and once-popular standard-bearers, a point that Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics made convincingly in January 2012. In a slightly different universe, Republican primary voters in 2012 might have been choosing among candidates like former Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado (messy divorce), former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina (really messy divorce), then-Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana (messy divorce and remarriage to the ex-wife who had previously divorced him messily), and former Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut (federal corruption conviction). Instead, the 2012 Republican presidential field was dominated by blasts from the past like Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum, as well as a veritable cavalcade of novelty candidates destined for the infomercial circuit. Granted, the 2016 Republican field looks quite a bit stronger. In the interview with conservative impresario Hugh Hewitt that kicked off the latest round of Romney 2016 speculation, the former Massachusetts governor named his erstwhile running mate, Paul Ryan, as a great potential candidate and also touted Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Let's reflect on this list for a moment. Ryan may run for president, yet many informed observers believe he's more interested in leading policy change as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the role he's all but guaranteed in the next Congress in the likely event Republicans hold the House. Walker is in the fight of his political life and there is no guarantee that he'll still be governor in a few months' time. The Christie brand has been tarnished by Bridgegate, fairly or otherwise, and his appeal outside of Acela-land has never been tested. Jindal ranks among America's least popular governors. And even when we discount Jeb Bush's dynastic affiliation, his passionate support for Common Core and increased immigration are out of step with the conservative grass roots. Rubio stands apart as a conservative with a knack for talking about upward mobility, but his association with comprehensive immigration reform could be his undoing. There are several names Romney left conspicuously unmentioned--Texas Gov. Rick Perry comes to mind, as do Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. I find it hard to imagine that Romney would feel comfortable getting behind any one of these three. This process of elimination hardly guarantees that Romney will run for president in 2016, at which point he'll be 69 years old. But it does give him something to think about. There is precedent for a two-time loser finally winning the presidency on his third try. Ronald Reagan made a last-ditch effort to secure the GOP nomination in 1968. He nearly wrested it from an incumbent president in 1976. But it was only in 1980 that Reagan, at age 69, finally won. Of course, Reagan was famously charismatic, and he had been a conservative folk hero for years by the time he finally won the Republican nomination. The same can't be said of Romney. Nevertheless, there is something to the Reagan parallel. Though he commanded the loyalty of conservatives, Reagan was a decidedly pragmatic governor of California who acquiesced to tax increases, the liberalization of the state's abortion laws, and other measures that should by all rights have scandalized the right. By the time Reagan ran against Gerald Ford in 1976, however, he presented himself as a conservative purist, devoted to devolving power to state governments and taking a tougher line against the Soviet empire. Between 1976 and 1980, he again underwent another subtle but important shift, smoothing some of his ideological rough edges and offering a more optimistic brand of conservatism tailor-made to appeal to voters who had grown tired of Carter-era malaise. Could Mitt Romney pull off a similar feat? I wouldn't rule it out."	Mitt Romney Should Run for President in 2016. I'm Not Kidding.

But it's a real life line. It comes from a police stop in February 2013, where a Florida cop pointed his gun in a car full of black men who refused to stop filming the encounter. The men were rude, but they weren't dangerous. Nonetheless, police escalated the situation, arresting the driver and threatening the passengers. Watch the video. What's striking is the speed with which the gun comes out. In just a few seconds, one man is on the ground with an officer behind him, and the other cop is in the car brandishing a weapon, even as a passenger records the entire interaction. And this isn't unusual. It's not hard to find cases where police continued to abuse their authority, even as bystanders record their behavior. Indeed, in some cases--like the one in Florida--they become more aggressive, reacting against the cameras as if they were illegal. Chris Lollie was sitting in a public area outside First National Bank in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in January when a police officer approached and escorted him away. He recorded the encounter, which began with his explanation to the officer--he was waiting for his children to come from school--and ended with a second officer arriving to arrest him. ""Please don't touch me,"" says Lollie. ""You're going to go to jail, then,"" says the second officer. ""I'm not doing anything wrong,"" replies Lollie. Soon after, one officer pushes the cellphone away--which drops--and the other uses a Taser. ""I didn't do anything wrong. I'm a working man. I take care of my kids. And I get this?"" says Lollie to the officers. ""And you tase me. For what? I don't have any weapons. You're the ones with the weapons here."" Likewise, when Juaquez Johnson saw police punching his brother, Octavius, outside of their Omaha, Nebraska, home, he tried to record the encounter, for proof if something happened. Officers demanded the phone, and when he refused, they chased him into his home, throwing his aunt from her wheelchair, arresting him, and confiscating the phone. Charges against the Johnson brothers were eventually dropped, but the family is suing the Omaha Police Department, alleging excessive force and search and seizure without a warrant. And in Ferguson, Missouri, SWAT-clad police targeted cameras and journalists, arresting Ryan Reilly of Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post for recording several officers in a McDonald's, and using tear gas against camera crews stationed on the street. In one instance, police dismantled camera equipment after pushing out journalists with tear gas and rubber bullets. Recording police officers isn't a crime. In some states, you may have to identify yourself, but overall, everyone is free to record law enforcement. The problem is that most police weren't trained for a world where cameras are ubiquitous and almost anyone can provide documentary footage of a police encounter to media or other groups. And that lack of training can lead to tension from police, who might feel their authority is being challenged. More broadly, despite the proliferation of civilian complaint groups and internal review boards, there's shockingly little accountability for police and other law enforcement. Take police-involved deaths. According to one analysis from Talking Points Memo, indictments for police homicides are rare, and convictions almost nonexistent:"	America's Police Departments Need Greater Accountability--and It Must Come From Outside the Forces	[]	[]
19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/scott_walker_and_mary_burke_are_running_a_tight_race_the_wisconsin_governor.html	"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker may survive, but the Walker Hypothesis seems dead. In a poll released by Marquette University Law School on Wednesday, Walker's Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, has her biggest lead among likely voters, 49 percent to 47 percent. In May Burke trailed Walker 48-45, but pulled ahead by one point (47-46) in July. Walker's recent attempts to define Burke, including the risky attack on the practices of her family company, haven't appeared to work. As I wrote earlier this month, the Wisconsin governor's race touches a lot of national themes. On the Democratic side, it is a test of the strength of union forces that have branded Walker enemy No. 1 and a test of how effectively a candidate can be attacked for those who back him. (Walker has been supported by the Koch brothers.) But the biggest national test taking place in Wisconsin is a test of the Walker Hypothesis, which held that a politician who enacted conservative policies and didn't shrink from the resulting controversy would be rewarded by a wide range of voters--conservatives, but also swing voters. It was a model that conservatives offered not just for other GOP governors, but for the party's presidential candidates. With each new poll showing a close race, that hypothesis grows weaker. Walker may win (he's ahead by three points with registered voters, he's an incumbent, has lots of money and is a fierce competitor) but the polls seem pretty conclusive that it will only be through a grinding and close political battle where he relies deeply on his base. That's not how the hypothesis was supposed to work. ""Results trump everything else,"" Walker told National Review last November. ""If you deliver, voters will stick with you,"" he said during his book tour as he explained how he could capture a wide group of voters in a battleground state. Walker has been recently talking about what he has delivered and touting the state's economic record, but it hasn't improved his standing much in the polls. In fact, in this poll, 48 percent of voters say Wisconsin lags behind other Midwest states in job creation (a charge Burke has been making), which is an increase from the 43 percent who said so last month. Walker's broadsides, by contrast, don't appear to have paid off yet, which is why Democrats are happier than a two-point lead would seem to justify. They think Burke has withstood some of the strongest stuff that can be thrown at her. The biggest blow was Walker's attack on the outsourcing practices of Trek Bicycle, the company her father founded and where Burke was once an executive. Seventy-three percent of Wisconsin voters think outsourcing reduces jobs and wages of American workers. The ones who believe that strongest are in Burke's base. In such a polarized state, Walker's goal was to drive down support among his opponent's core voters. Since Burke was undefined and is running as nonideological rather than as a populist rabble-rouser, that seemed like a good bet. But the latest poll shows Burke with 89 percent support among Democrats, roughly where that number has been for the last several months. Democrats are also more enthusiastic about the contest. Eighty-two percent say they will certainly vote, whereas only 77 percent of Republicans say the same. The Wisconsin contest offers an example of a familiar campaign dynamic: Walker is racing to define his challenger before she can define herself. In March, 59 percent of state voters said they didn't know Burke, who is a first-time statewide candidate who has far less money in her campaign coffers than Walker. In July, 49 percent said the same. Now 35 percent still say they haven't heard enough about her or don't know if they have a favorable or unfavorable view of her. Because Walker is so very well known in the state--only 4 percent of voters do not have an opinion of him--and opinions about him are less likely to change than about his opponent, that put an even greater emphasis on defining Burke. In July Burke had a 26 percent favorable and 24 percent unfavorable rating. Now those numbers are 33 percent favorable and 32 percent unfavorable. Walker's hope was that the more people got to know Burke the less they would like her. That hasn't happened yet either."	Is This the Beginning of the End of the Scott Walker Experiment?

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/why_barack_obama_said_so_little_about_michael_brown_s_killing_in_ferguson.html	"Last week, the Rev. Al Sharpton called on leaders in both political parties to speak on the shooting of Michael Brown. ""Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton,"" he said, ""don't get laryngitis on this issue."" I don't have much to say about Bush, but as much as Clinton deserves criticism for her silence--even as she relies on black voters for her presidential hopes--there's one more name to add to Sharpton's list. Barack Obama. In fairness, the president hasn't been silent on Brown. He's given two statements: one after the shooting and initial demonstrations, and another after an especially violent night when police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. But both were lackluster. In the first, Obama gave a short comment on the death of Brown, ignoring the civil unrest in Ferguson. ""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" said Obama A week later the president gave a fuller statement on the situation, announcing a federal civil rights investigation of the Ferguson Police Department and giving an almost obligatory ""both sides"" condemnation of the violence. ""While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos. It undermines rather than advancing justice,"" he said. Obama ended with a brief plug for My Brother's Keeper, a White House-led program to improve outcomes for young, at-risk men of color. The program, he said, would work with the Justice Department in ""local communities to inculcate more trust, more confidence in the criminal justice system."" It's a worthy aim, but it's not relevant to Ferguson, where Michael Brown had parental guidance and a loving family, and where police mistrust came from egregious police misconduct. It's worth a comparison to Obama's 2012 remarks on Trayvon Martin. ""[M]y main message is to the parents of Trayvon. If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened."" Nowhere in his comments on Michael Brown's death do we see the same resolve, or even the same empathy. Likewise, there's nothing that echoes the broad perspective of his 2013 remarks on the George Zimmerman verdict, where he gave a personal account of racial discrimination and tried to voice the concerns of the black community. ""There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me,"" he said. ""Those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida. And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear."" The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates once wrote that Obama is the ""first president who could credibly teach a black-studies class. He is fully versed in the works of Richard Wright and James Baldwin, Frederick Douglass and Malcolm X."" From the new, nationwide conversation on police militarization to the disturbing pictures of tear-gassed protesters and civil disarray, Ferguson is probably the most important racial event of the Obama administration. In which case, why didn't Obama--elected on the promise of greater racial understanding--address it with the wisdom we know he has? Why the cautious words? One answer is that the White House is keenly aware of the president's poor standing with large parts of the public. ""[T]he White House,"" writes Vox's Ezra Klein, ""no longer believes Obama can bridge divides. They believe--with good reason--that he widens them. They learned this early in his presidency, when Obama said that the police had 'acted stupidly' when they arrested Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates on the porch of his own home. The backlash was fierce. To defuse it, Obama ended up inviting both Gates and the arresting officer for a 'beer summit' at the White House."" This is an important anecdote. Not just because it shows how Obama's interventions can be divisive, but also because it shows the fault lines for those fissures. The Gates incident marked the beginning of Obama's free fall with white voters. ""In interviews conducted Wednesday and Thursday night,"" noted the Pew Research Center at the time, ""53% of white non-Hispanics approved of Obama's overall job performance, compared with 46% of those interviewed Friday through Sunday,"" after Obama's comments blew up. ""Disapproval among whites edged up from 36% on the first two nights to 42% Friday through Sunday. And the share of whites who say they like the kind of person Obama is slipped from 75% to 69% over the same period."" A subsequent survey confirmed the results: Whites disapproved of President Obama's handling of the Gates incident, with greater disapproval among whites who heard a lot about Obama's comments. By contrast, neither blacks nor Hispanics changed their views of the president following his intervention. Polling is highly contingent, and we should be careful about drawing conclusions. Still, I think this shows something profound. By siding with the black Gates against the white police officer, Obama gave greater salience to his race. Put another way, Obama entered office as a president who was black, but ended that summer as a black president. Here's Coates again, ""The irony of Barack Obama is this: he has become the most successful black politician in American history by avoiding the radioactive racial issues of yesteryear ... and yet his indelible blackness irradiates everything he touches."" At last week's press conference on Ferguson, Obama was weary. He was tired. Part of that, I imagine, was the circumstance: yet again, an unarmed black teenager, killed on the basis of suspicion. But part of it also, I'm certain, was self-awareness. With two years left in his presidency, Obama is thoroughly racialized. There's nothing he can say on race that won't lead to rancor, fractured on racial lines. And so, he avoids the subject. For many supporters, it's frustrating. But there's a silver lining. The same president who doesn't want to talk about race has taken genuine action to combat racism. Under Obama, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is more active than it's been in a generation, fighting voter suppression and tackling lending discrimination. And most notably, it's led by an attorney general who--unlike his boss--is eager to take the stage with blunt talk on race."	Why Did Obama Say So Little About Ferguson?	['Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

In a recent Pew Research Center survey, 80 percent of blacks say that the shooting raises racial issues, compared to only 37 percent of whites. The same goes for views of police conduct toward the Ferguson protesters. Sixty-five percent of blacks say police went too far responding to protesters, compared to just 40 percent of whites. When you consider the segregated lives of most blacks and most whites, this makes sense. Most white Americans live near other white Americans, and most black Americans live among blacks. Work notwithstanding, there's not much overlap between the two worlds. ""Overall,"" writes Robert P. Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, ""the social networks of whites are a remarkable 93 percent white."" In fact, he points out, ""fully three-quarters of whites have entirely white social networks without any minority presence,"" a level of social homogeneity unmatched among other racial and ethnic groups. In which case, of course blacks and whites have different views of the Brown shooting. Separate social lives means few whites are privy to the mistrust and fear that inform the black relationship to law enforcement. Which brings us to Ferguson. Pay any attention to the lawns and storefronts near downtown, and you'll notice a new detail in the landscape: The ""I  Ferguson"" sign. You'll find a few on West Florissant, where the protests were, but they're ubiquitous around the downtown core, dotting homes and businesses as a public declaration of pride for the recently besieged town. And that's the point. The signs are a starting point for a general campaign--based in the dining room of the Corner Coffee Shop--to show a better side of Ferguson. ""Who can deny that what happened is a horrible tragedy that no one would ever, ever wish on a family, an individual, or a community?"" said Chris Shanahan, who was part of a group selling T-shirts with the ""I  Ferguson"" logo. ""I think [the T-shirts] became something to help certain people in the community remember that they still like this community despite certain things that have been shown on TV."" Behind the signs and T-shirts is Friends of the City of Ferguson, a group started by former Mayor Brian Fletcher, who held office from 2005 to 2011. ""You look at Wikipedia and go to the 'History' and Michael Brown is the whole thing,"" he said over the phone, ""We're trying to show what Ferguson is really like."" So far, Fletcher and the group have sold more than 3,000 T-shirts and raised more than $13,000, which they plan to use to help local businesses repair damage to their stores and stay in the area. Along with the rapid progress of this group's campaign is the explosive growth of the Internet fundraiser for Officer Darren Wilson. Thousands of donors have given more than $220,000 to a gofundme.com campaign for Officer Wilson, who is on paid administrative leave. The comments in support of Wilson range from banal (""This is for Darren Wilson to use in any way he sees fit"") to racially charged (""All self-respecting whites have a moral responsibility to support our growing number of martyrs to the failed experiment called diversity"") to outright racist. On Thursday, the Friends of the City of Ferguson held a public forum at First Baptist Church, where a mostly white group of supporters voiced concerns and offered ideas for progress. ""Among their less-drastic suggestions for bringing progress to the community: Holding a parade, executing a beautification project along the city's black corridor, and getting a large group to make a viral video on social media of residents taking the 'Icebucket Challenge,' "" notes Fusion's Errin Whack, who attended the event. Meanwhile, at Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church near West Florissant, a largely black group of young people and older residents discussed ideas for moving forward and changing the status quo. ""I would like to see more emphasis on investing in stock or putting your money in the bank, so that people understand you can do just as much as these white people within your community,"" said Trevor Woolfolk, a student at nearby St. Louis University. ""A year from now, I would like to see empowerment. I would like to see uplift, I would like to see consciousness,"" added Chris Walter, another student. For what it's worth, the church sits next to a small neighborhood of modest, one-story homes. The Friends of the City of Ferguson have yet to leave their mark. The two-mile drive from First Baptist to St. Mark's takes six minutes, and as far as distance goes, they're practically neighbors. But if the dueling meetings show anything, it's that they live in different worlds. White Florissant--or at least a vocal slice of it--believes the issue is image. Black Florissant, by contrast, believes the issue is justice. Read more of Slate's coverage of Ferguson."	The Two Very Different Worlds of Ferguson	['Black', 'Holding']	[]

I'm all for that. And sometimes it's necessary,"" says Robert Powell, while we stand in his garage, trying to escape the late summer heat. But, the older, longtime homeowner says, he wishes it were easier to get home past the police and the demonstrators. ""I own a home. I pay my taxes. I have my rights. I should be able to get into my house."" Powell might get his wish. On Wednesday night, the Ferguson protests--centered on West Florissant Avenue--had shrunk from large demonstrations to a relative handful of marchers, circling the length of the area, which begins at the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store and ends at the now infamous McDonald's. The air still carried slogans--""Hands up, don't shoot! No justice, no peace!""--but they were quieter and less frequent than a few days earlier. Likewise, there was still a pointed difference between daytime and nighttime protesters. During the days, the demonstrators are older and more likely to come from the surrounding neighborhoods. At night by contrast, the group skews younger, with teenagers, young adults, and a smattering of professional protesters and others from outside the community. A growing proportion of people on the street--including myself--were media and law enforcement. Blue-uniformed police officers were stationed all around West Florissant, talking to demonstrators and reminding everyone to ""keep moving""; the compromise for holding protests is that no one can congregate in a single area, a change that takes the energy out of demonstrators and precludes tension from building in groups. After a week of outrageous, disproportionate responses, police appear to have finally learned to create order without pointing weapons, using tear gas, or threatening mass arrests. And indeed, when tensions eventually flared--sparked by a pro-Darren Wilson marcher who provoked a crowd of antagonized demonstrators around her--the police responded with proportional force. They cleared the street, dispersed the group--arresting one person in the process-and moved everyone to the sidewalks. Sudden rain made the job easier, sending everyone in a scramble for shelter and prompting the police to move back to their positions--no need for officers when marchers are moving of their own accord. The story of Ferguson isn't over. There's still a lot of energy, and local activists hope to channel it into something durable and long-lasting. The Department of Justice is conducting its own investigation into Michael Brown's killing, and Attorney General Eric Holder has told reporters that--even after media leaves--he intends to ""continue the conversation this incident has sparked about the need for trust building between law enforcement officers and communities they serve."" But if Wednesday night is any indication, the large mass protests of the last week are over. Even with unanswered questions and concerns, including the whereabouts of Wilson, it seems that--barring another unexpected provocation from the authorities that upends the peace--Ferguson is beginning to return to normalcy and everything that means. On Tuesday--not far from where Brown was killed--police officers shot another young black man. The official report says they acted in self-defense. The man, 25-year-old Kajieme Powell, had allegedly taken food from a nearby convenience store, was ""acting erratically,"" and had brandished a knife, asking officers to ""Shoot me now. Kill me now."" He stepped forward, and they fired. A video--recorded by a witness--tells a slightly different story. Yes, the man was erratic, and yes, he had a knife. But police were quick on the trigger. Guns drawn, they leaped from their vehicle, barked a command--and before the man could respond--they shot. The body was handcuffed.

Partly, this is a technical issue. I own a single telephoto zoom lens, and given its length--80 to 200mm--it's not especially versatile. For most photos, I use a collection of prime lenses--15mm, 40mm, and 70mm--which covers most situations. What it means, however, is that if I want to get a portrait, or a scene, or a view of the landscape, I have to physically position myself--I can't rely on the lens to close the distance. This is fine when you're photographing protests and demonstrations. In Ferguson, Missouri, where I took these photos on Aug. 13 and 14, most people wanted media coverage and didn't complain when I was in their face, snapping away. Photographing police, on the other hand, is a different story. As we've seen, police in Ferguson aren't terribly interested in sharing their names or their faces, and get hostile--quickly--when they see cameras. Of the photos in my Ferguson collection, nine are of police. Four were taken with the zoom lens, three with the 70mm, one was with an iPhone, and one--a wide shot of police and armored vehicles--was with the 15mm. To grab that shot, ""SWAT Team, Fully Assembled,"" I had to run onto the cleared street, get extremely close to the police, and position myself to get as much of the scene as possible. The police were steadily moving forward and threatening to arrest anyone who got in their way. If you look closely, you'll see a man looking directly at me. A moment after I got close, his hand gripped his weapon. I took my photos, looked at him, and dashed off the street. To say that this was unnerving would be an understatement.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_police_reform_how_the_justice_department_could_revamp_the_ferguson.html	"President Obama on Monday announced that he will send Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson, Missouri. America's top law enforcement official will meet with FBI agents conducting the civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed, black 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer a little more than a week ago. The investigation into Brown's death--which will include a federal autopsy of his body--is expected to take some time. But its end will likely only mark the beginning of a larger probe into the Ferguson Police Department, which has seemingly gone out of its way to stoke protesters' anger by refusing to clarify the circumstances of the shooting, and by greeting the originally peaceful protests with military-grade riot gear. Any meaningful reconciliation to the chaos and conflict provoked by this episode will have to include reform of the Ferguson Police Department. But how could that be done? How do you fix a police department that has proven it can't police itself? If Holder concludes that there has been a pattern of misconduct by the police--either in the lead-up to Brown's death or in its aftermath--the president has the ability to force widespread reforms within the department with the help of a law passed in the wake of the Rodney King beating. The provision in question, part of what was officially known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, is ""one of the most significant"" pieces of civil rights legislation passed in the latter part of the 20th century, and also one of the most ""overlooked,"" according to Joe Domanick, the associate director of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice's Center on Media, Crime, and Justice. The law gives the federal government two options: It can either formally pursue a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Ferguson Police Department by alleging a ""pattern and practice"" of misconduct or the administration and city officials can enter into what is known as a ""consent decree"" that would mandate a specific set of reforms that would then be overseen by an independent court-appointed monitor. Faced with the possibility of a costly court battle, most cities have historically taken the path of least resistance and signed on the decree's dotted lines. Ferguson officials probably wouldn't buck that trend. According to Samuel Walker, the emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, such an outcome is ""the best hope we have"" for turning around the troubled department. The reforms that normally accompany a consent decree ""really get at the critical issue here, which is the culture of the department,"" Walker says. ""Day in and day out, what do officers know they have to do and what do they know that they can get away with?"" For evidence of what happens when a department has a culture where officers have no reason to believe there is serious oversight, Walker didn't need to dive far into the Ferguson timeline for Exhibit A--a video clip recorded this past weekend that captured a police officer shouting, ""Bring it, all you fucking animals! Bring it!"" at protesters. ""If they know they can get away with that type of language, that really defines the culture of the department,"" Walker says. ""You need to change the way that [officers] think and act so they know they can't do policing the way they are used to doing it."" So what would such a consent decree actually look like in Ferguson? Each settlement is unique, but generally speaking they last a minimum of five years and ensure that the reform process is a public one. The agreed upon reforms have historically covered three main areas, according to Walker: overhauling of the department's use-of-force policies, including how such incidents are investigated internally; enacting an early intervention system that relies on a variety of data, ranging from citizen complaints against an officer to the demographics of his or her traffic stops; and creating a clear, open process through which citizens can lodge complaints when they feel they've been mistreated. All three seem necessary in the wake of what we've learned about Ferguson in the past week. In the past two decades, more than 20 cities have entered into such agreements with the federal government, both in big cities like Los Angeles and New Orleans and in smaller ones closer in size to Ferguson, places like East Haven, Connecticut, and Steubenville, Ohio. The results are mixed. Reforms are often slowed when local officials fail to buy in fully to the need for change and resist. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, for example, unsuccessfully tried to appeal a pair of decrees covering Orleans Parish Prison and his city's police department, arguing the city didn't have the money it would take to pay for the reforms. And as Domanick recounted earlier this summer, police in Cincinnati were so uncooperative during the time they were undergoing reforms that on ""at least one occasion the monitor was actually kicked out of police headquarters."" Still, there is evidence that real reform is possible, even if it takes time. The best-documented example of such an effort succeeding is, somewhat remarkably, in Los Angeles, where the beating of King by police helped prompt passage of the federal law in the first place. The city signed its consent decree in 2000 following a particularly shameful stretch that included both the King beating and the Rampart scandal that saw scores of officers affiliated with the department's anti-gang efforts implicated in a variety of misconduct. Before the decade came to a close, however, there were already signs of significant improvement. An independent study published in 2009 by a trio of researchers at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government found rather stunning results. ""Policing in Los Angeles today is noticeably different from what it was only a few years ago,"" the authors wrote then. ""The quality of service to residents is higher, the perception of the LAPD as fair has risen, and the use of force is down."" The numbers behind that conclusion tell an even stronger story, most notably this one: 83 percent of residents said that the police department was doing a good or excellent job. That, again, was less than two decades after residents watched in horror as news stations broadcast a home video of a group of LAPD officers beating an unarmed King nearly to death. Still, the LAPD reforms did not happen overnight and the reform of the Ferguson Police Department, if it ever happens, would likewise take years. And even if that were to happen there is no guarantee that any changes that are enacted will become permanent. ""Once the monitor goes away, will these reforms have been institutionalized? Can [police departments] sustain these reforms?"" says Walker of the problems facing any reformed department, not just a hypothetical Ferguson. ""We need to make sure that these things last."""

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/ferguson_libertarians_have_been_leading_the_charge_against_the_militarization.html	"In December 2012, when Washington's press corps was peering over the ""fiscal cliff,"" Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn released a report that looked and sounded too goofy to be real. The cover of ""Safety at Any Price: Assessing the Impact of Homeland Security Spending on U.S. Cities"" portrayed a child-size drone flying near the Capitol; over ATV-driving Lego men; and, for some reason, over R2D2. ""If in the days after 9/11 lawmakers were able to cast their gaze forward ten years,"" wrote Coburn, ""I imagine they would be surprised to see how a counter-terrorism initiative aimed at protecting our largest cities has transformed into another parochial grant program."" His researchers had dug up dozens of examples and told the story of how local police forces started to look like occupying armies, thanks to $35 billion in Department of Homeland Security grants. Seattle had spent $80,000 on a drone, which it insisted was not a drone. Pittsburgh had spent $90,000 on a sonic cannon, and used it to break up G-20 protests, though a SWAT officer assured a reporter that the device was just ""a speaker that delivers an intended message to an intended group of people to disperse."" And then there were the armored vehicles. Police departments in less-than-bustling towns suddenly needed $250,000 armored BearCats. ""Because Fontana, California considers itself a 'top 100 terrorist target,' "" wrote Coburn's researchers, ""it needed a BearCat."" In New Hampshire, the libertarians of Keene had been fighting, unsuccessfully, a police department that wanted a BearCat to guard an annual harvest celebration. ""Do I think al-Qaida is going to target Pumpkin Fest?"" Keene's police chief asked, rhetorically. ""No, but are there fringe groups that want to make a statement? Yes."" There were no attacks, and there was little coverage of Coburn's report. Gene Healy, a vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute, publicized Coburn's findings in a column. Radley Balko, a former Huffington Post reporter who'd worked with Healy at Cato (and, full disclosure, with me at Reason), praised the report, which touched on stories he'd covered, like the BearCat fight in Keene. Coburn appeared on Neil Cavuto's Fox Business show (not to be confused with the more widely watched Fox News shows), where the discussion quickly veered from the report's highlights (""zombie apocalypse training"") to the more exciting fiscal cliff. Attacking the military buildup of local police, on its own, was just too kooky. What a difference Ferguson makes. This week, when Sen. Rand Paul published a brief op-ed denouncing ""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars,"" he conquered the headlines. The New York Times, which had just published an epic story about libertarians, offered that ""conservatives tend to be fairly consistent"" on law and order, and Paul was acting as a disrupter. ""Rand Paul is right,"" argued Al Sharpton, who is more familiar with being labeled an ""outside agitator"" by conservatives than with complimenting them. But libertarians and libertarian-leaning Republicans have been attacking the militarization of police forces for the better part of a decade. They come at the issue from a stronger ideological position than the left does, or can. Decades of tough-on-crime policies have made the right (and libertarians are part of the right) less vulnerable to charges of softness and thug-coddling. And the libertarian answer to crime has never been about empowering the police. In the ideal liberal scenario--call it ""Japan"" or ""any part of Europe""-- civilians have as much access to firearms as they have to rocket launchers and ICBMs. In the libertarian ideal, the state has no more firepower to control civilians than the civilians have to police themselves, or to fight back. It's hard to date when the backlash began, or when it became mainstream, but 1989 is a good time to start. That was a hot year for the crack wars, not long before Washington Mayor Marion Barry was arrested with a pipe in the room, and the year Congress' National Defense Authorization Act added Section 1208. The new NDAA language authorized the transfer of excess military equipment ""suitable for use"" in ""counter-drug activities."" In 1989, that meant almost anything. The first time many Americans realized that was in August 1992, when the ATF, FBI, Border Patrol, U.S. Marshals, Idaho National Guard, Idaho state police, and local police laid siege to Randy Weaver's home in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, with assault weapons and night-vision goggles. The siege started with the deaths of Weaver's son and one of the dogs, and the Weaver family would eventually settle for more than $3 million. But less than a year later, some of the same agencies (and some of the same agents, as Radley Balko points out in Rise of the Warrior Cop) raided David Koresh's compound outside Waco, Texas, smashing the walls with tanks and shooting 350 rounds of tear gas inside. Seventy-six people died. But Bill Clinton was in the White House. The gun control lobby was experiencing what would be, in retrospect, its finest hour--the passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which banned the sale of ""assault weapons"" until 2004. As conservatives and libertarians saw it, and as the gun lobby saw it, the government was arming a police state while making it illegal and impossible for citizens to defend themselves from tyranny. ""Not too long ago, it was unthinkable for federal agents wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens,"" read a 1995 National Rifle Association fundraising letter signed by Wayne LaPierre. ""Not today."" You can draw a straight line from that letter to, this week, WorldNetDaily posting photos of American cops who look like they're breaking up rallies in Tahrir Square. After the events of this week, the right-wingers who'd been warning about fat contracts arming thuggish police departments are suddenly finding themselves in step with the left. But it's the right-wingers who might be the best political allies that Ferguson's black protesters have. Like Trayvon Martin's Florida, like John Crawford's Ohio, Michael Brown's Missouri is governed by a Republican legislature that has gerrymandered itself into at least another decade of power. State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, who represents Ferguson and live-tweeted her tear-gassing by police, is one of 10 Democrats outnumbered by 24 Republicans. Florida's Dream Defenders, who occupied the state Capitol to demand a second look at ""stand your ground"" law, made up no ground at all with the conservative legislators. But the Dream Defenders have common cause with libertarians. In Keene, for example, the movement to stop the BearCat sale--""tanks, but no tanks""--was led by libertarians who ideally wanted a cop-free city. Pete Eyre, who once aspired to become a police officer, became a libertarian instead, and ended up in Keene after touring the country in an RV to make movies about freedom. ""On the road, we just happened to have interactions with police employees, and it seemed clear that they didn't like being filmed,"" Eyre told me. ""It became clear that capturing the truth of the situation might be powerful."" That revelation led Eyre to co-found CopBlock, which encourages citizens to film the police--an action that got two reporters illegally arrested in Ferguson, piling outrage on top of the outrage. It also led to Eyre's lobbying (""there were songs, music videos, petitions"") against the BearCat, which became enough of an early warning signal to make it into a Republican senator's paper about post-9/11 police militarization. ""As people start to film what they see and pursue tactics that are peaceful,"" said Eyre, ""ultimately these incidents will continue to happen until the institution of policing, which is a coercive monopoly, is denied legitimacy. Badges don't grant extra rights. If an action's unlawful for me or you, it's unlawful for anyone."" That's further than many liberals would be willing to go, obviously. And they're not going to stop campaigning for gun control. But if they want to stop police departments from turning into shoot-first armies, the libertarians have been waiting for them. In June, 18 months after the Coburn report, the New York Times' Matt Apuzzo published a wide-ranging study of what military equipment was making it to the sheriff's office and how. In Morgan County, Indiana, the police acquired an MRAP because, in one sergeant's words, ""a lot of people who are coming out of the military that have the ability and knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law-enforcement techniques."" If that sounded familiar, it may have been because in April 2009 the DHS released a report warning that the fringe was rising and that ""rightwing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to exploit their skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat."" This was just days before the first big national wave of Tea Party rallies, and to the horror of progressives, some activists showed up with signs that dared the DHS to go after ""rightwing extremists"" like them. Five years later, the progressives still disagree with the right-wingers. They still reject, as insane, the idea that a heavily armed citizenry might be safer than a country where the cops have the guns. But they suddenly agree about something.

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/police_in_ferguson_military_weapons_threaten_protesters.html	"The most striking photographs from Ferguson, Missouri, aren't of Saturday's demonstrations or Sunday night's riots; they're of the police. Image after image shows officers clad in Kevlar vests, helmets, and camouflage, armed with pistols, shotguns, automatic rifles, and tear gas. In one photo, protesters stand toe-to-toe with baton-wielding riot police, in another, an unarmed man faces several cops, each with rifles at the ready. What's more, Ferguson police have used armored vehicles to show force and control crowds. In one photo, riot gear-clad officers are standing in front of a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, barking commands and launching tear gas into groups of demonstrators and journalists. This would be one thing if Ferguson were in a war zone, or if protesters were violent--although, it's hard to imagine a situation in which American police would need a mine-resistant vehicle. But an episode of looting aside, Ferguson police aren't dealing with any particular danger. Nonetheless, they're treating demonstrators--and Ferguson residents writ large--as a population to occupy, not citizens to protect. This is part of a broader problem. In his book The Rise of the Warrior Cop, journalist Radley Balko notes that since the 1960s, ""law-enforcement agencies across the U.S., at every level of government, have been blurring the line between police officer and soldier. Driven by martial rhetoric and the availability of military-style equipment--from bayonets and M-16 rifles to armored personnel carriers--American police forces have often adopted a mind-set previously reserved for the battlefield."" This process ramped up with the ""war on drugs"" in the 1980s and 1990s, as the federal government supplied local and state police forces with military-grade weaponry to clamp down on drug trafficking and other crime. And it accelerated again after the 9/11 attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when the federal government had--and sent--billions in surplus military equipment to state and local governments. Since 2006, according to an analysis by the New York Times, police departments have acquired 435 armored vehicles, 533 planes, 93,763 machine guns, and 432 mine-resistant armored trucks. Overall, since Congress established its program to transfer military hardware, local and state police departments have received $4.3 billion worth of equipment. Accordingly, the value of military equipment used by these police agencies has increased from $1 million in 1990 to $324 million in 1995 (shortly after the program was established), to nearly $450 million in 2013. At the same time as crime has fallen to its lowest levels in decades, police departments are acquiring more hardware and finding more reasons to use SWAT teams and other heavy-handed tactics, regardless of the situation. According to an American Civil Liberties Union report released this summer, 79 percent of SWAT deployments from 2011 to 2012 were for search warrants, a massive overreaction that can have disastrous consequences, including injury and death. That was the case for Aiyana Stanley-Jones, who was killed during a SWAT raid by the Detroit police department. Serving a search warrant for an occupant of the house, Detroit police rushed in with flash bangs and ballistic shields. When one resident tried to grab an officer's gun, it fired, striking Aiyana. She was 7. If you know anything about the racial disparities in the criminal justice system, then it also shouldn't shock you to learn that SWAT deployments are used disproportionately in black and Latino neighborhoods. The ACLU finds that 50 percent of those impacted by SWAT deployments were black and Latino. Of these deployments, 68 percent were for drug searches. And a substantial number of drug searches--60 percent--involved violent tactics to force entry, which lead predictably and avoidably to senseless injury and death. The fact that police are eager to use their new weapons and vehicles isn't a surprise. As the New York Times notes, ""The ubiquity of SWAT teams has changed not only the way officers look, but also the way departments view themselves. Recruiting videos feature clips of officers storming into homes with smoke grenades and firing automatic weapons."" Put simply, when you give anyone toys, you have to expect they'll play with them. That is how we get images like the ones in Ferguson, where police officers brandish heavy weapons and act as an occupying force. We should expect as much when we give police departments military weapons. Already--when it comes to predominantly black and brown communities--there's a long-standing culture of aggressive, punitive policing. Add assault weapons and armored vehicles, and you have a recipe for the repressive, violent reactions that we see in Ferguson, and that are likely inevitable in countless other poor American neighborhoods."

Like yours, my face reddened when I read Shmuel Rosner's op-ed, but I suspect for different reasons. As an Israeli, I found his article patronizing, illogical, and, frankly, infuriating. Let's start with the one thing he gets right: It's true that a vast majority of Israelis, myself included, believed that the country was justified in forcefully reacting to Hamas' current acts of aggression. A reality of rocket barrages and the threat of underground tunnels leading straight into Israeli territory are not things that a country can, or should, be expected to overlook. But this doesn't mean that the government now gets carte blanche to pursue reckless and corrosive policies. Since when do we exclude any kind of critical reflection? Is the fabric of our democracy really so fragile that we can't accept pointed criticism? Rosner writes: ""There's no doubt that many liberal Jews feel uncomfortable with Israel."" But what he neglects to say is that there's a difference between being uncomfortable with Israel and being uncomfortable with the current Israeli government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doesn't represent all ""the Jews,"" or even all of Israel, for that matter. That's why we have a parliament, an opposition, and a vibrant democracy. Yes, there was overwhelming support for the current operation, but that doesn't mean that our prime minister's lack of vision for the future shouldn't be called into question. As the historian Zeev Sternhell said in a recent interview: ""Those in power don't need more power. They need criticism. They need a mirror."" In his conversation with you, Rosner said that the Israeli left has not come out against the operation. That is inaccurate: Meretz chairwoman Zehava Gal-On called the ground offensive a ""big mistake."" As for ""lefties"" like Amos Oz? Oz called this operation ""justified but excessive."" That, as far as I can tell, is the same line of argument being raised by the American Jewish liberals whom Rosner dismisses off-handedly. So is it OK for Israelis to bring up objections, but not for American Jews? Where do we draw the line? Rosner seemed to backtrack somewhat from his article when he emphasized to you the notion of ""bad timing,"" saying that it wasn't the nature of the criticism that angered him but the fact that it had been voiced during a time of crisis. But I find this reasoning even more curious, especially coming from a journalist. When should we be ""allowed"" to voice legitimate opposition to government policies if not as these policies are being implemented? If we're really expected to wait for peaceful times when it comes to Israel, we may well be holding our breaths indefinitely. But there's something else I wanted to ask you, and it has to do with his idea of a ""gamble."" Rosner writes: ""I would never expect Israelis to gamble on our security and our lives for the sake of accommodating the political sensitivities of people who live far away."" Reading his article, I couldn't help thinking that the one who's doing the real gambling here is him. Is he really suggesting that Israel turn its back on our one major ally in the world--the United States? Who was it exactly who invested in Iron Dome, the missile defense system that intercepted 90 percent of the rockets aimed at Israel in the current conflict, if not the Obama administration? There's no doubt that Israel's deterrence power stems, in large part, from the United States. Countries hostile to Israel know that in the case of a full-fledged war, the U.S. will always have Israel's back. Is he really willing to sever this bond? Seems to me that by pulling this ""We don't need you"" card, Rosner is the one gambling away on Israel's security, and, in doing so, he certainly doesn't stand for me. Do you think American Jews should be more careful in their criticism so that it might not be mistaken for a willingness to ""gamble"" with Israel's future? And what do you make of this idea that we're all one family and therefore American Jewish support of Israel should be unconditional?"	Criticizing Israel	['Israel', 'Obama']	[]

In this Slate Plus podcast extra, Slate's Will Saletan and Mark Joseph Stern revisit a debate they explored over a series of posts in March. Here are a few of the links mentioned in their discussion:	When Slate Writers Disagree: Stern and Saletan Revisit a Debate About Bigotry (Audio)	[]	['gay']
