The emotions I most closely associate with this campaign season are, in no particular order, dread, despair, rage, and mournful resignation. So to my surprise, there was a spring in my step as I headed to my polling place, located in a public housing complex a few blocks from my apartment. No, I'm under no illusion that Cruz will win the New York primary outright. Donald Trump is quite popular among Republicans in New York. Almost every recent survey has him comfortably above the all-important 50 percent marker statewide, which means he is all but certain to win the lion's share of New York's delegates. I'm nevertheless holding out hope that I will be able, in my own infinitesimally small way, to help deny Trump one of the three delegates that my congressional district, New York's 10th, will send to the Republican National Convention. Why Cruz? Did I vote for him because I find him charming and approachable? No, I'm afraid that's not it. Cruz struggles in personality contests for the obvious reason that he is impressively unappealing. Let us not forget that Cruz's remaining opponents for the GOP presidential nomination are Trump, a blowhard who has literally made a career out of lying about the size of his fortune, and the petulant John Kasich, who would be one of the world's most boring men if he didn't also have an explosive and easily triggered temper. Somehow, among these paragons of human excellence, Cruz strikes many voters as the least likable of them all. If it's not Cruz's winning personality that's led me to him, what is it? The first and most obvious reason I backed the Texas senator is that he is the only Republican left in the race who can defeat Trump. John Kasich has bested Trump in exactly one state, Ohio, where he has been governor for more than five years, and he has failed to broaden his appeal among non-Ohio Republicans in the weeks since--despite having ample opportunity to do so. Kasich's team has betrayed a failure to grasp the basics of how delegates are allocated, and for that reason alone he should go mutter to himself in a corner somewhere and leave the rest of us alone. The same can't be said of the Cruz crew. Cruz has run a disciplined, focused, and tenacious campaign, which has been causing Trump fits. Most recently, Trump has been crying foul over the fact that Cruz has outmaneuvered him in recent state conventions and caucuses in Wyoming and Colorado. One is reminded of a particularly choice Trump bon mot from August, when he told CNN's Chris Cuomo, ""I am a whiner, and I keep whining and whining until I win."" Though I wouldn't say that Cruz is immune to the whining impulse, he generally takes a different approach: He keeps organizing and organizing until he wins. I admire that. There is another reason I support Cruz: Like a large majority of GOP voters, I favor stronger border enforcement and a reduction in less-skilled immigration. Why would I favor Cruz over Trump on this front, given that Trump has made building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border his highest policy priority? While Trump's champions insist their candidate has shifted the mainstream conversation on immigration to the right, I would argue that his noxious tone has made it much harder for immigration hawks to win new allies. Some voters who might have otherwise been open to a more selective immigration policy have recoiled from Trump's thinly veiled appeals to racial and ethnic resentment. As long as Trump is the most visible figure on the anti-immigration right, partisans of more permissive immigration policies will have the upper hand. Leaving aside Trump's incendiary rhetoric, his approach to immigration policy is confused, contradictory, and often quite stupid. His campaign has issued policy papers outlining one position on, say, skilled immigrant workers only to have Trump take an entirely different stance in his public utterances. Trump has called for establishing a new ""deportation force"" that captures and removes all unauthorized immigrants from the country, a process that would prove quite expensive and contentious. But he has also said he'd like to allow ""the good ones"" back into the country. Why go through all that trouble if you intend to put in place what immigration hawks have dubbed a ""touchback amnesty""? What separates the good ones from the bad ones? Trump has failed to clarify these matters, most likely because he's just making things up as he goes along. Critics of touchback amnesty tend to favor Cruz's position, which is that governments at all levels should more rigorously enforce immigration laws, which in turn will encourage unauthorized immigrants to return to their native countries. In recent years, slightly more Mexican nationals have been returning to Mexico from the U.S. than moving in the other direction, a return migration that Cruz's ""attrition through enforcement"" policy could accelerate. Though I don't agree with every aspect of Cruz's position on immigration, it has the virtue of being coherent and defensible, something that can't be said of Trump's. Finally, I voted for Cruz because I believe a Cruz nomination will be far better for the longterm health of the Republican Party than a Trump nomination. Trump has drawn attention to the yawning chasm separating grassroots Republican voters from the elected officials who represent them and the donors who finance GOP campaigns. He has demonstrated that there is a large and receptive audience for populism among Republicans, and future candidates will do their best to appeal to this audience. For all his faults, Cruz has tried to fuse elements of this new populism, from opposition to mass immigration to a deep cynicism about big business, to his more traditional constitutional conservatism. Cruz's conservative populism might not be the best way forward for Republicans. My own view is that the party needs to go much further in embracing a modernized safety net and in putting the interests of working- and middle-income voters ahead of the rich and the connected. But there is no doubt in my mind that Cruzism is a better foundation for the party's future than Trump's odious authoritarianism. That's why I voted for Ted Cruz, and that's why I'm hoping my fellow New Yorkers did the same. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	Why I Was Delighted to Vote for Ted Cruz in the New York Republican Primary	['Cruz', 'Trump', 'Kasich']	[]
1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/bernie_sanders_deep_south_excuse_doesn_t_hold_up.html	"As the Democratic primary turns into its final stretch, Bernie Sanders, his advisers, and his surrogates are making a three-step argument to remaining primary voters and uncommitted Democratic elites that suggests either a deliberate misreading of his party's electoral base in the South or genuine ignorance. Whatever the case, Team Bernie seems to be working from some long-expired premises about the nature of the Southern electorate, which today is neither white nor conservative. First, the argument goes, the senator has momentum. ""And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people, and doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination,"" said Sanders near the conclusion of Thursday's debate in Brooklyn, New York. Second, this is why ""superdelegates""--uncommitted delegates who can support either candidate--should back the senator if Hillary Clinton doesn't win the nomination outright. ""Nobody is going to arrive in Philadelphia with enough delegates to win the nomination,"" said Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver in an interview with NPR. ""[I]t looks like the Democrats are going into an open convention as well."" There's a problem. Even if Clinton doesn't reach the delegate threshold, she'll likely still have more votes and delegates than Sanders. To throw the nomination to the runner-up using superdelegates would be to play the same undemocratic game he decried earlier in the process. But Team Sanders has a response. ""Her grasp now on the nomination is almost entirely on the basis of victories where Bernie Sanders did not compete,"" said senior strategist Tad Devine in a March conference call with reporters, listing eight states in the South: Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas. Clinton, Devine continued, ""has emerged as a weak frontrunner."" ""Well, you know,"" said Bernie Sanders on Wednesday, responding to Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore, who asked if he thought the process was ""rigged,"" ""people say, 'Why does Iowa go first, why does New Hampshire go first?' but I think that having so many Southern states go first kind of distorts reality as well."" He continued, pivoting to superdelegates, ""When a lot of these so-called superdelegates begin to see which candidate is the strongest candidate ... I think some of these guys are going to be coming our way."" Sanders took this line again at Thursday's debate. ""Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true. Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South. No question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. That's the fact."" Between the three statements, the Sanders argument is clear: Yes, Hillary Clinton has more votes and more delegates, and will likely have more votes and more delegates when voting ends. But she won those votes and those delegates in conservative states where Sanders was weak and didn't compete. If you ignore them--or at least, if you give them an asterisk--then she's weaker than she looks. So far, so good, right? Not at all. To start, this is a bit hypocritical. Sanders has won seven of the past eight contests, but four of those wins came in states so Republican that they've backed a Democrat only once in the past 60 years: Idaho, Utah, Alaska, and Wyoming. If the South's conservatism is reason to discount Clinton's success there, then the same is true for Sanders vis a vis his wins in the Mountain West and elsewhere. There's also the simple fact that the primary calendar did not begin with the Deep South, which usually includes Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and adjacent parts in other states, like the Florida panhandle, East Texas, and parts of Tennessee. The only Deep South states that voted in the first few weeks were Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana. Other Southern states, like Virginia, Arkansas, and Tennessee, were a little more hospitable to Sanders. If the argument is that Sanders would have done better under a different calendar, that doesn't hold up, either. The most diverse states with representative populations and general-election significance--Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri, Illinois--are also friendly to Clinton. And broadly, a primary scheme that starts with large states is also one that disadvantages insurgent candidates like Sanders, who don't begin the process with the same resources and support. That the Democratic primaries began with Iowa and New Hampshire was a great stroke of luck for Sanders, given his coalition and early challenges. Which gets to the largest--and most troubling--problem with the ""Deep South"" arguments from Bernie Sanders and his campaign. In the popular imagination, Southern Democrats are still ""good 'ol boys"" and wealthy elites--the Bill Clintons and (for a fictional version) the Frank Underwoods of the world. In reality, those Democrats have long since died or left the party. The typical Southern Democrat of 2016--and of 2008, and even of 2004--is black; the typical Southern Democratic voter is a black woman in middle age; and the Democratic electorate in the Deep South is largely black. The primaries bear this out. In South Carolina, blacks were 61 percent of all voters. In Alabama, they were 54 percent; in Georgia, 51 percent; in Mississippi, 71 percent. We don't have exit polls for Louisiana, but given its large black population and racially polarized politics, it's a reasonable guess that most of the Democratic voters in that primary were black as well. At the same time that the Democratic Party of the South has become, for the most part, a black party, the ideological distance between congressional Democrats in the North and South has also shrunk, with little difference between the two. The reason is straightforward. Across racial and economic issues, black Americans are more liberal, as a group, than their white counterparts, and this is reflected in their choice of representatives, who stand on the left side of the House Democratic Caucus. Blacks are more conservative on social issues--a function of high religiosity--but those are less salient than economic and civil rights concerns. Black voters are far from a monolith--as evidenced by Sanders' significant support among young black voters and slightly higher support among blacks outside the South--but dismissing the South is dismissing where they hold the most significance. Again, the primary results give a glimpse into the ideological composition of the Democratic South. In the states with the largest black voting populations--South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi--an average of 54 percent of voters identify as ""very"" or ""somewhat"" liberal. For the four of the whitest primary states--Massachusetts, Michigan, Vermont and Washington--that number is 67 percent. Sanders' geographic base is more liberal than Clinton's, but it's a difference of degree, not of kind. It is also true, as Phillip Bump demonstrates for the Washington Post, that on questions of government and its role in society, Democrats agree regardless of region. On the issue where Sanders is most liberal, Southern Democrats are no less likely to agree than any of their peers. As long as you grasp that Southern Democrats are black ones, this is easy to understand, albeit inconvenient for Team Sanders' claim that he is the actual choice of the Democratic base. It is too much to say that Sanders is deliberately dismissing black voters. But that's the effect of his argument, and the impact goes beyond the Democratic primary. The rise of the black Southern Democrat is also the decline of the white one. There was a time when black politicians in the South could govern with white ones to reach common goals. It's gone. Now, in Republican-dominated Southern states, blacks are almost shut out of power. It's how we get voter-suppression laws North Carolina. It's why the Medicaid expansion--funded under the Affordable Care Act--is still absent from most of the states of the former Confederacy. Worse, because they live in red states, most black Southern Democrats are ignored in the general presidential election, and get little attention in off-year races. The Democratic presidential primary is the one time, once every four years, when they have a voice, and it's a powerful one. To dismiss it is to disrespect the most loyal and perhaps most vital part of the Democratic coalition--a group that sustains progressive politics in some of the most reactionary parts of the country. If the moral argument doesn't move you, try the strategic one. For as much as Democrats talk about Texas or Arizona as future opportunities, the better and more immediate bets are North Carolina and Georgia, where demographic change is shrinking the Republican advantage year after year. In 2008, black Democrats joined with Latinos and liberal whites to turn the state blue, and it was competitive again in 2012. This year, if Donald Trump is the nominee, there's a good chance that North Carolina goes blue again, and brings Georgia with it. If Bernie Sanders wants to bring about a political revolution, he should refrain from spurning the Democrats who are most likely to make it happen.

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/donald_trump_s_exit_strategy_should_he_lose_the_republican_nomination.html	"One of the reasons that so many incorrect political observers (including myself) assumed Donald Trump wouldn't actually run for president was that he wouldn't be able to cope with certain loss. Early last year when he was considering a run, he was registering nothing in the polls and his favorability ratings were comically poor among Republicans and the general population alike. Since he was going to lose everything, and by a lot, what would be his exit strategy from the race? Wouldn't he have to quit by, say, December, after getting some good publicity but before real voting commenced, so he could lie about how he could have won the presidency but didn't feel like it? As I was saying: incorrect. Trump will almost certainly finish primary season with the most votes, states won, and delegates to his name. But he has not won anything since Arizona's primary on March 22 and, in the meantime, he has lost the Wisconsin primary and has been outhustled on the ground by Sen. Ted Cruz in Colorado's convention delegate hunt. His disorganization in selecting loyal convention delegates from the states he's already won means he has little chance of winning the nomination if it extends beyond a first convention ballot, and winning on the first ballot will likely rest on his ability to woo some not-insignificant number of scattered unbound delegates to his corner. Though the next stretch of contests are favorable to Trump, the possibility that he does not become the nominee despite having the most votes, states won, and delegates to his name has emerged, setting up the likelihood of a lively Republican National Convention in Cleveland. After all that, it returns us to that original question: How would Donald Trump cope with a loss, or as he might call it were anyone else in his shoes at this point, a ""choking?"" How would he spin such a convention defeat to prevent his brand and his legacy--because he has earned himself a sizable legacy in modern American political history, regardless of what happens next--from forever being associated not just with defeat, but with an inability to close out the greatest deal of his life? This eventuality is what he seems to be planning for, consciously or subconsciously, if you read anything into his recent bromides against the ""rigged"" system of delegate selection, formalized Thursday in an extremely ghostwritten column for the Wall Street Journal. In it, he attacks the idiosyncratic Colorado delegate selection process. Republican insiders have treated this as nothing more than whining. The rules were put in place last year, they say; if he didn't prepare, then he has no grounds on which to take issue. To his supporters, though, these complaints ring quite true. And they have a point. Why couldn't Colorado have just held a primary instead of skipping straight to district and state conventions that allow in-the-know types to dominate? Was 34 delegates for Ted Cruz, however impressive a feat of organization, really the most accurate representation of Colorado Republicans' political preferences? Trump is cleverly trying to spin his apparent lack of organization into a virtue of his candidacy: that the rules are complicated by design to prevent an outsider from succeeding. ""In recent days, something all too predictable has happened: Politicians furiously defended the system,"" the writer writing under the name of ""Donald J. Trump"" explains in the Journal.  "" 'These are the rules,' we were told over and over again. If the 'rules' can be used to block Coloradans from voting on whether they want better trade deals, or stronger borders, or an end to special-interest vote-buying in Congress--well, that's just the system and we should embrace it."" ""Let me ask America a question,"" the writer continues. ""How has the 'system' been working out for you and your family?"" The column goes on to introduce a new campaign promise. If president, Trump will ""work closely with the chairman of the Republican National Committee and top GOP officials to reform our election policies. Together, we will restore the faith--and the franchise--of the American people."" (Presumably there are few plans within either the Trump camp or RNC to cease real disenfranchisement efforts, but that's another story.) It's useful to read this column and listen to the rest of his ravings about the flawed process as him articulating his contingency plan in the event of a loss. In such an event, he would argue that the party used every trick it could muster to stop him, the people's choice, from winning the nomination. In this, he would be right and wrong. The party will have used every trick it had to stop him. But that he has gotten as far as he has demonstrates the dearth of tricks available to the party, since winner-take-all or winner-take-most rules frequently allowed him to turn his narrow pluralities into majority delegate pickups. Trump may be denied the nomination, but that won't stop him from saying he won it anyway. He will argue until his death that he actually is the rightful GOP nominee but that the RNC pulled some rules run-around on him to deny him his crown. Trump should be able to successfully spin that to his need, and his need is simply to avoid being labeled a choker every place he goes for the rest of his life. What it doesn't mean, though, is that he would be a gracious loser in defeat (not that anyone is expecting this), or urge his supporters to move on and to back the eventual nominee. That would not help his brand, and the brand comes first. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	Donald Trump Has Started to Lay Out His Exit Strategy Should He Lose the Nomination	['Cruz', 'Trump']	[]
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/bernie_sanders_has_framed_the_debate.html	"""History has outpaced Secretary Clinton,"" said Bernie Sanders, the 74-year-old socialist senator from Vermont who often appears to have stumbled out of the pages of a crumbling paperback history of 1930s radicalism. But appearances can shortchange as well as deceive: From the moment that his campaign kicked into high gear more than six months ago, Sanders has captured the radicalized spirit of a Democratic Party that is increasingly attentive to the appeal of economic populism and to the realities of racial injustice. During CNN's Democratic debate on Thursday night, while the candidates ricocheted between discussions of global warming as the primary threat to America and whether to raise the minimum wage to $12 or to $15, it was hard not to feel that Sanders had won a battle almost as large as the race to be the 2016 nominee. ""I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism,"" Clinton stated Thursday night in one of many statements that would cause a time-traveler from the 1990s to stare with open-mouthed astonishment. Indeed, the debate functioned as a fascinating window into Democratic politics in 2016. Even a mere eight years ago, Obama and Clinton often struggled to outflank each other on the right. (Think of the skirmishes over the individual mandate.) But on nearly every domestic issue, both candidates went left, strongly so, and from health care to college tuition to Social Security, Clinton played on Sanders' turf. Even her critiques of Sanders' spending focused not on the deficit but on Sanders' general sloppiness with numbers. Most of the debate thus settled into a routine in which both candidates used their time to fortify their progressive bona fides. Sanders' weakest issue remains gun control, where his record is relatively moderate. Clinton still makes a dog's breakfast of any answer regarding her speeches, such as the one to Goldman Sachs. (Sanders needs to develop a better response to the perfectly reasonable question of how Clinton's donations and Wall Street connections have influenced her as a policymaker. He might've mentioned bankruptcy reform.) And everyone in the Brooklyn audience cheered anything even resembling an applause line--""Let's talk about judgment""--and I was reminded yet again that the crowds are the most annoying thing about these debates not named Wolf Blitzer. The one area where the pattern shifted was foreign policy. Clinton remains stuck in the 1990s paradigm that she has otherwise discarded, at least rhetorically. On Libya and Syria, Clinton took a more hawkish line, as she did as secretary of state, and was (for her) surprisingly unfocused and even a little shameless. Her claim that the United States did plenty to provide for Libyans after the NATO bombing campaign is, er, questionable. The debate lingered for a long moment on the subject of Israel, and the more Clinton talked, the more she sounded like a back issue of Commentary. She blamed the Palestinians for the failed Camp David negotiations in 2000. ""If Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the late 1990s to the offer that Prime Minister [Ehud] Barak put on the table,"" she said, ""we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years already."" Sanders, however, mounted a stronger, more rousing defense of Palestinian rights than I can remember hearing from a major presidential candidate. There were real differences to dwell on here, although Bernie's suspension of his progressive new Jewish outreach director, announced shortly before the debate amid considerable hue and cry, suggested that the Democratic Party isn't as eager to follow him to the left on Israel as it has been on domestic issues. (Still, the fact that the subject was debated so heartily is itself a sign of at least some change within the Democratic Party.) The irony of his campaign is that the septuagenarian Sanders is probably four or eight years ahead of his time, rather than behind it. In some ways Sanders was lucky in his opponent. He wound up getting paired against someone who happens to be on the wrong end of the prevailing trends in the party--hawkish; friendly to Wall Street; an almost perfect embodiment of that otherwise nebulous term, the establishment. Despite these advantages--not to mention a fundraising prowess that must surprise even him--Sanders is still facing an almost impossibly narrow path to the nomination, and this debate was unlikely to widen it much. Clinton's support among minority voters, not to mention the large margins she ran up in many Southern states, are almost certain to ensure her victory. But she is not only a different candidate and political figure from the Hillary of 2008; she is significantly, ideologically distinct from where she was in 2015, and in the general election she will likely be running on a platform as progressive as the Democratic Party has had in many years. Clinton will surely move quickly and decisively to the right once she officially vanquishes Sanders, but the triumph of the Bernie insurgency is that to get back to the center now, she has so much farther to run.

Though Bernie Sanders has won seven consecutive nominating contests since late March, Hillary Clinton maintains a solid delegate lead. FiveThirtyEight puts her chance of winning New York at 98 percent. There are no further debates scheduled, so this could be the final showdown between the two candidates. The generally civil tone of the Democratic race has frayed a bit since the last debate.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/terrorism_myths_debunked_do_attacks_really_come_in_bunches.html	"Within hours of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels, New York City authorities deployed roughly 400 National Guard troops at major transit hubs, and transit police in Washington ordered a surge at Metro stops. The Metro's police tweeted reassuringly that it was ""closely monitoring events in Brussels w/our fed partners."" Visibly surging security personnel in urban centers after a major terrorist incident has become a habitual response around the globe since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington, putting citizens on edge and occasionally causing policing expenses to spike. But it turns out there's little evidence that such an aggressive public response is necessary, according to a new report by terrorism experts at the Rand Corporation. The experts studied 140,000 terror attacks in the United States and Europe between 1970 and 2013 and found no statistically significant evidence after 2003 that one big attack will spawn another one immediately afterward, producing a ""cluster"" of related incidents. ""Visible increases in security reflect prudence, but also suggest that there is reason to worry about further terrorist attacks,"" experts Brian Jenkins, Henry Willis, and Bing Han wrote in their report, published on March 31. But since 2003, they said, terrorist attacks in Western countries have actually not been occurring in clusters, which they define as falling within a 30-day period. The incidents studied were listed in a global database of terrorism events that produced at least one fatality. The database was compiled from open sources by the University of Maryland. Before 2003, some terrorist attacks did occur in clusters, suggesting that officials in Europe and the United States might now be reacting reflexively to a pattern that is no longer prevalent. The Provisional Irish Republican Army, for example, carried out clusters of attacks in Ireland and the United Kingdom in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and the Basque separatist group in Spain known as ETA carried out clusters of attacks starting in the 1970s. But the clustering phenomenon started to drop off by 1993, and now there is no statistical evidence that a large terrorist attack will trigger or inspire another attack. ""Jihadists have not been able to field groups in the United States or Europe that are capable of sustaining terrorist campaigns like those that operated in Europe from the 1970s to the early 1990s or in the United States primarily during the 1970s,"" the authors explain. The report also disputes another commonly held view about the timing of terrorist attacks. Terrorists generally have not attacked on symbolically important dates in the U.S. and Europe. While attacks increased slightly on dates around Independence Day and New Year's Eve, the evidence did not show any increased likelihood of attacks on anniversaries such as Sept. 11 or other symbolic dates such as Ramadan or Christmas. Some experts who study terrorism say they doubt that terrorists keep a calendar. Attacks are timed when those involved conclude they will be successful. The Rand authors state that Independence Day and New Year's Eve, for instance, draw large crowds that represent a vulnerable target. A third, surprising argument in the report is that terrorism in the West has been declining. The incidence of attacks decreased roughly 94 percent between 1976 and 2013, the Rand tally showed, again reflecting the different capabilities of European paramilitary groups and present-day jihadis. At the same time, the deadliness of recent attacks has increased. The scale of the Sept. 11 attacks was ""unprecedented."" And since then, the proportion of incidents with more than three fatalities has increased. Some experts said they didn't take much comfort from the new report. With respect to ""some of the European [jihadi] plotters who were captured, we now know that they had been planning a series of attacks. It calls into question how reliable this finding is,"" said Jessica Stern, a research professor at Boston University's Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies who has interviewed terrorists and written several books on their motivations. The Rand authors acknowledged that they could not rule out that police surges had deterred some coordinated or copycat attacks. And they also warned that the future might not be like the past: ""It's important to monitor"" whether terrorism related to the Islamic State will be different, said Willis, director of the Rand Corporation's Homeland Security and Defense Center and one of the study authors, in an interview. Stern said that there's some evidence of a shift already. ""Most of the attacks we've seen until now carried out in ISIS's name are not the kind of attack we would expect to be clustering--they're individuals who radicalize themselves or small groups that seem to have minimal if any contact with ISIS. ... [But] the kind of attacks we've seen in Paris and Belgium are not that kind. They involved highly trained operatives, and they're part of a plot that's a broader attack."" Belgian authorities have reported in recent days that those involved in the Paris attacks were planning additional bombings there--months later--but undertook the March 22 attacks in Brussels instead because they feared that police were closing in. This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/hillary_clinton_s_superdelegate_problem.html	"Donald Trump's struggles with the delegate selection process, which has led him to believe that the nominating process is ""rigged"" against him, have of late given him a sort of one-sided kinship with Sen. Bernie Sanders. ""I'm no fan of Bernie Sanders, OK, I'm no fan at all,"" Trump said during his Tuesday town hall with CNN. ""But every time I turn on, he's winning, he's winning. Every week after week, he wins, he wins, he wins, he wins. And then I watch you and I watch all of the pundits, they say, but he can't win. You know why?"" Why, Donald? ""It's stacked against him. It really is. It's stacked against him. In his case, it's superdelegates."" We already knew that Donald Trump didn't have a strong understanding of Republican delegate allocation. Now we know that his grasp of the Democratic process isn't so sharp either. Sanders is not losing because of superdelegates. Clinton leads him by 251 pledged delegates, according to the Associated Press' count, a much wider lead than then-Sen. Barack Obama ever held over her in 2008. Unless Sanders can somehow shift the ground and pick up significant wins in the large remaining nominating contests of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and especially California, he will not come anywhere close to making up the pledged-delegate deficit. The Sanders campaign's recognition of its narrow window for overtaking the pledged-delegate lead, combined with its interest in still winning the nomination, has led to some ... mixed messaging on superdelegates, to put it politely. In February--before Clinton had taken her sizable pledged delegate lead--Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said on MSNBC that ""if the people in the states choose Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton, I cannot imagine that the superdelegates would overturn the will of the people in this case."" These days, the Sanders campaign is acknowledging that its strategy for winning the nomination, if it doesn't get the pledged-delegate lead, rests on swaying to its side both outstanding and Clinton-supporting superdelegates up to and potentially through the convention vote. The Sanders campaign may be trying to have it both ways on superdelegates, but getting called out on this doesn't seem to stop them from doing so. This creates a problem for the Clinton campaign: Though Clinton will almost certainly end primary season with a safe pledged-delegate lead, the race has been close enough that it's much less likely she'll end up with a majority of delegates through pledged delegates alone. In 2008, Obama wound up about 350 delegates short of winning the majority on pledged delegates alone. Clinton could have taken her fight all the way to convention balloting had she wanted to give herself more time to wheedle superdelegates. But it was very clear that wasn't going to happen. So she dropped out and, at the convention, instructed her pledged delegates to support Obama in a show of unity. It's possible that Sanders would do what Clinton did in 2008 if he loses the final pledged-delegate count. Campaigns, including Clinton's in 2008, have a tendency to promise that they'll fight all the way to the convention as a means of rallying supporters, but once the voters have finished voting, they call it a day. But Hillary Clinton in 2008 was a much different person than Bernie Sanders is in 2016. She was, and is, a party player, and taking her doomed fight to the convention in 2008 would have crippled her legacy within the party and her chances for running again in the future. Sanders, as the Clinton campaign likes to point out, is much less a party man, and he's also in his mid-70s, meaning it's highly unlikely that he would run for president again. What does he have to lose by contesting the convention other than the admiration of his peers, which he never had in the first place? Good lord, would the people who run the Democratic Party loathe him if he did this. His challenge would obstruct Clinton's four-day PR showcase. It would hamper her efforts to bring Sanders supporters into the fold before November. It would get in the way, basically, and draw media attention away from the Republicans' own historically nightmarish spectacle. Maybe, then, the anger that Democratic Party leaders would feel would finally provide the impetus needed to kill off superdelegates. Sanders would show that superdelegates, instead of saving the party from electoral disaster, instead make it easier for an outsider candidate to cause problems. Democrats created superdelegates to give party leaders a final check over nominations after the reforms of the 1970s, in their opinion, gave too much power to primary voters. But the superdelegate trigger has never been pulled. Voters have always chosen nominees that the party deems acceptable, and it would destroy the party if superdelegates ever did overturn the clear preference of the voters. What superdelegates have done is dilute the pool of pledged delegates and make it that much harder for the leading candidate to compile a delegate majority solely from pledged delegates. That in turn gives someone like, say, Bernie Sanders a justification for extending his fight into the convention if he's willing to shatter certain norms of intra-party etiquette. And as you've probably noticed, norms aren't doing so hot in politics these days. The Democratic Party establishment--and I don't necessarily mean ""establishment"" in a pejorative way; it's simply the best description of what superdelegates are as a collective--won't kill off their special convention votes for nothing. One fancies it would be nice to have a special convention vote, after all. But if Sanders' crusade proves that superdelegates just make the process more aggravating for the party, maybe that will be enough to bury them, or at least slash their number.

They're also not the wave of delegates who, in state after state, have made it clear that they'll support Sen. Ted Cruz if they become unbound on later ballots at July's Republican National Convention. The most important figures right now are the delegates who will be unbound on the first ballot of the convention and will effectively hold veto power over whether Donald Trump is the party's nominee. And there will be 54 of these delegates from Pennsylvania alone, making the Keystone State's delegation some of the most critical individuals at the convention. Given the tightness of the presidential race, Pennsylvania's quirky Republican primary system affords the state's delegates the most nominating leverage they've had in 40 years. Republican voters on April 26 will choose a presidential candidate to first determine the winner of the 17 bound, statewide delegates. But the 54 delegates allocated by congressional district will be voted on separately--without any candidate preference listed next to delegate candidates' names. This means the district delegate winners will be true wild cards--not bound to the candidate preferences of the men and women in their state or districts--and the targets of serious persuasion efforts from the campaigns of Trump, Cruz, and John Kasich through the first ballot vote in Cleveland. The good news for Trump is that he's comfortably leading in Pennsylvania, and many of the delegate candidates are saying they'll vote in Cleveland according to their districts' wishes. In a Pittsburgh Tribune-Review survey of the 162 delegate candidates on the ballot (to which 127 have responded), 67 have said that they'll vote on the first ballot for whoever wins their districts. If Trump trounces his competition in the state, he'll likely win the lion's share of its 18 congressional districts and the support of many of these unbound delegates promising to obey the will of the voters. The bad news for Trump, however, is that many of those delegate candidates who've pledged to support the winner of their districts may not hold to that position under the spotlight of a national convention--whether they honestly believe they will now or not. ""That's the position I've taken. I think that's the logical position, but whether or not that actually happens is another thing altogether,"" said Charlie Gerow, a Republican operative and delegate candidate in the 4th District. ""There's going to be tremendous pressure put on the folks who are elected on April 26 in every direction, and where they ultimately end up is going to be very interesting."" These ""folks""--including Gerow--aren't lying about their commitment to support the winner of their districts, he said. Gerow just ""knows how these things go."" John Schnaedter, executive director of the Allegheny County Republican Party, agreed that these survey pledges don't mean much--and may just be part of electoral strategy. ""Because [the delegates] are being elected, they're watching what they say. They don't want to turn anybody off,"" he said. ""They're being kind of vague as to who they actually really want to support, just so they don't alienate any kind of potential voters."" How do voters even go about choosing delegates with no candidate affiliation next to their names? In districts like the 12th, which has 15 candidates for three slots, it's mostly about ballot placement and name recognition within Republican political circles. ""I think Dave Majernik has a really good shot ... because he's the vice chair of the [Allegheny County Republican Party] and also he's [listed] second [on the ballot],"" Schnaedter said. Two candidates, Bob Howard and Jill Cooper, he added, are lower on the ballot (13th in Howard's case and third in Cooper's) but have similarly good chances because of name recognition alone. ""If I were to bet,"" he said, ""I would guarantee that two of those three make it, if not three of those three."" Of the three candidates Schnaedter says has the best shot of representing the 12th, he believes all of them are supporting Cruz. ""They're probably not admitting it, but I know they are,"" he said. Howard, Cooper, and Majernik have all pledged to support the winner of their districts on the first ballot. Other districts are far less competitive. The 14th District, for example, has only three candidates for its three delegate positions. It's not surprising, then, that each of the candidates' public position is ""uncommitted,"" since these candidates don't need to make any tiresome pledges to voters to respect their wishes in order to get elected. ""I'm talking to lots of folks. I'm listening. I certainly will weigh what the voters do in my district. I'll certainly look to what the voters do statewide,"" said Mike DeVanney, a Republican strategist in Pittsburgh and one of the 14th District's three candidates (e.g. one of the eventual delegates). ""But I also recognize, as someone who's independently elected, that I have a responsibility for my vote at the convention to help nominate a candidate who can ultimately win in November, and also someone who I think can articulate a Republican message and grow our party."" DeVanney was originally a Marco Rubio supporter and served as a regional state finance chair for the Florida senator's now-suspended presidential campaign. Mary Ann Meloy, a former official in the Reagan White House and another 14th District delegate candidate who was also originally a Rubio supporter, said she has a ""sacred"" duty to support a candidate who can win in November. Both believe that the Rubio campaign was easily the best organized in Pennsylvania, and Rubio's original delegate recruits will comprise a significant bloc of the delegates elected later this month. ""None of the campaigns were organized in Pennsylvania except the Rubio campaign,"" DeVanney said. ""We knew the rules. So we recruited a lot of Rubio's [most prominent] supporters to run for delegate. Frankly that was how I ended up on the ballot."" Rubio's Pennsylvania operation was "" very thoughtful"" of whom they recruited--people with relatively high name recognition, for example. ""I am still very confident that a large number of people like me, who had Rubio as a first preference, are going to be victorious,"" he added. None of these ex-Rubio supporters would say it explicitly, but the subtext here is pretty obvious: If the Rubio campaign had scooped up many of the most recognizable delegate candidates in each district, then these candidates were probably not likely to shift their support to the likes of Trump. They ""believe the same things that Marco Rubio believes, about America and the party and anything else,"" said Chris Bravacos, another Pennsylvania Republican operative who chaired Rubio's campaign in the state. In other words, with a few exceptions, these likely delegates probably consider Trump an unelectable con man who's destroying the party. Bravacos has a list of all the delegate candidates the Rubio campaign recruited in each district but declined to share it with Slate, lest it affect those candidates' ongoing campaigns. Gerow, on the other hand, scoffed at the idea that the Pennsylvania delegation will be chock full of stealth Rubio exiles. ""Mike [DeVanney] is a guy I respect,"" Gerow said, laughing, but DeVanney and the rest of Rubio's statewide operation ""are reaching back to pat themselves on the back after their candidate's off the ballot."" Gerow doesn't deny, however, that much of Pennsylvania's slate of unbound district delegate candidates might not vote with the current runaway leader in the state. ""Looking up and down the list of delegate candidates, and I have done that,"" he said, ""I don't see a lot of support for Donald Trump among the people who are running."" And come July, those 54 men and women could make all the difference between a first-ballot Trump nomination and an open convention. See more of Slate's Republican primary coverage."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/trump_probably_won_t_be_the_nominee_how_will_the_gop_get_rid_of_him.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. When my son was in the third grade, I went ice skating with his grammar school at the Wollman Rink in Central Park. On a weekday morning, the children had the place all to themselves. After a spell of skating, they took a break for hot cocoa while the ice was cleaned. But as they got ready to return, a rostrum was pushed out on to the ice. From behind it, an enormous orange-haired man in a double-breasted overcoat began boasting about how he had overcome the incompetents in city government to restore the facility in the 1980s. He seemed unaware that he was lecturing an audience of 8- and 9-year-olds. After a time, the children began to chant, ""We want to skate! We want to skate!"" Oblivious, Donald Trump continued his monologue. Members of the Republican Party are now facing a version of this same problem: How do we get this megalomaniac off the ice? Trump suffered his worst defeat on Tuesday when he lost the Wisconsin primary to Ted Cruz by 13 points. This capped off seven days that began with Trump's campaign manager being charged with battery for manhandling a female reporter at one of his events in Florida; continued with his saying that ""there has to be some form of punishment"" for women who have abortions; and culminated in his refusal to forswear the use of nuclear weapons in Europe or the Middle East. Pundits who underestimated Trump's potential last autumn have been hesitant to come out and state what has now become apparent: He is probably not going to be the Republican nominee after all. Even if he wins the New York primary next week, and others in the Northeast the following week, it is unlikely that he can gain the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination on the first ballot at the Republican convention. And if he does not win on the first ballot, Trump won't win it at all--because the GOP doesn't want to nominate someone who is certain to be clobbered by Hillary Clinton and to drag the Republicans down to defeat in state and congressional races. It turns out there is no convention rule requiring the party to commit suicide simply to serve Trump's egomania. Trump's reaction to the Republican Party's late scramble to reject him is much like the one he gave to my son's schoolmates: Who cares what you want? As the Wisconsin results came in, he was apparently in too deep a sulk, or too purple a rage, to deliver even a pro forma concession speech. Instead, his campaign released an unhinged statement about ""Lyin' Ted Cruz,"" calling him ""worse than a puppet"" and a ""Trojan horse"" for the party bosses who were ""attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump."" Attempting to steal the nomination is despot-speak for daring to challenge him in an election. Trump is now a wounded animal, and as hunters know, these can be the most dangerous kind. The Republican Party will have to use care in depriving him of a prize that he thinks belongs to him by rights. The best-case scenario for the GOP would be Trump facing facts and backing out of the primary before the Cleveland convention in mid-July. Narcissists like Trump cannot tolerate defeat, because their self-worth is bound up in the idea that they are winners. ""My life is about victories,"" he told the journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in a jaw-dropping interview. ""When I do something, I win."" Faced with defeat he may prefer to walk away, declaring the grapes sour and the game rigged while preserving his belief in himself as someone who never loses. In some ways, an establishment conspiracy to deny him the nomination gives him the exit strategy he sorely needs. Even if he goes without a fight, Trump may have changed the GOP forever by exposing the vast gap between white working-class Republican voters and the party leadership. The legacy of his campaign may be a split into two parties, or at least two distinct factions--one nationalistic, nativist, and antitrade; the other internationalist, pro-immigration, and pro-corporate. More immediately, Republicans face a possible Samson scenario in which Trump tears the party down around him. This is the course he has implicitly threatened by warning of riots if he arrives in Cleveland with the most delegates and is denied the nomination. It would not take much for him to instigate violence at the convention. The rabble that he has roused seems to crave it as a forbidden form of political expression. A rebellion will be harder to pull off if the party comes together around Cruz on a second ballot, as opposed to a backroom deal to nominate House Speaker Paul Ryan or another candidate who didn't run in the primaries. The only thing worse for the GOP than chaos in Cleveland would be a third-party campaign by a vindictive Trump. If he waits until the convention, it would be hard for him to secure ballot access as an independent in several key states. But even as a write-in candidate, he would draw significant votes from the Republican nominee, ensuring a Democratic victory. If rejection propels Trump to play spoiler for his party, he has the means to do so. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	Trump Probably Won't Be the Nominee.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/ted_cruz_doesn_t_need_any_endorsements.html	"Sen. Jim Risch is not sure whether he's endorsed his colleague Sen. Ted Cruz for president. In a Wednesday interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, the Idaho senator said he ""hopes"" Cruz takes the nomination. Blitzer responded by saying that makes him only the third senator to endorse Cruz, a comment that befuddled Risch. ""Did I just endorse, Wolf?"" he asked. Blitzer pointed out that he had said he ""hopes"" Cruz is the nominee because he's better than the other two candidates. So is that an endorsement? ""I guess,"" Risch responded. ""Obviously Kasich is so far behind, it's impossible really for him to get the numbers, so by process of elimination that gets you to Ted Cruz,"" Risch added. Don't get carried away now, Jim, you're going to make the man blush. Risch's resigned quasi-endorsement is more than Cruz is getting from his other congressional colleagues this week. You might've thought his high-profile thrashing of Donald Trump in Wisconsin would've positioned him for a wave of endorsements--even from those who have despised him and his brand of politics for years. But as the Washington Post and Daily Caller report, his colleagues are hardly rushing to sign on. So what? Cruz doesn't need endorsements from lousy senators. His success thus far is proof enough of that. Cruz knows that he'll have the support of his colleagues, as well as of the ""establishment,"" when the time comes: at the convention, when their choices really are limited to either him or Donald Trump. ""Let's face it, Senate endorsements haven't had much sway,"" Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy told the Post. Exactly correct, Bill Cassidy! The two candidates who racked up by far the most endorsements among members of Congress were Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. You don't hear much about Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio anymore. It is almost as if a primary electorate that has awarded 78 percent of delegates so far to either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz pays little heed to congressional endorsements. Might it be that they're even a burden? ""I think there are individual senators who probably have had discussions with the campaign,"" Sen. Jeff Flake told the Daily Caller, ""but frankly, I'm not sure Sen. Cruz wants members of the establishment endorsing him. ... It's kind of been the kiss of death around [here]."" For the Cruz campaign, a wave of establishment senatorial endorsements would counter the central appeal of his campaign to Republican voters. From the moment he came to Washington, he has been laying the cynical groundwork of his presidential campaign by doing whatever he could to make Washington hate him. This is not an especially complicated task--just find out what would annoy Republican leaders at any given moment, and then do it--and he has executed it well. Why change now, when that strategy hasn't appeared to hinder his chances? Even as he becomes, amazingly enough, the ""sane"" option in relation to Donald Trump, he's not laying off his rhetoric as the establishment's worst nightmare. The one factor that could compel Cruz to lay an all-out charm offensive on fellow party members is to ward off the threat of an establishment convention coup. There is some chatter going around, after all, about party leaders simply overlooking primary results and bringing in a ""white knight"" or ""consensus"" candidate-- Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, say--during the latter ballots of a contested convention. It might be in Cruz's interest, then, to persuade them that he's their guy, even after all his years of back-bencher heckling. The problem with this scenario is that the Cruz campaign doesn't think the establishment has the leverage to enter such a savior candidate into the mix. Speaking to reporters in Wisconsin early this week, Cruz described the ""white knight"" scenario as a ""fevered pipe dream."" He explained how difficult it would be to pull off such a maneuver. Because he and Trump would have a ""supermajority"" of delegates, and the rules committee at the convention comprises those delegates, it would be very difficult for the establishment to rewrite Rule 40(b), which allows only candidates who've won a majority of delegates in eight states to have their names entered into consideration. As long as Cruz and Trump stick together on this--and so far, they have!--their loyalists will ensure that only they are entered for consideration. In an era when Congress' approval rating was higher than 13 percent, endorsements might have held more sway as positive signals to voters. Before this cycle, the candidate with the most endorsements from leading party officeholders, operatives, interest groups, and so forth usually won the nomination. That pattern broke this time around when the campaigns of Bush and Rubio collapsed. Cruz doesn't need the party muckety-mucks to decide for him. They're the ones who need to fall in line.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/voter_id_laws_are_causing_havoc_it_s_time_to_do_something.html	"The biggest news out of the Wisconsin primary isn't about the horse race, which is largely unchanged. It's about the election itself--about how the voting happened. As soon as polls opened in urban centers like Madison and Milwaukee, there were reports of long, almost intolerable waits. Students at universities around the state faced hourslong lines to cast a ballot. Others waited just as long for a chance to change their registration. The proximate cause of these long lines in urban, student-heavy areas is the state's new voter identification law backed by the Republican legislature and Gov. Scott Walker. It implements strict new requirements for valid identification that excludes most student IDs (in response, some Wisconsin schools have begun issuing separate identification cards for students to vote) and requires voters without official identification to go through a cumbersome process even if they've voted in the past. Writing for the Nation, Ari Berman describes elderly, longtime voters who were blocked from the polls for want of the right papers. ""Others blocked from the polls include a man born in a concentration camp in Germany who lost his birth certificate in a fire; a woman who lost use of her hands but could not use her daughter as power of attorney at the DMV; and a 90-year-old veteran of Iwo Jima who could not vote with his veterans ID."" But this was more than predictable--it was the point. ""I think Hillary Clinton is about the weakest candidate the Democrats have ever put up,"" said one Wisconsin Republican congressman, Rep. Glenn Grothman. ""And now we have photo ID and I think photo ID is going to make a little bit of a difference as well."" If the urgency of the issue wasn't obvious, Grothman made it plain. Voter ID laws in Wisconsin and beyond are a direct attack on democracy, an attempt to rig the game by blocking whole groups of Americans from the polls. In what appears to be a strong cycle for their party, Democrats should take what happened in Wisconsin as a siren for action. Restoring democracy and protecting it from these attacks should be at the center of the party's agenda. The burden of voter ID laws falls hardest on the marginal members of society, who are predominately nonwhite, elderly, or both. In Wisconsin, 9 percent of registered voters (300,000 people) lack government-issued identification and fall disproportionately under those groups. And while Wisconsin provides voter ID at no cost through its Department of Motor Vehicles, the dirty secret is that this is a difficult and cumbersome process given the extremely limited hours for DMV offices. (Just 31 of Wisconsin's 92 DMVs hold normal business hours and most are open just twice a week.) And worse, as Berman notes, Republican legislators in the state made no provision for voter education. They also shut down the state board that monitors elections. Wisconsin isn't the only place where voting has been hampered by voter identification laws. In Arizona, a similarly strict law--compounded by a Republican-led drive to close voting precincts in heavily populated areas--brought long waits for people who wanted to cast a ballot. As many as 20,000 Americans weren't able to vote, many of them Latino. Three years ago, the Supreme Court struck down the ""preclearance"" provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which required states with a history of discrimination to get the federal government's permission before making any changes in how they run elections. Since then, Republican legislatures like those in Wisconsin and Arizona have adopted draconian identification laws that stand as meaningful barriers to the right to vote. They act as de facto poll taxes, forcing voters to spend time and money in order to exercise their constitutional rights. Thirty-three states will require voters to show identification at the polls this November, and the likely outcome will be long lines and complications for countless voters. Beyond the sort of educational measures that Wisconsin didn't bother with, it's too late to do anything this year about the spread of voter ID and other barriers. But this should be a wake-up call for Democrats. Unless there's pushback, these restrictions will become part of the firmament of our elections, effectively disenfranchising those on the margins of American life. For Democrats now and in the future, reversing those laws--and enhancing voter access--has to be a priority. On the national level, both Clinton and Bernie Sanders should tout their plans to restore the Voting Rights Act and build more voter protections. Below that, prospective Democratic governors and state lawmakers should place voter access at the top of their agendas, a first item for incoming administrations. Everything, from automatic registration and mail-in balloting to ending felon disenfranchisement, should be on the table. This isn't just the right thing to do; it's the smart thing to do. If Democrats believe that they benefit from more voters and larger electorates, then they would do well to mimic the Republican approach, but in reverse: Use their power to tilt the playing field toward more access, more participation, and more democracy."

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/the_gop_needs_ted_cruz_to_lose_the_presidency.html	"Last fall, Rep. Paul Ryan brought peace to the House of Representatives when he agreed to replace John Boehner as speaker and leader of the House Republican caucus. Now, GOP elites want him to perform the same feat for the presidential race. If Donald Trump falls short of the delegates he needs to win the nomination outright, then some Republicans hope Ryan can step to the stage and unite a divided party. ""He's the most conservative, least establishment member of the establishment,"" said an unnamed Republican source to Politico. ""That's what you need to be."" This makes a certain amount of sense. With strong stature among Republicans of all stripes, Ryan could plausibly unite the establishment with its Trumpist discontents. At the same time, he's not the only person in the Republican Party with the status and credentials to accomplish this task. There is another, an actual presidential candidate with real support from Republican voters and a patina of credibility: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, statewide winner of Tuesday night's Wisconsin primary. Barring a major shift in the race, Cruz will finish the Republican primary with the second-most delegates and the second-most votes. He is the only candidate with a proven ability to rally GOP voters against Donald Trump, and while he's antagonized elite Republicans through legislative stunts and constant attacks, he also has an almost-typical resume, having done stints on the 2000 George W. Bush campaign and in the Bush White House, and having worked in the highest levels of Texas government. He holds elite degrees, is fluent in conservative rhetoric, backs the Republican Party's policy agenda, and is comfortable with its donors and wealthy benefactors. And the fact that he holds some democratic legitimacy--as an actual presidential candidate with a viable and well-organized campaign--makes him the obvious choice for any effort to take the nomination from Trump. But for as much as Cruz makes sense, there's a reason Republican elites have kept him at arm's length, and it's not his vocal and alienating disdain for much of the party establishment. Ted Cruz represents more than his own vaulting ambition; he is an avatar for a conservative faction of the Republican Party that wants to ascend to prominence. Attached to the Tea Party, rooted in institutions like the Heritage Foundation, and based in the deep-red South and the most conservative parts of the Midwest, this counterestablishment seeks to supplant the traditional power brokers of the Republican Party. And in Cruz, it has a candidate with the strategic mind and organizational prowess to make it happen. We see this in the delegate shenanigans of the past week. In Arizona, Cruz is recruiting candidates--loyalists--to serve as delegates to the national convention in Cleveland. Should they win their delegate elections, they will stand as Cruz allies this summer. Likewise in North Dakota, Cruz won the delegate selection process outright. ""North Dakota Republicans selected 25 national delegates and, of those, 18 were on a list of preferred delegates that Cruz circulated,"" notes CNN. Ted Cruz will do anything it takes to win, and once he holds victory, he'll use his influence to reshape the Republican establishment in the image of its hard-right rivals. For as much as the GOP's traditional elites are afraid of Donald Trump and what he could do to the party's prospects, they are terrified of Cruz, who wants to shunt them to the ash-heap of history. It's this (along with pure personal dislike) that has pushed these elites to look for a savior from both men. As for Democrats? They're eager to run against Donald Trump. He's one of the most unpopular people in America, not just disliked, but loathed. With Trump at the top of the Republican ticket, Democrats aren't just favored to win the White House and the Senate; they have a shot at the House of Representatives. But if the long-term problem of American politics is a dysfunctional Republican Party that's averse to compromise and the basic give-and-take of governance, then Trump is a less-than-ideal opponent. To the most conservative Republicans--the counterestablishment that claims Cruz as its champion--the real estate mogul is a black swan. If he loses, he loses, and they can get back to the business of claiming the party for themselves. And Cruz, if he runs again, will stick to his core message: that the Republican Party can win again if it nominates a ""true conservative."" The GOP establishment is right to fear and dislike Cruz, but, ironically, its best option for retaining influence is to choose him for its nominee. That would clip Cruz's wings, and in the process marginalize a faction that has steered the GOP to an almost untenable position. We have reached a through-the-looking-glass phase of the election in which the smartest play is for Republicans to be good Leninists and heighten the contradictions within their own party. GOP elites hate Cruz, but in a perverse way, he's the man that they--and the Democratic Party--need right now. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/donald_trump_uses_trade_issue_to_attack_ted_cruz.html	"MILWAUKEE--Donald Trump's pitch to Wisconsin voters is more or less an elaborate neg. ""I went through your numbers,"" he said at a Saturday rally in Racine, ""and you're not doing that well. You're right in the middle of the pack. You're not doing anything outstanding, believe me."" Trump has been doing several events per day in Wisconsin since late last week, a heavy schedule by his standards. He even spent Monday night in a Milwaukee hotel, a rarity for the figure who usually likes to fly back to his own bed in New York each night. He wants badly to win the state. But when he came to Wisconsin several days after Sen. Ted Cruz had hunkered down in the battleground, he found himself facing a sudden polling deficit to the Texas senator. The Trump campaign's comeback strategy has been to supercharge his attacks on Cruz as not just an errand boy for elite interests, but as elite interests personified. Cruz doesn't just support deals that help China, but he ""sides with China."" The Trans-Pacific Partnership--""which Ted Cruz totally supports, which Kasich totally supports""--isn't just a bad trade deal, but one ""far worse"" than NAFTA, which ""took the guts out of our country."" Cruz isn't just your average Wall Street receptacle, but ""Goldman Sachs' favorite senator."" The surrogate doing much of this work for Trump in Wisconsin is Stephen Miller, Trump's senior policy adviser, who's opened for Trump with snarling speeches of his own throughout Wisconsin. For a policy adviser, Miller--until recently an aide to anti-immigration Sen. Jeff Sessions--has a fantastic talent for giving icy, brutal, pit bullish political speeches inveighing against Trump's rivals. His bromides are a pure distillation of white working-class resentment against the elites, and his function at Trump rallies is to get all the important information out there before Trump takes the stage and rants haphazardly about whatever's on his mind. ""We are 24 hours away from delivering a message so loud that it shakes every conference table, in the office of every high-powered lobbyist who's been betraying the working people of this country for 40 years,"" Miller began at a rally in the downtown Milwaukee Theatre on Monday night, about one block away from a Bernie Sanders rally. ""You have a chance, with your vote tomorrow ... to cancel out 40 years of corruption and failure and betrayal that has destroyed the lives of millions of American people."" In his speeches at the Milwaukee and Racine events, Miller described Cruz as ""pro-amnesty, pro-Obamatrade,"" a ""Wall Street extremist,"" and a ""radical globalist"" who ""supports China over America."" Cruz, by Miller's account, is the purveyor of Senate amendments to quintuple the number of guest workers to ""compete against you and your children and your grandchildren and your brothers and sisters for jobs"" and ""double the number of Muslim migrants coming into this country."" Cruz ""was happy,"" Miller added, ""to replicate here in the United States the same conditions we have in Germany and Belgium and across Europe ... that is the real legacy of Ted Cruz."" Because of Cruz, Miller said, resettled refugees were taking jobs away from Wisconsin workers. And where Cruz hasn't been giving jobs to immigrants, he has been sending them overseas. ""No man has pushed harder to push your jobs overseas than Ted Cruz,"" Miller said in Racine, and given Cruz's supposed support for TPP, he ""will sign the death warrant for Wisconsin's economy"" and ""end forever a manufacturing middle class in America."" ""Do you want your jobs?"" ""Yes!"" the crowd shouted back. ""Do you want Ted Cruz?"" ""No!"" The Trump campaign's efforts to position Cruz as TPP's best friend in the Senate aren't entirely based on the truth. Cruz has said he will vote against TPP, and he voted against Trade Promotion Authority, the legislation to ""fast-track"" trade agreements through Congress. But this doesn't mean that Cruz's history on these issues has been as crystal clear as Cruz says it has. Cruz initially did support passage of TPA. Not passively, either--he co-authored a Wall Street Journal op-ed with Rep. Paul Ryan last April urging passage of TPA and saying nice things about TPP. He voted for TPA the first time it came up in the Senate and voted against it the second time. He's on record now as being against TPP. It's reasonable to presume that his opposition to TPP is much like Hillary Clinton's: a stance that may have had less to do with the deal's merits than with the prevailing political winds of the moment. And Trump's campaigning is milking that suspicion for all it's worth. The Wisconsin campaign has been one in which Trump and Cruz appear to be speaking to completely different audiences. Cruz's base is in the better-educated and very ideologically conservative suburbs of Milwaukee, like Waukesha and Ozaukee counties, the two wealthiest counties in the state. Trump does far better in the northern part of the state and in any low-income regions. Unfortunately for Trump, Cruz's base is where more of the votes are, and that's why polling suggests he'll be able to pull off a win Tuesday night. But the deeper we get into the primary schedule, the further apart Cruz's and Trump's bases seem to grow, and the higher the animosity between them. This does not augur well for the party's plan to unify behind the eventual victor. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 Republican primary."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/john_fetterman_s_senate_campaign_needs_bernie_sanders_help.html	"John Fetterman, the populist mayor and long-shot Democratic Senate candidate, was one of the first elected officials in the country to endorse Bernie Sanders for president. He is, like Sanders, a political outsider. A tattooed giant--6-foot-8, more than 300 pounds--he's spent the past 11 years presiding over Braddock, Pennsylvania, a largely black town outside Pittsburgh that was wrecked by the collapse of the local steel industry. Income inequality is at the center of his campaign. ""I think there's a great deal of overlap"" between Sanders' platform and his own, he tells me, ""whether it's a $15-an-hour living wage or health care, trade deals, a rigged economy."" Ideologically, the only real difference between the two men is that Fetterman is more in favor of gun control. He has the date of every homicide in Braddock since his election--nine in all--inked on his right arm. In February, the New Republic described Fetterman as part of ""Bernie's army,"" a generation of Democratic candidates creating ""a progressive revolution from within."" Like Sanders, Fetterman has raised most of the money for his primary online, from small-dollar donors. He's in a three-way primary race against Joe Sestak, the defeated Democratic Senate candidate in 2010, and Katie McGinty, who has the backing of much of the national Democratic establishment. Fetterman's criticism of McGinty echoes Sanders' case against Hillary Clinton. ""When she ran less than two years ago, she was for $9 an hour instead of $15,"" he says, referring to the minimum wage. ""She brought fracking to Pennsylvania, and she also supported NAFTA."" She has a massive financial advantage in what is currently the most expensive Senate race in the country, with more than $17 million already spent. Given the money and political power stacked against him, Fetterman says he needs Sanders' help to have any chance next Tuesday, the same day as the Pennsylvania presidential primary. So far, however, it has not been forthcoming. There's been no endorsement, no fundraising support, no joint appearances. Fetterman's campaign finds this confounding. On the ground, he says, there's enormous overlap between his supporters and the Sanders grassroots. (""The crowd at the Fishtown brewpub is young, liberal, urban. They rave about Sanders--and Fetterman,"" says a recent Philadelphia Inquirer story.) In a three-way race, he believes, Sanders' backing could be decisive; Fetterman estimates that he'll win if he gets 60 or 70 percent of Sanders' voters. Right now, that seems unlikely; a poll from early April had him at 9 percent of the vote, with 66 percent saying they haven't recently seen, read, or heard anything about him, and 63 percent saying they didn't know what his ideology was. The only ray of hope: When people had heard about him, what they heard made them like him more. Lacking the resources to get on the airwaves, he's doing as much retail campaigning as he can, including going to Sanders rallies to talk to voters one on one. (The Sanders campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.) ""To me, Pennsylvania represents the perfectly framed battle within the party war of 2016,"" Fetterman tells me. ""Untold millions in outside money and establishment endorsements versus the will of Sanders' grassroots supporters who could, quite literally, pick the next nominee in this state. That nominee, badly outspent, represents a decimated steel town on society's economic fringe."" Sanders often says that his audacious agenda depends on a political revolution, one that would sweep progressives into office behind him. So far, however, he's done notably little to make that happen. It's not just his failure to support Fetterman; he hasn't gotten involved in any Senate races. He made his first congressional endorsements just last week, sending out fundraising emails for three female House candidates: Zephyr Teachout of New York, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, and Lucy Flores of Nevada. In Wisconsin, a conservative Supreme Court candidate triumphed in part because 11.5 percent of Sanders voters didn't vote in the judicial election, compared with 4 percent of Clinton voters. ""The president can do very little by him or herself,"" says Fetterman. ""You need Congress, too, and we could be somebody in the race that supports a lot of the Sanders agenda."" He's still holding out hope that Sanders comes through: ""I'm sitting here with my corsage, waiting."" Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/how_the_gop_is_losing_its_grip_on_working_class_republicans.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. A brief history of white working-class voters in America: Between 1932 and 1964, they were diehard Democrats, core constituents of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.  Lyndon B. Johnson severed that bond when he committed his noblest deed in signing the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. ""I think we've just delivered the South to the Republican Party for the rest of my life and yours,"" Johnson told his aide Bill Moyers. George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, began fulfilling Johnson's prophecy when he led Southern whites out of the Democratic Party. Wallace formed the American Independent Party, which took five Southern states and helped deliver the White House to Richard Nixon in 1968--incidentally, the last time a third party carried any state in a U.S. presidential election. Wallace's Southern voters and their Northern brethren increasingly supported Republicans thereafter, becoming a pillar of the Reagan coalition in the 1980s. Now a version of that old split has emerged on the right. The Reagan Democrats have become the Trump Republicans, and signs point once again to a breach with the party they have reflexively supported for decades. At one level, the cause is the same as in 1964: reaction against social change that has eroded the value of white privilege. But at another level, this is a revolt by Republican voters who no longer believe that their party supports their basic economic interests. While the leader of this rebellion is one of the rankest opportunists ever to appear on the American political scene, the white working class's feeling that it has been seduced and abandoned by the GOP is perfectly justified. The revolt of the Republican masses bears out the thesis of Thomas Frank's 2004 book What's the Matter with Kansas? Non-college-educated whites have been suffering from an epidemic of false consciousness that took hold during the Reagan Era. While their self-interest aligned with Democratic policies designed to help insulate the vulnerable from economic transition, Republicans managed to persuade working-class voters to support the very policies that were doing them harm. They accomplished this by diverting the attention of less-educated whites with coded racial appeals, emphasizing cultural issues like abortion and gay rights, and stirring resentment against liberal ""elites."" (It should be noted that not everyone buys this thesis.) Working-class Republicans are waking up to the reality that their new party doesn't represent them any more than the Democrats did. On issue after issue, Trump's supporters are at odds with GOP dogma. They don't support free trade and globalization. They don't favor tax cuts for the wealthy, or bailouts for banks, or financial deregulation, or the rollback of consumer protections. They're against privatizing Social Security, paring back Medicare, and eliminating other government programs that aid the middle class. While they've been encouraged to regard Barack Obama as an extraterrestrial, they're not demanding the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Though nationalistic, their families are the ones that paid the human cost for the neoconservative fantasy of bringing democracy to Iraq. With his real estate developer's nose for opportunity, Donald Trump has bought up the swampy property between Republican leaders and the Republican led. His most effective line of attack is against sensible immigration reform, which the party's donor class supports and its constituent base rejects. Trump's voters couldn't care less about bringing Latinos into the GOP. But his rallying cry of ""build the wall and make them pay for it"" isn't just about nativism. It expresses a broader distress over the consequences of globalization, free trade, deindustrialization, and deunionization. Like William F. Buckley in the 1950s, Trump's supporters stand athwart economic change yelling, ""Stop!"" In this context, the rise of the Tea Party, circa 2009, now appears as red herring. Rank-and-file Republicans weren't in fact dismayed by George W. Bush's failure to shrink their entitlement benefits. It was the party's wealthy elite--the Koch brothers and their beneficiaries at libertarian think tanks--who were frustrated about that. Working-class Republicans were enraged because they saw the federal government bailing out Wall Street banks instead of ordinary citizens. The Tea Party quickly dissipated into irrelevancy because it didn't represent the people it claimed to represent. Granted the nomination, Trump will drive away the Republican elite in this year's election. Denied the nomination, he may lead the white working class out of the party for good, or clear the path for its slow-motion removal. But people who agree on next to nothing can't go on cohabiting indefinitely. It's impossible to say what form a Republican schism will end up taking. It could be an actual rupture at the Republican Convention in Cleveland, like South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrat walkout from the 1948 Democratic Convention, with immigration as the new segregation. Or, if Republicans lose in November, we could see the emergence of a Trumpian third party. Or a populist faction could try to seize control of the GOP from within. What seems least likely is for the voters aroused by Trump to return to their previous docility. They won't fall back on supporting another corporate conservative like Mitt Romney, or a soft libertarian like Paul Ryan. Once parties rupture the way the GOP is now doing, only a master of constructive ambiguity like Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton can paper over their fundamental disagreements. There is currently no such figure at large in the Republican Party. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/04/there_is_no_bernie_sanders_movement.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. He'd just been declared the winner in the Wisconsin Democratic primary, and now Bernie Sanders, speaking from a stage in Laramie, Wyoming, was thundering into a favorite refrain. He was talking about money, about the small donations--$27 on average!--that have come pouring in from millions of Americans across the country. ""To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg,"" he said, breathing new life into an old line, ""this is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people."" And this campaign of the people, he believed, had legs. It had momentum. ""What momentum is about is my belief that if we wake up the American people, and if working people and middle-class people and senior citizens and young people begin to stand up, fight back, and come out and vote in large numbers, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish."" It was Sanders' theme, the idea driving his campaign. ""All over this country,"" he said a little later, ""young people are standing up and they're saying, 'You know what? We want to help determine the future of this country.' "" The crowd was with him. They whooped at the applause lines. They responded when he called. They were with him not only because this was good rhetoric--inspirational and aspirational language that evokes a better, more just world--but because it felt true. This time last year, Bernie Sanders was announcing his campaign for president from the corners of national obscurity--a self-described ""democratic socialist"" throwing in his lot from one of the most homogenous and idiosyncratic states in the Union. Now, he's built the gold standard for insurgent campaigns in a Democratic presidential primary, second only to Barack Obama's effort in 2008. He has an incredible following with young liberals, who are swept away by his optimism, his decency, his seeming authenticity. And incredibly, he's raised tens of millions of dollars through small donations from millions of people, funding his campaign without recourse to corporate or financial interests, in a way we've never seen before. It feels true that Bernie Sanders has sparked a new movement of the left--a flowering of youthful energy that will transform American politics, or at least pull the Democratic Party to the social democratic left where it belongs. But it's not. There's no question the Vermont senator has performed in a way--and at a level--that no one anticipated, giving Hillary Clinton a serious challenge in a primary that was originally billed as a coronation. He has beaten expectations. But far from building a coalition of new voters and expanding left-wing politics to groups who have traditionally eschewed or avoided it, Sanders has simply reconstituted the usual liberal coalition that backs insurgents in a Democratic primary. He has done so with incredible success. But a movement? There never was a Bernie Sanders movement. * * * That there's precedent for Bernie Sanders isn't trivia or a means to dismiss him. Far from it. Instead, it tells us something significant about the roots of Sanders' support in the Democratic Party, why he's struggled to break through with certain groups, and about the likely fate of his coalition as constituted, in the unlikely event that he wins the nomination. It's not hard to list the ways in which Sanders departs from the typical politician, much less the typical presidential candidate. At 74, he's older than most of the men and women who have run for the Democratic nomination (and president) in the modern era. He's Jewish, a major change from the cadre of Protestants and Catholics who typically run for president. And he brings a unique persona to national politics: a disheveled, irascible, sometimes grumpy man who carries a trace of Brooklyn in his accent and his blunt habits of communication. There's also his politics, or rather, his political labeling. Sanders identifies as a ""democratic socialist"" and has been at an official remove from the Democratic Party for the whole of his congressional career. But as just a glance at his record shows, this is more cosmetic than anything else. There's no doubt that in his pre-political career, Sanders was devoted to socialist politics, such as they existed in the United States. But as a legislator, he has caucused with Democrats, voted with Democrats, fundraised for Democrats, and he's now in line to run a Senate committee under Democrats. Remove his ""socialist"" branding, which even he defines as little more than an updated form of New Deal liberalism, and you're left with a candidate who strongly resembles other insurgent candidates going back to the beginning of the modern primary process, from George McGovern to Jerry Brown to Bill Bradley to Howard Dean. He relies on ""authenticity"" as contrasted with the ""calculated"" positioning of mainstream candidates. He stands on the ideological left, a factional figure who seeks to pull the party in his direction, or pry concessions from a reluctant establishment. And his support comes from the usual places: Young people (especially college students), white liberals, and the most ideological actors within the Democratic Party. Just look at the rhetoric. Sanders has a consistent message: Using their wealth, powerful interests have rigged the game against you. ""What the American people are saying--and, by the way, I hear this not just from progressives, but from conservatives and from moderates--is that we can no longer continue to have a campaign finance system in which Wall Street and the billionaire class are able to buy elections,"" Sanders said in his New Hampshire victory speech this February. ""Americans, no matter what their political view may be, understand that that is not what democracy is about."" In the same way, his predecessors also framed their campaigns as movements--grassroots efforts to challenge the establishment and grab the reins of the Democratic Party from monied interests and other villains. ""This is a campaign to unite and empower people,"" said Howard Dean in Burlington, Vermont, where he announced his bid for the Democratic nomination in June 2003. ""It is a call to every American, regardless of party, to join together in common purpose, for the common good, and for the common good to save and restore all that it means to be an American."" He transitioned into a familiar message about the threats to American democracy: ""Companies leaving the country to avoid paying taxes, or avoid paying people a livable wage. And corporations doing this with the support of our own government and a political process in Washington that they rent--if not own. This, this is the fear of James Madison and Thomas Jefferson--the fear that economic power would one day try to seize political power."" ""You have a choice to make in the coming days, and you need to know where the two Democratic candidates stand on the issues that are important to you,"" declared former Sen. Bill Bradley in his well-worn stump speech during the 2000 presidential primary. ""I'm challenging a sitting vice president of the United States for the nomination of my party for president. I'm going up against the party favorite, the choice of the political establishment, a man whose name and face are known by every American."" He went on to position himself as a champion of ordinary people against a powerful ruling class: ""We have to sweep away the old politics of distortion and special interest money and special interests in Washington and create a new politics of honesty and conviction."" Or, to reach back to an insurgent politician who faced a (different) Clinton, there was California's Jerry Brown, running in the 1992 Democratic primary. ""Our democratic system has been the object of a hostile takeover engineered by a confederacy of corruption, careerism, and campaign consulting,"" said Brown in his announcement speech. ""And money has been the lubricant greasing the deal. Incredible sums--literally hundreds of millions of dollars--from political action committees, lobbyists, and wealthy patrons have flooded into the campaign war chests of Washington's entrenched political elite--Democrats and Republicans alike."" Like Sanders, these candidates brought unapologetically liberal positions to the table. Jerry Brown touted living-wage laws and opposed free-trade agreements like NAFTA; Bill Bradley called for universal health insurance and attacked Al Gore for backing the 1996 welfare-reform law; and Howard Dean rooted his campaign in his opposition to the Iraq War, running as a dovish alternative to John Kerry. But those substantive positions were often subordinate to a process critique; before anything else, they seemed to argue, we had to reform campaign finance and ""get money out of politics,"" to borrow a now-common phrase. They weren't ""men of the left"" per se--Brown, in particular, had a testy relationship with the left--but in the context of the Democratic Party, that's the space they held. And within that space, they appealed to a narrow slice of the Democratic electorate. Predominantly white and disproportionately college-educated, these voters formed (and still form) the core of ideological liberalism within mainstream politics. Take the Dean campaign. In a 2005 survey, the Pew Research Center compared the demographics of Dean's effort with those of the Democratic Party at large. The results don't surprise. Just 25 percent of Democrats nationwide held college or postgraduate degrees, compared with 79 percent of Dean activists. And 92 percent were white, compared with 68 percent of all Democrats. Thanks in part to the fact that 2016 is a two-person race, the Sanders coalition isn't this starkly white and college-educated. But it's still disproportionate, a fact illustrated by the primary results. The single easiest way to predict a Sanders win in the Democratic contest is to look at the state's demographics. Where blacks make up a large share of the Democratic electorate--industrial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, Southern states like North and South Carolina--Hillary Clinton wins. Where whites are the largest share, Bernie Sanders prevails. Which is to say that, like Dean or Bradley before for him, Sanders is a factional candidate of ideological liberal Democrats, who are largely white Democrats. The difference between now and then, however, is that, with the collapse of conservative white Democrats in the South and elsewhere, those liberal whites make up a larger share of the party. They provide more fuel for an insurgency. But they're still not enough to overcome the influence of moderates and stalwart black voters, who form a majority of the party. That, in fact, was the fate of previous insurgencies, which crashed on the rocks of math. Ideological liberals are among the loudest Democrats, but they are a minority within the entire party. And while that minority is larger and stronger than it's been in a generation, it's still not strong enough to steer the party alone. It still has to play coalition politics. * * * The simple fact is that there aren't enough liberals to elect politicians outside of bastions in California and in the Northeast, and there never have been. It's part of why, in the middle of the 20th century, Democratic liberals from the North were sharing space with segregationists in the South--the only way any Democrat could win the presidency is through alliance with groups that shared different, often opposing goals. The divides aren't as stark as they were in the '50s and '60s--even the most conservative Democrat today is far from a segregationist--but the dynamic remains. To have any hope of White House influence, liberals need votes from progressive Massachusetts as well as moderate Colorado and conservative Florida. But coalitions are tricky things. Working with other groups doesn't guarantee you will achieve your goals, or even come close. Like its predecessors, the Sanders insurgency is an attempt to force the question, to declare ""we deserve a louder say"" to the moderate stalwarts, corporate interests, unions, and activist groups that constitute the Democratic Party. But they have a say, too, with backers and voters who support their positions. And they may not be swayed by arguments over policies and ideology. Groups and voters come to political parties with a variety of different interests that reflect their identities and livelihoods as much as their beliefs and values. Some of this is tribalism or ""identity politics,"" but those are real forces that have to be negotiated. It is possible. The one upset in the 2016 contest was in Michigan, where Sanders beat expectations by enlarging the electorate--bringing more young people into the process--and improving with black voters. And he did this by reaching out, early and often. Not just with talk of a ""political revolution,"" but by connecting to voters with a common message rooted in trade and labor, an effective move in a state with a long history of unionism. The broad point is that a ""political revolution"" can't rest on a call for clean government and ideological rigor--the crux of Sanders' general argument. The Democratic Party isn't yet an ideological party, and many of its voters don't put ideology or good-government reform at the top of their lists. You see this in how insurgent candidates, Sanders included, tend to flail when faced with black voters, one of the largest constituencies in the Democratic Party. Beginning with the South Carolina primary--and continuing in every Southern contest--Sanders has flopped in his efforts to win over black voters, losing them by huge margins. He's responded by discounting the significance of Southern primaries, describing the region--and by extension, the voters--as ""conservative."" Sanders is wrong. The people voting in Southern primaries aren't ""conservatives"" in any meaningful sense. They aren't electing conservative or Republican lawmakers, and they aren't driving the conservative politics in those states. They are moderate to liberal Democrats who back moderate to liberal politicians. And they're black, which is significant. Black voters aren't just palette-swapped white ones; they have interests and concerns that are specific to themselves and their communities. They are experienced and sophisticated voters. Some support Sanders' ideological pitch, but others don't and are looking for something else--from ties to the black community to experience to support for Barack Obama--that they don't see in Sanders. What's key is that this isn't a failure of will from Bernie Sanders, who worked to reach out to these groups. But it reflects the degree to which presidential campaigns are not the right place to change the overall dynamics of a political party. To win over black voters, Sanders and his supporters needed to spend time in black communities, becoming a part of their politics--a trusted partner. It's how Jesse Jackson won black voters in the 1988 campaign, and it's partly how Barack Obama persuaded them to join his campaign, an unprecedented effort that merged ideological liberals with black voters and other Democratic stalwarts to win. Obama is a unique case. Whereas Jackson had a whole career of civil rights activism behind him before he entered politics, the then-Illinois senator was still fresh-faced, a relative newcomer. But he connected with black audiences on a symbolic level--the first black American with a strong chance at the nomination and the White House--and with a message centered on the economy and other material concerns as much as anything else. He knew where and how to speak to black voters--in churches, on black radio--and it paid off. But then, Obama was a mainstream Democratic politician. He was accustomed to this kind of coalition-building. For most of his congressional career, Sanders has been a gadfly--an ideologue pressing his colleagues from the left, with a base in one of the least diverse states in the union. The same qualities that make him exciting to so many Americans--his passion, his bluntness, his uncompromising views--make him ill-suited for the transactional politicking that you need to pull off a coup against an establishment figure like Hillary Clinton. And the absence of rigid racial politics in Vermont meant he didn't have to learn those politics, at least not to the same degree as other left-leaning politicians. (On the one issue of real disagreement in Vermont, guns, Sanders was an eager compromiser.) * * * There are signs, however, that the future holds promise for candidates who want to take up Sanders' mantle. If there is a major difference between Sanders and previous insurgent candidacies, it's that his supporters are young. Madison, Wisconsin, is a college town, but at an event there before the state's primary, I was surprised to talk to several kids--not college students, but high schoolers--who at 16 or 17 couldn't vote but were thrilled to see Sanders and participate in the process. ""This is my fourth time seeing Bernie Sanders at one of his rallies,"" said Jason, a high school student in Madison. ""I'm here just because I really like the energy. I'm not here to hear anything new--I already like what he has to say--but I like the energy."" In New Hampshire, Sanders won 83 percent of voters under 29 and 66 percent of voters between 30 and 44, as well as 56 percent of college graduates--who formed most of the electorate in the state. In Ohio, he did the same, winning 81 percent of voters under 29, 54 percent of voters between 30 and 44, and earning greater support from white Democrats than from black ones. In Wisconsin, Sanders won an even larger share of the 18-to-44 vote (73 percent), a large majority of college graduates, and a large majority of white voters. The percentages will vary, but we should expect something similar in the upcoming New York primary. Whether he wins or loses, he'll take his greatest support from those younger voters. The sheer youth of the Sanders coalition is novel. And it has much to do with the ways Sanders is different from past insurgent candidates. He doesn't end with a reformist message against a ""rigged system""--an argument for liberals that falls flat with other groups. He moves to a larger narrative tied to class, explaining how this rigged system is the enemy of working- and middle-class people, how ending it is the necessary step to unleashing the power of government to improve people's lives. When meshed with proposals like free public college, it speaks deeply to young voters whose political coming of age was the Great Recession and its aftermath. Still, we should be careful not to overplay Sanders' youth support. For starters, while Sanders wins a huge share of the youth vote, young voters (18 to 29) are still a modest share of the primary electorate. In the 2008 New Hampshire primary, they were 18 percent of all voters. This year, they were 19 percent. In South Carolina in 2008, young people were 14 percent of all voters. This year, they were 15 percent. And in Ohio in 2008, they were 16 percent of all voters. This year, they were just 15 percent. If the Sanders revolution is supposed to drive greater turnout, it hasn't happened--Democratic turnout overall is far below its 2008 high, and on par with turnout in the 2004 nomination race. The same goes for fundraising. There's no denying that Sanders has done something unprecedented in raising huge sums--upward of $140 million--almost exclusively through small donations. It's a sign that presidential candidates can be competitive without recourse to Wall Street or other centers of financial power and privilege. At the same time, we can't divorce this from its context. In building this remarkable fundraising apparatus, Sanders has drawn on the lessons of Obama and Dean, utilizing the rapid growth and reach of smartphones and social media to enhance the approach, without fundamentally changing it. The truth is, Sanders is less an innovator than a beneficiary of favorable political and technological trends. And for as much as he has pressured Hillary Clinton and the Democratic establishment--forcing both to account for past policies, pulling their positions to the left, and denying them a chance to move to the center for a general election--there's no indication that his influence will last beyond the campaign. History suggests it won't: The energy generated by the most remarkable election-year movement in recent memory--the 2008 Obama campaign--dissipated in the aftermath of his victory. That wasn't completely inevitable--and Obama supporters tried to turn his campaign into something that could last--but it was close. In the broad scheme of politics, electing a president is a narrow goal that involves well-defined steps. All things considered, it is easy to get people invested in tackling that goal. It's much harder to find people excited about the hard, difficult work of party building. But for people who want to make fundamental change to American politics, it's vital. Conservative Republicans, for example, didn't quit in the aftermath of Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater's defeat in the 1964 presidential election. They used their experience--the connections they made, the networks they built--to establish a conservative beachhead in the Republican Party. The next GOP presidential nominee might not be Goldwater, the thinking went, but he'll sound like him. Over the next generation, these conservatives--and those who followed--worked from the ground up. They took over local and state Republican Party organizations; they challenged moderate Republicans in congressional and state races; and they made their presence known in presidential primaries, pushing back against the ""establishment"" choice whenever possible. They tilled and seeded the ground so that, when a viable conservative candidate finally came in the form of Ronald Reagan, he had a coalition flowering behind him. And once in the White House, Reagan entrenched their brand of conservatism in the Republican Party, making it the dominant faction among many. You can't draw a direct analogy between the GOP of the 1960s and 1970s and the Democratic Party of today. Conservatives had institutions and forces on their side--powerful businesses, influential religious groups, wealthy elites--that aided their drive to dominate the GOP. Leftists will likely be in opposition to the traditional interest groups of the Democratic Party, including its high-dollar donors. Still, there are lessons liberals and leftists can draw from the conservative experience--lessons that Sanders supporters can use. All the enthusiasm is there; it just needs to be cultivated and channeled into something durable. But that requires a sacrifice, of sorts. For as much as Sanders and his most vocal supporters identify themselves as outside the party system, the only way a real Sanders movement can make change is to take an active role within that system. Voting is too imprecise to send a message or make a statement, and withholding a vote does nothing to persuade or build influence. (Who in the Democratic Party solicits Ralph Nader for advice and aid?) Sanders supporters who want to move the Democratic Party to the ideological left need to become Sanders Democrats, political actors who participate in the system as it exists. To win a lasting victory--to define the ideological terms of Democratic Party politics--the people inspired by Sanders need to do more than beat the establishment; they need to become it. Liberals and leftists will have to work with an eye toward the long-term, operating from the ground up to make ideological liberals a key power-broker in the party. If the Bernie Sanders effort shows anything, it's that the odds are in their favor. The youngest, most active Democrats are more liberal than their older counterparts, and technology has advanced to the point where they can organize and raise money without relying on established power centers. Even if Bernie Sanders is just the inheritor of friendly demographic and technological trends, his success suggests a real opportunity for the liberals and leftists who back his campaign. They have the chance, if they want it, to channel their energy into a move to make the Democratic Party theirs, in the same way that conservatives--until the rise of Donald Trump, at least--took hold of the Republican Party. The energy of the Sanders campaign will almost certainly fade away. But if the voters inspired by Sanders can gather their energy and become a part of the Democratic Party, they can win the influence they need to shift its direction in the long-term. And with their youth, they can play the long game, if they choose to. The same goes for the now. In the context of coalition politics--where different groups negotiate for their interests--withdrawal is a poor strategy. For any chance at victory, you have to play the game. But within that, you can build leverage. It's why, for instance, Bernie Sanders is right to begin to fundraise for other candidates, using his valuable list to raise cash for like-minded politicians around the country. It's not just a way to further his beliefs--if those candidates win, it's a signal to other politicians from other corners of the party that the Sanders message has wings. That it's something to imitate. And he should do more. Not only should the Sanders campaign look for as many local and congressional candidates to support as it can, but it should encourage its supporters to engage politics at that level, perhaps even to run for office. Likewise, Sanders should devote real time to raising money for the Democratic National Committee and affiliated groups. Yes, this is the establishment. But if the goal is pulling that establishment to the left, fundraising is one way to win a seat at the table. This isn't fun. It's routine. It's boring. It requires Sanders and supporters to play a game they've decried for the past year. But in the American system--where everyone gets a vote, and the most votes win--you have to pick one party or the other as a vehicle for your views. For liberals, historically, that's been the Democratic Party. Bernie Sanders isn't leading a new movement, and he doesn't represent the dawning of liberal ideology. To the extent that there is a movement at all, it is simply a movement to get Sanders elected president. Nothing more and nothing less. This is a classic insurgency, updated for 2016. But that doesn't mean it's insignificant. This year, the insurgency is larger than it's ever been, and that in itself is an opportunity. A chance for the insurgents to play the long game, to co-opt the institutions that have held them back and to emerge as the leaders of a new Democratic Party. Sanders may not be the Democratic nominee, or the president of the United States, but if his supporters take the opportunity, they'll accomplish what past insurgent candidacies couldn't, and he'll stand as a key figure in the origin story of a new, new left.

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/bernie_sanders_defends_palestinian_rights_what_a_mensch.html	"On Thursday, the Bernie Sanders campaign suspended its new Jewish outreach coordinator, Simone Zimmerman, who was anathematized on the right for, among other things, calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ""arrogant, deceptive, cynical, manipulative asshole"" on Facebook. The move seemed like a capitulation by the idealistic Sanders camp to the sordid realities of presidential politics, especially in New York. As the New York Times reported, ""a significant number of Jewish voters consider Ms. Zimmerman and her allies to be radicals, and the Sanders campaign, already facing a more than 30-point deficit among New York's Jewish Democrats, according to a new NBC New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, took action."" That made it all the more surprising when, just a few hours later, Sanders made a brave, unprecedented defense of Palestinian humanity from a primary debate stage in Brooklyn. It began with a question about Israel's 2014 war in Gaza, which Sanders rightly called ""disproportionate."" Moderator Wolf Blitzer, perhaps attempting to expose a weak spot, asked him, ""What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?"" Sanders, however, stuck to his position. Then he said, ""[I]f we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity."" Clinton followed with a cringe-worthy defense of the war, evading the question of whether Israel could have acted with less overwhelming force. It was one of those moments that demonstrated the chasm between what is morally right and what is politically useful, because even if her pro-Israel rhetoric outraged Sanders supporters, it probably played well with New York Jews, especially those for whom Israel is a decisive issue. (A 2014 Gallup poll found that among Americans who followed news of the conflict ""very closely,"" 71 percent thought Israel's invasion was justified.) Sanders thus had little to gain, electorally speaking, from pressing Clinton on her Israel stance. But he did it anyway. ""Was their response disproportionate?"" he asked. ""I believe that it was, you have not answered that."" Then he hit Clinton on her egregiously one-sided speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March: ""I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people. Almost none in that speech."" He criticized her fealty to Netanyahu: ""There comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time."" And then he returned to the AIPAC speech. ""[W]e cannot continue to be one-sided,"" he said. ""There are two sides to the issue."" The idea that the Palestinians have legitimate grievances--that there are two sides to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--should be a political truism, but it's generally a taboo. High-level American politicians hardly ever speak of Palestinian suffering, except when they're blaming it on the feckless Palestinian leadership. Even those who forcefully advocate for the creation of a Palestinian state usually do so by arguing that it is in Israel's best interest. There has never, in American presidential politics, been a penalty for being too pro-Israel, at least until Sanders briefly forced Clinton onto the defensive Thursday night. She ended up pointing out that she has indeed criticized Netanyahu: ""I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders."" This happens to be true; see, for example, the 2010 Reuters article headlined, ""Hillary Clinton Berates Netanyahu Over Settlements."" But the fact that she was groping to distance herself from Netanyahu in a presidential debate was remarkable. My guess is that this will not help Sanders in New York's primary on Tuesday, and it will quite possibly hurt him. If that's the case, he'll have made a sacrifice to pry open American political conversation on an issue where it has been sealed shut. Whether or not it was strategically wise, it was a mitzvah.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/any_claim_that_donald_trump_has_lost_momentum_is_ending.html	"Those Republicans united in opposition to Donald Trump's candidacy pulled off the perfect victory in the April 5 Republican primary in Wisconsin. Through a combination of paid and earned media and successful rallying behind Sen. Ted Cruz as the alternate candidate--rather than splitting votes between him and Ohio Gov. John Kasich--the anti-Trump apparatus was able to keep the GOP front-runner's support ceilinged to 35 percent, roughly the same number he was polling at when there were still six candidates in the race. It was a humiliating loss for Trump, and the one that finally taught him to at least marginally watch his mouth (and his retweets). The Cruz campaign has since tried to spin Wisconsin as a ""turning point"" in the race, or the moment when the Republican Party united behind him to block Trump's path to the nomination. Like most spin, this isn't entirely the case. It's true that Trump's near-shutout in delegates in the state hampered his ability to reach the 1,237 bound delegates he needs to secure the nomination, and his fate now probably hinges on corralling some number of unbound delegates. But the idea that this signaled a shift in ""momentum"" in the race toward Cruz is much less evidence-based. Throughout this back-and-forth primary calendar we haven't seen shifts in ""momentum"" so much as shifts in geography. And now that the race has shifted to the Northeast for the remainder of April, the anti-Trumpers are back exactly where they were before Wisconsin: with a split vote that allows Trump to clean house. Trump is going to win the New York primary on Tuesday. No one ever doubted that. What will be important to watch, though, is whether he can break 50 percent statewide and in each congressional district to exceed winner-take-all thresholds and capture nearly all of the state's 95 delegates. He looks in decent shape to reach the magic number statewide, and Wednesday's Siena College poll showed his support to be fairly consistent geographically: He's at 56 percent in New York City, 52 percent in downstate suburbs, and 48 percent upstate. As BuzzFeed reports, anti-Trump spending groups aren't even bothering with New York anymore. Trump is going to dominate on April 26, too. Connecticut (28 delegates) has a 50 percent winner-take-all threshold statewide and plurality winner-take-all rules by congressional district. A new Emerson College poll finds Trump at 50 percent and leading in all five congressional districts. Trump is similarly taking command in Maryland (38 delegates) although John Kasich might be able to pluck a couple of moderate, well-educated districts in the D.C. suburbs. Meanwhile, a Monmouth University survey released Wednesday shows Trump picking up 58 percent of Maryland's ""very conservative"" voters--usually Cruz's best demographic, which tells you all you need to know about his chances for Maryland pickups. Trump will almost certainly win Pennsylvania's 17 bound statewide delegates; its unbound district delegates are a more complicated matter. Rhode Island's 19 delegates are proportionally allocated and though there hasn't been any recent polling, Trump will likely end up with a plurality. Delaware is a pure winner-take-all state with 16 delegates. It has not been polled because no one respects Delaware. Poor Delaware! It will either be Trump or Kasich and probably not Kasich, because Kasich can't win any state besides Ohio. The pattern in all these states is similar: Trump gets his plurality--or, especially the closer you get to New York, his majority--while neither of his rivals can emerge as a viable anti-Trump horse, and so they fumble around with 15 to 30 percent each. The anti-Trump thinking behind Kasich continuing his campaign after he won Ohio on March 15 and the rest of the field cleared out was twofold. First, he's incredibly stubborn and wanted to stay in, so it was the only option. Second, the Northeast is hardly Cruz territory, in part because the Cruz campaign casts the region's hub as home to god-stabbing gay abortionists as part of its (effective) heartland messaging. So the plan was to divvy up the work: Cruz would serve as the anti-Trump alternative between the coasts--a role he has so far successfully filled--Kasich would be the anti-Trump vehicle for Northeastern hedonists, and then they could figure out the complex California situation later. Kasich hasn't been able to take care of his end. The Ohio governor is doing better than Cruz in Northeastern states, just not by enough. Kasich may be a better regional fit than Cruz, but he's also not as strong of a presidential candidate. At this point, it's still useful on net for Kasich to stay in just to help keep Trump below various 50-percent thresholds. But the split field makes it nearly impossible for Trump to lose much of anything in the region. The only anti-Trump strategy that genuinely would have helped in the Northeast would have been for Kasich to appeal more to Republican primary voters from the beginning, and that just wasn't happening.

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/bernie_s_pick_for_jewish_outreach_director_is_inspiring_it_s_also_bad_politics.html	"The hiring of Simone Zimmerman to be Bernie Sanders' new Jewish outreach director demonstrates everything that is inspiring about Sanders as a primary candidate and everything that is frightening about Sanders as a potential Democratic nominee. A zealous activist against Israel's occupation of Palestine, Zimmerman represents many social justice-minded young Jews whose views have been largely excluded from mainstream politics. As the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reports, during the 2014 Gaza War, she was part of a group of Jews who held regular vigils outside the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, reading the names of people killed in the conflict.* A former president of J Street U's National Student Board, she was a leader in If Not Now, a Jewish group dedicated to ending the occupation. Her ideology is not particularly radical--unlike many of Israel's fiercest critics, she appears to believe in a two-state solution rather than a single bi-national state. But she is frank about Israel's failings in a way that even left-wing Democrats--including Bernie Sanders--almost never are. As she tweeted last month when Israel appointed the settler leader Dani Dayan to be consul general in New York, ""Am Jews shld see that Israel scorns liberal values, peace, 2states."" By hiring Zimmerman, Sanders is once again connecting with a strain of millennial politics that otherwise has little representation. Just as millennials have rejected the pro-capitalist consensus of their elders--polls show them to be the only generation to prefer socialism--they also reject reflexive support of Israel. (In a Pew survey taken during the conflict in Gaza, adults between 18-29 were the only group to hold Israel more responsible for the fighting than Hamas.) In February, after spending time on American college campuses, Israeli journalist Ari Shavit wrote about Zionism's ""millennial crisis."" ""[T]he most pressing existential threat we face is the clash between Zionism and the zeitgeist of the 21st century,"" wrote Shavit. ""The fact is that while most young people in North America and Europe have adopted universal values, both Israel and the organized Jewish world are perceived as tribal."" Yet if hiring Zimmerman taps into the zeitgeist, it also opens Sanders up to a fusillade of attacks. Like many young Jews who deplore the occupation, Zimmerman hates Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""Bibi Netanyahu is an arrogant, deceptive, cynical, manipulative asshole,"" she wrote on her Facebook page last year, adding, ""Fuck you, Bibi."" She has since edited the post, but the original is currently all over the right-wing media even though, at the moment, conservatives aren't terribly interested in attacking Sanders, who is widely seen as a weaker general election candidate than Clinton. Were Sanders actually the nominee, Zimmerman's hiring would spark a multiday festival of manufactured outrage. If the electorate exclusively comprised millennials, this wouldn't matter. But Israel, like capitalism, is actually really popular in America at large; in one 2015 Gallup poll, 62 percent of Americans said they sympathize more with Israel than with the Palestinians. Some of Sanders' older Jewish supporters are already uneasy about his (mild) criticism of Israel. They're particularly outraged by his mistaken claim in an interview with the Daily News that 10,000 Palestinians were killed in the 2014 Gaza conflict. (The number of deaths was actually 2,310.) ""Sanders has been tone deaf on Gaza. And the interview with the Daily News was appalling,"" the Jewish Telegraphic Agency quoted a 72-year-old supporter saying at a Jews for Bernie brunch in New York City. ""He doesn't go to the AIPAC conference, but he's going to the Vatican? I mean, come on!"" If the Sanders campaign is about broadening the space for progressive ideas in American politics, hiring a leader like Zimmerman is a great idea. If it is about winning elections, it is risky, especially in a state like New York, where, running for Senate in 2000, Hillary Clinton had to answer, over and over and over again, for a pro-forma kiss on the cheek that she once gave to Suha Arafat, Yasir Arafat's wife. Right now Sanders, the first Jewish candidate to win a presidential primary, trails Clinton among Jewish Democrats in New York; several polls show him down by double digits. If he wants to win more Jewish support, he's unlikely to do it by doubling down on criticism of Israel, however valid that criticism is. I understand that part of what Sanders supporters love about him is his unvarnished leftism, his refusal to poll-test his convictions. No doubt Clinton goes too far in the other direction. But her caution is born of hard experience--like weathering the idiotic uproar over Arafat. Perhaps she overestimates the power of the right-wing noise machine. Or maybe Sanders underestimates it. One thing that separates progressives who are backing Sanders from those who are, however reluctantly, voting for Clinton is their view of the electorate. Sanders people tend to believe that on some level most Americans agree with them, even if they don't know it yet. Sanders himself recently argued that if the corporate media were honest about the Republican Party's terrible agenda, it would wither away to a tiny fringe, garnering no more than 10 percent of the vote. He cannot quite conceive of sincere ideological disagreement, of people rejecting his beliefs for reasons besides ignorance or corruption. Progressive Clintonites are much less likely to believe that a majority of Americans share their worldview. That makes their approach to politics more cautious and cynical. There is a gap between what they believe to be true and what they believe to be politically palatable. The question, to me, is not whether it's OK as a matter of principle to called Netanyahu an asshole--he most assuredly is. It's whether a Democratic candidate for president can afford to be associated with that sentiment. Whatever your views about god and Zionism, to answer yes is to take a leap of faith. Correction, April 14, 2016: An earlier version of this article misstated that a story about Simone Zimmerman was written by the Times of Israel. It appeared in the Times of Israel but was written by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. (Return.) Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/the_national_enquirer_s_ted_cruz_story_what_happened.html	"After a National Enquirer story late last month quasi-alleged that Ted Cruz has serially cheated on his wife, rival candidate Donald Trump emerged as a fan of the paper, directing our attention to scoops of yore. ""They were right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others,"" noted Trump in a campaign statement. Implication: The Enquirer might be right this time, too. Does Trump have a point? The Enquirer indeed found photos of O.J. sporting Bruno Magli shoes he claimed he'd never worn (which bolstered bloody footprint evidence introduced at the Juice's civil trial). And the paper's been spot-on in uncovering the scandals of some previous presidential candidates. Ask Gary Hart (photographed with paramour Donna Rice aboard his lap), Jesse Jackson (busted for fathering a love child), or, most famously, Edwards (caught lying after he knocked up not-wife Rielle Hunter). Given these past reportorial triumphs, should we be inclined to trust the supermarket tabloid's highest-profile move of this election season? Was the Enquirer's wafer-thin piece alleging that ""political operatives"" are ""digging into at least five affairs Ted Cruz supposedly had"" just the first stab at a bigger story to come? I spoke to former Enquirer editor-in-chief David Perel--the chief orchestrator of the Enquirer's Edwards reporting, now editorial director of In Touch magazine--to ask what he thought of Trump's laudatory comments. ""I wanted to call him and thank him,"" said Perel, ""and then tell him to make sure to buy In Touch. Because that's where the people who reported those stories are now. I brought them with me."" When I asked Perel about the Enquirer's recent Cruz headlines, he saw zero comparison to his Edwards bombshells, for which the Enquirer received Pulitzer consideration. ""No one has printed a story that says Ted Cruz had an affair and here's the proof,"" said Perel. ""It's not a parallel."" The Edwards story was an Ahab-like mission for Perel, requiring about 18 months of on-the-ground reporting and what one of his former colleagues estimates to have been about a half-million dollars in personnel and budgetary expenses. It began with Perel assigning a ""ghost squad"" of reporters to secretly track Rielle Hunter's movements for months on end--resulting in a 2007 story that alleged Edwards' infidelity. When Edwards haughtily denied the scoop while continuing to campaign for the 2008 Democratic nomination, and no mainstream media outlets picked up the scent, Perel remained undaunted. In July 2008, he sent his team to stake out the many entrances to the Beverly Hilton hotel after he got a tip that Edwards would be meeting Hunter and their out-of-wedlock infant there. Reporter Alexander Hitchen was on that Enquirer ghost squad. He staked out Hunter for months from a rented cottage in North Carolina. He trailed her to L.A., where he stayed up for 36 hours straight to at last catch Edwards red-handed. He eventually confronted the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee and 2008 Iowa caucus second-place finisher across the threshold of a public bathroom next to a Trader Vic's in the Hilton basement. Edwards had fled there in retreat from the cameras, refusing to come out. ""It was low-lit, but you could still see the color run out of his face,"" recalls Hitchen. The somewhat comic video evidence that resulted brought Edwards down, forcing him to confess that he'd lied about cheating on his terminally ill wife (though he continued to deny he'd fathered a child with Hunter until he at last admitted paternity in 2010). Hitchen was among the reporters who followed Perel to In Touch, where, last year, he helped break the story that reality TV star Josh Duggar had molested underage girls. When I asked him about the Enquirer's recent Cruz coverage, he was circumspect. ""I'm waiting to see where they're going with the story,"" he said. ""Given the backlash from Cruz's people, and the accusations leveled against the Enquirer, I would have thought that they'd be pushing the story further by now. Why aren't they pulling out some more revelations about it? It feels strange that it was just a one-off."" Beyond the fact that the Enquirer's Cruz reporting is barely sourced and presents no documented evidence of any kind, there are other compelling reasons not to put much stock in it. For one, it's been suggested that Trump has grown ""cozy"" with the Enquirer and its CEO, David Pecker. The Enquirer has even endorsed Trump's presidential bid. New York magazine has hinted that Trump previously planted a negative story about Ben Carson within the tabloid's pages. With Cruz emerging as Trump's last rival, perhaps it's no shock the paper has set its sights squarely on the Texas senator. There's also the Enquirer's longstanding, well-earned, dubious reputation. Watch Ric Burns' documentary Enquiring Minds to get the full sordid tale of the paper's history, which includes mafiosi, ill-gotten photographs, a longstanding practice of paying sources, and some brilliant distribution innovations. (The Enquirer pioneered those racks holding magazines in your supermarket checkout aisle and sold the excess space in the racks to other publications.) From its inception, the Enquirer was designed to push the boundaries of decent journalism, and it has published lots of hokum. Consider, just in this election cycle, the Enquirer's claim that Hillary Clinton is an alcoholic who's suffered three strokes and is battling multiple sclerosis. ""Failing health and a deadly thirst for power are driving Hillary Clinton to an early grave, The National ENQUIRER has learned in a bombshell investigation,"" began the story, before predicting that Clinton only had six months to live. (The story ran six months ago.) Current Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard declined to discuss the paper's ongoing Cruz reporting, or to address the Trump endorsement. But he did defend the Enquirer's honor in an email exchange. When I asked him why we should believe the paper, given some of the more outlandish stories it's printed, he replied: ""If you think The National ENQUIRER is reporting about aliens today, you have not picked up the magazine for a very, very long time!"" As for paying sources--a longtime, controversial policy at the paper--Howard praised the practice. ""I consider tabloid checkbook journalism more effective and reliable than regular reporting,"" he wrote me, "" especially considering the checks and balances that we have in place for information provided by sources. We only pay for information once it is considered credible and accurate."" The Enquirer paid sources during the Edwards investigation, but Howard says it has not (yet) paid any sources while reporting the Cruz story. Still, the Cruz rumors have lingered, with Cruz's wife, Heidi, still addressing the ""garbage"" allegations in an interview with Megyn Kelly on Fox News on Tuesday night. Perhaps the reason more outlets haven't outright dismissed the story stems from sheepishness at having ignored the Enquirer's Edwards scoop for so long. Edwards' infidelity had been an open secret among journalists at various prestige publications, yet they all failed to track the story down. ""A number of news organizations with resources far greater than The Enquirer's, like The New York Times, say they looked into the Edwards matter and found nothing solid enough to report,"" the Times's media desk wrote the day after Edwards' confession. ""Some of their comments point to a lack of interest in a story about the private conduct of an also-ran presidential candidate, and a distaste for following the lead of a publication they hold in low esteem."" The headline on a subsequent postmortem from the Times' public editor was ""Sometimes, There's News in the Gutter,"" and the story quoted the Times' then-executive editor Bill Keller saying, '""There was a tendency, fair or not, to dismiss what you read in the National Enquirer."" Howard acknowledges he has a different standard from other outlets. ""My line is further in the journalistic distance than most editors',"" he emailed me. ""We win by publishing the truth, and exposing malfeasance or corruption. Therefore, the line about what is okay to publish, and how we get that information, is often considered moveable--given each individual story's circumstance."" The line when it comes to Ted Cruz and his marriage still seems to be way beyond the horizon at this point."	What Happened to the National Enquirer's Ted Cruz Story?

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/the_politics_of_bill_clinton_s_crime_bill_were_messier_than_they_seem.html	"Twenty-two years ago, President Bill Clinton shepherded a comprehensive crime bill through Congress in the midst--though we would later learn it was the tail end--of a yearslong violent crime wave that had claimed close to 25,000 lives the previous year. Many, if not most, of the lost were young and black, victims of drug violence or turf wars or petty theft or just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire of criminal conflict in inner-city neighborhoods around the country. Torn apart by violence, these black communities--where churches and activists struggled to keep young people safe and where parents lived in terror of losing everything they had worked for--demanded action. And Clinton came to them, offering ""tough"" policies that might not bring jobs or repair their neighborhoods, but would keep dangerous people off the streets and offer a measure of safety to ordinary people. Backed by many of the most mainstream black lawmakers and community leaders, Clinton took their fears seriously, even as his proposed remedy divided these communities along class and ideological lines. But at a time when death claimed or threatened a whole generation of young people, it was something. Last week, while campaigning for his wife in Philadelphia before a predominantly black audience of several hundred people, he tried to defend that something against two black protesters. The protesters held signs. ""Clinton crime bill destroyed our communities,"" read one. ""Black people are not super predators,"" said another. Clinton was incensed. ""Because of that bill,"" he said, ""we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate. ... Because of that and the background check law we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence--and who do you think those lives were? That mattered? Whose lives were saved, that mattered?"" Clinton, by this point visibly frustrated, wouldn't let up. ""This is what's the matter,"" he said, pointing at the signs. ""I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-olds hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't! ... You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter! Tell the truth! You are defending the people who caused young people to go out and take guns. ""I talked to a lot of African-American groups. They thought black lives mattered,"" his voice rising as he took and repurposed the chant against him. ""They said, 'Take this bill, because our kids are being shot in the streets by gangs. We have 13-year-old kids planning their own funerals.' "" He pointed to one of the protesters. ""She doesn't want to hear about that."" Here, it's hard not to psychoanalyze Clinton. Between Bernie's challenge from the left and Hillary's decision to move in kind, this presidential campaign is as much a repudiation of his administration as it is a look to the future--Bill Clinton is confronting that as much as anything. But in that confrontation, we vividly see the rapid shift in the politics of crime that has turned his rhetoric--which was once routine for all Democrats--into something that feels out of touch, if not offensive. It's a shift that obscures the degree to which black communities were active participants in the crime debate, both as critics and as supporters. Indeed, Clinton and the protesters are talking past each other and embodying the change in our politics, with the former blind to the new landscape and the latter profoundly informed by it. It's worth saying, first, that Bill's defense of Hillary's ""superpredator"" comments doesn't hold up. When Hillary Clinton spoke about ""superpredators""--referencing a now-debunked theory about crime that had gained currency in both academia and the media--she was talking about the children themselves, supposedly remorseless killers who couldn't be redeemed. They needed to be ""brought to heel."" For today's activists, this language--which played to white fears of monstrous black youth--is emblematic of a Democratic Party and a political culture that locked away an entire generation of young black men. And while an increasingly brown and black Democratic Party has abandoned that language, it lives on in right-wing rhetoric like the kind that surfaced after the killing of Trayvon Martin. The Clintons recognize the ground has shifted. Bill has acknowledged the failures of the crime bill, and Hillary Clinton has both renounced her ""superpredator"" comments and made criminal justice reform a central part of her campaign, lending credence to the idea that Bill's response was more an emotional outburst than a calculated decision. Where Bill Clinton was correct (if self-serving) was in the reality of black political support for the bill. Michael Fortner, a professor of urban studies at the City University of New York, makes this point in a February interview with my colleague Leon Neyfakh:"	The Messy, Very Human Politics of Bill Clinton's Crime Bill	['Clinton']	['guns']
22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/fire_bill_clinton.html	"I wonder if there's a part of Bill Clinton that doesn't really want Hillary Clinton to become president, particularly if she has to distance herself from his legacy to do so. How else to explain why one of the world's most talented and agile politicians is so consistently flat-footed and destructive when advocating on his wife's behalf? How else to explain his terrible and destined-to-be-viral confrontation Thursday with Black Lives Matter protesters in Philadelphia? It started when the demonstrators interrupted Bill Clinton's speech to protest his draconian 1994 crime bill, which, among other things, expanded the scope of the death penalty, enshrined ""three-strikes"" provisions into federal law, and allocated almost $10 billion in funding for prison construction. That bill is now widely seen as contributing to the human catastrophe of mass incarceration. Hillary Clinton is proposing a diametrically different approach to criminal justice, and even Bill Clinton renounced the law last year, though today, bafflingly, he went back to defending it. ""I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-olds hopped up on crack and sent them out into the street to murder other African American children,"" he shouted at the protesters. ""Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't. She didn't! You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter."" The crowd cheered, but most Hillary supporters who watch it online will be aghast, if only out of political self-interest. Right-wing outlets like the Daily Caller and the Weekly Standard rushed, naturally, to post video of Bill's hectoring. At a time when Hillary Clinton is dependent on black voters and campaigning with mothers who've lost sons to police violence, Bill Clinton yoked her to his own discredited policies. He reminded everyone that, in defense of his bill, she'd once spoken about underage ""superpredators,"" language she has since apologized for. Then, Bill Clinton aped the maddening right-wing tendency to derail conversations about criminal justice abuses by invoking black-on-black crime. He might as well have said, ""All lives matter!"" It was a mess, but it's not the first mess he's caused for his wife's campaign. Just a couple of weeks ago, he decried ""the awful legacy of the last eight years,"" which sounded a lot like a condemnation of the Obama presidency--a presidency that Hillary Clinton is doing her best to tie herself to. And in February, Clinton said that if the system is rigged, it's because Americans ""don't have a president that's a changemaker."" One might attribute this repeated clumsiness to the fact that Bill Clinton is getting old; his hearing is bad, and on the trail he looks frail and wan. Perhaps he's simply slipping, mentally. But let's remember that Clinton caused similar problems for Hillary in 2008. There was the time he tried to diminish Obama's victory in South Carolina by noting that Jesse Jackson won there as well. The time he described the idea that Obama had gotten the Iraq war right as ""the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen."" The time--it hurts to remember it--when he complained that the Obama campaign ""played the race card on me."" And yet, after all that, once Hillary had lost and Bill Clinton was supporting Obama, the sloppiness ceased and he was back to performing superbly. (Witness, for example, his celebrated speech at the 2008 Democratic convention.) It is somehow only when he is working on his wife's behalf that he veers into sabotage. What is needed here is probably a shrink, not a neurologist. Either he doesn't want her to overtake him, or he doesn't want her to repudiate him. Regardless, Hillary should shut him down. She can't divorce him, but she can fire him. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."	Fire Bill Clinton	['Black', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/donald_trump_s_long_island_rally.html	"It's often better to attend Donald Trump's rallies as a civilian rather than as a journalist. Journalists are usually penned off from the action, unable to interact with the crowd except as the object of ritual jeers. For Trump's rally Wednesday in Long Island, New York, however, I had no choice: My press request was denied on the grounds that I'd submitted it too late for a rally that had been announced the day before. To be on the safe side, I got to Grumman Studios, a film and TV production facility in the town of Bethpage, a little before 3 p.m. for a rally that started at 7 p.m. and found hundreds of people already shivering in line. Thousands more joined the queue as the hours dragged on. Once the doors opened on the massive soundstage where Trump would speak, not everyone could fit inside; a great crowd pressed up against the bank of metal detectors, chanting, ""Let us in!"" The overflow was a mark of both slapdash logistical planning and local enthusiasm. Trump has recently had a rolling series of campaign disasters, culminating in his weak showing in Wisconsin on Tuesday, but he arrived in Long Island as a conquering hometown hero. In line, his mostly male supporters were salivating at the thought of protesters. One feigned an effeminate, nasal voice and whined, ""Black lives matter!"" Another said to his friends, ""I wanna hear him say, 'Get em out of here!' "" He got his wish but just barely; there were, for a Trump rally, relatively few interruptions by protesters and only two arrests. This was for the best. People were packed into the bare, cavernous space without chairs or aisles; it was hard to move and would have been catastrophic had fights broken out. (One teenage boy was taken to the onsite paramedics after he almost fainted.) The amped-up crowd was thick with bullnecked men in T-shirts or lapel pins marking them as off-duty cops and firemen. It was mostly but not entirely white. I met two exquisitely made-up, middle-age black women in matching fur coats and wide-brimmed red hats who believe that Trump is just the man to shepherd the U.S. through the end of days as prophesied in Revelation. Trump was introduced by his daughter, Ivanka, who had given birth 10 days before. As evidence of her father's greatness, she cited his 1986 renovation of Central Park's ice-skating rink. Before Trump came on, two giant monitors showed a montage of great moments from his life while "" 'O sole mio"" played on the sound system. The music abruptly changed to 2 Unlimited's ""Get Ready for This,"" and Trump appeared. ""It's great to be home!"" he said, exultant. The only new part of his stump speech centered on Ted Cruz's infamous insult about ""New York values,"" which could haunt Cruz now that he's in New York grubbing for votes. ""Do you remember during the debate when he started lecturing me on New York values, like we're no good,"" said Trump. He started talking about 9/11: ""The worst attack in the history of the United States. We all lived through it. We all know people that died. And I've got this guy, standing over there, looking at me, talking about New York values with scorn on his face, with hatred, with hatred of New York. So folks, I think you can forget about him."" The crowd broke into ecstatic chants of ""Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted!"" ""He is Lyin' Ted!"" said Trump. ""But you have to spell it right! It's L-Y-I-N-apostrophe! Lyin' Ted! The Bible held high, he puts it down, and then he lies."" When it was over, thousands crowded onto a narrow pathway to make their way back to a staging area where poorly organized shuttle buses ferried passengers to parking lots and train stations. It was moving slowly, so the impatient climbed through a row of bushes to a narrow, unlighted dirt track. ""We're like Mexicans sneaking over the border!"" someone said. ""This is how the refugees get into Europe!"" added someone else. ""La migra! La migra!"" shouted a third. Hearty laughs rang out. When we emerged, a white man with manic bright eyes pressed a red photocopied flier into my hand. It recounted the dreams that self-described Christian prophets are having about Trump: ""I then heard the Lord speak loudly in my dream 'TRUMP SHALL LEAD THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA INTO TRIUMPH!!!'

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/cruz_victory_strategy_will_now_focus_on_unbound_delegates.html	"MILWAUKEE--Ted Cruz's victory in Wisconsin was the crown jewel of what has otherwise been a spotty group effort to deny Donald Trump his delegates. Cruz leveraged a coalition of evangelicals, well-educated conservative suburbanites, local talk-radio personalities, and the Wisconsin Republican Party apparatus to his advantage in a dominant victory that, once the final numbers are tallied, will give him the vast majority of the state's 42 delegates. It also didn't help Trump to be retweeting things about how Cruz's wife was butt-ugly. The Cruz slogan in the two-week runup to Wisconsin was that the state's primary would mark a turning point in the race, after which the Trump campaign, having been exposed as a fraud by the glorious people of the Badger State, would be reduced to a pile of bones bleaching in the Whitefish Dunes. ""Tonight is a turning point,"" Cruz said at his victory party Tuesday night in Milwaukee's American Serb Hall. ""It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America: We have a choice. A real choice."" But how much of a turning point is it? In his victory speech, Cruz played up the idea of ""momentum,"" chronicling his recent delegate pick-ups in all manner of political events: a caucus, a primary, a few conventions. ""Four very different states--Utah, Colorado, North Dakota, Wisconsin--four victories,"" he said in front of beaming supporters. Sure, these states aren't identical. But his best states have proven to be in the West and the Great Plains, and Rubio's exit from the race made Cruz a much stronger candidate in the Midwest. But now the race heads back to the East Coast. Any chatter of ""momentum"" for Cruz will be extinguished on April 19 with the arrival of the New York primary, which is another way of saying that ""momentum"" isn't a good framework for considering this primary calendar. With a broad, statewide win in New York, Trump can cancel out most of the delegate gains Cruz has made in recent smaller contests. Cruz does have two events scheduled this week in New York: one at a Bronx charter school and another further upstate at a Christian school in Scotia. But the calendar doesn't really pick up for him again until early May, with its contests in Indiana and Nebraska. Cruz's Wisconsin win is a serious turning point in the sense that it was not a win for Donald Trump. Capturing a majority of the 42 delegates was critical to Trump's quest for 1,237 bound delegates; congressional district results so far suggest that Trump will earn three to nine delegates instead. Had Trump won, say, 30 to 36 delegates, as polling a month ago suggested he would, projections would have had him in line to secure his majority. Trump's path to 1,237 has been tight from the beginning; he's never had the luxury of a whiff here and there. Tuesday night was a whiff. Trump's best--perhaps only--shot at the nomination is on the first ballot, and more and more it's looking as if he's going to end up somewhat shy of 1,237 in bound delegates. Campaign strategy now turns to the matter of unbound delegates. There are several hundred of these delegates floating around out there for one reason or another: They were released when candidates dropped out of the race; they were (or will be) chosen at state or local conventions instead of by statewide vote; or, as is the case for most of Pennsylvania's delegates, they will be elected directly on the ballot by voters. Cruz, who is vastly more organized in this regard, has cleaned up so far in these under-the-radar events. Trump doesn't need all that many unbound delegates, but his campaign will likely live or die on its ability to capture some ""50 to 75"" of these, as his adviser Barry Bennett recently told NBC News. As of that report from late March, the Trump campaign considered the 40 days between the end of primary season and the beginning of the convention its window for swaying unbound delegates. It'll certainly be adjusting that timetable now. There's your turning point. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 Republican primary."	It's All About the Unbound Delegates Now	['Cruz', 'Trump']	[]
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/twitter_commentary_about_the_wisconsin_primary.html	Tuesday's Wisconsin primary may spell bad news for GOP front-runner Donald Trump as the three remaining Republican presidential hopefuls compete for the state's 42 delegates. Trump has a comfortable lead in total delegates, but a defeat in Wisconsin, where the most recent polling has him 4 points behind Ted Cruz, will make it harder for him to collect the 1,237 delegates he needs to prevent a contested convention and clinch the Republican nomination. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders polls 3 points ahead of Hillary Clinton, but whether he'll win enough of Wisconsin's 86 delegates to put a meaningful dent in Clinton's sizeable lead in total delegates remains to be seen. Has the Trump machine run out of steam? Can Bernie get into striking distance of the nomination? Pundits and politicos will be watching closely to find out.

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/donald_trump_abortion_comments_exposed_the_incoherence_of_the_anti_abortion.html	"The Republican Party, its presidential candidates, and all major pro-life organizations claim to believe two things about abortion. First, ""unborn children"" deserve the same legal protection as born children. Second, a woman who hires someone to kill her unborn child should not be punished. From these two principles, a third proposition logically follows: A woman who hires someone to kill her born child shouldn't be punished, either. In the past five months, at least three women have been sentenced to death or to long prison terms for recruiting assassins to kill their children. If the GOP, its candidates, and the pro-life movement truly believe that the fetus is a person and that a woman who solicits the death of such a person is innocent, they should step forward and demand pardons for these three convicts. On Nov. 18, 2015, Lisa Graham was sentenced to death in Alabama for recruiting a man to murder her 20-year-old daughter. According to evidence presented at trial, Graham blamed her daughter for destroying Graham's marriage. In a recorded conversation, Graham had reminded her husband, ""I told you that child would ruin my life, didn't I?"" The district attorney concluded that the daughter ""was murdered for the convenience of her mother."" On Dec. 2, 2015, Mae Taylor was sentenced to a 20-year prison term in Virginia for hiring a man to kill her adult son. Police said she did it because her son wasn't helping to cover the cost of raising his child. In a confession, Taylor said she needed the money. During a recorded conversation, she had cited her son's life insurance policy, which would help her make ends meet. On March 18, a South African woman, Thandi Ndlovu, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for paying three men to kill her 25-year-old daughter. Ndlovu and her daughter had been living apart for many years because, as Ndlovu explained in court, the daughter had been born out of wedlock, and Ndlovu's new husband, who was not the girl's father, didn't want to have the girl around. Hiring someone to kill your adult son or daughter is different from hiring a doctor to terminate your pregnancy. But you can also see familiar themes. Sometimes a woman seeks an abortion because she thinks the child would break up her relationship, destroy her marriage, or ruin her life. Sometimes she worries that the father won't support the child financially and that without his help, she can't afford to raise the baby. Sometimes she's in a new relationship with a man who doesn't want some other guy's kid in the picture, so she gets rid of it. Pro-lifers often describe these situations as abortions for ""convenience."" Still, pro-lifers say the woman must not be punished. Last week, after Donald Trump said ""there has to be some form of punishment"" for women who get abortions, he backtracked amid great hue and cry, stipulating that ""the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman."" Ohio Gov. John Kasich agreed that penalties could be applied to ""clinics or whatever, but you don't lay this on women. It's a tough enough situation for them."" Sen. Ted Cruz said ""being pro-life is not simply about the unborn child; it's also about the mother. ... Of course we shouldn't be talking about punishing women."" GOP Chairman Reince Priebus echoed those words: ""Of course we don't want women prosecuted."" Pro-lifers offer several reasons for this lenience. First, they argue, women who solicit abortions do so out of desperation. They feel trapped by shame or financial troubles. Second, they're driven to this desperation by male pressure or by society. Third, they're not the ones who get paid for the killing. Fourth, they feel bad about it afterward. Fifth, the loss of the child they've sacrificed is punishment enough. In recent days, anti-abortion activists have used these arguments to explain why Trump was wrong to suggest that women should be punished. ""Women who choose abortion often do so in desperation and then deeply regret such a decision,"" said March for Life, which organizes the annual rally of pro-life organizations. ""We invite a woman who has gone down this route to consider paths to healing, not punishment."" Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said many women turn to abortion as ""an escape route from a life of unbearable shame, secrecy, and hardship."" The Susan B. Anthony List, another pro-life group, said punishment should be reserved ""for the abortionist who profits"" from the transaction, not for the woman whose male companion ""drove her to the desperation which impels her to the crime."" Charles Camosy, a pro-life scholar and author of Beyond the Abortion Wars, added that even in the absence of explicit male pressure, women should be spared punishment because they're ""coerced into having an abortion as a means of having social equality."" Frank Pavone, the national director of Priests for Life, said Trump was wrong because ""women who have had abortions are already in a prison of guilt and shame."" Women who take out contracts on their born children use the same arguments. Ndlovu told the court in South Africa that she loved her daughter and regretted having her killed. Taylor told the court in Virginia that she was sorry for soliciting her son's murder and ""didn't mean to hurt anyone."" Taylor's son, the only intended victim who survived in the three cases, asked prosecutors to drop charges against his mom. Graham blamed her daughter's death on the man who pulled the trigger, suggesting it was his idea. Graham's attorney argued on psychiatric grounds that Graham didn't really know what she was doing. Graham's son pleaded that if his mom got the death penalty, it would only add to his family's grief. In all three cases, courts rejected these excuses. A court-ordered evaluation found Graham mentally competent, and the judge affirmed the jury's recommendation that she be executed. The judge in South Africa said Ndlovu didn't have to kill her child, adding: ""Parents are required by divine grace to give the gift of life and to preserve it at all costs. Not to take it away at will."" The prosecutor in Virginia, refusing to drop charges against Taylor, cited the importance of ""deterrence of others from committing similar offenses and upholding respect for life and the law."" Isn't that what pro-lifers profess? That the law must deter violence and uphold respect for life? That killing your child is never necessary? That life is a divine gift, and mothers have no right to take it away? If you really believe these things, shouldn't women who pay to have their fetuses killed be punished, just like women who pay to have their born children killed? If pro-lifers shrink from this conclusion--if they continue to make excuses for women who procure abortions while rejecting the same excuses for women who procure the deaths of their born children--then there's only one logical explanation: They don't really believe abortion is morally equivalent to killing a person. They sense that something about abortion-- the fetus's limited development, or its location inside the woman's body, or the moral seriousness of weighing parenthood before you've actually taken it on --mitigates the gravity of the deed and the culpability of the procurer. In their rebukes of Trump, you can see signs that pro-lifers share his doubt. Officially, the National Right to Life Committee asserts, ""The baby living in her mother is as distinct and unique a separate person/human being as I am from you. This human being, as we all do, has the unalienable right to life and deserves full protection under the law."" But in its reply to Trump, the NRLC stressed that it ""has long opposed the imposition of penalties on the woman on whom an abortion is attempted or performed."" The woman on whom an abortion is attempted. Apparently, the NRLC forgot that abortion, as an act of termination, is aimed at the supposedly distinct baby, not at the woman. Kasich, Moore, and the Susan B. Anthony List committed the same slip, describing women, not their babies, as the victims who ""receive"" and ""undergo"" abortions. Never mind that the woman pays to have the baby killed and leaves the clinic alive. March for Life, which claims that its anti-abortion position ""follows the basic homicide laws,"" chastised Trump for prescribing punishment instead of ""healing."" That's how you talk when you know, somewhere in your brain, that abortion is a medical procedure, that the woman is the primary patient, and that the physical and moral relationship between her and her fetus is complicated. But maybe I'm being unfair to Cruz, Kasich, NRLC, and other pro-lifers. Maybe they really believe abortion is murder. In that case, they'll endorse clemency for Lisa Graham, Mae Taylor, and Thandi Ndlovu. Any day now. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 Republican primary."
