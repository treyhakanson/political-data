Today is Election Day. Today's Good News for Romney: On Election Day, the math still isn't in Romney's favor, but it's not over. Romney thinks his path to victory is to win 61 percent of white voters as long as white voters comprise 74 percent of the vote--and the Obama camp agrees. One campaign staffer told the Daily Beast the biggest fear was ""a huge white turnout. Kind of like what Bush hit us (John Kerry) with in '04."" The latest polls show 59 percent of white voters supporting Romney--the biggest racial split since 1988. Meanwhile, we already have the data on early voting, which shows that there were fewer registered Democrats voting early this year than there were in 2008 by a 4- to 8-point margin across swing states. Though the Obama camp has reason to be optimistic, they should be concerned about turning out the base, and the early voting numbers aren't a great sign. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope."	Why Today Could Still Be Mitt Romney's Day	['Kind', 'Romney', 'Obama']	[]

Most people in the steady lunchtime line were black. Add this to my small pile of anecdotes from Virginia, which has memorably huge lines in Northern Virginia and Richmond. And add something else--the absence of any presence from True the Vote, the independent, conservative, poll-watching organization that grew out of the Tea Party. Before I got to the polls, True the Vote had an announcement: It was going to have trouble policing Ohio's Franklin County. In order to watch the polls and potentially challenge voters, you have to either 1) be a member of a major party or 2) get five possible watchers to sign a form saying they can do it. True the Vote filled out the forms, but the Franklin County Board of Elections rejected them, explaining that the documents might have been falsified. True the Vote, predictably, called this ""a final, desperate attempt to deny citizens their right to observe elections."" But Democrats remained sort of worried that the True the Vote crew would show up anyway. The people on the forms didn't pick up when I called. They didn't show up in east Columbus. A Democratic poll watcher, Phil Hart, sat sketching a table while a Republican poll watcher, Chris Walsh, was checking his phone. They'd both heard the True the Vote ""falsification"" rumor and found it amusing. ""Wouldn't that be ironic!"" Hart said. Neither of them was challenging any voters. We're going to see more paranoia before this ends. I'm listening to Rush Limbaugh as I drive, and he's informing listeners that a test page put up at Cincinnati.com, a list of early votes that was just written for fun to check the system, is possibly legit. ""It has Romney up by 90,000!"" Limbaugh said. True the Vote may be wasting the precious time of Tea Partiers who could be getting out the vote. Limbaugh's at least serving as a distraction."

I can match them against the campaigns. So, for example, the Obama campaign says there are long lines in Madison, Wisc. and I rate that true because people on the ground there report long lines and lots of same-day registration. The Romney campaign says the vote is down in the Democratic stronghold of Miami-Dade County, and I rate that as not true because of stories of people waiting in line and my television screen which shows people in a line in Miami-Dade that seems to stretch to Georgia. On CNN, they are people saying they've waited in line for three hours. This is the last desperate gasp of the spin war. Here's what I'm hearing from the campaigns. From the Obama campaign: Those Madison lines are long. This is Dane County, a big Obama area. The Obama campaign said 10 percent of its 2008 tally came from same-day voter registrations on Election Day. They're banking on it again. So if this holds all day, it's a sign Obama is running up the score in the areas he needs to win. Obama folks are also reporting big turnouts in their strongholds of Cuyahoga County in Ohio and across northern Virginia. Team Romney's best turnout facts on background from the campaign: Two-hour lines reported in Florida's Walton County, a county that voted 73.2 percent for George W. Bush in 2004--21 points above the statewide percentage for Bush. Sounds impressive, but Walton is a pretty small county. There are lots of other GOP strongholds they should be boasting about. Walton went for McCain by 72 percent, which means it is the reddest of the red. The Romney camp is also saying there are hour-plus lines in Florida's Escambia County (Pensacola). This is a more robust county and would mean that Republicans are turning out their vote, if this is a sign of genuine turnout. Also news out of Pasco: long lines and Republicans outvoting Democrats by nearly 2 to 1, says the Romney team. The Romney campaign calls this a swing county, but it's not really a swing county. In 2008, Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 percentage points. He lost Pasco County. Two years ago, Rick Scott narrowly won the governor's mansion by 1 point. His won Pasco by 9.

He got there 15 minutes into his final Ohio speech, after he and his wife, Ann, exited an airplane that had been slowly and dramatically parked in front of the crowd to the ear-splitting sounds of Aaron Copland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man."" ""If the president were to be re-elected,"" said Romney, ""he still wouldn't be able to work with the people in Congress, of course, because he's ignored them. He's attacked them. He's blamed them. The debt ceiling will come up again. And then there'll be a threat of shutdown or default. And if that happens, the economy will become frozen. You'll have a harder time finding jobs. The president was right when he said he can't change Washington from the inside, only from the outside. Let's give him that chance!"" Those words got floor-stomping cheers from the crowd of 10,000 or so Republicans, which included two members of the aforementioned Congress. Those guys had been there, voting in unison against the February 2009 stimulus package. Rep. Eric Cantor, now the House majority leader, had told Republicans not to vote for the bill, to deny it any ""bipartisan"" cover when Barack Obama's approval was at his apex. When the GOP obliged, Cantor's office released a video called ""The House Republicans Are Back!"" Calculations of all the alleged stimulus waste appeared onscreen as Aerosmith's Steven Tyler screamed, ""I'm baaaaaack! I'm back in the saddle again!"" At this late date it feels strange to argue that the Republican Party, in the Obama era, has been unusually obstructionist. Senate Republicans have filibustered bills and judges at a steadier pace than any previous Congress. The current class of House Republicans bent the debt ceiling vote into a showdown over spending cuts. After the pathetic compromise that ended that fight--the sequester, an automatic $1.4 billion of spending cuts that will probably get punted--Standard & Poor's downgraded America's credit rating and moaned that ""the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues."" Hearing Mitt Romney say he'll fix this problem is like watching Cleavon Little hold himself ""hostage"" in Blazing Saddles. But he's trying to collect on a bet that Republicans placed years ago. Since January 2009, they've denied Democrats cover on their own bills, expecting voters to blame the president when Washington failed. If it doesn't work today, it will go down as one of the weakest long games in political history. Here's the first problem. Voters don't actually hold President Obama responsible for everything that's gone wrong in their capital. According to Gallup, the president enters Election Day with a 52 percent approval rating--not that unusual, after months of campaigning and mudslinging. More compelling are the polls that have shown, consistently, that voters bear residual ill will against the last Republican president. In mid-September, when CNN asked voters whether they blame Barack Obama or George W. Bush for their economic problems, 38 percent said Obama and 54 percent said Bush. This was four full years after Lehman Bros. But Republicans have never taken that seriously. On Fox News or talk radio, the very mention of Bush starts the conservative host laughing at the pathetic idea of ""blaming Bush for everything."" In Columbus, Romney hit the nerve like this: ""On January 20, I won't just take office. I'll take responsibility."" This shifts the ""blame Republicans"" burden from the voters, who believe it, to the president, who sounds pathetic when he says it. ""A lot of people who blame Congress are probably the people who get their information from the evening news, which slants the story against Congress,"" said Lisa Pranckh, a Dublin, Ohio, mom at the Columbus rally. The ""blame Obama"" case should be easy to make. In September, Bob Woodward published a tick-tock of the debt ceiling fight. It was, by far, the most jaded and damning portrait of the president published by a journalist with access. (This excludes Ed Klein and his secondhand anonymous sources.) The Romney campaign immediately lifted one anecdote from the book for a TV ad, telling voters that the hapless Obama couldn't even get Democrats to listen to him during the stimulus fight. In October, after Romney blamed Obama for the sequester--which was purely a product of the debt deal, and which Paul Ryan supported--Woodward spoke up, confirming that White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew had endorsed the idea, as a trigger for a better deal. In Woodward's telling, as well as Romney's, it doesn't matter that Republicans were intransigent. What matters is that Obama did not win them over. Weak presidents happen. John F. Kennedy didn't know how to get big bills through Congress. Neither--more importantly, for Republican purposes--did Jimmy Carter. Of course the problems in Washington are Obama's fault. If voters agree with that analysis, Republicans can undo it. What if they don't? Ask that question and you see how dangerous the ""no bipartisan cover"" bet was. Republicans expected to be running against a president whose signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, would be struck down by the Supreme Court. They expected that from the day they won their first lower court case to the moment they actually got to Page 6 of the court's decision. Had it happened, the strategy of denying bipartisan cover to Obama--and some buy-ins that Republicans might have liked--would have worked. But as soon as the court upheld the law, voters stopped thinking of it as unconstitutional. Also part of this bet: Control of the U.S. Senate. In 2010, Republicans thought they had a bank-shot chance of winning control of the chamber. They did spectacularly well, but lousy candidates in Nevada, Delaware, and Colorado (though I always feel bad about lumping Colorado's Ken Buck together with Christine O'Donnell) kept them at 47 seats. This year, they were dead-bang certain that they'd take the Senate. If the polls are right, they won't. That's why Romney's close-out speech refers to ""executive orders"" that will undo Obamacare, not to anything that can pass the Senate. Why are they losing the Senate races? Consult the map. In Maine, the retirement of liberal Republican Olympia Snowe has opened the door for Angus King, a liberal independent who has run against the very idea of the modern, filibustery Senate. In Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren is now favored (narrowly) to beat Sen. Scott Brown because she's pulling around 80 percent of Barack Obama's voters. Republicans are canceling this out with expected wins in North Dakota and Nebraska, which would finally, after years of ticket-splitting, have all-GOP Senate delegations. They might win Montana; Democrats might hold off Tommy Thompson and win in Wisconsin. All of these poll numbers and possible outcomes can be explained by partisanship. The voters in all of those states are acting with impeccable logic. So were the voters who chose the most conservative candidates in their primaries. They want, at the federal level, representatives who'll push with maximum force when they have power and resist with maximum force when they don't. It's tough to convince them that the failure of Washington is Barack Obama's fault. Republicans did want him to fail. Their voters wanted him to fail, too. On the long, cold walk out of the Romney rally, I trudged next to an older couple wearing garb they bought at 2009 Tea Party rallies. Cathy Bender, a child-care specialist, wore a shirt that read, ""I Hate It When I Wake Up and Barack Obama is Still President."" I asked her about Romney's version of the gridlock story. When Republicans won the House in 2010, setting up two years of brinkmanship, how should Obama have responded? ""He should have stepped down,"" she said."

Mitt Romney faced an incumbent with a mediocre job-approval rating who had presided over the worst recovery from a recession in decades. Barack Obama, meanwhile, faced a milquetoast challenger with a long history of pandering flip-flops. Either man could have conceivably been able to beat such a weak foe. Now that President Obama has won, Republicans will be devastated by election results that could have gone the other way. Democrats, meanwhile, are euphoric at having threaded the needle to pull out a victory. Now that it's all over, there will be gloating, declarations of mandates, and speculation about how great the next four years will be from the Democrats. From the GOP there will be despair, hand-wringing, and speculation about the dire consequences of this defeat for the American people. Thanks to Twitter, we can watch the celebration and jubilation of the winning side and the recrimination and desolation of the losing side in real time! Below are the live tweets of 20 liberal pundits, surrogates, candidates, and politicos on the left-hand side of the screen and 20 conservative pundits, surrogates, candidates, and politicos on the right-hand side of the screen.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/presidential_election_how_ohio_could_come_down_to_evangelicals_the_tea_party.html	"COLUMBUS, Ohio--World Harvest Church is situated on 57 acres southeast of this state's capital. A driver can spot it from a quarter-mile away, the 5,200-seat chapel poking out of flat land dotted by flags. You walk in and are greeted by black ushers--striking in the suburbs. You take a pew and the parishioners--again, mostly black--chat amiably as TV screens count down the seconds until the service begins. When the countdown reaches one minute, a curtain rises and reveals a stage large enough to fit a Les Miserables finale. The service starts on time, with a gospel choir, then into some keyboard-and-guitar-powered pop-gospel that sends half the audience into a palm-raising rapture. The real magic is the chorus, repeated again and again in higher keys: My soul my soul
 magnifies the lord
 My soul
 Magnifies the lord
 My soul
 He has done great things for me
 Great things for me At the front of the room, a 50-something man with a sharp suit and slicked-forward hair pumps his fist and bounces on his heels. The Rev. Rod Parsley turns to the audience, banging his head, beckoning the faithful, asking them--there's really no other way to put this--to raise the roof. Years ago, after it was too late, Democrats realized that Rod Parsley had outsmarted them at the polls. He was an early backer of Ohio's gay marriage ban, which boosted George W. Bush over John Kerry, especially with conservative blacks. The next year he co-founded Reformation Ohio, calling for a ""Holy Ghost invasion"" that would register 400,000 voters and spread the gospel to 1 million people. In 2008, he endorsed John McCain for president. Then came a fuss over Parsley's opinion of Islam (""the greatest religious enemy of our civilization""), and the candidate denounced his endorser. Today, right before another election, Parsley isn't doing much for any candidate. ""Think of the princes of Israel,"" he says, pacing the stage, his amplified voice rising to a shout. ""Those government leaders who tax and tax, and tax and tax, and tax and tax, and stole from the women, and took from the children, to finance things that they did not need!"" But: ""I'm talkin' about all of them. Vote themselves raises, and then ask you for more taxes to pay for it, when you already can't pay your bills. But please don't complain! You're in the top 25 percent of the richest people on the planet if you live on the streets of Columbus."" Parsley tells the crowd that Democrats and Republicans, both of them, were just as helpful in passing relief for the Christians of Darfur. He doesn't sound like a man with a candidate. If Mitt Romney wins Ohio, an outcome that would now be seen as an upset, it will be the way George W. Bush won it: Republicans and religious groups blowing the doors off on turnout, swamping the Democrat lines in Columbus, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. The old conservative turnout machines are supposed to be augmented by the Tea Party. They will outplay the Democrats' data campaign and the unions and the black churches' ""souls to the polls"" operation. Will they? Here's a quick guide to the nonparty groups that are expected to push out voters. The Evangelicals. They're working in plain sight. At Romney's show-of-strength rally in Cincinnati, Focus on the Family's ""Values Voter bus"" parked near the entrance and volunteers passed out voter guides that told extremely forgetful people about the president's stands on gay marriage and abortion. The local Citizens for Community Values passed out their own versions of the same guides; volunteers for that Cincinnati-based group are traveling the state in RVs, church to church, trying to recapture the Bush magic. ""If the Christian vote comes out,"" said a voter at Romney's rally, ""we win."" Maybe. In 2004, according to exit polls, 25 percent of Ohio voters were white evangelicals or born-again Christians, and they broke for George W. Bush by 52 points. In 2008, the evangelical share of the vote was actually higher--30 percent--and John McCain carried it by only 44 points. Even if McCain had scored those Bush numbers, he would have lost. And no one can tell you whether the first Mormon presidential candidate can pull similar numbers. Some conservative leaders are counting on fear of Obama more than affinity with Romney. The Tea Party. In a DoubleTree hotel north of Cincinnati, in one of the ground-floor suites, David Koch's Americans for Prosperity has gathered a small army of canvassers. In the parking lot: two vans for organizers, plastered with slogans reminding people that ""[Democrat Sen. Sherrod] Brown Cast the Deciding Vote for Obamacare."" Had I arrived earlier Saturday morning, I would have seen 10 passenger vans taking 236 AFP volunteers into the swingier parts of the suburbs. The man in charge is Corey Lewandowski, AFP's New Hampshire state director. As we talk, two volunteers walk in, ask for directions, and are given tote bags of AFP gear before heading out to canvass. ""At every door,"" says Lewandowski, ""they ring the bell. If someone answers, they ask, 'Do you think this administration's policies have helped or hurt the economy?' "" This is called ""persuasion"" canvassing. AFP started its get-out-the-vote effort Sunday, but from the time I first checked out its operation in Virginia to the time I got to Ohio, it was using a sophisticated system of lists and tablets to have door-to-door talks, not to turn out the votes of those already persuaded. In Ohio, where early voting has been possible since Oct. 3, I was a little surprised by the focus. And then I found this strategy in other Tea Party groups. Four years ago, Ed and Gena Bell spent the last weeks of the campaign canvassing for John McCain, on behalf of the local Republican Party, in their Cincinnati suburbs. After the 2008 elections, they became founders of the local Tea Party. This year, they're working with FreedomWorks, the other umbrella Tea Party group, and canvassing--but not for Mitt Romney. They're having conversations with voters who they hope will vote for the GOP's U.S. Senate candidate, Josh Mandel. Some of the Tea Party's membership has joined the GOP machine. Those working for big Tea Party groups, though--they're either working quietly on ""voter integrity"" challenges to the voter rolls or working parallel to the party, trying to outdo it. ""Whether it's Republicans, or Democrats, Ohio or New Hampshire, I don't understand the relevance of parties anymore,"" says Lewandowski. ""They're not using tablets. They're using paper and information that's probably a year old."" The Black Church. On Saturday evening I walk down to the basement of New Hope Baptist Church, north of Cincinnati's Martin Luther King Boulevard. The AFL-CIO has joined the community-organizing AMOS project and a group of black pastors for a small, pre-""souls to the polls"" rally, starring the Rev. Jesse Jackson. He's late, thanks to a Chicago plane delay, but a moderator says he's driving in ""as fast as he can, within the law."" When he arrives, he hangs back and lets the AFL-CIO's Arlene Holt Baker finish her speech about how ""the poll tax was very expensive"" to her family, before the Civil Rights Act was passed. Jackson's turn. He walks to a podium and leads a low-energy version of his standard chant. I am!
 Somebody!
 I am!
 Somebody!
 I work.
 Respect me.
 Protect Me.
 Pay Me.
 Stop the violence.
 Save the children.
 Stop the violence.
 Save the children.
 Save the workers.
 Save the families. The speech is rote, and the union volunteers sort of sit through it, but the pastors love it. ""This vote suppression is going to backfire on somebody,"" he says. Everybody in the room can finish the thought--since early-voting hours were extended, the Republicans will lose. ""It's better than four years ago,"" says Jackson, after the speech is over. ""We didn't know it would rain. Dry machines, wet people. People voting until midnight. People are more ready now to fight the schemes."" On Sunday, after the church service, I check out the ""souls to the polls"" effect in Summit County. The county is only 15 percent African-American; the polling place is in Akron, which is 30 percent African-American. Most of the people queued up to vote are African-American. The Unions. Sunday afternoon, after I finish talking to the queued at that early-voting site, I walk a block and a half to the party Democrats are holding for their faithful. A small crowd noshes on sandwiches, chicken wings, and brownies decorated with patriotic icing. Members of the local machinists union are here. The Teamsters, I'm told, are busy at their ""war room"" up the road, where they're trying to cut into the Republican advantage in the suburbs and rural counties. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, was just out there, in Brilliant, Ohio, on his way to campaign in Pennsylvania. Molly Ball's reporting nails it: The labor vote is Democrats' not-at-all-secret weapon in Ohio. In 2011, while their comrades in Wisconsin were only winning two of the three state Senate recall votes they needed to take power in the chamber, Ohio unions were getting out votes to repeal the state's Wisconsin-esque union reform bill. They won with 62 percent. Lesson 1: It's easier to drive a ballot measure to victory than it is to defeat a candidate. Lesson 2: Of all the third-party groups fighting it out tomorrow, they know best where their voters are, and how to persuade them."

Iowa and New Hampshire--two swing states where Romney had gained ground in recent weeks--have now tipped darker blue, thanks primarily to support from women. A new poll of the Granite State shows Obama with a 5-point advantage, the same margin by which the president leads in Iowa. (A massive weekend rally in Concord with Bill Clinton probably didn't hurt Obama's numbers there.) Another poll gives Obama a surprising 6-point lead in Colorado, a state in which Romney once held a small but steady advantage. Even more unexpectedly, PPP gives Obama a  4-point edge in Virginia and a solid 5-point lead in Ohio, back up from a virtual tie last week. So long as Ohio stays blue, Obama only needs a handful of other swing states to reach 270 electoral votes.- See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/ohio_early_voting_there_s_no_vote_suppression_when_you_can_vote_absentee.html	"Elsewhere in Slate, Emily Bazelon argues that voters should not have to wait so long for early voting. It is hard to be an Ohio resident these days. Sure, all the attention from Jon Stewart and the New York Times is nice. But there are the ads that spoil my college-football watching, the robo-calls that disrupt my family time, and the door-knockers that leave me wondering. (If Obama is sending volunteers into my extremely Republican neighborhood, does that mean he's desperate or does it mean he's got a surplus of volunteers?) But what is most frustrating is that you can't look at Twitter, Facebook, or RealClearPolitics without reading a hyperbolic, hand-wringing column from a liberal bemoaning the fact that Ohio is a backward, Third World-caliber banana republic just because people have to wait in line to take part in early voting. Give me a break. It's true that Secretary of State Jon Husted* is a Republican, and it's true that he's fought to limit early voting this election, the result being that Ohio had a shorter early-voting period this election than in 2008. Is he acting in a partisan manner? Probably. In 2008, there were 35 early voting days, including weekends. This time around, there were 19 days total, mostly during the week, and over the final weekend, the hours were from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. (However, as long as you were in line by 2 p.m. on Saturday or 5 p.m. on Sunday, you were allowed to vote.) But that doesn't mean that Ohioans are having their vote ""suppressed"" or being denied the ""right to vote."" After all, voters still had 19 opportunities to vote early in person, an option that is not even available, except in extraordinary circumstances, in 18 states. Moreover, Ohio is one of only 27 states who have no-excuse absentee voting. And the much-maligned Husted mailed every Ohio voter an application for an absentee ballot. (The Ohio GOP also mailed out ballot applications, and I suspect the Democrats did, too.) If you didn't want to wait in line, you could vote from your kitchen table. A common question I see is, ""If people are waiting five hours to vote for early voting, how bad will it be on Election Day?"" Actually, there are plenty of legitimate logistical reasons that voters have to wait in line for early voting but may not have to wait that long on the big day. When one goes to vote on Election Day, one goes to a church or a school or community center that is in your precinct, or a similar location that houses several precincts but is still close by. But you can't have schools and churches open for early voting for an entire month, so early voting necessarily takes place at fewer locations. Further, you would have a hard time staffing wider polling hours. The kindly old folks who staff our precinct might look like sweet volunteers, but they are pocketing more than $100 a day. That adds up in smaller counties and rural areas with tight budgets. I still remember going with my parents to vote when I was growing up. Our polling place was my elementary school, and we would stand quietly behind our parents when they went into the mysterious booth and made all those mysterious grown-up decisions. I looked forward to the privilege and responsibility. And I have voted in every election--and almost every primary--since I turned 18, whether it was local or presidential, or whether I lived in a swing state or the bluest of blue states. I think that everyone should have a fair shot at getting to the polls. Early voting and absentee voting are great, and making Election Day a holiday would provide a great civics lesson for new generations of voters. The system could be better, but the system--at least in Ohio--is not broken. By and large, we all have a right to vote. We don't have a right to demand that the election be held at the 7-Eleven. Correction, Nov. 5, 2012: The article originally misspelled the name of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/obama_and_romney_should_stop_sampaigning_and_help_victims_of_hurricane_sandy.html	As I write this, Mitt Romney is 179 miles away from me, attending a rally in Lynchburg, Va. Joe Biden is even closer, just down Route 7 in Sterling, hosting his own campaign event. Barack Obama is on his way from Madison, Wis. to Columbus, Ohio. Paul Ryan's in Colorado.  All four candidates will spend today hip-hopping from rally to rally in a total of eight battleground states. At these events the candidates will fire up supporters, cheer on their get-out-the-vote crews, and maybe land a mention on the local news. They won't, their handlers fervently hope, make any real news. And it's hard to imagine that, for all their frantic speech-giving and baby-kissing today, they'll change the minds of more than a handful of voters. You know where the candidates won't be today or tomorrow? The places that could really use their visit: the areas of New York and New Jersey hardest hit by Hurricane Sandy. There, gas shortages, continued power outages, and an oncoming nor'easter bedevil millions of Americans. Imagine if one or the other of the presidential candidates scrapped his plans for the rest of the day. What if Mitt Romney loaded up his campaign jet with contractor bags and batteries, flew to JFK, and spent the day on Staten Island cleaning up the debris-covered streets? What if Barack Obama hung out in Hoboken, N.J. handing out blankets to the needy? Or, if they're afraid their entourages might do more harm than good, what if they both suspended all advertising until Election Day and sent that money to the Red Cross instead? It would accomplish a number of things. First of all, the visuals would be inspiring. I expect donations to organizations and communities in need would skyrocket in the wake of such a visit. Americans would be inspired to volunteer, to chip in, and to do their part. Second, it would help put things in perspective. It would highlight that even at this politically charged moment, there are things more important than elections, or spending tens of thousands of dollars on crowd control, placards, security, and advertising just so your campaign can get its 20th touch of an undecided in Ohio. Lastly--and most pragmatically--think about this. If you were an undecided voter, what would be more likely to sway you toward a candidate: Yet another stump speech, or a picture in tomorrow's newspaper of one of the candidates mucking out a house in the Rockaways? As the curtain closes behind you in the voting booth, you're looking for one last reason to pick one guy over the other. It's hard to think of a message more inspiring than: This guy cares more about Americans than about campaigns as usual. Wouldn't you pull the lever for that guy? I know this idea is naive. I don't expect either campaign to seize on this notion--to respond to what I hope might be an outpouring of support for the idea on Twitter for #CandidatesHelp, or to calls in the media that I wish would be at least as loud as the gripes about the New York City Marathon were last week. It's a real shame. Today the candidates are wasting time and energy scrambling for votes. Tomorrow they're sitting in Chicago and Boston watching TV. Why not do something good for the world--and good for your campaign--instead? Why not help?

So please, someone, explain some things to me. For instance, Republican spin-meisters are reportedly preparing to blame Hurricane Sandy if President Obama wins re-election. But, assuming the analysis is true--and it's dubious--why is this a matter of ""blame""? For months now, Mitt Romney and his surrogates have been slamming Obama for lacking ""leadership""--a baseless accusation, but again, let's say there's something to it: a major storm, which requires federal assistance, is surely a test of presidential leadership. If the response had been dreadful, as was, say, George W. Bush's to Hurricane Katrina, Romney would be trumpeting it as proof of his claim. But, as just about everyone agrees, Obama's performance has been exemplary. If anything, Sandy has served as a vindication of his administration--and a refutation of Romney's loudest charge. Then there's the argument that if Romney wins, it will only be because he moved to the center and that, therefore, in order to be re-elected four years from now, he will govern in the center as well. This logic makes no sense whatever. If Romney wins, it will be because, in addition to the near-majority (say, around 47 percent) that would have voted for him had he remained a ""severe conservative,"" another 4 or 5 percent were swayed his way by his moderate assurances in the campaign's final weeks. Which constituency would he serve in the Oval Office: the base he'd long been cultivating or the last-minute converts, a group barely one-tenth the size with no organized pressure group behind it? The question answers itself. A similar argument, filed most eloquently by David Brooks and the Des Moines Register editorial board, is that, because President Romney would be able to count on the support of all the Republicans and a handful of Democrats, he could break the logjam in Washington and get measures passed. But this raises the question: What measures does he want passed? If he turns out to be more centrist than the GOP stalwarts in Congress, he may face great resistance. (House Speaker John Boehner couldn't keep his rank-and-file in line; why should Romney think he could do better?) If, as is more likely, he returns (or succumbs) to his party's right-wing mainstream, Senate Democrats will certainly be able to muster the 41 votes necessary for filibusters.* Either way, a Romney presidency is no solution to gridlock. Then there are those, like David Frum, the Republican apostate, who sees in the New Romney a candidate who meets his standards of what the GOP should, and once did, stand for. (Long ago, before the Iowa caucus, I asked Frum--who had just been excommunicated from the American Enterprise Institute--if he could vote for any of the Republican candidates. He replied, ""I could vote for the good Romney."" Apparently, Frum has found him.) But if the Romney of the debates is the real Romney, how ""good"" can he be--how good can anyone be--after spending the last two years, before the revelation, lying through his teeth? And how does Frum know that the Romney of the debates--who loves schoolteachers and, of course, would give FEMA all the money it needs--is the real Romney? Nobody knows, even reportedly many of Romney's own aides. Romney is, at best, a Rorschach blot: the ultimate faith-based candidate. Finally, there is the most revealing clue of Romney's true sentiments: Paul Ryan. The running mate and Ayn Rand acolyte has kept his distance from reporters in these final weeks, since the ticket-leader's 180 shift. But Romney has re-embraced Ryan, referring to him, just on Friday as, second to his wife Ann, ""the best choice I've ever made."" Only a real caveman lawyer would say anything like that. Correction, Nov. 5, 2012: Because of a production error, this article originally referred to ""the 60 votes necessary for filibusters."" (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/presidential_election_bill_clinton_is_campaigning_hard_for_barack_obama.html	"CHILLICOTHE, Ohio--Nineteen-odd years ago, before he'd spent a full month in office, President Bill Clinton flew to this city of around 20,000 people for his first national town hall meeting. He introduced the local Democratic congressman, Ted Strickland, who'd flown in with him, and the business that supplied wheels for his ""famous bus tours,"" and some school officials. Then he got down to business with his first somewhat hostile crowd. ""Why are we denying the right to life for the 4,400 human beings a day and 1.6 million human beings a year in the murder of an abortion?"" asked one voter. ""In your address to the joint session of Congress,"" said another, ""nothing was mentioned about tort reform."" Clinton, in prime feel-your-pain mode, handled this with minimal difficulty. Each question could be dispatched with short lists of economic data, and when that failed, he could slip in an anecdote of real pain from somewhere in real America. ""Salesman Clinton All but Clinches Deal,"" reported the Baltimore Sun. In 1996, after some reversals, Clinton easily carried Chillicothe's Ross County. No Democratic candidate for president has done so since. On Thursday afternoon, while Barack Obama stumped in western states, Clinton returned to Chillicothe to save him. When I arrived at the local Ohio University complex, two hours before the start time, around 1,000 voters were already lined up to see him. A confused jogger stopped at the front of the line and ruefully asked who was coming. ""President Clinton,"" said a man holding a copy of the president's memoirs. ""Oh, Clinton?"" said the jogger, replacing his iPod earbuds. ""Cool!"" The people in the queue outdid one another with praise for Clinton. What was better with him in the White House? Everything. ""You could walk across the street and get a job,"" said Dean O'Brian. Fifty years old, he had lost a job at ConAgra at the end of the Bush years, struggled through some manual labor gigs, and this year, finally scored a job he liked--a managerial role at a company that produced doughnut ingredients. But everything was better under Clinton. ""He's up there with Kennedy as the best we've ever had,"" said O'Brian. Ross County is around 90 percent white, and so was the crowd at Clinton's rally. John and Agatha Zikowski, 63 and 62, reminisced about how much better the city was when Clinton was president. Jeremy Brown, a 33-year-old software engineer, claimed that Clinton's speech at the Democratic convention managed, all on its own, to convert his Republican friends to Obama voters. It didn't last, but nothing Obama had ever done had swayed them. ""As far as I'm concerned,"" said Brown, ""he's our Camelot."" ""What's Camelot?"" said his daughter, Eliza. ""Oh, when Kennedy was president, they called it Camelot."" As we talked, a rolling, trolling flatbed truck from the Ohio Republican Party rolled by and slowed down. It carried an electronic billboard with this message: In Obama's Economy, Every Ohioian's Share of the National Debt: $51,000. The Clinton crowd laughed and booed. ""Clinton's the only one who ever did anything about the debt!"" said Joyce Childers, a 72-year-old Democratic volunteer. She wore a shirt mocking Obama ""birthers,"" with the slogan ""Made in the USA,"" and excitedly told me about driving Ted Strickland around when he was running for Congress and lacked a car, right before he and Clinton came to that town hall in Chillicothe. Strickland was in the room again on Thursday, tasked with introducing the former president. Five years older than Clinton, the governor of the state until the Tea Party wave took him out in 2010, he talks like a politician one or two generations removed--his quavering voice, on tape, sounds like a recording of someone schlepping war bonds for the boys fighting up the boot against Mussolini. He quoted the scripture not once but twice--he has a master's from divinity school--to condemn Mitt Romney. ""As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he!"" said Strickland. ""And in that [47 percent] video, we saw something of Mitt Romney's heart! And it was not a pretty picture!"" This sounded like raw, underdog, populist politics. When Clinton arrived, he cut the volume by at least 20 decibels. ""I have lost my voice in the service of my president,"" he said, croaking the words out. But Clinton doesn't lose his voice like other people. As he talked, the croak disappeared. Ten minutes into the speech, it was gone. With no real skeptics in the audiences, Clinton would be, alternately Barack Obama's Ambassador of Nostalgia and Secretary of Explaining Why Things Aren't So Bad. He did this, at first, by putting on a pair of enormous glasses and reading from the newspaper. ""Here's a headline from USA Today,"" he said. ""GM's profit tops expectations. Another headline, which says Chrysler sales at five-year high. And then, there's this from USA Today--when disaster strikes, voters put competence over ideology."" Big cheers. Everybody intuited that ""competence"" meant their neighbors thinking harder about an Obama vote. He wasn't their favorite president, but he'd tried hard enough. And Clinton could explain, at great length, what had worked. ""Last week,"" he said, ""there was a big headline in the USA Today that said health care costs were the big reason that millions of middle class people did not get a pay raise in the last decade, because employers had to spend their profits on health insurance premiums. A lot of you had that experience, didn't you?"" Sure, finding a job and, generally, being alive had been easier when Clinton was president. But all of those wonderful, wonky things that Clinton had wanted to do, that he'd promised in 1993--Obama had done them! They were just tough to explain. Medicare reform, for example. ""Barack Obama did not weaken Medicare."" Explaining this meant walking the audience through health care reimbursement pricing. ""They start out at 114 percent of Medicare's price, and drop something like to 112 percent. They guarantee 12 percent revenue. How many businesses in Chillicothe would love to get a guaranteed 12 percent revenue? If grocery stores got that, they'd be richer than Wal-Mart."" Clinton kept talking, with no stab at anything like an applause line. The Democrats reacted like they were hearing applause lines anyway. I was sitting not far from a woman with a green shirt and the text ""I'M IRISH! Do I Get a Free Drink?"" who whooped at most of the wonky numbers and filmed what she could on an iPhone. The possible disaster, said Clinton, was an Obama loss that both undid the gains and let Romney take credit for the incipient recovery. Would Democrats really put up with the backlash and never get the credit? This went on for 45 minutes. It wasn't clear what it would do for Obama. The only ""news"" Clinton made all day Thursday was a verbal flub at an earlier stop, accidentally saying he was in ""Pennsylvania."" For whatever reason, the press and tracker corps that follows these campaign events leads with the flubs. Post-convention, Clinton can't get a national audience to pay attention to all of this. With no notes, he says it anyway. ""There is no limit to what we can achieve, and I want Barack Obama to lead the way!"" said Clinton. ""We need you."" He turned and walked off the stage, into the rope line. The guy with the copy of Clinton's bio made sure to find a place there."	Can Bill Clinton Push Obama Across the Finish Line?

Four days to go: Today's Good News for Romney: Flush with cash as Election Day draws close, conservative super PACs have begun making a last-minute push for Mitt Romney in several light-blue states. Pennsylvania, where Obama's lead has fallen below five points, will see $3.2 million worth of advertisements this week courtesy of two right-wing super PACs: Americans for Job Security and Restore Our Future. Restore Our Future is also dropping $700,000 in New Mexico, where Obama has maintained a comfortable lead, and $1 million in Minnesota, where the president has a shaky three-point advantage over Romney. This 11th-hour flood of money presents a serious challenge to Obama, who must continue to hold his lead in these three key states by spending time and money he should be utilizing on more contested swing states. If Pennsylvania, New Mexico, or Minnesota slips away from the Democrats and pushes Romney over 270, it'll be a potent reminder of what a post-Citizens United democracy looks like.

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/presidential_election_mitt_romney_may_win_the_race_because_he_ignored_conservatives.html	"If Mitt Romney wins the election, it will be because he ignored conservatives. After he won the primaries, many of the most prominent voices in the movement plead with him to run loud and proud as a conservative and to campaign overtly on conservative ideas. He never did that, and he's ending the campaign on a moderate note, a move his strategists believe will capture the disaffected Obama voters he needs to win the election. The strategy appears to render a verdict on a long-standing debate in conservative circles over whether candidates can campaign on conservative ideas like privatizing Social Security, offering Medicare vouchers, or drastically shrinking the social safety net. It also gives us some limited insight into the inner heart of Mitt Romney and how he might govern. At least tactically, he's acted pragmatically, not ideologically. Starting in the spring and spilling over into the summer, Romney got a regular dose of advice from the most prominent public conservatives: Bill Kristol, Charles Krauthammer, and the Wall Street Journal editorial page. They all counseled him that he couldn't win on a platform of not being Barack Obama. He had to unfurl the conservative banner, and proclaim these bold ideas from the rooftops. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker survived a recall vote, it seemed to ratify the idea that a person could govern as an unabashed conservative. Walker said that the one lesson from the recall was that he should have been more open about his plans. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels made a pragmatic rather than political case. Unless Romney explained his conservative solutions as a candidate, he'd never have a mandate for governing. Romney resisted these appeals for weeks--and then he picked Paul Ryan. For a moment, it suggested that he'd been quietly listening to the conservative commentators all along. Ryan was a twofer. He had put conservative principles in practice and he was a leading advocate of the loud and proud approach. He had been a member of the Romney advice chorus before he was picked. In 2004, when President George Bush pushed for private Social Security accounts, many Republicans thought the idea was toxic. Ryan, however, campaigned on it, arguing when he won that if you bravely backed the idea voters would reward you. But picking Paul Ryan was not the same as running on Paul Ryan's programs. The Romney campaign boasted that selecting Ryan meant that Romney was making tough decisions and backing conservative solutions, but there was very little evidence that Romney and his campaign were actually going to campaign on those solutions. Medicare is a good example. Romney distanced himself from the details of the Ryan plan--absolving himself of the tricky math questions by arguing that private-sector competition would solve the problem of maintaining quality care while reducing cost. But then he never really ran on the idea itself. Giving a speech in which you savage the president for cutting Medicare is not the same as running on your ideas for the program. In fact, Paul Ryan seems more changed by running with Mitt than the other way around. How transformed is Ryan? (Politico called him Mini-Mitt) He recently gave a speech on income inequality. That's a far distance from running on conservative principles. This isn't to say that conservatives are not concerned about income inequality--Ryan talked about it before he was a national candidate--but income inequality is not an issue conservatives consider in their wheelhouse. It is often the case that conservatives think that talk of income inequality is an attempt to pit one class against the other. Indeed, Mitt Romney thought this; he once said that talk of income inequality should be confined to ""quiet rooms,"" and not the campaign trail. When Democrats raised the issue of distribution of wealth and inequality, he claimed they were practicing the ""politics of envy."" Wisconsin Gov. Walker rendered the final verdict on the watering down of Paul Ryan. ""I was enthused when Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan because I thought that was a signal that this guy was getting serious, he was getting bold,"" Walker told a local radio host. ""I just haven't seen that kind of passion I know that Paul has transferred over to our nominee."" Walker believed that Romney was in synch ideologically with Ryan, but that he wasn't being vocal enough about it. ""They need to have more of him rub off on Mitt, because I think Mitt thinks that way but he's gotta be able to articulate that,"" he said. He wasn't the only one who noticed. The Weekly Standard reporter Stephen Hayes said the Romney campaign has reverted to the pre-Ryan moment. Bill Kristol also called for more brio. But now no one is making too big a fuss because Romney's moderate Massachusetts strategy has improved Romney's standing. It's conventional Republican wisdom that Romney succeeded in the first debate because voters--particularly married women voters--found him to be a likeable, moderate fellow. The campaign has been running with this ever since. Previously Romney had been downplaying his conservative positions. Now he is either running away, or, in some cases--like his position on legislation to allow companies to deny employees contraception coverage--actively changing them to a more moderate posture. (If the election were held on New Year's Day, he might come out for Obamacare.) This leads to some head spinning conversations with Romney strategists and surrogates. More than once they have boasted that what people are now seeing is the true Romney. They remind you that their candidate had to withstand all of those accusations that he was ""Moderate Mitt"" during the primary season. That's proof that he's always been the far more reasonable, centered candidate. What makes you reach for the Dramamine is that when Romney was being called ""Moderate Mitt"" he and his campaign were steadfastly rebutting the label. It was about this time that Romney started calling himself ""severely conservative."" In the end, all of this shape-shifting leads to confusion about what Mitt Romney will govern. Will it be the fellow who was trying to court conservatives in the primaries or the one who is appealing to moderates now? Or, will he be pragmatic, calculating his political positions based on the composition of the Congress and the forces in the larger electorate he'll still have to appeal to once he's in office? Romney has been sounding notes of bipartisanship since the first presidential debate on Oct. 3. The election is all about coming together with Democrats, he says. ""I've got to make sure and reach across the aisle,"" Romney said at a recent campaign stop. ""I gotta find, I know there are good Democrats who love America just like we do. I'm going to reach across the aisle to them and work together, put the interests of the people ahead of the politicians. We've gotta do this. It's too critical a time. We can't change course unless we change the way Washington is working."" It's another shift in tone and it appears to be working--at least with many of the 200 undecided voters I've been corresponding with. It doesn't seem to be costing Gov. Romney support with conservatives who are banking he'll return to the fold when he's in office. Romney's new spirit of bipartisanship actually seems in keeping with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christies, our most recent example of a big name Republican saying good things about the other side. Christie has been sharing the stage and praising President Obama for his fast response to Hurricane Sandy. It is completely in keeping with Christie's reputation for calling it as he sees it--even if it might upset Republicans. That's what works for Christie, as he recently told Esquire: I caught a guy in high school who went on to play pro ball. His father was this quiet retired Marine drill sergeant. This kid threw a ninety-four-, ninety-five-mile-an-hour fastball. But he also had a good curveball. Freshman year one game, we made a guy look silly on two curveballs in a row -- strike one, strike two. I called a third curveball. The kid hit it about 350 feet. That night I went to my friend's house for dinner. And his father said to me in his quiet way, ""Chris, let me ask you something. That third curveball: I couldn't see from where I was standing. Did you call it or did Scott shake you off to the curveball?"" And I said, ""No, I called it."" And he put his fork down on his plate -- I can close my eyes and still see this guy doing this -- and he said to me, ""Don't ever do that again."" If you're gonna get beat, get beat on your best pitch. Mitt Romney has always seemed awkward playing the severe conservative. It's not his best stuff. He might lose this thing--the polls in the battleground states aren't looking good--but since Oct. 3 he's been going with his best pitch. He's no longer taking advice from the Scott Walkers of the world. He is listening to the more pragmatic Chris Christies. If Romney loses, those will be the battle lines for the next GOP contest.

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/richard_mourdock_questions_about_rape_and_abortion_have_become_a_problem.html	"Shortly after 5, on Wednesday, I was wrapping up a conversation about ""rape gaffes"" with Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. She has had a lot of conversations like this, especially about the U.S. Senate race in Indiana. An internal poll for Rep. Joe Donnelly now showed him up by 9 points over Republican state Treasurer Richard Mourdock. A previous poll had showed Donnelly up by 7 points. Mourdock's own polling suggests, at the very best, a tie. All because Mourdock had said ""even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,"" and had chosen a televised debate as the place to say that. ""Anytime somebody mentions rape,"" said Dannenfelser, ""the other side thinks it's over for that candidate. But voters are smarter than campaigns think they are. Women are smarter than they're cracked up to be. Mourdock did a good job explaining what he believes."" I hung up and greeted my inbox. The first story: ""Republican Congressional Candidate Opines on 'The Rape Thing.' "" John Koster, who's running for the new 1st district in Seattle's suburbs, had wondered whether ""putting more violence onto a woman's body and taking the life of an innocent child that's the consequence of this crime"" was really the way to deal with the aforementioned Thing. Among his endorsers was, of course, the SBA List. And the only reason that either issue had come up so awkwardly, in either race, was that Missouri Rep. Todd Akin had mused about legitimate and nonlegitimate rape, two-and-a-half months ago. This question is going to haunt Republicans if, next week, they blow a few elections that they should have won. Why, why, why do their candidates keep musing about abortion in cases of rape? Akin they could explain away as an anomaly, a cow-licked holy roller who'd gotten arrested at abortion clinic protests and spoken out for the poor, benighted militia men. But Richard Mourdock? The soft-spoken state treasurer of Indiana? He'd never been arrested in front of any clinics. I understand the confusion. Back in February, I spent most of a day with Mourdock as he tried to get noticed at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Most of the time, he was humble and intelligently ignored the bait easy or gaffe-ready questions. At one point, though, he described the new success he was having in politics, and got a little teary-eyed. ""I do have an ability to stand in front of a room of people, and talk, and watch those faces as people change their minds,"" he said. ""It's something I never thought I'd do. At age 60, I find out, I'm pretty good at this. I can change minds."" That was Mourdock's bad bet. The same miscalculation made by Akin and Koster, even though the content of each quote is apples/oranges different. (No one but Akin suggested that holy hormones could prevent a rapist's semen from implanting in an egg.) As my colleague Will Saletan has reported, at least 12 Republican candidates for Senate this year hold the same ""life is a gift"" position against the rape exception. But Mourdock chose to defend a moral stance because he thought he could convince people. It wasn't just his stance. Logically, it was theirs. And this is what drives Republicans mad about the race. Mourdock's opponent, Donnelly, refers to himself as ""pro-life."" At the pivotal debate, he gave a clipped, quick answer to the abortion question that made less sense than Mourdock's. ""I believe in pro-life,"" he said, which sounded weird on its own. ""I believe that life begins at conception. The only exceptions I believe in are for rape, and incest, and the life of the mother. In regards to contraception, I believe women have the right to quality health care."" He believed that life starts at conception, but he was willing to let doctors and women end it in certain circumstances. Republicans can't believe he's getting away with this. ""Donnelly claims he's pro-life but he's gone lockstep with Democrats,"" said Greg Fettig of Hoosiers for a Conservative Senate, which helped to unite Tea Party groups behind Mourdock and ultimately win the primary. The SBA List's ad in Indiana hits Donnelly for his vote on the Affordable Care Act. And that vote is probably worth explaining. Like Rep. Bart Stupak, Donnelly initially refused to support the health care bill for fear that it would fund abortions. Stupak and Donnelly switched their votes when the president promised a mostly toothless executive order that reaffirmed the no-money-for-abortion language. Most of the Stupak caucus lost their elections in November. Donnelly survived, then co-sponsored the Republicans' ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,"" which (in initial drafts) changed a legal reference from ""rape"" to ""forcible rape."" So it should be Donnelly, not Mourdock, who's squirming to explain his abortion stance. For a while he was, giving mushy answers about his stance on the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate. Then Mourdock effectively bailed him out, and Donnelly has benefited from third-party attacks on his opponent. They work because voters are also skittish about the question of when life begins. Just this week, a national YouGov poll asked Americans when abortion should be legal. A full 67 percent favored some restrictions or total restrictions. A full 74 percent wanted to keep it legal in cases of rape or incest. Republicans are better off when then this distinction never gets explored. Akin's supporters are convinced: The initial backlash to their candidate, the establishment's attempt to remove him in favor of one of a half-dozen Republican stars, made the damage worse. Akin's had to cobble together support from social conservatives, and to an extent, it's worked. Mike Huckabee and the Family Research Council are in Missouri for Akin right now. Akin's adviser Rick Tyler can count off the spending that's collating for the final stretch--a $387,000 coordinated buy with the state party, $800,000 from the Now or Never super PAC spending $800,000, a $550,000 ad from the Faith Family Freedom Fund, and $900,000 of Akin's own funds. But Republicans don't normally need to spend that much to ""fix"" an abortion question. The issue works for them when it's sublimated and obscure. Mourdock and the other victims of Akinmania aren't particularly bad candidates. They've just failed to be as hypocritical as their voters."

Obama is up another 0.7 percent today in national polls, he still leads in critical swing states, and Nate Silver puts his odds of winning at a jaw-dropping 91 percent. Still not reassured? Then look at it this way--for Romney to have the edge, polls would need to be statistically biased in Obama's favor by 4 percentage points, according to a study by Columbia political science professor Robert Erikson. If the pollsters are that wrong, Obama won't be the only one out of a job tomorrow. Even if polls statistically favor Obama by 2 percent, Erikson gives Obama a 65.9 percent chance of winning.

Florida-based National Campaign Supply claims to have designed the original ""I Voted"" sticker and first printed it in 1986, but each state or county decides the design of their sticker--or to have none at all. This morning Twitter and Instagram was flush with more lucky voters (and their kids!) who were happy to share their confirmation.

I don't know any Democrats here that are worried about losing Pennsylvania to Mitt Romney. That's in large part because--far more than Ohio, with which it is often paired--Pennsylvania has become a state that Democrats think they can win on mobilization alone. Any scenario for Romney to win Pennsylvania has to be predicated on the assumption that Obama will fail to mobilize black voters even at the levels John Kerry did. So it's a nice little synecdoche for the turnout assumptions that seem to have guided Romney's strategy all year and that sustain the disbelief Republicans who see his internal polls have about the public polls showing Obama leading just about everywhere. Late moves by Romney and his allies to get on TV here seem like they may be evidence of what I think of as supply-side campaigning. Available spending opportunities narrow in the final days of a campaign: Several weeks before election day is too late to open and equip field offices, hire and train staff. A week out it is too late to print new direct mail and get it into the system. One reason robocalls remain persistent in our political culture, even though there's good evidence they're ineffective, is that when you get to the final weekend there's nothing else to spend money on. The Romney campaign has had unpredictable cash flow, and like the Obama campaign, is making a lot of spending decisions not based on tactical acumen or a broader strategy but a need to spend it all by the close of business. (Remember that Kerry squirreled away millions in 2004 in anticipation of a recount, and has been mocked for it ever since. Seemed prudent to me!) Obama has produced early-vote Frisbees distributed on Ohio college campuses; Romney has purchased TV ads in states where he barely invested a dollar until last week. Why Pennsylvania? There's inventory available on local stations because the campaigns and outside groups have treated the state as a foregone conclusion for months, and the Senate race turned out to be a dud. So unlike in the other battlegrounds, you can still buy last-minute TV time in Pennsylvania. I'll be keeping my 215 number on in the hopes of catching a robocall or two.

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/presidential_election_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_are_ending_their_campaigns.html	"If you are still undecided and haven't voted, you don't have a lot of time to read position papers and rewatch the debates. You certainly don't have time to read a five-part series on presidential attributes (though you should). On the other hand, you may be undecided because you've read everything, and the more you read the more confused you become. Whatever camp you're in, time is drawing short. So here is a quick rundown of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's closing arguments and parting shots. Barack Obama: Fight. President Obama is ending the campaign on a pugilistic note. Though he starts his rallies by nodding to the spirit of brotherhood that prevailed in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he presents himself as a warrior for regular people. He has settled on a narrative of combat, telling the story of his presidency as a series of tough and unpopular battles--from the auto bailout to his health care plan. And, in this story, it is the middle class he seeks to defend. Covered with scars and bruises, he promises not to give up the fight for programs that will help build the middle class. ""You know that I'll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how,"" he says frequently. The word fight appears more than a dozen times in his speeches. He presents himself as a bulwark against the Republicans in Congress but also against the privileged class of financiers and uber-rich that Romney is supposed to represent. ""The folks at the very top in this country, they don't need another champion in Washington,"" he says. ""The laid-off furniture worker who's retraining at age 55 for a career in biotechnology--she needs a champion. The small restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down--he needs a champion. The cooks and waiters and cleaning staff working overtime in a hotel somewhere, trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college--they need a champion."" The president is making a deal with his audiences: If he isn't going to give up on the fight, he is asking voters not to give up on him. Obama's closing argument video. Obama's closing argument speech. Mitt Romney: Change. Mitt Romney has appropriated Obama's message of change from the 2008 campaign. Every challenger is naturally a change candidate, but Romney is using the word change as often as a checkout clerk. The comparison to President Obama doesn't simply end with the use of his words, though. Romney has been measuring Obama against his 2008 promises. ""Instead of bridging the divide, he has made it wider,"" says Romney. His closing argument has little red meat. The base is already fired up, so the former governor of Massachusetts isn't talking to them. Romney's closing message is to undecided voters--particularly undecided women. He will turn around the economy because he's turned things around before. ""I built a business, and turned around another. I helped put an Olympics back on track. And with a Democratic legislature, I helped turn my state from deficit to surplus, from job losses to job growth, and from higher taxes to higher take-home pay."" The argument closes on an elegiac vision of togetherness. ""On November 7th, we'll get to work. We'll reach across the street to that neighbor with the other yard sign and we'll reach across the aisle in Washington to people of good faith in the other party."" Without coming out and saying it, Romney is closing his final campaign rallies with a message of hope. This is the ""hope"" portion of President Obama's 2008 message, though in today's partisan Washington it sounds more like a fantasy. Romney's closing argument video. Romney's closing argument speech. The campaign of 2012 is now down to a matter of hours. We have endured an endless number of speeches, a litany of supposed gaffes and game-changers, hundreds of millions of dollars in advertisements, and a battleground map that barely moved despite all of the above. Tomorrow, provided the lawyers don't get their way, one of the candidates will earn the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Then, we will know whether Americans want a fighter or a new day. There's nothing left to do but vote and count."	Do Americans Want a Fighter or a New Day?	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]

In Florida, several new polls have confirmed Romney's advantage, giving him a lead of between 2 and 5 point. The Sunshine State's 29 electoral votes have been highly contested throughout the campaign, but Romney's down-to-the-wire wooing of Floridians seems to have paid off. Romney has also effectively maintained his advantage in North Carolina, where the candidate leads by between 2 and 4 points. Before the first presidential debate, Obama had a fairly good chance of capturing the Tar Heel State, but in the closing month of the campaign, the Democrats have watched the state slip away. Even more promisingly for Romney, another poll this weekend placed the two presidential candidates in a tie in Pennsylvania, a must-win state for Obama. The Romney campaign has seized upon this apparent momentum, holding rallies in the Keystone State and blitzing it with advertisements. If Romney can swing the state red at the last minute, it might very well get him to the magic number. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

The 2012 race has featured a particularly rich crop of presidential insults, fueled perhaps in equal measure by social media and the candidates' highly punnable names. Obama haters call the commander-in-chief Nobama, Obozo, and Obummer, among many other pejoratives. Anti-Romneyites call the GOP nominee Mittens, R-Money, and Mitt the Twit. Which of these nicknames is the most popular? To find out, we scanned Twitter for six and a half hours last week in search of Barry, Mittens, and 11 other election-related taunts. We then checked those tweets for political keywords to ensure that we weren't pulling in, say, advertisements for mittens.

After a campaign where no fact, poll, or dependent clause was beyond debate, we're going to start getting actual votes. Barack Obama's ground game will either live up to the hype or it won't. Mitt Romney will either win Ohio's 18 electoral votes and prove almost every poll wrong or he won't. Obama will either win Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Minnesota or David Axelrod will have to shave his mustache. The voters will finally speak, which reminds me of Mo Udall's line after losing: ""The voters have spoken. The bastards."" Here are some of the questions I'm hoping will be answered by the poll results and the exit poll tabulations. I've had such good luck with thoughtful reader responses recently, I'm also interested in what questions you'll be looking to have answered on Tuesday. Email me your ideas at slatepolitics@gmail.com. Will the popular vote winner match the Electoral College vote? Election watchers started to talk about this possibility when Romney led in the national polls but not in the battleground states. If it does happen, we may not know until after Election Day, as provisional ballots, military ballots, and mail-in ballots are tallied. Some Western states, not crucial to the battleground competition, may still be counting their vote for days. What economic question mattered most to voters? Obama has consistently polled ahead of Romney when people are asked which candidate cares about people like them. Romney has consistently out-polled President Obama when people are asked which candidate can better handle the economy. The exit polls should help us understand which question voters had in their head when they made their choice. How much has the electorate changed? If President Obama wins, what will his coalition tell us about the electorate? In 2008, he won 80 percent of the minority vote and 43 percent of the white vote. Minorities represented 26 percent of the electorate and whites the remaining 74 percent. He is almost certain to increase his share of minorities, with such strong support from Hispanic voters, but will they turn out? The fewer of them who turn out, the more Obama will need to stick close to his 2008 share of the white vote. If Mitt Romney wins, it will be either by maximizing his totals among white voters--beyond the 55 percent that McCain received. (Ron Brownstein says he needs to get 61 percent. Gallup's most recent weekly data has Romney at 60 percent with whites.) Or, Romney will need white voters to make up more than 74 percent of the electorate. That's unlikely. Whites have declined as a portion of the electorate in every presidential election since 1992. Does Obama's coalition include white college-educated women? In 2008, Obama lost white men and women without college degrees and he lost among men who had a four-year college degree. But he won a 52 percent majority of white women with a four-year college degree. He's been going after that vote very hard this campaign by talking about pay equity, health care insurance for contraception, and trying to tie Romney to the abortion views of more extreme elements of the Republican Party. Will he keep his majority and maybe expand it? Who did blue collar white men in Ohio vote for? Nationally, Democrats traditionally lose the white blue-collar male vote. Walter Mondale only received 31 percent of their vote nationally. Obama won 39 percent in 2008, which was actually the party's best performance in a long time. In Ohio, Obama may do better because of his support for the auto bailout and his relentless attacks on Romney for embodying everything that caused the economic downturn--an outsourcer, a layoff artist, and a distant Wall Street-like executive. If Obama can hold down Romney's margins with this group, it might be his key to winning the state. Did the relentless ads in Ohio doom Romney? This will be hard to tell from the exit poll data, but if Romney does poorly with white working-class voters--a group Obama is doing poorly with in polls in the rest of the country--it may be attributable to the barrage of ads run against Romney in the state. Hopefully the exit polls will ask about the auto bailout as well as which candidate ""cares about you."" Answers to those questions might give us a basis for some early conclusions, especially if Obama does better on the ""cares about you"" question in Ohio with white male blue-collar voters than in other states. Did Obama build two different coalitions? If Obama wins in Virginia, Colorado, or Nevada, it will be because he combined suburban college-educated women, younger voters, and minorities. If he wins in Ohio, it will be with a very different coalition. To win nationally, Obama was supposed to build a minority-focused coalition and get around the bad economy. If he wins Ohio, it will likely be because he did better with nonminority voters and because of his contribution to the state's economy. Should Romney have introduced ""Moderate Mitt"" earlier? I'm not sure how we'd test for this in the exit polls, but based on the responses of the undecided voters I corresponded with, the governor's more moderate tone was highly appealing. By most polls, this race only got tight after the first presidential debate, when Romney unveiled his more moderate posture. If only he'd deployed it earlier, some undecided voters have told me. What if he did? Would he have had enough time to elbow Obama off the political center or would it have cost him the conservatives he always needed to be competitive? Are the kids alright? In 2008, President Obama received 66 percent of the 18- to 29-year-old vote. Young voters did not make up a significantly greater share of the electorate than before--only 18 percent--but Obama got a much bigger percentage of them than John Kerry did in 2004. Will his margin remain as big and will they turn out in significant numbers? How will the low unemployment swing states vote? There are five swing states with unemployment rates below the national average of 7.9 percent: Iowa (5.2 percent), New Hampshire (5.7 percent), Virginia (5.9 percent), Wisconsin (7.3 percent), and Ohio (7 percent). There are four swing states with a rate above the national average: Nevada (9.6 percent), Florida (8.7 percent), North Carolina (9.6 percent), and Colorado (8 percent). Nevada has the worst rate in the country. Seventy percent of the houses have mortgages that are worth more than the property. Yet Obama is likely to do well there--and without an auto-bailout to champion. Perhaps it's all about demographics in Nevada (26 percent of the state is Hispanic, making it the largest relative percentage of Hispanics in a battleground state). In other words, demographics keep Obama competitive, but he must rely on enough low unemployment states to break his way to win. Who had the better ground game? The Obama team's vaunted ground game banked a lot of early votes. Republicans say that they will be able to make up their deficit on Election Day. We'll know soon whether Democrats only turned out their usual supporters in early voting--cannibalizing their numbers--or whether they found new voters, turned them out early, and then still held strong on Election Day. What is the relative health of the Tea Party? In the Senate contests, Republicans are counting on some conservative candidates like Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock whose recent missteps may cost the Republicans their chance at controlling the Senate. On the other hand, Ted Cruz, a Tea Party favorite in Texas, will win and is poised to become a strong conservative voice. Depending on which Senate candidates win and whether the Republicans take control of the Senate, we'll get an early sense of the sophomore reputation and development of the movement that was so crucial to the GOP victories in 2010. Did the selection of Paul Ryan change the map at all? Before Obama won Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes in 2008 by 14 percentage points, the state was very close. Al Gore won it in 2000 by just 5,000 votes. In 2004, John Kerry won it with just 11,000 votes. How close will it be this year and will that be attributable to Paul Ryan? Obama won Ryan's district by 14,000 votes in 2008, but George W. Bush carried it with 27,000 votes. In 2000, Al Gore won it by 4,600 votes. If Romney doesn't win Ryan's district, how much can the veep pick have been worth? Did seniors get spooked by Medicare? Democrats traditionally lose the older vote. Obama lost it by 8 points in 2008. Seniors represented 22 percent of the vote in Florida, one of the highest in the country. (Seniors only make up 18 percent of the vote in Ohio, for example.) Will Obama get more than 45 percent of Florida's seniors, which is what he got in 2008? Paul Ryan's plan for Medicare vouchers were supposed to move some seniors into the Obama camp. But maybe the relentless years of advertisements against Obamacare turned off elderly voters for good. Did Romney out-perform McCain in his red counties? John McCain really did not turn out the Republican base in 2008. In 44 states Republican turnout was down in 2008 from the previous election. Can Romney fire up the team across the board? Will there be ticket-splitting? We look at the presidential map, and the ideologies of our country seem fixed. There are red states and blue states. But in the Senate races in Indiana, Arizona, Montana, Massachusetts, and Missouri, candidates from the ""other side"" are doing well. The races are close, demonstrating that the nation is more purple than the maps charting the presidential contest suggest. There are also some interesting Senate races in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, and Nevada. Will voters pick a Senate candidate of one party and a president of another? The most interesting place to watch that will be Virginia. Democrat Tim Kaine looks strong going into the home stretch. Watch how voters in Henrico, Hanover, and Chesterfield counties vote.* Kaine was the former mayor of Richmond, the city surrounded by those counties. That might get him more votes than president Obama which could mean Kaine could win the state while Romney does too. Correction, Nov. 6, 2012: This article previous referred to the city of Richmond, Va. as a county.

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/early_voting_republicans_have_tried_to_restrict_access_to_voting_for_partisan.html	"Elsewhere in Slate, Rachael Larimore points out the logistical problems that lead to early-voting lines. If you believe in broadening the franchise in democracy for the many rather than the few, the complaints from people who spent a chunk of their weekend waiting at the polls are infuriating.  Like this one from Myrna Peralta in the Miami Herald: ""This is America, not a third-world country. They should have been prepared."" She spent almost two hours in line with her 4-year-old grandson before being shut out in Doral, Fla., the home of the election headquarters in ever-crucial Miami-Dade County. This was on Sunday, after elections officials opened the doors for four hours for in-person absentee voting--and then suddenly shut them midstream when the mayor of Miami-Dade demanded it. (He said he hadn't agreed to the Sunday hours.) Almost 200 people were waiting and some of them actually banged on the doors, shouting ""Let us vote!"" Eventually, amid a barrage of phone calls to his office, the mayor gave in. Everyone who was still in line at 5 p.m.--about 400 people--got to cast ballots. But who knows how many gave up along the way. And why all the waiting and the craziness in the first place? The problem is that early voting has become intensely partisan. Democrats increasingly press for more of it and Republicans for less.  It's sad: In a country known for low voting rates, where Election Day isn't a holiday and Tuesday lines at the polls deter people from showing up, early voting should be a bipartisan cause. Both parties could put their energy into increasing turnout for their side. Instead, the Republicans who litigate against early voting--and in favor of voter ID--talk about following the rules, even though the rules they are crafting have such self-serving ends, and inveigh against voter fraud, even though in-person vote stealing almost never actually occurs. In Miami-Dade, the weekend chaos was the result of the Republican mayor's response to litigation over a state law that stopped early voting on the Sunday before the election. That's right: There used to be more opportunities to vote in Florida and now there are fewer. Democrats went to court over the weekend over extending early voting in Broward and Palm Beach counties as well as Miami-Dade. (Does anyone else feel like just listing the names of these counties brings on a Bush v. Gore migraine?) The Democrats went to court after Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, refused to extend early voting despite all the complaints about long lines and voters who were giving up and leaving. Scott claimed that ""the process was running smoothly,"" the New York Times reported. He's also the guy who pushed through the state law cutting back early voting from 14 days to eight, as well as eliminating it altogether this past Sunday. (The polls only ended up open on Sunday in some places because of the lines and snafus on Saturday.) Republicans also insisted in cutting back on early voting in all-important Ohio, where it was allowed for each of the five weekends before Election Day four years ago, and this year is allowed for only one. It's hard not to draw a line between that narrowing and a study released last month by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which found that black voters vote early at 26 times the rate of white voters. This study was conducted in Cuyahoga County, an Obama stronghold. Then there's this statement in the Washington Post from the Ohio AFL-CIO, which is campaigning hard for the president:  ""This is what works for working-class folks. If they have a 9-to-5 job, they've got kids to pick up and a lot going on, the weekend is when they'll be able to get time to go vote."" I suppose you could argue that given the resistance from Republicans, it's amazing that early voting happens at all in swing states. The federal appeals court that forced Ohio to open the polls for this past weekend pointed to ""the unacceptably burdensome situation at many Ohio polling sites during the 2004 election where, in some countries, voters were required to stand in line for long hours and until late at night."" The lesson of the weekend from Florida is that cut off by officials like the Miami-Dade mayor, early voting can also leave voters hanging. Maybe the hope is that if you frustrate people enough, they'll quit asking for it. But what we should want is exactly the opposite: More polling places open at more times when all kinds of people can get to them. And a commitment from both parties to fight the turnout war instead of this misguided fight to choke off access."	Why No One Should Have To Wait Two Hours To Vote	['Obama']	[]

These are their responses. Click here to read Editor David Plotz's explanation for why we share this information with you. Laura Anderson, assistant editor: Barack Obama Full disclosure: There is probably a 0-percent chance I will ever vote for a Republican presidential candidate in my life. But Romney is particularly unappealing; I'm appalled by his apparent inability to empathize with people who are less advantaged than he is. I haven't agreed with every single one of Obama's decisions as president, but his administration's failure to live up to expectations has more to do with the petty obstinacy of Republicans in Congress than with a lack of character or competence on his part. Plus, Obama has demonstrated a commitment to women's reproductive freedom and has at least paid lip service to marriage equality, both issues near and dear to my heart. Emily Bazelon, senior editor: Obama I'm voting for Barack Obama because I want to live in a country with more opportunity and greater equality. I also want a government that will make Obamacare succeed instead of narrowing access to health care. I care about the rising cost of medical services and entitlements, and about the national debt. If I thought Mitt Romney, the moderate governor of Massachusetts, would show up as president, I'd be open to his candidacy. But I don't--not with this Republican Party and leadership in Congress. Also, the future of the Supreme Court is at stake. Jeffrey Bloomer, Slate V editor: Obama I have already cast a vote for the president. I have selfish reasons, like health care: I'd prefer my domestic partner didn't have to pay $122.54 monthly in federal taxes on my benefits--and the only change Mitt Romney wants to make to DOMA is to codify it into the Constitution. Really, though? Even if Romney is who he says he is this week, then he believes in near-term military action against Iran, deep cuts to safety nets, and a Supreme Court in the ""mold"" of Scalia and Thomas. Not a difficult decision. Will Dobson, politics and foreign editor: Obama I grew up in a Republican household. I have voted for Republicans and Democrats. Party identification has never been the most important factor for me. At least, it wasn't. But given the direction the Republican Party has moved in my lifetime, on a whole host of issues, it feels like the height of irresponsibility to vote for Mitt Romney. I am willing to believe that Romney could be a good president. If he had always portrayed himself as the former governor of Massachusetts, he could have made a play for my vote. But I don't care for the company he keeps. And when he promises to nominate another Scalia to the court, he seals the deal. Greg Engel, software engineer: Jill Stein For me, this election comes down to a stark choice between a wide-eyed idealist who's often been labeled a ""socialist"" and a comparatively tough-minded pragmatist best known for briefly holding elected office in Massachusetts. It's a genuinely difficult choice! So it is with some ambivalence that I've decided to vote for Jill Stein of the Green Party rather than Peta Lindsay (of the Party for Socialism and Liberation.) Molly Fabbri, art intern: Obama 1. Obama hasn't accomplished everything I wanted him to, but I'm not nearly disappointed enough to switch sides. I still agree with him on most things and I have a little extra hope leftover from 2008. 2. America invaded two countries before I was voting age. I feel a vote for Romney all but guarantees a third war in the Middle East before I'm 21. 3. My pre-existing conditions include being female, and the GOP has scared the crap out of me in that regard. 4. Obama seems composed, intelligent, and rational, all things I want my president to be, whereas Romney's temperament reminds me more of [a less-likable] Bush. Katherine Goldstein, innovations editor: Obama I'm voting for Barack Obama because I feel he's led the country in good direction over the last four years under difficult circumstances. I am happy that he was able to accomplish the herculean task of passing health care reform, which I believe is sensible and will save millions of lives through better preventive care. I believe we share a similar vision about what's important for America: including a strong middle class, equal pay and reproductive choices for women, and support for ending discrimination and allowing everyone the freedom to marry. On the issues I feel the president has not made enough progress, such as fighting climate change, I feel that his policies are better than the alternatives proposed by his challenger. I am proud to vote for Barack Obama for a second time. Laura Helmuth, science and health editor: Obama If you care about science--teaching it, funding it, grappling with its findings, using it to guide policy--Obama is the clear choice. He has assembled arguably the most scientifically accomplished administration in U.S. history. He accepts the overwhelming evidence for climate change, values people over embryos, bases regulations (mostly) on sound science, and invests in the environment. Romney, Ryan, and the Republicans give comfort to creationists and climate change deniers and reject research findings on education, regulations, the environment, and social programs. The data are clear: The scientific vote is for Obama. Fred Kaplan, Slate contributor: Obama I will vote for Barack Obama. First, he has accomplished a great deal, especially given the Republicans' obstructionism and given the post-Cold War world's dispersion of power, which has diminished the leverage of any country. Second, Mitt Romney has proved himself a hollow man, shameless in the extent to which he switches views and outright lies in order to win. He is inept at foreign policy, clueless on the important issues facing our country. He is either the reactionary that he ran as through the GOP Convention or a man without a core. It's unclear which is worse; both are unacceptable. Dan Kois, senior editor in culture: Obama I am voting for Barack Obama because all I care about are social issues and I don't understand the economy. So maybe Mitt Romney would be way better for my pocketbook, but hell if I really know! On the other hand, it is clear that if Mitt Romney and I got into a conversation on a Greyhound bus, I would hate him in like 10 seconds (and vice versa!). Rachael Larimore, managing editor: Mitt Romney The GOP convention had few memorable moments, but one I keep coming back to is Ann Romney's speech. ""This man will not fail,"" she said of her husband. ""This man will not let us down."" Jokes about the 2008 nomination aside, Romney was indeed impressive as the Massachusetts governor and as the savior of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Four years ago, when John McCain bafflingly halted his campaign to deal with the financial crisis, I wished that McCain had picked Romney to be his running mate. Or that we had nominated Romney himself. Instead, Barack Obama inherited the admittedly daunting challenge of fixing the economy. And he has tried. But it feels like his efforts have been as much about padding his resume as helping Americans. It's as if it was more important to pass a stimulus quickly rather than passing one that would work. (Say what you will, but this chart says more.) He pushed hard for Obamacare with no regard for the fact that it scared the crap out of already-struggling business owners. This aloofness and distance has alienated even his supporters. While I'm not quite sure what job one would use the presidency to audition for, I say let's let him start looking. Josh Levin, executive editor: Obama I'm with the Democrats on gay rights and women's rights and would never vote for a candidate whose stances on social issues align with what's in the current Republican Party platform. I'm concerned that a President Romney would be beholden to the ""shut that whole thing down""/""something that God intended"" wing of the GOP and would appoint justices that would push the Supreme Court further rightward. Plus, Coach K doesn't like Obama. That means he must be doing something right. Chad Lorenz, news editor: Obama I believe Democrats have the best ideas and the right moral code for leading America, and Obama represents those values well. He's also proven himself a smart, careful, determined president in his first term. He has led America through one of its most difficult periods and has helped us recover from the economic and diplomatic damage of the Bush administration. Where he has fallen short, it is usually because of political obstructionism. His conservative opponents in Congress have stood in the way (deficit reduction, economic stimulus), and corporate interests have manipulated public opinion against him (environment, immigration). J. Bryan Lowder, editorial assistant for culture: Obama The short answer: I'm gay, and the protection of my and my partner's still-meager civil rights (and, hopefully, their continued expansion) is my primary concern. However, the qualities I look for in a leader--intelligence (intellectuals welcome!), calmness of spirit, integrity, critical reasoning, sensitivity to the environment, belief in a secular state, and a commitment to a strong social safety net and an improved national infrastructure (what else is the federal government for?)--are clearly held by only one candidate. And hey, he's a fellow introvert, so my vote was always in the bag. Farhad Manjoo, technology writer: Obama I think he's done as good a job as president as can be expected. That's not nearly as good as I'd hoped, but the primary lesson I draw from Obama's first term is that presidents just aren't very powerful when hemmed in by a determined opposition. I don't have high hopes that the next four will be any better. Amanda Marcotte, ""Double X"" contributor: Obama As I did in 2008, I will be voting for Barack Obama for president. The most banal reason for this is that I always vote for Democrats. I don't buy the strange myth of ""vote for a man and not a party,"" since party politics are how things get done. But Obama also has earned my vote. While I disagree with him on some issues, mainly regarding civil liberties, as Jamelle Bouie points out, Obama's overall record shows he's the most liberal president since LBJ. I expect him to continue to be an effective leader into his second term. Andrew Morgan, designer: Obama I'm voting for Obama because he seems like he has an actual direction to go in, unlike Romney's flip-flopping, listless ""plans."" Also, he's not an asshole. Will Oremus, ""Future Tense"" blogger: Obama Mitt Romney has played sea-level rise for a laugh line, sucked up shamelessly to the coal industry, ridiculed clean-energy innovators in the private sector, and pledged to strip the EPA of its ability to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. Whether even he believes what he's saying is hard to tell: His readiness to subordinate his ideals to his political ambitions stands out even among politicians. Either way, his stances are irresponsible and will not be judged kindly by history. Brian Palmer, Slate contributor: no one I missed the registration deadline. I live in New York, though, so neither candidate cares about my vote anyway. For the record, I would have voted for President Obama. He has been ineffectual, but at least I know what he will attempt ineffectually to do. Mitt Romney would spend the next four years ineffectually doing God knows what. I believe it's important for a candidate to be consistent about what he will fail to accomplish in office. David Plotz, Slate editor: Obama I think Mitt Romney would have been an excellent president in an earlier, less partisan era. He's technocratic, rational, and solutions-oriented. But hitched to a Republican Party with theological beliefs about taxes and almost everything else, he'll be impotent at best, and extreme at worst. Barack Obama has played a terrible hand--awful economy, nihilistic opposition party--pretty well. He deserves another term to lock in Obamacare, appoint a couple of Supreme Court Justices, and change America's military posture. Alyssa Rosenberg, ""Double X"" contributor: Obama For health care reform. For moving the conversation about marriage equality into the future, not back to the '50s. For talks with Iran rather than talk about war with Iran. For not pretending that cutting public broadcasting funding is a serious solution to the deficit. And because I remain confident in my ability to make decisions about my own body, thank you very much. Will Saletan, national correspondent: Obama Four years ago, I had two worries about Obama: his executive inexperience and the risk that he'd be pushed around as he sought consensus. I'm sorry that those concerns turned out to be well-founded, and I hope in a second term Obama handles Congress more adeptly. But he has managed foreign policy--the most important part of the job, because a president can screw it up all by himself with global consequences-- as well as anyone in memory. The chances that Romney would do this job better, given the cartoonish worldview he has presented, are nil. And the notion that Obama caused the slow pace of the recovery, or that Romney would accelerate it, is economically illiterate. The good news is that both candidates have been wildly caricatured. For the most part, Romney would be a sensible, moderate Republican president. (I'm setting aside his idiotic pledges to defund Planned Parenthood and to spend at least 4 percent of GDP on the military regardless of need.) But we already have a sensible, moderate Republican president. Everything Obama has done, from foreign policy to economic policy to national Romneycare, is what moderate Republicans used to stand for. The only reason he gets called a liberal is that he's up against the most right-wing Congress in history. You want change? Vote out this Congress. If the Republicans lose enough seats to fear for their House majority and their ability to sustain filibusters in the Senate, you'll find them much more cooperative. Tom Scocca, columnist: Obama  Bill Smee, Slate V executive producer: Obama In 2008, I explained my vote with a haiku. This time, I've written a sonnet: Ode to the Shape Shifter Shall I compare thee to the president?
Thou seem reasonable and moderate:
A Republican without precedent.
But campaigns doth bring out the desperate. Those who say this, then that, really anything,
While revealing almost nothing about
What they'd do, why they deserve to be king.
Beyond a five-point plan and sowing doubt. Face it: we are far better off today
Than when Obama came in amid huge fears
Saddled with cards no person could parlay
Into a winning hand in just four years. You say we can't afford four more of the same,
Yet offer nothing to back up that claim. Eliot Spitzer, Slate contributor: Obama It is really quite simple. There are a few things I believe in that I would hope the next president would believe in as well: facts, logic, constancy of opinion, expanding civil rights for classes of folks who have been historically disadvantaged, and Keynesian economics. These baseline issues seem to differentiate the two candidates. Obama is on the right side of all of them. Jeremy Stahl, social media editor: Obama Mitt Romney spent the last month obfuscating his positions on everything from taxes, to spending cuts, to foreign policy. He is clearly banking on the idea that the only way a Republican can win a national election is if he conceals his platform from the rest of the country. Barack Obama's stimulus policies, meanwhile, saved the American economy from depression (and millions of jobs), he saved the American auto industry from destruction (and a million jobs), he passed a health care bill that will insure 32 million Americans, he killed OBL, he wound down two wars, issued a version of the Dream Act, etc. He did this despite unwavering opposition from Republicans, who have spent the last four years with the exclusive and explicitly stated goal of making sure that the current Democratic president is undone by the economic calamity that they wrought. Obama has earned a second term. Mark Joseph Stern, editorial intern: Obama Obama has improved the lives of gay people like me beyond what I ever could have imagined a decade ago. He repealed ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and secured hospital visitation rights for same-sex couples, yes, but more importantly, he gave his blessing to marriage equality. That might seem relatively insignificant, but there's something about the president of the United States recognizing your rights that puts to bed a lot of lingering struggle. Seth Stevenson, Slate contributor: Obama I think a Romney administration might actually govern pretty well. He's smarter than G.W. Bush, more reassuringly bloodless and technocratic than John McCain. But Romney evinces zero sympathy for the less advantaged, he seems dangerously malleable when it comes to foreign policy, and his nominees could tip the Supreme Court in a terrifying direction. As for the other guy: President Obama has played a uniquely awful hand as well as anybody could have. Platforms aside (I greatly favor the Democrats'), Obama's calm and steady performance in the face of potential chaos--along with his overall competence, intelligence, and authenticity--easily earn him another four years from me. John Swansburg, editorial director: Obama I believe I'm Slate's only registered Republican besides Rachael Larimore. But Rachael's the real thing; I'm a RINO. I joined the party in 2008 because I wanted to vote against Rudy Giuliani in the primary. (His fear-mongering use of the 9/11 attacks was driving me batty.) While I do admire certain Yankee Republicans of yore, their breed has ceased to roam the American political landscape, and I can't imagine voting for a GOP presidential candidate nowadays. I lived in Mitt Romney's Massachusetts and found him to be an able manager of the commonwealth's affairs. But the Romney who's running for president isn't that Romney. And I'm pretty satisfied with my Obama vote from 2008. On the whole I think he's done about as well as can be expected in difficult times and has earned another nod from this Lincoln Chafee Republican.* Ryan Trow, account manager: Gary Johnson I am voting for Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party. He aligns much more closely with my views of laissez-faire governing, meritocracy, and individual freedom. I would rather throw away my vote than support the continued failure of the traditional two parties. Let's try something new. Matt Turck, publisher: Romney I will again vote the Republican ticket this year. This follows my vote for Obama last presidential election, after a long history of voting Republican. While I don't agree with all the principals of the Republican Party, and I think Obama is a good man, I don't believe Obama prioritized well. More importantly, it's my belief that larger government feeds into a ""level of expectation"" that is crushing our country. Julia Turner, deputy editor: Obama I'm voting for Obama. Perhaps not wholeheartedly: I am frustrated by the gridlock that has characterized his term. I am disappointed that regulatory reform on Wall Street after the crash wasn't more comprehensive. I am troubled by the kill-at-will drone strike program he has authorized. But I believe his stimulus prevented a total economic collapse; I'm impressed that he passed health care; I think he's a fundamentally smart, thoughtful, and decent person--and I can't stand the other guy. Romney's ""just trust me"" economic ""plan,"" lack of firm commitment to any ideal, and general slipperiness turn me off. His comments on women in the second debate signaled a complete inability to understand the workings of a modern family. The power he would have over the future of the Supreme Court frightens me. I'd much rather see Obama get another four years--if he does, I think we'll all be much better off. Katy Waldman, assistant editor: Obama I am voting for Obama because I do not understand how Romney plans to provide for people in need while cutting entitlements, increasing defense spending, and preserving tax cuts for the stupendously wealthy. I find his views on gay rights and women's reproductive choice morally offensive. I wish I believed that he cared about 100 percent of Americans, but his policies tell a different story. Obama, on the other hand, seems to genuinely want to resurrect the value of ""fairness"" and to lessen suffering--not just to promote success for some but to secure opportunities for all. I get the disappointment surrounding the last four years, but Obama's critics seem to be ignoring some dazzling accomplishments, too: a new health care system, Osama Bin Laden dead, the end of the Iraq War. GObama! David Weigel, political reporter: Johnson I'm copping out. On about half of the issues that I care about, Barack Obama has been a massive improvement on George W. Bush. Drone warfare or lie-based land wars in the Middle East? U.S. attorneys running junk cases against ""voter fraud,"" or the DOJ trying to expand the vote? Endorsing the Federal Marriage Amendment, or refusing to defend DOMA in court? I agreed with an economic stimulus in 2009, as did the forgetful Republicans, who just disagreed about what should go in it. But Obama's a mediocre executive who's never figured out how to overcome opposition in Congress. I think Romney could be a great executive. If we fell into some Greece-like receivership, and a coalition of bankers installed a dictator to manage our economy, Romney would be perfect. Give him a Democratic Congress and you'd bring out his best instincts. My problems: If you trust John Bolton and Dan Senor to speak for you, who are you going to fill the government with? If you agree to a Balanced Budget Amendment that would require a California-style supermajority to raise taxes, what other dumb fiscal decisions will you make? So I'll vote for the Libertarian ticket, which I agree with on everything besides the scale and speed of spending cuts, and the first third-party team that actually seems competent enough to run a country. (Let's face it, Nader voters. Would you have trusted him to run anything larger than a make-your-own-salad franchise?) But I guess I'm pulling for a 269-269 electoral vote split, which would give us a chastened President Romney and let us keep the greatest vice president in history, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. Forrest Wickman, staff writer: Obama I was going to list off President Obama's many major accomplishments here--saving us from a depression, putting an end to ""don't ask don't tell,"" ending the war in Iraq, helping my struggling friends get insurance (I'm under 26)--and leave it at that. But right now I can't help but focus on another reason I'm voting for Obama, a reason that showed up at my doorstep on Monday. Right now I'm working from home in a city that's gone half-dark, with a tree still on top of a car across the street, as vital federal aid begins to flow toward my city. I don't believe that Obama is eager to grow the federal government, but he understands that there are some things--from rebuilding cities after historic disasters to helping ensure affordable health care for every citizen--that only the federal government is fit to do. Meg Wiegand, copy editor: Obama I believe access to health care and education are rights, not privileges reserved for those who can afford them. I believe this country needs economic policies inclusive of all Americans, not just those at the top. I believe women should make our own health care decisions and receive equal pay for equal work. I believe my friends, family members, and peers--straight or gay--should be allowed to serve openly in the military, receive benefits for their partners, and marry the person they love. And I believe Obama will continue push for these issues and more in his second term as president. Matt Yglesias, ""Moneybox"" columnist: Obama I'm voting for Obama because, basically, I strongly disagree with Mitt Romney's views on abortion, gay rights, foreign policy, and such. I'd like to say I have reasons driven by detailed examination of the policy issues, but that's really what it comes down to. On the economic policy issues I cover for Slate I think it's a tough choice, but Romney may deserve the edge. Obama's proposed second-term agenda of deficit reduction is misguided, and I think it's reasonably likely that President Romney would emerge as a closet Keynesian and bring us a lower unemployment rate.

Four days to go: Today's Good News for Obama: On Friday the Labor Department released the last round of jobs numbers before the election, and on the whole they provided yet more grist for Obama's defense of his economic policies. Although unemployment crawled slightly upward to 7.9 percent, 171,000 Americans found jobs during the month of October, and the August and September estimates were revised upward by 84,000 jobs total. The small rise in unemployment is, in fact, a promising sign, as it indicates that more people are looking for work and are presumably more optimistic about their prospects of finding it. Most of the new jobs gained, moreover, are in the private sector, undercutting Mitt Romney's criticisms of Obama's business policies. With only four days to go, a terrible jobs report could have drained Obama of his increasing momentum. Today's solidly good news, however, may allow the president to hold on to his narrow lead in the closing days of the campaign. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

While 47 percent of voters think Romney could foster more bipartisan cooperation, only 37 percent believe Obama could do so in his second term.

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/undecided_voters_readers_explain_why_they_can_t_decide_to_vote_for_barack.html	"Mitt Romney may have hacked my email. A week ago, I asked undecided voters to write me at slatepolitics@gmail.com to explain themselves and their situation. I got about 200 thoughtful responses. (I welcome more, though supplies are going fast.) The message to Romney was clear: run as a malleable moderate from Massachusetts who isn't passionate about implementing a conservative social agenda, will promote a foreign policy that is not too different from President Obama's, and keep your distance from the Republican Congress. As the campaign comes to an end, Romney has fully embraced those first two pieces of advice, and by never really campaigning with GOP congressional leaders and recasting Paul Ryan, is doing a version of the third. For these undecided voters, this election is a referendum on Romney. They've mostly already made up their mind about the incumbent. They don't dislike President Obama, but they think he is either incapable of improving the economy or locked into a do-nothing phase with Congress. ""I voted for Obama in 2008, much to the surprise of my family and some of my friends, but certainly not all. I was enthusiastic about his election, but 4 years later feel he has not lived up to the 'hope and change' he professed, and [he] has not been successful in working with Republicans to get things done,"" writes Linda from Ohio. ""I don't hold him responsible for the current state of the economy. I know it's not in his control, but I am concerned with his plans, or lack thereof, for growth going forward. He seems stuck."" (This message almost sounds like a planted Romney email it so closely mirrors his campaign's spin, but as you'll see at the bottom of this story, Linda has some pretty harsh things to say about Romney, too.) These voters think Romney can handle the economy, but they worry he will embrace an extreme agenda on social issues ranging from abortion to gay marriage. It's on those issues that they favor President Obama. The conundrum of one woman was typical: ""I believe Obama, if elected, would be disastrous for the country, not only because of the debt he would cause the country to incur, but because of the precedents he would continue to set that make his initiatives very difficult to roll back in a future election. I believe Romney would be equally disastrous for different reasons. Republican positions are almost uniformly anti-woman, and as president, Romney would be in a position to name Supreme Court justices whose rulings will determine highly significant and personal issues not just for me but for my daughter. So, do I sell out my daughter's legal rights for her economic future?"" If they're not worried about Romney, they're worried about his party. ""Although the economy is certainly my No. 1 issue (I'm also unemployed),"" writes Christine from California, ""it isn't the only issue. If it were, I think I would vote for Romney. But when it comes to social issues, I find the Republican Party downright scary, and I am also opposed to their stance on immigration, which is also an important issue for me. On the other hand, while I am not convinced Obama even understands the economy, never mind will actually move things in the right direction, I do think he has a bit more empathy in general."" Romney's focus groups and polling have long told him a version of this. That's why Romney has fully implemented this strategy of recasting or--in some cases like abortion--rewriting his positions on a host of issues. The Boston Globe helpfully put together a list. At this point, liberals scream that the reshaping of Romney should disqualify him. He either can't be trusted--Obama's point on the stump--or he's just going to govern as a die-hard conservative once he gets in office. That points to a fundamental question for voters still considering whom to support. Will Romney aim to please his party's conservatives once he's in office, the way he did during the primaries? Or, will he move to the middle, recognizing that's where the country is and where he'll need to be to get anything done in Washington? Romney's past flip-flopping doesn't bother many of these people. For a sizable group, it gives them hope that a vote for his economic policies won't lead to an extreme conservative agenda. ""I'm working under the assumption that the Senate stays blue, and that Mitt Romney has shown a willingness to pursue pragmatic rather than idealistic ends,"" writes Peter Bryan, an Obama 2008 Pennsylvania voter who is leaning toward Romney. He notes approvingly that Romney will be pragmatic because he ""is the Etch-A-Sketch candidate, as we've learned so far."" Some would like to see a little more shape-shifting from the candidate. ""I would definitely vote for Mitt the Massachusetts Moderate,"" says Mary from Northern Virginia. ""I am frightened by the risks of [the] Mitt who picked Paul Ryan ."" But they wouldn't be independents if they all saw things the same way. ""Romney's willingness to transfigure himself into whatever people want to hear is very off-putting and gives me doubts about his character,"" writes Joe from Wisconsin. ""I understand the need to be less than forthright--you tell people that you are going to touch their entitlements and they whip themselves into a frenzy. But a president with character should at least try to convince the mob rather than running with it. What if the mob is leading us off of an unknown cliff?"" For Grant, a lifelong Republican from West Virginia, he's thinking about voting for Romney because it might change the party from within. ""I know the real Romney from his Olympics days, governorship days, and Bain days (before it became politically incorrect to make money on Wall Street). I never thought the GOP minders would let him come out and talk about his family,  religion, and practical--dare I say, moderate--approaches. The GOP Politburo has forced a VP candidate on him and also a narrow message. My vote is for the long view--assisting the GOP to cleanse itself of the ""little tent"" views .... I've been impressed that just before the debate, Romney took some initiative and broke away from the party line .... If he will keep showing he can do this, I'd consider voting for him."" A slight majority of those who responded are women. ""I'm an undecided, under-25, female voter in one of Ohio's biggest swing counties,"" writes Lauren. ""If any other man vied so hard for my affections as these two candidates, I'd have filed a criminal harassment report by August."" Their views are complex and they're irritated by the way the candidates are talking about them. Jenelle Kirchoff is a pro-choice Catholic, but she is considering voting for Romney because ""I am struggling with Obama's insistence that all entities mandate birth control coverage."" Kirchoff is also the mother of seven, and though after her divorce she accepted limited government assistance, she thinks Obama is in favor of subsidies that are too generous. ""My indecision is based solely on the fact that the Romney/Ryan platform has every intention of limiting access to safe abortions and affordable birth control through clinics like Planned Parenthood. And the Obama/Biden ticket doesn't seem to understand that welfare programs can and should be cut. I'm a single mother of seven. If I can live without government assistance, why can't everyone else?"" Ginger from Oregon has just moved very reluctantly to the Romney camp: ""I am still sick to my stomach with what I did, but I voted for Romney. The economy has to be dealt with and he is, in my humble opinion, best qualified. I told my husband that if they start to repeal women's health care choices I WAS going to use family money to go to Washington, DC and protest."" Chris from Ohio and his wife went with Obama, barely: ""My wife and I simply can't swallow a Republican in the White House who would support their point of view and potentially put two Supreme Court justices in place that would imprint even more misogyny into the federal government. It is maddening that we really have no rational options here and are forced to vote for a crony capitalist with no second term agenda and a deadly foreign policy program ... but what else can we do?"" Scot in Denver voted for Obama, too: ""We can vote early in Colorado, and I voted for Obama last Saturday. It was a close thing--about an hour before I went to the poll I was convinced I was voting for Romney. When it came time to pull the lever--well, touch the screen--I decided to remain optimistic. We'll see how that turns out."" These emails point out an important thing about undecided voters. They may be unclear on their candidate, but they have very clear views on certain issues. The number of voters who were weighing the question of Romney's stance on social issues suggests they have clear inclinations. That is why the Obama campaign has tried so hard to keep Indiana senatorial candidate Richard Mourdock's comments about rape and abortion in the news. If voters are balancing between Romney's views on the economy and social issue overreach, the Obama campaign wants to keep them focused on the social-issue part of the equation. My sample is not scientific. Political scientists tell us my respondents are not your typical undecided voters. In fact, according to Lynn Vavreck, a political scientist at UCLA, the undecided voters are the exact opposite of those who responded to my request. They are not that involved in politics, they're not reading up on the issues--or any issue since they tend not to follow the news--they're not sure that their vote will matter, or they're sick of the whole business. ""When I look at the data, what I see is that the majority of [undecided voters] have a hard time making sense of the political world,"" says Vavreck. ""The normal cues--party, ideology--that early voters use are like a foreign language to them."" Both campaigns are courting these voters, but Vavreck says about 30 percent of registered voters who are undecided will stay home. Of course the largest group of undecided Americans is those who are undecided about voting, not undecided about whether to pick one candidate or the other. So just as campaign rallies only give you a sliver of the overall race, these voices aren't representative of the entire undecided voter pool. But undecided voters have taken such a pounding--on Saturday Night Live and from people like Chris Matthews and Bill Maher--it seemed fitting to give them a chance to speak. I have reprinted more of their responses below. Many of these voters come from swing states, but a lot are frustrated that they don't live in swing states and believe their vote is wasted. Most are highly informed, which you'd expect from this kind of experiment. They are the opposite of ""low information voters."" They read too much and become more indecisive the more they read. When the campaigns and candidates pander to them without giving them what they want, they are left even more unsure. What do they want? A serious answer to their specific questions. They also want a political process that recognizes that the world is complex. ""I face a serious crisis of values. Additionally, I am a conservative Christian, but I am wondering who really is pro-life: the candidate who believes abortion should be legal or the candidate who wants to maintain a system where people are denied life-saving health care services because they can't afford to pay?"" An anonymous government worker in a swing state writes: ""The notion that undecided voters are 'low information' voters rests on the belief that the party platforms are coherent and, accordingly, any rational person paying enough attention would naturally fall into one camp or another. But there is no natural affinity between a neo-con foreign policy, reactionary views on social policy, and laissez faire economic policies. Likewise, there is nothing particularly coherent to my mind in a platform of multilateralism abroad, liberalism with regard to social issues, and redistributionist tax policies."" Bryan Sell describes himself this way: ""I'm a 38-year-old undecided voter registered in Michigan who believes that humanity's greatest problems are largely rooted in binary thinking."" Some voters want more than two choices and are voting for Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate, or Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Though most admit they're throwing their vote away by voting for a third-party candidate, their commitment to their principles comes first. ""I know as well as anyone that Johnson doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell. I am not delusional. That said, my vote is one of the purest ways for me to exercise my voice and my protest, and I am incredibly disappointed with Obama,"" writes Morgan Klein. This exercise was refreshing and faith restoring. That isn't a knock against partisans. They care about the country enough to donate their time and energy to the cause. That makes them a necessary treasure to democracy. I spend a lot of time with partisans at rallies listening to their worries and hopes. But in the digital world, partisans are often full of certainties, snap judgments, and insults. The passion overwhelms illumination. These correspondents are undecided--or ""still deciding,"" as one put it in an effort to lessen the stigma--because they weigh the duty so heavily. More important, they all have a quality that has all but disappeared in this election: They pause long enough to hear the other side's arguments. Not once in these emails did a voter write about one of the candidates' supposed gaffes. They are the perfect combination: skeptical and thoughtful. They don't trust politicians, the press, or pundits, but they treat the ideas of all of those players seriously enough to formulate an opinion of their own. If only the politicians trying to get their vote behaved the same way. Undecided Voters in Their Own Words Matt from North Carolina:
I am a 24-year-old undecided voter. Rather, I am a constantly-deciding voter: I woke up yesterday thinking I would vote for the president, and today I'm leaning towards Gov. Romney. I realize the problem is that I can't have my cake and eat it too. I agree with Obama on a lot of domestic and foreign policy, but I'm unconvinced that his fiscal policies are working. With Romney, I feel the opposite. I think he could get the economy turned around, but I'm afraid of what may become of the social issues I care about. As an NSF-supported chemistry graduate student, the future of basic research funding is very important to me and whether it's true or not, the general mindset of my (vocal) peers is that Democrats are better for science. So I feel like I'm trying to choose between things I want as an individual (Obama's social policies and being ""good for science"") and things that I think could be good for the country as a whole (Romney's economic policies). If I vote for Romney, am I turning my back on my own scientific future, my gay friends, the poor, the environment, etc.? If I vote for Obama, am I being shortsighted and selfish? I'm definitely going to vote, I'm just not sure yet who it will be for. Amy in New Hampshire:
I'm finishing my dissertation right now, so I really shouldn't be writing to you, but knowing I am so in the minority is interesting and maybe worth sharing some data on. Rather than being ""undecided,"" I would describe myself as ""deciding."" Active, not passive. Gerund, not past tense. In other words, don't talk down to me, all you decided voters! Plus, I live in a swing state (New Hampshire), so I guess I'm a ""deciding"" voter in that sense, too. Adore privilege of voting, total highlight every four years. Used to be more partisan. Have voted almost entirely Democratic since age 18. Really happy when Obama won. That was an easy choice--who would vote for the McCain ticket after certain, um, choices were made? This one is harder. I'm thinking in terms of the long view and what's best for the U.S. on a variety of levels as it develops in a sea of factors no one has fully foreseen or can foresee. The multiplicity, complexity, and acknowledgement of the limited nature of human foresight are all key. Neither guy is a complete package, but at their best: Obama is dutiful, earnest, idealistic, inteligent. Romney is efficient, sharp, conservative, center leaning. Both are good sets of qualities at specific historical moments. Which can leverage this moment in U.S. history best? I don't know, and I think the majority of voters who think they know actually don't (and can't). It's just hubris and excessive partisanship that makes us think we can know without waiting, watching, weighing, and fully considering. There is major damage to be done by voting in the wrong guy, and I want to be totally open to seeing which points will become most critical to national and global health in the next four years. Linda in Ohio:
I hope I am not too late... I was, until Monday night, an undecided woman voter from Ohio. Of course, I am being courted by both parties and therefore feel that I could actually have an impact on the election. I must say I find some of the articles I've read questioning how anyone could still be undecided at this point just slightly offensive. Well, I'll tell you. I was undecided because I wanted to know more about the candidates and their plans for going forward before making a decision. I wanted to hear the debates. I consider myself a socially liberal fiscally conservative Republican, and maybe more of an independent. I voted for Obama in 2008, much to the surprise of my family and some of my friends, but certainly not all. I was enthusiastic about his election, but 4 years later feel he has not lived up to the ""hope and change"" he professed, and he has not been successful in working with Republicans to get things done. I don't hold him responsible for the current state of the economy. I know it's not in his control, but I am concerned with his plans, or lack thereof, for growth going forward. He seems stuck. I also don't like his class warfare approach on taxes. I was undecided because although my enthusiasm for Obama had dwindled, I was uncomfortable with Mitt Romney and the Republican extremists. I wasn't convinced that he had a better plan to move the country and the economy forward and I could not support the social positions of the Republican party. For example, I am in favor of gay marriage, some abortion rights (rape/incest), and programs to help the needy. I don't like Paul Ryan; he is too extreme on social, tax, and economic policy. The game changer for me was the first debate when a more mild, centrist, concession builder, get-it-done Mitt Romney showed up. He made his case strongly and President Obama did not. I was undecided until the last debate, because I wanted to hear and see more from the two candidates. I have thought long and hard on this. The ads and stump speeches don't convince me of anything other than how they are trying to paint their opponent so they can win. So after the final debate, this undecided voter from Ohio who voted for Obama in 2008 will be voting for Romney this year. I am still a bit uncertain of which Romney we are going to get, but I think he has great executive experience and makes a better case for growth and reducing our deficit and working together for a better America than Obama does. Lauren in Ohio:
I'm an undecided, under-25, female voter in one of Ohio's biggest swing counties--and if any other man vied so hard for my affections as these two candidates I'd have filed a criminal harassment report by August. Seriously. Ohio voters have long gotten a quadrennial ego boost, but this year's has reached another level. The weird lines upon which the current parties have polarized is the single biggest factor in my indecision: I'm a good moderate with a terrible job, a crumbling community, taxes I would [like to] pay less of, and zero interest in the zany conservative social agenda. I want to vote for the character Mitt has played over the past several weeks--the Massachusetts moderate who wants to cut spending while limiting cuts to social programs and defense. Unfortunately, there's no sign that that guy will show up on inauguration day if elected, or that his real plan meets those promises. I balk at the idea of a Republican president assisting Congressional right-wingers in limiting gay and women's rights and blocking environmental regulations my state should, in my opinion, impose. At the same time, I disagree with what I see as federal over-reach imposed by this administration; the stagnant economy and the president's priorities in foreign policy don't feel much like ""moving forward"" either. Perhaps I need to make a better list of my own priorities, but not all undecideds are mouth-breathers who just haven't been paying attention. Just please, both of you: we like you, but we don't LIKE like you. Melinda in Iowa:
I am a moderate Democrat and I voted for Obama in the last election. I am an undecided voter.
 
I take my vote very seriously and have been going back and forth on whom I am going to vote for. The debates did not help, but I have started to research both candidates' stance on various issues and feel confident I will come to a decision soon.
 
The reason I am undecided: I feel obligated in a way to vote for Obama. I am a Democrat, I live in Iowa where gay marriage is legal, and I am fortunate to be able to say I am happily and legally married to a woman and we are raising 2 children together. There is a sense of peer pressure from the gay community to support Obama due to his support of us. I don't like that pressure and my main concern right now is the economy. I feel Obama inherited a mess and is getting a lot of blame and he has not been given enough time to try and fix things. On the other hand, I also see a lot of handouts to people that take advantage of the system. I am concerned Obamacare will just take my money so I can pay for others. Now, I do believe many people deserve assistance, but I wish that there would be more investigation into who actually is getting assistance and I feel that Obama has not done enough in regards to this and once again, the middle class has to keep on working and keep on struggling. I have been at my job 21 years, never a day without a job since I turned 16. I work for a major bank in the foreclosure department and I have seen so many people get assistance due to the real estate crash, not [always] a bad thing by any means. Although I know banks have to be held accountable for some of the problems, I also feel there have been so many chances given to people who don't take advantage of them and still they get away with not paying their mortgage. Again, as I stated before, some people need these options and deserve them; some just take advantage. I don't think I can put all of my reasons as to why I am an undecided voter in writing, but I hope this helps you understand there really are people who are still undecided, most of whom are probably going to be the most educated voters when this is all said and done."
