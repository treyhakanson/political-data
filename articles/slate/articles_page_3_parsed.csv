Lists of voters' emails, phone numbers, who they are, what they like, and so on. Lists, lists, lists, for which a candidate, campaign, or consultant can fetch a handsome sum on the market. Private companies, like the Harold Ickes-founded Catalist, can build up their own data warehouses and partner with progressive clients. Newt Gingrich lost the Republican presidential primaries in 2012 but rents out the email list he built up to the highest bidder, whether that's scammers offering secret cancer cures or Donald Trump. Newt Gingrich lives well. As does Ben Carson, whose list of millions of names could be worth $5 million to $6 million. Selling or renting lists can either be the silver lining for a losing candidate who held a grip over a firm core of supporters--or the whole point of the scam candidacy in the first place. Speaking of which, who owns Donald Trump's lists? Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg's Bloomberg Businessweek cover story, published Thursday, outlines both the campaign's strategy and expectations for the next two weeks as well as Trump's (and his associates') early post-election contingency plans in the off chance he doesn't win the presidency. Much of the piece is adorable. These aides, like campaign CEO and ex-Breitbart chief Steve Bannon and data guy/campaign utility player Brad Parscale, imagine themselves as legendary, Rove-esque Republican electoral safecrackers giving us just a peek into their brilliance--as though they're not senior figures in the most disastrous presidential campaign of modern times. (An unnamed senior campaign official, for example, seems quite proud of their ongoing ""voter suppression"" efforts, which are essentially just targeted messages aimed at softening Hillary Clinton's support.) Parscale, though, claims that the campaign's pricey efforts to build out an expansive voter file nicknamed ""Project Alamo"" has been a success--and is something Trump could monetize after the election, perhaps as the foundation for a media network. ""By Election Day,"" Green and Issenberg write, ""the campaign expects to have captured 12 million to 14 million e-mail addresses and contact information (including credit card numbers) for 2.5 million small-dollar donors, who together will have ponied up almost $275 million.""

How did we get here? Read on. For the past year, political journalists across the ideological spectrum have worked to understand Donald Trump and his voters. What drove their frustration and anger? Why did they gravitate toward Trump versus other political figures? A cottage industry sprang up around the drive to answer those questions, with stories that followed a kind of template: nuanced, empathic portraits of working-class whites living in former industrial towns and cities that have long since fallen from their former glory. Few of these stories were bad, but most of them suffered from the same blind spot: race. In telling the story of the white workers who backed Trump, they missed the perspective of the black ones who rejected him. This is important. Without that perspective, you risk downplaying the consequences of Trump support--not for supporters, but for the groups Trump has targeted throughout his campaign. Empathy without clarity leads to a place where Trump's material threat to nonwhites--""stop and frisk,"" mass deportation, Muslim surveillance, etc.--is treated as incidental to the story of Trump and his support, when it's the opposite. One outlet managed to convey that nuance the other night. Improbably, it was Saturday Night Live. Political humor is old hat on Saturday Night Live, but it's rare to see anything with real subtlety or sophistication. In general, we get caricatures and impressions--exaggerated renderings of individuals, ideas, and events. Occasionally, those renderings are so brilliant that they add something to our larger understanding of a particular politician. Most times, they aren't and they don't. This past Saturday, however, SNL struck gold with one of its sharpest political sketches in recent memory. Instead of Kate McKinnon doing her repressed-mania bit as Hillary Clinton or Alec Baldwin playing the fleshy id of Donald Trump, we had three ordinary people as contestants on ""Black Jeopardy!"", a recurring bit on the show. Kenan Thompson played the host, with Leslie Jones and Sasheer Zamata as two of the three competitors. The third was Doug, played by Tom Hanks wearing a denim shirt, graying facial hair, and a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat, and speaking as if through a freshly applied hunk of Skoal. In past versions of the sketch, the white contestants are too tied to their whiteness and their political correctness to accurately answer questions about black cultural tropes and stereotypes, which is to say that these bits are typically little more than refurbished Sinbad jokes. At first, that's what we seem to have with Hanks' character. Thompson is skeptical that Doug is in the right place, and when he interjects after questions, Thompson is dismissive. But then Doug begins to answer questions. When Thompson reads a clue for the category ""They Out Here Saying""--""They out here saying, the new iPhone wants your thumbprint 'for your protection' ""--Doug gives a correct response: ""What is, I don't think so, that's how they get you."" When Thompson reads a second clue for that category--""They out here saying that every vote counts""--Doug answers again, and again correctly: ""What is, come on, they already decided who wins even 'fore it happens."" With each correct answer, Doug gets cheers and applause from Thompson, the black contestants, and the black audience. They all seem to understand the world in similar ways. ""I really appreciate you saying that,"" says Thompson after Doug praises Tyler Perry's Madea movies, leading to an awkward moment where Hanks' character recoils in fear as Thompson tries to shake his hand, but then relaxes and accepts the gesture. By this point, the message is clear. On this episode of ""Black Jeopardy!"", the questions are rooted in feelings of disempowerment, suspicion of authority, and working-class identity--experiences that cut across racial lines. Thompson and the guests are black, but they can appreciate the things they share with Doug, and in turn, Doug grows more and more comfortable in their presence, such that he gets a ""pass"" from the group after he refers to them as ""you people."" That moment is funny, but it also foreshadows the end of the sketch, where this message of commonality--even solidarity--is tweaked and made more complicated. ""Doug, I have to say it's been a pleasure,"" says Thompson as the sketch comes to an end. ""Well, right back at you my brother,"" says Hanks. ""All right, well, let's take a look at our Final Jeopardy category,"" announces Thompson, "" 'Lives That Matter.' "" Jones and Zamata turn to look skeptically at Hanks' character, while Thompson laughs and gives the punchline. ""Well, it was good while it lasted, Doug."" To which Hanks says, ""I have a lot to say about this."" And then the sketch comes to a close. Because the bulk of the sketch is this humanizing back-and-forth between Doug, the black host, the black contestants, and the black audience, it's easy to read the message as a plea for tolerance and understanding. There's more that unites us than there is that divides us. You can even add a class analysis: Black Americans share more than just common culture with some Trump supporters; they share common interests. There are important limits to this, beyond the universe of SNL: Because of its roots in the South, black culture shares an affinity with the rural white life that Doug represents. It's not clear this would exist between, say, a black audience and a Trump-supporting professional from outside Milwaukee. But at this point, the sketch's argument seems barely implicit: We need to work together instead of pitting ourselves against each other. Then comes the final punchline, ""Lives That Matter."" Obviously, the answer to the question is ""black."" But Doug has ""a lot to say about this."" Which suggests that he doesn't think the answer is that simple. Perhaps he thinks ""all lives matter,"" or that ""blue lives matter,"" the phrasing used by those who defend the status quo of policing and criminal justice. Either way, this puts him in direct conflict with the black people he's befriended. As viewers, we know that ""Black Lives Matter"" is a movement against police violence, for the essential safety and security of black Americans. It's a demand for fair and equal treatment as citizens, as opposed to a pervasive assumption of criminality. Thompson, Zamata, and Jones might see a lot to like in Doug, but if he can't sign on to the fact that black Americans face unique challenges and dangers, then that's the end of the game. Tucked into this six-minute sketch is a subtle and sophisticated analysis of American politics. It's not that working blacks and working whites are unable to see the things they have in common; it's that the material interests of the former--freedom from unfair scrutiny, unfair detention, and unjust killings--are in direct tension with the identity politics of the latter (as represented in the sketch by the Trump hat). And in fact, if Hanks' character is a Trump supporter, then all the personal goodwill in the world doesn't change the fact that his political preferences are a direct threat to the lives and livelihoods of his new friends, a fact they recognize. Now, this sketch isn't some exercise in didacticism. It's genuinely funny with great performances from everyone involved. But it does make a firm statement about our political world: that racism is a huge obstacle to a kind of class solidarity. And that, as long as real-life Dougs hold on to their identity politics, that obstacle will remain. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

Clinton may have played loose on some facts at the final debate, but as usual, Trump offered a truly virtuosic lesson in evading the truth. At one point, before Clinton even had a chance to quote him, he protested, ""There's no quote. You're not going to find a quote from me!"" In the video above, one last time, we offer video after video of Trump contradicting his own debate answers, a testament to just how thoroughly he has bungled the record over a year-and-a-half of running for president.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/trump_s_surrogates_can_t_defend_his_attack_on_democracy_so_they_re_pretending.html	"LAS VEGAS--How to spin the possibility of Donald Trump refusing to accept the outcome of the election? ""Who are you?"" demanded Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump's military adviser who had once been considered a possible running mate. We were in the spin room after Wednesday's presidential debate, and I'd asked if he thought Trump should say he would abide by the results of the vote. ""Who are you?"" he asked again. When I told him, he continued to walk away without answering the question. So that's one way. No one, it seemed, knew how to spin Trump's attack on democracy, other than to pretend he hadn't said what he'd said. A reporter asked Sen. Jeff Sessions, one of Trump's earliest supporters, if he was concerned by Trump's statements that he would not necessarily accept the results of the election. ""Well, he's going to accept the election,"" Sessions said, rejecting the premise of Trump's own words. Sessions then attempted to explain Trump's answer in the context of electoral fraud. ""If there's fraud or impropriety in it, I think what he's saying is that 'I'm not waiving'"" the option to contest the results, Sessions continued, comparing Trump's response to Al Gore's legal challenge in the state of Florida in 2000. The vote in that decisive state was determined by fewer than 600 out of nearly six million cast, the closest presidential election in American history. ""One thing that Donald Trump means is, he doesn't intend to be cheated or taken advantage of,"" Sessions continued. ""So he will defend his rights."" Sessions followed up by blaming the media for making too much of the topic. In reality, Trump has been laying the groundwork for months to argue that the election is rigged. It's just that his rhetoric has escalated in recent days. How big a losing margin, I asked, would Trump need for Sessions to feel it would be justified for him to concede? ""I don't know about that,"" Sessions said. Was there a margin? Two points, three points, more? This was when Sessions began to acknowledge reality. ""You can't--it would be wrong for a candidate to contest an election for light or transient reasons,"" he said. ""It ought to be a serious reason, a justifiable reason, because you should accept the election results unless you have a real basis to challenge it. Al Gore lost his challenge, and I think he was wrong, but he had a right to bring it, it was a serious issue."" But then, almost as quickly as he had returned to Earth, Sessions floated off into unreality. Could he define a serious issue? ""I'll just see,"" he said. ""There's no need to declare that today."" At this point, Sessions went back to his original reading of Trump's statement, the one that ignored the text of what Trump actually said. Trump, Sessions argued, was merely saying he was preserving his right to contest a close election or one with issues of voting fraud. ""He feels strongly that he thinks there are things going on out there. It worries him,"" Sessions said. ""We do have voter fraud, there's no doubt about this."" (There is plenty of doubt about this.) Sessions then argued that Trump didn't actually mean he would challenge the results of a legitimate election; he was just ""not a politician"" so he couldn't articulate things the way ""you think he should have."" Sessions continued: ""I think what he said is justified--he basically said what I'm saying. ... He refused to make a prejudgment on all that, that's all you're hearing."" For the record, here is what Trump said: Moderator Chris Wallace had asked him whether he would commit, as he'd done in the first debate, to accepting the results of the election. ""I will look at it at the time,"" he said. ""I'm not looking at anything now."" He hinted darkly at voter fraud, whereupon Wallace pressed him: ""One of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign the loser concedes to the winner. ... Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?"" ""What I'm saying is that I'll tell you at the time,"" Trump reiterated. ""I'll keep you in suspense, OK? "" I asked Sessions what evidence he had of voter fraud that was widespread enough to come close to swaying an election--evidence that every legitimate expert who has looked at the issue denies exists. Again, Sessions cited the 2000 election. ""There is fraud [in] every election,"" he said. ""Florida tried to count ballots in one county more lenient to Al Gore than they did in other counties, and the Supreme Court had to say, 'No, whatever standard you use in pro-Democrat counties to count more ballots had to be used throughout the rest of the state.' That was an attempt to manipulate the outcome of that election."" What Sessions was describing was the wrangling over how ballots would be tallied in a recount after the fact--whether or not the state of Florida could make a judgment about the intentions of a voter with a faulty ballot based on that voter's attempted vote. This was not evidence of vote rigging in any way resembling what Trump has suggested--massive voter fraud on election day. When I caught up with Flynn later, he was being interviewed by another reporter who was asking him about Trump's response. Flynn answered this time, but like Sessions, he denied reality. ""He'll accept the results,"" the general said. ""Donald Trump will accept the results. What he's talking about is--that's part of it is, if you listen to what he's been saying, he's been talking about the media bias against him, frankly, which poisons the American people. Talk about divisive."" OK. Trump, apparently, was also talking about voter fraud. ""Donald Trump at the end of the day when he talked about the kinds of things that are happening that we see at some of these in previous elections, and also some of the things that we're hearing and what we're seeing with people that are different rolls, people that are on lists to be able to vote, all kinds of things, there's three or four different examples out there,"" Flynn rambled Trumpishly. ""But at the end of the day, he'll accept the results of the election."" ""Why didn't he say that?"" a reporter asked. ""Because he wasn't asked that,"" Flynn said. Again, here is what Trump was asked: ""Do you make the ... commitment that you will absolutely accept the results of this election?"" After denying Trump was asked what he was asked, Flynn decided that the nominee had answered in a way that he didn't answer. ""He addressed it in a way that I felt was appropriate,"" Flynn said. ""He said, 'Hey, look, let's see what happens. We have got to maintain our elections the way we always have, which is free and fair.' "" Trump, of course, has never defined free and fair. Flynn was then asked if he believed that Trump believed in his heart that the election would be free and fair? ""Yeah, I do,"" he responded. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., was asked at another point if the Republican nominee would accept the outcome of the election. Like everyone else, he rejected his father's own words. ""He will, barring rampant fraud,"" Trump Jr. responded. Given what Trump's campaign had been saying earlier in the day, it's no surprise that Trump refused to say he would accept the results of the election, or that his surrogates would bend over backward to pretend he actually meant that he would. Trump senior aide Boris Epshteyn told me that ""voter fraud has been rampant in this country and we want to make sure that there's integrity in voting."" This is all Trump's talk of usurping American democracy was really about: integrity. Epshteyn then cited multiple examples that he claimed demonstrated fraud, none of which actually did. The key line was a claim Epshteyn had been pushing in recent days that a debunked and essentially retracted article from the Washington Post in 2014 showed that enough non-citizens might have voted in the 2008 presidential election in North Carolina to sway that contest for Barack Obama (he won by a bit more than 14,000 votes). Not only is the evidence for this theory wrong, the theory itself doesn't make any sense. ""If you're an illegal immigrant, you usually don't do criminal acts because you're concerned about exposure and removal from the country,"" Robert Lang, director of The Lincy Institute and of Brookings Mountain West at UNLV, told me before the debate. ""The value of a single vote is so small that it's a very high-risk, low-yield thing to do: You're not going to likely change an election and you're putting yourself at risk of discovery."" What about Epshteyn's other claims of fraud, specifically his citation that some members of ACORN monkeyed around with the voter rolls during the 2008 election? (This did indeed happen, though it's never been proven to have had an effect on the vote count). ""First of all, ACORN doesn't exist anymore so your fear of ACORN is misplaced if you're going to say it's in this cycle,"" Lang said. ""Voter registration issues like that are so few and far between, and states are so large relative to them."" What about general voter fraud? ""This idea that there's dead people--people have looked into those claims,"" Lang responded. ""It's a pretty clean voting system. And, by the way, it's an insult to every Republican secretary of state, as well, that somehow these people can't handle this."" Again, the voter fraud claim is nonsensical. There are more than 3,000 counties running voting operations in this country, with power completely decentralized in our elections. ""Rigging this thing would require participation of both parties. It would have dozens and hundreds of thousands of volunteers,"" Lang notes. ""Most of these people are doing public service by volunteering, they're doing civic duties. So it's a real stab at that and the whole thing is completely bogus."" Maybe Trump's threat not to accept the results of the election has some historical basis, though, as Sessions suggested. ""It's unprecedented and I think it's bad for the country, truthfully,"" UNLV associate history professor Michael Green told me before the debate. ""There is one election where one side did not accept the result: 1860."" Trump's refusal to say that he will accept reality flummoxed not only Republicans, historians, and electoral experts. Democrats struggled with it too. ""It's racial intimidation,"" Jesse Jackson told me of Trump's calls for his supporters to monitor polls in ""certain areas"" on Election Day. ""What I find to be astonishing is he will not accept the results of the campaign, wants to play by his own rules. He will think that if he doesn't win, it's rigged. That's not fair."" Did Jackson fear an outbreak of violence if Trump loses and refuses to accept the result? ""I hope it will not happen,"" he said. ""He is trying to incite it, but it has not happened and it should not happen."" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/trump_s_final_debate_was_a_slow_motion_meltdown.html	"Much of the post-debate conventional wisdom on cable news and the internet suggests that Donald Trump was having a fine debate for the first 50 minutes or so. Eh? It looked like a standard 50 minutes of Trump demonstrating that he's not qualified to be president. He had a horrible time explaining his deportation plan and used the term ""bad hombres""; he got battered over his belief that we should kick South Korea and Japan out from under the nuclear umbrella and over his general misunderstanding of nuclear deterrence. He couldn't defend the numbers on his tax and spending plans. But sure, he didn't egregiously misbehave himself, as he's capable of doing, which was all he needed for competition-hungry, low-bar pundits to declare this his finest debate ever, maybe the greatest debate performance of all time. Comeback time, here we go. And then the rest of the debate happened. No one could spin that away. The closing half of the debate was a debacle for Trump, and the way his anger seemed to build as the night wore on suggested he knew it. He knew that this debate was his last good opportunity to shake up a race that shows him losing by an incredible margin, by the standards of the polarized era, against a deeply unpopular but competent representative of the status quo. Instead, in the final minutes of 2016's cycle of presidential debating, he lost ground, lost the debate, and continued losing the election. He's really going to need his boy Julian Assange to come through with that grainy 1990s camcorder footage of Hillary Clinton murdering Vince Foster now. Let's divide the meltdown into three parts. It began with Chris Wallace's question about the women who have come forward accusing him of sexual misconduct. ""Why would they make up these stories?"" Wallace asked. ""I believe, Chris, she got these people to step forward,"" Trump said. ""If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame, but they were all totally--it was all fiction. It was lies and it was fiction."" It was Clinton's turn. ""At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women, and after that a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them,"" she said. ""Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for him."" This is true, but Trump denied it. ""I did not say that."" Clinton had the quotes down. ""He went on to say to her: 'Look at her. I don't think so.' About another woman, he said that 'wouldn't be my first choice.' He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, calling her 'disgusting.'

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/rumors_of_bill_clinton_s_secret_black_son_have_been_around_since_at_least.html	"""You're really gonna write about the Danney Williams thing again?"" Steve Denari asks when I reach him by phone. ""I hope you put it to bed."" The ""Danney Williams thing"" is the musty allegation that Bill Clinton fathered an illegitimate black son. Naturally, it's bubbled up into this year's election cycle. The Daily Mail went there. InfoWars went there. The Drudge Report went there, too. The chairman of Utah's Republican Party went there, live on CNN. It's a reasonable guess that Steve Bannon, the CEO of Donald Trump's campaign, would like to go there for Wednesday night's presidential debate. The rumor has bounced around since Clinton's first run for president. In The War Room, a 1993 documentary about Clinton's campaign team, a scene shows George Stephanopoulos fielding a phone call from Denari, then a Ross Perot campaign official apparently in possession of a fat dossier on Clinton's supposed love child. With the rumor back in the news, I thought I'd track down Denari to find out how he'd gotten his hands on that dossier, and what he did with it after he hung up with Stephanopoulos. I found him at the bottom of this press release announcing ""a new convertible debt/equity fund"" concentrating on the medical marijuana sector--known as the ""Amerijuana Fund""--that Denari had apparently tried to launch in 2014. After some cagey text messaging (he said he was recovering from a surgery that made it hard to talk), he eventually agreed to get on the phone with me. He was reluctant to dredge up ancient history but willing to answer my questions if it meant setting the record straight. Denari says he was the Chicago campaign manager for Perot in 1992, doing lots of regional media on behalf of the candidate. The love child dossier had arrived anonymously at the desk of the Illinois state director for the Perot campaign, who passed it along to Denari with the thought that he might mention it on air. It was the day before the election. Denari was scheduled to go on Bruce DuMont's live national radio show that night. The folder was two or three inches thick, stuffed with ""copies of copies""--faxes, canceled checks, photos of Williams and a young Clinton juxtaposed. The checks were supposedly child support payments. ""It was a phone book worth of stuff,"" says Denari. ""I didn't have time to read it all. Anybody could forge it. You or I could."" Denari suspected the materials had come from people on the Bush campaign who hoped the Perot team would do their dirty work. He decided he'd call the Clinton campaign to see what they'd say. So he did, an hour before DuMont's show started. ""I wasn't just going to go out and mention something like this the night before the election. I wasn't going to do it unless they gave me some kind of no comment--'Do what you want, we don't care.' "" ""Believe me that it's been looked at by every major national news organization,"" says Stephanopoulos to Denari, unseen and unheard at the other end of the phone line, in the scene from The War Room. ""And it is completely bullshit. If you went on the radio and said that Bill Clinton is the father of an illegitimate black child, you would be laughed at and people would think you're crazy. ... You will be embarrassed before the national press corps. Nobody will believe you. And people will think you're scummy."" Denari says that was good enough for him. He chucked the dossier in his fireplace. He never mentioned it on air. ""I didn't go with it because it wasn't an honorable thing,"" he says. ""If it were real, I think it would have been released some other way than anonymously over the transom to the Perot campaign."" That was that, until 1999, when Denari was awoken one morning by a phone call from a talk radio show in Denver. Matt Drudge and Lucianne Goldberg, the doyenne of Clinton smears in the 1990s, were guests on the show, and they'd decided to ring Denari to inquire about the dossier and demand he release the materials. (Presumably someone had rented The War Room from Blockbuster that week.) Denari told them he felt there was nothing worthwhile in the documents and that he'd destroyed them. Soon after the segment ended, Goldberg called him again and asked to put him in touch with a British reporter. ""I thought I could finally squelch it,"" says Denari. ""I told him the same story."" The resultant article, written by Daniel Jeffreys for the Daily Mail and published Jan. 8, 1999, was headlined ""Could This Boy Bring Down the President?"" It quotes Denari describing the dossier contents, including a photo putatively showing Clinton with Williams' mother at an Arkansas nightclub. The article went on to claim that Denari was writing a book about the dossier and publishing its contents. ""He writes this ridiculous story that I've got this stuff and am saving it for a book I'm writing,"" Denari says now. ""Lucianne Goldberg must have had some friendly over there. He made that story up. They'll pimp anything over there."" (In his journalism days, Jeffreys had a rep for doing this sort of thing.) At the end of the call in The War Room, Stephanopoulos hints that the Clinton campaign will remember Denari kindly if he refrains from mentioning the dossier on air. So I ask Denari if anything ever came of that. He says Clinton's campaign manager, David Wilhelm, called him the day after the election to thank him and to invite him to some inaugural events, but Denari declined the invitation. When he ran for Congress against Denny Hastert in 1994, Denari says, he received no help from the Clintons. (To be fair, although he was running as a Democrat, Denari also failed to receive the support of the DeKalb County Democratic Central Committee, which endorsed the Republican Hastert--citing in part the fact that Denari had made that phone call to Stephanopoulos.) Denari has lain low in this cycle. He says I was the first reporter to contact him about the Danney Williams story. He tells me he is now a ""freelance strategic consultant"" based in southern Illinois. His most recent brush with the love child story was eight years ago, when he made an 18-minute video about his part in the saga. He sent copies to Bill and Hillary Clinton, James Carville, Stephanopoulos, and Wilhelm. He sent me a copy, too, hoping it would help answer my questions. The video features Denari dubbing his side of the phone call into the scene from The War Room. It goes on to advertise a charity Denari was working with and closes with Denari asking Bill Clinton to be the executive technical consultant on a TV series Denari and his daughter were then trying to create. As for Danney Williams, the alleged Clinton scion? He--or someone claiming to be him--has Twitter and Facebook pages that continue to assert his genetic link to the 42nd president. A 1999 paternity test (using the DNA sequence taken from the semen on Monica Lewinsky's dress and published in the Starr Report) failed to prove the claim. But a contemporaneous Slate story argued that the test was not definitive. The Danney Williams thing won't be going to bed anytime soon. It seems as if it's just now waking up from a short nap.

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/what_chris_wallace_should_ask_trump_clinton_at_final_debate.html	"Wednesday night is the last debate of the most difficult, depressing, maddening election cycle in recent American history. It is probably also the last chance for a television anchor--in this case, Fox News' Chris Wallace--to ask Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump pointed, aggressive, illuminating questions in front of a massive audience of likely voters. So what should he ask? Below is Slate's best attempt to articulate what we think Trump and Clinton should still have to answer for. Some of these questions are grounded in the events of the past week, some are what we wish the candidates would be asked were we living in an alternate universe where this election was not such a total shit show. Some are single questions, and others have follow-ups because there should be follow-ups, Chris Wallace. All of them are important. Michelle Goldberg, columnist: I would like Chris Wallace to ask Donald Trump, ""Why don't people like you?"" Over her many decades in public life, Hillary Clinton has, again and again, been asked versions of this same humiliating question. In a 2008 primary debate, the moderator put it this way: ""What can you say to the voters of New Hampshire on this stage tonight who see your resume and like it but are hesitating on the likability issue?"" It's certainly true, as I've written about at length, that a lot of people really hate Clinton. But do you know who else people really hate? Donald Trump! Somehow, though, the widespread revulsion he inspires is never seen as something that he has to either account or apologize for. Obviously, likability is far less important than the many matters of public policy at stake in this election. But let's be honest--to attempt a substantive political exchange with Trump is a category error. Facts are irrelevant for him; emotion is what matters. So out of fairness, I'd like to see him asked about the emotional response he elicits, just as Clinton so often is. It's telling, in this sexual Rorschach test of an election, that we only expect one of the two candidates to be responsible for the way they make people feel. Jamelle Bouie, chief political correspondent: Given that Hillary Clinton is most likely to be president, I'd want Chris Wallace to press her on her opening plans as chief executive. In her first 100 days, what does Clinton intend to introduce to Congress? Why that legislation over other priorities? If she can't find cooperation from, say, a Republican House, what is she willing to sacrifice or concede to move that legislation forward? And if she's unwilling to make those sacrifices or concessions, does she intend to follow President Obama's lead and use the power of the executive branch to make progress on that concern? How, and as a follow-up to ""how?,"" is she worried about the long-term implications of that kind of turn to the executive branch, to the exclusion of legislative action? Does she worry whether it weakens separation of powers and concentrates too much authority in the executive branch? Leon Neyfakh, staff writer: It's conventional wisdom at this point that Trump's rise has revealed something ugly about the American people that a lot of us didn't fully understand before. More specifically, it has revealed that a large chunk of the populace is consumed with profound anger and racial resentment. I'd like Wallace to ask Clinton whether this revelation has in any way changed the goals and hopes she would bring with her to the White House. Does the fact that so many Americans have shown a willingness to support an authoritarian alter her conception of the country? Insofar as Trump's popularity is a symptom of problems a president could help fix, what does she think those problems are, and how would she fix them? I would ask Trump to narrate, from morning to night, how he imagines a typical day in the life of the president. What order of business will he attend to first thing after waking up? How will he decide what issues to deal with once he gets to his desk? What does he think will take up most of his time? These would be my questions because I am sincerely curious what Trump thinks the job he's running for is like and why he wants it. William Saletan, national correspondent: I want Wallace to ask them both: ""Is there anything you have done in your career that you now recognize as simply wrong? I'm not looking for something you can explain or justify. I'm looking for something for which you genuinely feel shame and something that you're willing to acknowledge as wrong, without offering any excuses."" I realize the question might sound like a cliche, but the point of it is to embarrass either candidate if they use the question to spin what they did into something positive. I don't think either of them could pass this test, but maybe Hillary would surprise me. Jordan Weissmann, senior business and economics correspondent: Since we're talking about a Fox News debate, I don't expect this to happen. But I would be overjoyed--like, literally, fist-pumping, end zone-dance giddy--if Chris Wallace were to ask the candidates whether they believe in man-made climate change, aka the single greatest threat to human civilization we currently face, and if they have any plans to do something about it. So far, the closest we've come to a direct question on the subject has come from Ken Bone, who just asked how the candidates would save fossil fuel-industry jobs while making their energy policy ""environmentally friendly."" And nobody bothered listening to the candidates' answers because we were all too busy losing our minds over Bone's sweater-'stache combo. The almost complete silence on this topic during the debates has been disgraceful, and this is our last chance to fix it. Joshua Keating, staff writer: In her campaign for president, Hillary Clinton has faced one opponent, Bernie Sanders, with almost no interest in challenging her on foreign policy, and another, Donald Trump, who's so ludicrously unqualified to handle national security that raising qualms about her positions seems almost churlish. This is unfortunate, because despite Clinton's obvious level of foreign-policy experience and superiority to her opponent in this area, there are still a number of areas where I don't think her foreign policy views have gotten enough scrutiny. Given the circumstances, I don't actually hope Chris Wallace asks these questions Wednesday night. But here are some of the things I would want Hillary to be asked in a public forum if this were a normal election in which she were facing a remotely qualified opponent: Won't a no-fly zone in Syria simply escalate the violence there?
Clinton has, in the past, advocated for the establishment of a no-fly zone in northern Syria to protect civilians and support U.S.-allied rebel groups. But she herself may have doubts about the strategy. In an apparent excerpt from a speech to Goldman Sachs revealed by WikiLeaks, Clinton noted correctly that establishing a no-fly zone would require destroying Syrian air defenses, which are located in populated areas, putting both U.S. pilots and Syrian civilians at risk, so ""all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians."" A no-fly zone would also increase the risk of a clash between U.S. and Russian forces and could simply prompt Russia to escalate its military involvement in Syria. Assuming Clinton genuinely backs this strategy, I assume she's thought these problems through, and I'd like to hear how she'd address them. Why are we helping Saudi Arabia bomb Yemen?
Yemen, which briefly made headlines a few days ago when U.S. Navy ships fired missiles at Houthi rebels, is the Obama administration's forgotten war--which is lucky for the administration because it's pretty hard to defend. The U.S. has been providing logistical and intelligence support for the Saudi air campaign, which has included attacks on civilians that have been described as war crimes and may actually be benefiting al-Qaida. It undercuts America's moral outrage over Russia and Syria bombing hospitals in Aleppo when a U.S.-supported operation is doing the same thing in Yemen. Hopefully a ceasefire agreed to this week leads to something more lasting, but I'd like to hear our next commander in chief explain what exactly the U.S. is trying to accomplish there. Related question: Is it time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia?
The Obama administration may have had reasonable legal grounds for vetoing a bill allowing the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, but it was still a bit unseemly that the administration was willing to take its one overturned veto in defense of an autocratic, human rights-abusing, religious extremism-promoting kingdom. With Washington and Riyadh at odds on a number of regional issues--from Egypt, to the Iran deal, to Syria strategy--and the American economy far less dependent on Saudi oil than it used to be, do we still need to suck up to Saudi Arabia quite so much? In one of the most memorable speeches of her career, the then first lady famously told a U.N. conference in Beijing in 1995 that ""women's rights are human rights,"" specifically taking aim at the effects of the host country's one-child policy on women and girls. Would she ever make a similar stand against a close U.S. ally that bars women from driving or traveling without a male chaperone? Should we have done anything differently in Libya?
No, I'm not just talking about Benghazi. Clinton was one of the staunchest voices within the Obama administration backing military action to remove Moammar Gadhafi from power in 2011. Her answers defending that decision, on the rare occasions she's been asked about it, have not been that satisfying. Clinton may still feel (with some justification) that removing Gadhafi was the right decision at the time, but I'd like to hear more from her about what could have been done to prevent the chaos that followed, particularly given the seeming likelihood that she'll be much more of an interventionist than Obama. What ever happened to the pivot to Asia?
As the questions above indicate, events in the Middle East and North Africa have continued to dominate the U.S. foreign policy agenda in the closing years of the Obama administration. It wasn't supposed to be that way. In a 2011 article published in Foreign Policy, then-Secretary of State Clinton introduced the concept of the ""pivot"" to Asia, the idea that as the U.S. draws down its military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, it should shift its diplomatic, economic, and strategic resources toward the Asia-Pacific region, which is poised to become the ""key driver of global politics"" going forward. Unfortunately, a never-ending series of challenges from the Middle East and Russia have made the pivot difficult to carry out. Is Clinton still committed to it? These questions are just a start and regrettably leave out whole swathes of the world including the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe. But I think they would help draw out a better sense of how Clinton views America's role in the world--something that this demoralizing election has left alarmingly unexplored. Josh Voorhees, senior writer: If Wallace doesn't ask about the rigged election talk, the whole debate's a farce. Here's how he should word his question: ""Mr. Trump, you maintain that this election is 'rigged' and is already being 'stolen' from you via 'large-scale voter fraud,' of which you have offered no specific evidence. Your campaign is now recruiting volunteer poll watchers, and at a rally earlier this year you told your supporters, quote: ""You've got to get every one of your friends, you've got to get every one of your family, you've got to get everybody to go out and watch. And go out and vote. And when I say 'watch,' you know what I'm talking about, right? You know what I'm talking about."" Mr. Trump, what exactly are you asking your supporters to do on Election Day? And are you at all concerned their actions will amount to voter intimidation, which is a federal offense and punishable by prison time?"" Jeremy Stahl, senior editor: For Trump, Wallace should ask: ""At least eight women have come forward to say you assaulted them in the exact way you described doing in the Access Hollywood video. You have said that was 'locker room talk' and you never actually did these things to women: ""just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait"" and ""grab them by the pussy."" Were you lying when you claimed to do those things, or are you lying now? For Hillary: ""Why should we believe Donald Trump's alleged accusers and not the multiple women who have accused your husband of sexual assault? And do you think there is such a thing as enabling sexual abusers by refusing to acknowledge their crimes?"" Jim Newell, staff writer: Because I'm a pedantic, tiresome ""Washington Beltway insider,"" I would like Chris Wallace to use this final opportunity for candidates to explain their hopes and dreams to tens of millions of voters to ask tedious questions about legislative strategy. Each of these candidates has big plans to do this, that, or the other thing, but neither has explained how they will pass any of it. Addressing these issues now will spare the inevitable heartache for respective partisans in 2017. There are a few ways Wallace could approach my wet-blanket line of boring, process-centric inquiry. He could point out that whichever candidate gets elected will have no ""mandate"" to speak of, since they're both well underwater in approval ratings. How would they compel the opposing congressional party to coordinate with them on big-ticket items, when--as unpopular politicians--the opposing party has little political incentive to cooperate? If their party controls the Senate and the minority just filibusters everything, is the filibuster's continuing existence negotiable? If he really wants to get into the good stuff, Wallace could ask about what legislative items they'd push Congress to pass through budget reconciliation and whether those items would pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian. I'm just not sure he'll have enough time!"	Make Them Squirm, Chris Wallace	['Clinton', 'Jordan', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/trump_and_the_gop_are_openly_attacking_the_legitimacy_of_black_voting.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Donald Trump doesn't know how to lose. In 2013, when his show The Apprentice got stiffed by the Emmys, Trump said the process was unfair and political. In 2012, after Mitt Romney lost the race for president, Trump denounced the results as a fix for Barack Obama. He tweeted: ""The phoney electoral college made a laughing stock out of our nation. The loser one! We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!"" After Trump lost delegates to Ted Cruz at state conventions in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, North Dakota, and South Carolina, he denounced the process as ""rigged."" And now that he's losing to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, he has begun insisting that the game was rigged from the start. ""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,"" Trump tweeted on Sunday. ""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" he tweeted Monday. None of this is true. The United States presidential election is more akin to 50 separate state elections (and the District of Columbia), organized by 50 separate sets of state officials, with a variety of different rules and processes. And on the ground level, these elections are run by thousands of different people of every possible political affiliation. The process of electing a president is too decentralized and fragmented for anyone to ""rig"" it at the ballot box in any systematic way. As for ""voter fraud,"" the evidence is clear. Setting aside the fact that the election hasn't happened yet, the ""in-person"" fraud that Trump alludes to--where someone impersonates another voter to cast multiple ballots--happens so infrequently as to be essentially nonexistent. Out of 1 billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014, according to the most comprehensive investigation of voter fraud, there were just 31 instances of possible impersonation. Other forms of fraudulent voting are similarly rare. There is no basis for Trump's claim. But that doesn't mean it won't stick. Already, according to the latest poll from Politico and Morning Consult, 41 percent of registered voters believe that the election could be stolen from the GOP presidential nominee. When respondents were broken down by party lines, 73 percent of Republicans said they feared a rigged election, compared with just 17 percent of Democrats. This outcome is a function of two facts. The first is partisanship--voters tend to agree with their chosen candidates. And that is tied to the second: the conduct and rhetoric of the Republican Party over the past decade. In the eight years since Barack Obama won the presidency, GOP lawmakers across the country have embarked on an aggressive campaign for new voter restrictions, all bolstered by false stories and insinuations of voter fraud. Minor problems--the occasional duplicate registration or misidentified voter that comes with running an election system--are turned into lurid stories of election year malfeasance, which then justify harsh new laws for voter identification and voter access. Justifying their sweeping and restrictive voting law, North Carolina Republicans pointed to an alleged 35,000 cases of fraudulent voting in the 2012 election, based on a report from the state's board of elections. ""These findings should put to rest ill-informed claims that problems don't exist and help restore the integrity of our elections process,"" wrote then-North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis in a statement. The problem was that the report said nothing of the sort. That 35,000 figure represented duplicate names and dates of birth--people who had the same information as others who voted that year. This isn't uncommon; it's possible that this is some combination of clerical errors, false positives, and actual people who share a name and birth date. ""We are not jumping to conclusions here,"" explained a spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. ""This may constitute evidence of voter fraud, voter error, poll worker error, or data problems."" North Carolina Republicans weren't alone in hyping claims of fraudulent voting. In Ohio and Florida, GOP lawmakers have done the same, all to justify new voting restrictions. What's troubling is that Republicans seem to know that fraud is nearly nonexistent. When caught behind closed doors, or in a verbal slip, GOP lawmakers don't cite fraud when defending voter ID or other restrictive measures; they cite raw partisan advantage. ""Pro-Second Amendment? The Castle Doctrine, it's done. First pro-life legislation--abortion facility regulations--in 22 years, done. Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done,"" said one Pennsylvania Republican ahead of the 2012 presidential election, stating plainly that voter ID was a measure to help achieve a partisan outcome. In Wisconsin, during a 2011 race for the state's supreme court, conservative officials workshopped false claims of fraud:"	There Is a Conspiracy to Rig the Election, and Donald Trump Is Part of It	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Romney', 'Cruz', 'Tillis', 'Obama']	[]
8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/trump_and_the_gop_are_alienating_latinos_the_way_they_once_alienated_black.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. For most of the now almost-forgotten vice presidential debate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence kept his cool, ignoring, deflecting, or outright denying any effort by Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine to tie him to his running mate, Donald Trump. But it's hard to keep your composure for the length of a debate. It takes work. And toward the end of the 90-minute showdown, Pence began to falter, and then with a single infelicitous phrase he evoked the only wall Trump will ever build: the one between the Republican Party and Latino voters. It happened after Kaine returned to Trump's rhetoric, pressing Pence to answer for his running mate's insults and bigotry. ""When Donald Trump says women or Mexicans are rapists and criminals ... or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is,"" said the Virginia senator, to which Pence had a reply. ""Senator,"" he said, ""you've whipped out that Mexican thing again."" Adding, ""There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives."" That Mexican thing. That Mexican thing, to be precise, is Trump's anti-Hispanic demagoguery, which stretches back to the beginning of the campaign. ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" said Trump when he opened his campaign last summer. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" The Trump-Pence ticket is well behind its Democratic opponent, trailing by more than 7 points in the Pollster average. And the reason, in part, is his incredibly poor performance with Hispanic voters, who see Trump as an unacceptable risk. This is no small thing. Political parties can make inroads with groups that disagree with them--that's just persuasion. But it's difficult, if not impossible, to make gains with groups that see you as a danger to their futures. By placing Donald Trump at the top of the ticket and indulging his nativism and xenophobia, the Republican Party has said with its actions that it doesn't want Latinos in its tent. Republicans may thus end up estranged from another group of nonwhite voters--not because there aren't conservative or right-leaning people in the Latino community, but because the GOP has shown itself hostile to the idea of a pluralistic, multiracial America with room and opportunity for Americans of all origins. You've seen this throughout the election, from Trump's attacks on federal judge Gonzalo Curiel to his performance at the Republican National Convention--where he cast Hispanic immigrants as an existential threat to American life--to his marquee speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, where he called for a new national focus on rooting out unauthorized immigrants. ""Under my administration,"" said Trump, ""anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came."" For Trump, Latino immigrants join Muslims and Syrian refugees as potential threats, fundamentally incompatible with American life. If they're here, they have to be removed, and if they're not here, they need to be kept out. In turn, for Latino Americans and their families, this makes Trump an existential threat to their lives and livelihoods. Only 21 percent of Latinos say the GOP cares about their community, and 70 percent say that Trump has made the Republican Party more hostile to them. In another survey, polling and research firm Latino Decisions asked Latino registered voters to gauge two statements: ""Donald Trump's campaign talk and policy views make me fear for the future of my family and our country"" and ""Donald Trump truly has the best interest of my family and our country in mind."" Eighty-two percent of respondents agreed with the first statement, that Trump makes them fear for their families and their country. Eighteen percent agreed with the latter. This isn't the first time the Republican Party has lost an entire demographic group through hostility and disdain. At the dawn of the 1960s, as Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater rose to become the voice for ideological conservatism, black Republicans warned that his ideology would create an irreparable breach between the GOP and its black supporters. ""Any Negro who helps the cause of Goldwater, should be declared anything but a Negro, because they will be a traitor to the Negro people,"" wrote a party member named Jackson R. Champion in an August 1964 editorial letter to the New York Amsterdam News, one of the oldest black newspapers in the United States. As historian Leah Wright Rigueur notes in The Loneliness of the Black Republican: Pragmatic Politics and the Pursuit of Power, this was far from atypical. Baseball pioneer Jackie Robinson, who'd endorsed Richard Nixon in 1960 and attended the 1964 Republican National Convention as a ""special delegate"" for New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, ""asserted that any black leader who demonstrated support for [Goldwater] would lose power and influence since 'the Negro is not going to tolerate any Uncle Toms in 1964.' "" She recounts the story of one black voter, a Cleveland man who backed Richard Nixon in the 1960 election, stating that Goldwater ""isn't for us ... and I'd be a damn fool if I voted for a man who's against me."" There was no mystery to black hostility for Goldwater. The Arizona senator rejected the moderate Republicanism of Dwight Eisenhower (and many black party members) in favor of a doctrinaire conservatism that closed all doors to government action in civil and economic life. Rather than a ""dime store New Deal,"" he promised small government, individual liberty, and states' rights. If Goldwater's libertarian-style ideology drew worry from black Republicans--who believed the government should work to uplift black Americans through economic programs--then his ""states' rights"" advocacy triggered outright alarm. Then as now, ""states' rights"" was a clear sop to Southern reactionaries who opposed a robust federal role in civil rights. Worse, Goldwater disparaged the Republican effort to win over black citizens, a key swing vote in 1960 who, with a little more outreach, might have delivered the White House to Richard Nixon. ""As he expounded during a March 1961 meeting,"" recounts Rigueur, ""the party should 'quit trying to win Negro votes' since the African American electorate had no sense of loyalty or gratitude. 'Party leaders should face up to the fact that although Republicans have done more for the Negro,' Goldwater complained, 'Democrats are getting more and more of their votes.' "" A later speech was even more direct. ""We're not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 ... so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are."" The result of Goldwater's rhetoric and ideology was a historic rout with the black electorate. Just 6 percent of black voters cast ballots for the Arizona senator, an 81 percent drop from the last presidential race, when Nixon won 32 percent of black ballots. (And before Nixon, Eisenhower had won 39 percent of black voters in the 1956 election.) The repudiation of Goldwater would be the last step in a realignment of black Americans that had begun in the days of Franklin Roosevelt. From then on, the national Republican Party would struggle to crack double digits with black voters, despite the strength of traditional beliefs and practices among black communities, from religious practice to traditions of self-help and self-reliance. The reason was straightforward: Goldwater wasn't just offensive; he articulated a vision of national life that would inevitably leave black Americans on the margins as second-class citizens, subject to the whims of segregationists and their allies. And if Goldwater didn't see it, his explicitly anti-black allies did. As Rigueur writes, one black delegate to the 1964 Republican National Convention, George Fleming, ""ran sobbing from the convention floor, crying that he was sick of being abused by Goldwater supporters. 'They call you 'nigger,' push you and step on your feet,' he muttered to reporters, wiping tears from his eyes. 'I had to leave to keep my self-respect.' "" The ideology that Goldwater articulated and his party embraced would put the modern GOP fundamentally at odds with America's people of color. No matter the temperamental affinities that might exist between some nonwhites and the Republican Party, attempts to bring them into the fold inevitably run up against a key reality: that movement conservatism--the starve-the-beast, libertarian mode that dominates contemporary Republican politics--is a white ideology. Unresponsive to the particular concerns of nonwhites--around issues of discrimination and racial inequality--it is a drive to preserve a status quo built around the political and economic dominance of white Americans. This is more explicit in the age of Donald Trump, but it's always been true, from Goldwater to the present. Like their black counterparts in the first half of the 20th century, Latino voters have been a fluid constituency.  The GOP's worst performance was in 1996, when Bob Dole won just 21 percent of Latino voters. The culprit was California's Proposition 187, passed in 1994 under Gov. Pete Wilson, which explicitly targeted Hispanic immigrants. It denied public services like health care and education to anyone who had illegally entered the country, and was part of a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment in the state's politics. Most of its provisions were eventually struck down, but its political impact would transform California politics. George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns were explicit efforts to undo the damage Proposition 187 had done to the national Republican Party, and it worked. In the 2004 election, for example, exit polls had George W. Bush with 44 percent among Latinos, an all-time high for a Republican presidential nominee. Subsequent analysis revised that number down to 40 percent, still an improvement over 2000, when Bush won 35 percent of Latino voters. His performance put him above Ronald Reagan, who won 37 percent of Latino voters in his 1984 landslide. But the gains were only temporary. In the wake of Bush's failed attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform, the Republican Party made a decisive return to immigration restrictionism. In 2008, under pressure from the Republican base, John McCain abandoned his support for his own immigration bill, hitting a hard-line note to secure his right flank. ""One thing we would all agree on, the status quo is not acceptable. We have to secure our borders,"" said McCain during one presidential debate. The Great Recession supercharged anti-immigration--and anti-immigrant--sentiment among GOP voters, and Republican lawmakers followed along, passing restrictive new laws after the party swept statehouses in the 2010 midterm elections. Indeed, we saw an inkling of rising anti-Latino sentiment in 2009, when Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court was met with a wave of racist criticism. ""She is an affirmative action pick,"" declared commentator Pat Buchanan. ""Clearly the president was down to four choices, all of them women, and he picked the Hispanic."" In 2010, Arizona embraced a measure that all but criminalized brown skin. Not only was it now illegal for unauthorized immigrants to apply for jobs or solicit work, but police were empowered to consider ""race, color, or national origin"" when questioning someone's citizenship. Deemed the ""papers please"" law by critics, it inflamed sentiment against the Republican Party, and was eventually invalidated by the Supreme Court. Despite the backlash, Republicans would move further down the path of restrictionism. In 2012, Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney endorsed ""self-deportation,"" a strategy--devised by anti-immigration activists like Kris Kobach and Mark Krikorian--to force unauthorized immigrants to leave the country of their own volition, by making life intolerable for them and their families. As Romney explained during a Republican presidential debate, ""We'd have a card that indicates who's here illegally. ... And if people are not able to have a card, and have through an E-Verify system determine that they are here illegally, then they're going to find they can't get work here. And if people don't get work here, they're going to self-deport to a place where they can get work."" Romney took the right-most position on immigration, and used it to sink his strongest rivals, like then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Unfortunately for Romney, however, ""self-deportation"" would cling to him through the general election, and weigh him down with Latino voters. In the aftermath of his defeat, Republican leaders--including the Republican National Committee--would finger his immigration stance and call for reform, prompting a new effort, led by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Like Bush before him, Rubio would crash against conservative opposition, organized by the most hard-right and anti-immigrant voices in the party, from Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and Iowa Rep. Steve King to conservative activists and radio hosts. By 2014, immigration reform was all but dead, killed by hard-line Republicans in the House of Representatives. The underlying fact, through all of this, was the intense anti-immigration and anti-immigrant sentiment of Republican voters. It fueled explicitly anti-immigration politicians like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and played a part in House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's surprise primary defeat to Dave Brat, an obscure conservative activist. And in the summer of 2015, it would shoot Donald Trump to the top of the polls, where he would stay, feeding sentiments with wild and prejudiced claims against a constellation of foreign targets, and Hispanic immigrants in particular. What's popular with the Republican base has been poisonous with Latino voters. The latest tracking poll from Latino Decisions shows Republican nominee Donald Trump with 16 percent support, versus 74 percent for Hillary Clinton. Looking ahead to November, the group expects that electorate to cast the vast majority of its votes for Clinton, 82 percent to 15 percent for Trump, which would be the most lopsided total in history. If this happens, Latino Americans will join blacks as one of the most Democratic groups in the country, and at 57 million strong (including 27.3 million eligible voters), one of the largest, too. According to a new survey from the Pew Research Center, 69 percent of Latino registered voters say they are ""absolutely certain"" to vote, and 44 percent say they are voting to oppose Trump. Both voting and party affiliation are habits. Once set, they tend not to change. And looking forward from the present, there's a real chance that Latino voting takes the same path as black voting, with routine and overwhelming support going to Democratic presidential candidates. Again, California gives us a glimpse of what this looks like. Following Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's anti-immigrant crusades in the 1990s, Latino Californians moved decisively into the Democratic column. By the end of the last decade, the state was a Democratic stronghold, with Democratic officeholders at almost every level of government. The once-dominant California Republican Party, by contrast, was a rump force, with little power or influence outside of its historic strongholds in the state's interior. In the wake of Obama's election, the national Republican Party was already on this path. But Trump has been an accelerant, driving Latino Americans away from the GOP with xenophobia and unyielding hostility. And in fact, this has had an unintended side effect: Asian Americans are leaving the Republican Party, too, in record numbers, and for similar reasons. A GOP that nominates Trump--and embraces nativism--is one that lacks room for all immigrant and nonwhite groups. Black Republicans resisted Barry Goldwater and his brand of doctrinaire, ideological conservatism. They backed moderate candidates for president, built alliances, and formed organizations meant to roll back the rising tide of movement conservatism. In its manifesto, one of those organizations--the Negro Republican Organization--promised to ""oppose any attempt to give the public any impression that Negro Republicans can unite behind Goldwater"" and ""make every effort to defeat the minority segment which appears determined to establish a lily-white Republican Party."" The NRO lost its fight. That ""minority segment"" is now a majority, and in the past 10 years, it has finally established a lily-white Republican Party. It's tempting to say that this GOP won't survive--that it's too homogeneous to succeed in a modern, diverse America. But if Donald Trump loses this election, he will likely lose by just a few points. With a nicer suit, steadier hands, and a better attitude, Trump--or at least Trumpism--could succeed nationally. And for those Republicans who don't want Trump or Trumpism? It may be too late. The thing about a lily-white Republican Party is that it doesn't have the diversity it needs to resist white resentment and white rage. Republicans crossed a point of no return. Raw ethnonationalism is their future, even if they don't want it. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	It Lost Black Voters. Now It's Losing Latinos. What's Left Is a Broken, White GOP.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/a_dispatch_from_a_normal_trump_rally_in_cincinnati.html	"CINCINNATI-- I was ready for almost anything at Thursday's Trump rally. But I was still taken aback by one person I met: a black, female, teenage immigrant Trump supporter. The unicorn of American politics. ""He went to the inner cities and told the kids he was going to help them,"" said Amoni Jalen, a 19-year-old native of Liberia who had come from Louisville, Kentucky, with friends to the Trump rally here on Thursday. ""That's a big plus for me. I grew up in the ghetto."" Jalen was eager to talk and quickly departed from my list of questions. Her family moved from Liberia in 2003, when she was 5, and bounced around the United States. ""I grew up in New Jersey, Philadelphia, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Arizona, Iowa,"" she said. ""What can you do when your mom thinks you're going to get shot? We moved a lot."" Jalen can't vote as she's not yet a citizen, but that has not stopped her from being politically active. While they lived in New Hampshire in 2008, her parents took her to an Obama rally. ""I was so happy! First black president. Everything was so amazing. The thing was, after a year was over, I was like, 'What was I so hyped about?' But I appreciate him."" Jalen went on to say that she didn't think Obama was effective in dealing with the racial problems in the U.S., though she added, ""I have never been president, so I can't judge him on why he did what he did."" And now? ""I'm picking the lesser of two evils, and he's not a liar. For now."" As someone who is also looking for the least-bad option in an awful election, I empathized with Jalen. And if she seemed at all naive about Trump, she wasn't alone. A sort of free-floating wishfulness was the prevailing order of the day, from Donald Trump to his surrogates to his supporters, everyone earnestly believing that their man could win, even without a huge chunk of the party working with them. They were an embattled remnant mistaking themselves for a plurality. Given that so many of Trump's rallies have been marked by violence and protests, I wasn't sure what to expect from an event in my hometown. In nonelection times, people here are less inclined to wear their ideology on their sleeves. You can get through a whole picnic without a political debate. Had Trump's outrageous campaign changed that? I was surprised to find on Thursday that it had not. A toxic demagogue was onstage, and his campaign had entered its violent death throes, and otherwise it was just another Thursday night in Cincinnati. This might have been the crowd at a Reds game. Parents brought their kids; adult children brought their elderly parents. Almost everyone I spoke to focused on a few narrow reasons for backing Trump. Namely, 1) he's not a politician; 2) he'll fix the economy and keep us safe; and 3) he's not Hillary Clinton. And as for those pesky sexual assault allegations that have surfaced in the wake of the infamous Access Hollywood hot-mic recording? The reactions ranged from ""It's not right, but ... "" to ""The timing's pretty convenient, isn't it?"" to ""Horse manure."" ""He's going to be what's best for our country, economically, and that's what we need. We don't need another politician,"" said Connie Farmer of Cincinnati. ""It wasn't right what he said about women, but he's apologized, and it's no worse than what a lot of politicians have said and done in the past."" The past actions of one politician in particular mitigates the accusations against Trump in the eyes of his supporters. ""My biggest concern is that [Clinton] is a liar; she's a lifetime politician,"" said Beth Williams, 44, an administrator at the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science, told me in a phone interview before the rally. ""She backed her husband up with the things he did but stands there high and mighty over words that Donald Trump said years ago. She's a hypocrite."" The crowd that mostly filled U.S. Bank Arena had perhaps fewer performance artists than other rallies. Unlike my colleague Seth Stevenson, I did not see a woman dressed up as Trump leading around a woman dressed as Clinton in shackles. But the attendees fully embraced the label Clinton had given them. ""Adorable Deplorable"" T-shirts were everywhere, and I spotted even a preteen girl wearing an ""I'm a Deplorable"" shirt. And they really, really, really wanted to ""Lock her up."" The chant rang through the arena perhaps a half-dozen times, both before Trump came out and during his speech. The warmup speaker who got the loudest reception from the crowd was Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones, who's garnered attention nationally for his extreme stance on immigration. ""I'm here to serve up some red meat. Am I doing my job?"" Yes, yes, he was. There was an anecdote about writing a letter to the president of Mexico, billing him $1 million for the crime and drugs that illegal immigrants had brought to his county. But, Jones lamented,  ""They told me I wasn't allowed to talk to presidents and leaders of foreign countries."" Then he turned his attention from those who aren't welcome in the United States to those who are no longer welcome in Trump's GOP. ""You're going to see, when this election is over, we're going to remove all the people who are running against Mr. Trump,"" Jones said. ""They are hiding. They aren't here tonight. They are afraid to meet with us, the people who hire them."" That was one of the more surprising sentiments that I heard from Ohioans I talked to. Wanting to get a broader picture of Trump's local support, I reached out to a few people before the rally. ""I'm so disappointed in the Republican Party,"" said Barb Mills, 68, of Loveland, with whom I spoke by phone. ""I loved George Bush. But when he turned on Trump--sure he didn't like what he said about Jeb, but Jeb was never going to get elected. And now Paul Ryan? I went to see him at a rally at Lunken Airport. I served Montgomery Inn barbecue sandwiches to him. I really liked him, but boy, has he been a disappointment. Him and Romney."" At a rally in Florida earlier on Thursday, Trump seemed angry and depressed on the stage, lashed out at the media and the establishment for coordinating against him. He was comparatively better behaved by Thursday evening, perhaps buoyed by an NBC /Wall Street Journal/Marist poll that shows him up by a point in Ohio--not much, but against the downward trend he'd been facing. He offered the usual list of promises--to repeal and replace Obamacare, to stop TPP and ""renegotiate"" NAFTA--and offered some more outlandish ones, like vowing that, ""No more companies are going to leave the state of Ohio."" But a war was on, and the soft stuff wouldn't suffice. In his own mind at least, Trump is waging a three-front battle right now: against his opponent, against the media, and against those in his own party who've abandoned him. On Thursday, he let his surrogates fight the latter battles; he focused his attacks on Clinton. He told the audience that WikiLeaks revealed that Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch were good friends (based on an email in which Huma Abedin told John Podesta they had a ""cordial relationship"") and rehashed Bill Clinton's tarmac visit with Lynch during the Department of Justice's investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails. Republicans considered this evidence of tampering. And so Trump couldn't resist going full Trump for at least a few minutes. In a bizarre combined jab at Clinton's ""stamina"" and apparent desire to send all of our jobs and money to China, he said, ""She doesn't have the strength, she doesn't have the aptitude, she doesn't have what it takes. When she's over in China, if she goes down in Tiananmen Square, they'll just leave her there. They are tough people. They are just going to leave her there. They are not going to help her up."" At the end, there was the ritual playing of the Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want,"" and the traveling press had to be escorted to the media bus by police in riot gear. The media was being menaced by people who believe it and only it was the cause of the candidate's problems. The naivete had been weaponized. I left wondering what Nov. 9 would bring.

And yet for months hardly anyone budged. Trump calls Mexicans rapists? Cool. Trump proposes a ban on all Muslims entering the country? No prob, Don. It took a leaked video of Trump boasting about sexual assault to finally get Republicans to move en masse, and even then not everyone has budged. John McCain may finally be out, but Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, et al? Still in. In all, there are more than 160 Republican politicos actively not supporting Trump. And the New York Times has done a masterful job of compiling those names, as well as when they withdrew their support--or rather, what Trump did to push them away.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/a_proxy_war_over_political_transparency_is_brewing_in_south_dakota.html	"SIOUX FALLS, South Dakota-- Ground zero in the ideological war over money in politics and ethics for lawmakers isn't Washington, D.C., this year. Instead it's the windblown plains of this state of just 858,000 people, where a big-money brawl over a ballot measure has emerged as a sign of the divisive times. Come Nov. 8, South Dakotans will be asked to vote on a measure that would reshape all things political by initiating public financing of campaigns, expanding disclosure of political donors, and creating an ethics commission to police legislators' behavior. Both sides in the debate--the one pushing the initiative and one fighting against it--are planning to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get what they want. But neither side hails from South Dakota. In this corner: a nonpartisan group focused on political transparency out of Massachusetts, Represent.Us, which steered Measure 22 onto the ballot. Its top funders are mostly wealthy individuals who struck it rich with West Coast tech companies. And in the other corner: Americans for Prosperity, a Virginia-based group bankrolled by wealthy industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch and other conservative heavyweights. What's happening here is a twist on that old bromide about all politics being local. When it comes to statewide ballot measures, actually most politics is national. And though this battle of the Plains is certainly entertaining to pundits and political junkies, the denizens of the Mount Rushmore State are not especially amused. ""As South Dakotans we like to think of ourselves as really pretty independent,"" said Sioux Falls pediatrician Jerry Blake, whose wife is a former legislator. ""When there's people that buy votes or people that buy influence that are not even having anything to do with our state, it's just not fair. My vote means less, you know, because of that."" This is not the first time a national group has sponsored a state ballot initiative in South Dakota, which in 1898 became the first state in the union to allow this form of direct democracy. And it's far from the only one this time around. California billionaire Henry T. Nicholas III has brought his crusade for crime victims' rights to the state's November ballot as well. And a Georgia payday lending company is financing support for one measure and opposition for another, both of which concern caps for loan interest rates. At least five of the 10 measures on South Dakota's ballot this year are mostly backed by out-of-state money. ""These are national conversations that are happening so it's not surprising that we're seeing these issues pop up in South Dakota--and also seeing more outside money pop up on behalf of these initiatives,"" said Julia Hellwege, assistant professor of political science at the University of South Dakota. Beyond South Dakota, this year's election alone has numerous examples of out-of-state cash calling the tune: the Humane Society is leading an effort to outlaw close confinement for chickens and other animals in Massachusetts; Everytown for Gun Safety is sponsoring gun control measures in Nevada and Maine; and a drug reform group is pushing for marijuana legalization in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada. But South Dakota can seem uniquely attractive to outsiders. For one, it's an economical place to push a ballot measure. Campaigns often have to pay professionals to gather enough signatures to make the ballot, as Represent.Us did here. The fewer signatures required, the smaller the tab. South Dakota requires relatively few signatures--only 27,741 for a constitutional amendment this year, versus the 98,492 required in Colorado, for example. And TV ads are also relatively inexpensive, though both sides on Measure 22 have stuck to radio and internet messages so far. ""We're cheap,"" said David Owen, president and chief lobbyist for the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""Two million dollars is a ton of money in this state. $1 million is a lot. So in that sense if you want to dabble in public policy and see how your reception's going to be, we're not a high-cost state."" Measure 22 is long--34 pages. ""It's not got much of a plot,"" Owen joked. Among its many provisions, it would create an independent ethics commission with subpoena power to watch over the statehouse, limit gifts from lobbyists to lawmakers, cap the size of political contributions, and require greater disclosure from those who give them. And it would institute a system of public financing for elections: Each registered voter would have access to two $50 ""democracy credits"" to donate to candidates, with no more than $12 million for the entire fund. Supporters say the measure is inspired by a 2012 State Integrity report card from the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity that gave the state an ""F"" overall for a lack of transparency. Some of the provisions come from Represent.Us' model anti-corruption act. Represent.Us is also sponsoring similar anti-corruption measures in Washington state, San Francisco, and five other localities this year. Dan Krassner, political director for Represent.Us, said his group came to South Dakota, a state with more cattle than people, because locals asked for help and the state needed reform. Here the group is allied with a cadre of former lawmakers (Democrats and at least one Republican) who are touring the state to spread its message that South Dakota needs to pass the measure to ward off corruption. ""In South Dakota and Washington, both states have bipartisan local coalitions that wanted to work on anti-corruption measures,"" Krassner said. ""They needed support to get on the ballot. So it was an obvious choice for us to help them out."" Represent.Us hired Minnesotan Richard Carlbom to manage the South Dakota campaign. The political consultant has done everything from winning an election a decade ago at age 23 to become mayor of St. Joseph, Minnesota, to leading the coalition that worked to legalize same-sex marriage in that state in 2013. Though the Washington measure is similar to the one in South Dakota, Americans for Prosperity is not fighting it, national spokesman Levi Russell said, because the group does not have a state chapter there. In South Dakota, it assembled a coalition of 14 local groups to oppose the measure, including South Dakota retailers and the South Dakota Farm Bureau Federation. The group also says it has local roots because of its permanent South Dakota branch, established in 2014. Americans for Prosperity's South Dakota Director Ben Lee moved to the state from Nebraska 23 years ago to attend a small Christian college. He most recently worked in the local office of U.S. Sen. John Thune, a Republican. ""We do think this would be wrong for South Dakota,"" Lee said. ""We've been here long before Measure 22 came around. ... If the folks that were pushing this measure wanted to sit down and have a conversation, we certainly would have been part of having a conversation about what might be best for the state. But that's not what they did. They brought in the out-of-state solution right from the beginning."" The initiative's disclosure provision is a major sticking point for Americans for Prosperity. It requires any group that pays for an ad advocating for a candidate or ballot question to disclose its most recent top donors. That's a key dividing line in the debate over the role of money in American politics. Americans for Prosperity won a federal lawsuit earlier this year after California tried to force the group to disclose its donors. (The state has appealed). Other Koch-backed groups have long argued against such disclosure measures as violations of free speech and free association. Those on the other side, such as Measure 22's supporters, argue voters should know who is trying to influence the political process. Through speeches at clubs and local forums, with mailers and door knocking, both sides are making their case. Last week in the back room of the Royal Fork Buffet restaurant, Americans for Prosperity's Lee attempted to persuade a room full of South Dakotans to vote against the ballot initiative during a meeting of a local Sertoma chapter, an international service group. ""I heard that 75 percent of the money to support this is coming from out of state,"" one man said during the time for questions. ""There are no local organizations supporting it,"" Lee answered. ""Their money comes from a group in Massachusetts."" Lee did not get into the details that his own national organization raises millions from around the country. As Sioux Falls resident Bryan Dahl emerged from the Minnehaha County auditor's office last week where he'd voted ""no"" on Measure 22, he said that out-of-state money for ballot measures bothered him. But he reconsidered when thinking about the crime victims' rights measure, which he favored and which has been adopted in multiple states thanks to billionaire Nicholas' backing. ""If it's out of state and it works, maybe it's a good idea,"" he said. ""We're just a small spot in the country."" But other voters said the out-of-state money was problematic. ""We don't really need money from Massachusetts to run our state government,"" said Norm Dittman, a retired investment banker who was persuaded to vote against the measure by Lee's presentation at the buffet restaurant. ""We embrace the irony that it takes the money to fight corruption,"" said Krassner. ""But there's only gains for the public interest if this passes."" Some Measure 22 supporters say they hope that South Dakota can lead other states to pass similar measures. ""We get it done at the state level and another state and another state and another state and eventually maybe the folks in Washington might start paying a little bit of attention to the folks out here,"" said Rick Weiland, a former Democratic U.S. Senate candidate who supports the measure. He makes no apologies for using out-of-state money to push the campaigns. Represent.Us' top donors this year include a Google engineer, two venture capitalists, and Connie Ballmer, wife of Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer, who each gave at least $100,000, according to the group. ""States can be an incubator for ideas,"" Weiland said. ""These are national issues."" Americans for Prosperity has a warning for voters: Measure 22 will mean their tax dollars will pay for politicians' campaigns, negative ads and all. ""We know that South Dakotans care about how their tax dollars are used,"" Lee said. ""We wanted to focus on that, because it's easy to understand."" He and other opponents think the ""democracy credits"" could be the measure's downfall. ""What they have written is so nonsensical and flawed. It's worse than trying to watch a penguin fly,"" Owen said. ""Look, if this thing passes ... I'm going to have 100 friends that are going to give me their democracy credits, and we're going to have a public rally in the park. And there's going to be a lot of beer."" The public financing proposal has already soured some voters who might have otherwise voted for the measure. Beth Buehler, a retired Sioux Falls resident, came to cast her absentee ballot last week with a small folded paper she called her ""cheat sheet""--containing how she planned to vote after reading through the sample ballot at home. Though she considers herself liberal and had heard the state had ranked high on corruption rankings, she voted against Measure 22. ""It's almost like funding it for them,"" she said. ""They need to do their own work."" Just how bad things are in South Dakota politics is a question that divides state residents--and could be the deciding factor for whether Measure 22 passes. Lourn Lysne doesn't consider state lawmakers corrupt. ""We're too Midwestern,"" the retired electrical lineman said while waiting for his food at an Applebee's in Watertown, about 100 miles north of Sioux Falls. Outside evaluations have given the state poor marks on whether it has the type of laws that prevent corruption. In addition to the Center's State Integrity Investigation, a 2014 study by the University of Hong Kong and Indiana University ranked South Dakota as the eighth-most corrupt state in the union. And the measure's supporters are quick to point to two recent scandals involving state employees misusing federal funds meant to spur investment and improve Native American education. Supporters of Measure 22 blame such scandals on the ruling Republican Party's unwillingness to probe too deeply into the inner workings of state government. But state Rep. Jim Stalzer, a Republican who is running for the state Senate this year, has a much more sanguine view of local politics and is skeptical that the new measure would improve anything. Lobbyists don't dole out lavish gifts to South Dakota lawmakers, he said. Most of the gifts are what he called ""trinkets."" The most expensive thing he remembers receiving is a backpack that can hold a laptop. ""They don't give us enough money to buy us,"" he said. Yet his Democratic colleague Rep. Patrick Kirschman already voted ""yes"" for Measure 22, mostly because he wants the state to have an ethics commission--a fight that Democrats have already tried to win in the Legislature and lost. ""It just needs more oversight,"" he said. ""Nobody's paying attention to all these little pots of money.""

Trump is doing an excellent job all on his own of making that as dim a prospect as can be. It's the deplorables in his midst, energized after eight years of a Kenyan Muslim usurper's presidency, who make me anxious. I met some of them at the Republican National Convention to give them an opportunity to talk Islam with an actual Muslim. I was accused on multiple occasions, of being a front for a secret Muslim invasion. During the second presidential debate, an undecided Muslim voter and mother of two, Gorbah Hamed, asked both candidates how they would handle the growing issue of Islamophobia. Violence against their community is a big concern for Muslim-American voters this election. The root of it all seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of what Islam is and who Muslim Americans are. Trump responded with a wink and a smile to his anti-Islam base. His played into ISIS's Islam-against-America narrative, and pandered to his xenophobic supporters, suggesting that Muslim Americans are in on it when it comes to terrorism. The video above is the response of one of those Muslim Americans--me--to Trump's jihad against Islam.	Donald Trump's Solution to Islamophobia Is to Make Life Worse for Me.	['Trump']	[]

This isn't a normal election. If you chatter about who won or lost on points, you're missing the story. The story in these debates is that the public is getting a chance to see, before it happens, what it would be like to have Donald Trump as president. It would be one of the most dangerous crises in the history of the United States. The first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on Sept. 26, exposed Trump's views on financial and civic responsibility. He advocated tax avoidance, international theft, stiffing vendors and creditors, exploiting the misfortunes of others, and deploying the military as a global protection racket. Viewers got a chance to see that Trump was no ordinary crook. He completely lacks a conscience. The second debate, held on Sunday, exposed Trump's views on human rights, civil rights, and the rule of law. Essentially, he doesn't believe in them. The debate opened with a question about role-modeling. CNN's Anderson Cooper asked Trump about the recently disclosed 2005 video in which Trump bragged about using his star power to grope women. ""You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals,"" said Cooper. ""That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?""

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/donald_trump_tells_hillary_clinton_you_d_be_in_jail.html	"ST. LOUIS--The most important part of Sunday night's presidential debate happened within the first 20 minutes. The rest wasn't uninteresting--at one point, Donald Trump confessed to not paying income taxes, at another broke with his running mate on what to do in Syria--but it wasn't vital. It wasn't, and shouldn't be, the chief takeaway. The honor goes to the first major moment of the debate. That's where, after a lengthy exchange, a menacing and almost unhinged Trump threatened to put Clinton in prison should he win the White House in November. Even in a campaign in which Republican crowds chant ""lock her up"" and Trump surrogates play-act anti-Clinton tribunals, it was extraordinary and disturbing. The behavior of a despot, not of a president. The ramp-up to this was revelatory. Trump was cornered, and he responded with a burst of banana-republic machismo, vowing to investigate and prosecute a political opponent using the powers of his office. It was a remarkable moment: a presidential nominee promising to rip up the foundations of liberal democracy for the sake of getting off a good attack line. It began with the first question. One of the two moderators, CNN's Anderson Cooper, asked Trump to account for the now-infamous tape in which the Republican nominee claims to ""grab"" women ""by the pussy,"" bragging about sexual assault. Trump called it ""locker room talk"" and tried to pivot to ISIS. Cooper stopped him and pressed him on the question, which he tried to avoid. Trump returned to his campaign slogan--""We're going to make America great again""--and Cooper turned the question over to Clinton, who hit one of her themes. ""Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander in chief,"" said Clinton, before rattling off the laundry list of groups that Trump has attacked and insulted over the course of the campaign. He responded--""It's just words, folks. Just words.""--and the moderators brought the debate back to audience questions, including one submitted online. This one also focused on the tape. ""When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man, or did that behavior continue until just recently?"" Again, Trump called this ""locker room talk."" But then he went in a different direction, one presaged by both his Friday night apology video and an unusual pre-debate ""press conference"" involving three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault. ""There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women,"" said Trump of the former president. ""You can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women."" He continued, tying Hillary to her husband's history with women. ""Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously."" Clinton had a chance to respond, and she did, again reciting Trump's attacks on a variety of groups and individuals, from the Khan family--whose son died fighting in Iraq--and Judge Gonzalo Curiel, to President Obama, whom Trump repeatedly attacked as illegitimate on the basis of his birth. It's at this juncture that the Republican nominee--already teetering on the edge of decorum--went off the rails. He accused Clinton of starting the ""birther"" conspiracy; he questioned her friendship with Michelle Obama; he accused Clinton of rigging the Democratic primary to rob Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders of the election; and he slammed her for her emails, all leading to an explosion of contempt and menace. ""If I win,"" said Trump, ""I'm going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there's never been so many lies, so much deception."" He continued: ""[W]e're going to get a special prosecutor because people have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you've done."" And when Clinton gave her response--""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law of our country""--Trump jumped in with a quip. ""Because you'd be in jail."" There's no charitable read here, or at least not one that respects the rules and structure of the English language. Trump's meaning is plain. Should he win the Oval Office, he will use his authority vis-a-vis the Justice Department to launch an investigation of his rival in the presidential election. And because he believes Clinton uniquely perfidious, this investigation would lead to her prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment. As he said, she would be in jail. Historians, commentators, and ""Never Trump"" Republicans quickly grasped the weight of his statement. ""Only time I've ever heard a candidate threatening to jail his opponent was in the Congo. He lost & was later convicted of war crimes,"" tweeted former Mitt Romney campaign manager Stuart Stevens. On television, CBS's Bob Schieffer said Trump's threat reminded him of a ""banana republic."" And University of Virginia historian Nicole Hemmer stressed that this was a ""breathtaking violation of our democratic tradition."" She's right. The United States is not a perfect democracy. But one thing we can say is that, in America, political opponents are just that: political opponents. They aren't hounded and they aren't imprisoned. It isn't a crime to be on the other side of an election. To go down that road is to take a shortcut to despotism and repression. On Sunday, to an audience of tens of millions of Americans, Trump voiced his contempt for the norms that define and safeguard our democracy with a promise to jail his chief political opponent. This, again, was the most important moment of the debate. Nothing else--not Clinton's poor answers for her private speeches, nor Trump's abject ignorance--comes close. And it's all the more important given Trump's larger platform. If elected, the Republican would use the force of the state against nonwhites and religious minorities, from forced deportations of unauthorized Hispanic immigrants to surveillance of Muslim Americans and a return to stop-and-frisk. Trump already promises an authoritarian state for millions of Americans. This statement--planned and strategically deployed--just shows the scope of his vision. In all of this, it's worth noting the complicity of the GOP leadership. An hour after Trump promised to jail his opponent if elected president, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus praised his nominee's performance. ""Hillary Clinton spent the night struggling to defender her failed record,"" he said on Twitter. American democracy needs two healthy parties, at least, to survive and to thrive.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/who_the_hell_is_an_undecided_voter.html	"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina--""I want you to raise your hand if this describes you,"" Peter Hart, the legendary Democratic pollster, instructed a room of 12 undecided North Carolina voters Tuesday night. ""I like both candidates."" Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, he meant. The attendees were sitting around a square table formation in an observation room, where their names were handwritten on folded pieces of pink, yellow, or blue construction paper at their seats. It resembled a private party room at a Chuck E. Cheese's or a bowling alley, except with adults instead of children, paper handouts instead of pizza, and a low hum of existential dread instead of joy and laughter. ""Anybody fall into that category?"" Hart asked. Zero hands went up. ""OK,"" he continued. ""I like one candidate."" No hands. ""I don't like either candidate."" Every hand went up. It was a cheery way to kick off a two-hour focus group, which Hart would later describe to reporters as ""unbelievably negative"" and among the worst he's seen in his 50-odd years of measuring public opinion. The group Hart selected for this research project, conducted on behalf of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, was largely middle class, educated, and Republican-leaning--the kind of voters whom a generic Republican candidate, after eight years of a Democratic presidential administration and in a state that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, would have already secured by now.* Three described themselves as Democrats, six as Republicans, and three as independents; nine listed their ideology as ""moderate,"" while three were ""somewhat conservative."" Five considered their political hero to be Ronald Reagan, while another two--the younger lean-conservatives in the room--pointed to George W. Bush. This would have been a 9-to-3 or 10-to-2 room for Republican presidential nominee John Kasich. Instead it was four reluctant Clinton-leaners; five gun-to-the-head, I-guess-for-the-Supreme Court Trumpers, and three who may well have mental breakdowns when they enter the voting booth on Nov. 8. They will enter the voting booth, though. ""I have to,"" said Gary Nesbitt, a 68-year-old moderate Republican banking consultant and probably the purest undecided of the group. ""Otherwise, I can't complain."" In a healthy election year, late-stage undecideds would be in that position because they're political moderates still weighing the pros and cons of each candidate's policy positions. Such a dynamic seems like a quaint, unrealistic piece of historical fiction now, even if it was basically the dynamic governing elections as recent as Romney versus Barack Obama. With two wildly unpopular candidates this cycle, candidates who by nature of their baked-in unpopularity have run campaigns of personal destruction against their opponent, it's natural that these undecideds would frame the decision as a matter of which contemptible personage they could tolerate for four years. None saw any aspect of the election as anywhere near edifying. Jennifer Meador, a 48-year-old homemaker, described the election as ""embarrassing for our country,"" while Katie Burak, a 30-year-old financial planner, said she's seen nothing but ""personal attacks"" this year. Donna Ryan, a 57-year-old retired finance director, said, ""It's embarrassing all the--pardon my French--it's embarrassing all the bullshit that's going on."" Meador added that she has a 13-year-old son and doesn't know how to talk to him about this election: ""It's hard to explain why adults are acting this way."" The dominant theme of the election, as Nesbitt put it, was ""vote for me because I'm less of a sleazeball."" With policy considerations seemingly at such a remove from the national discussion, they saw the election as part of a broader cultural malaise. Terry Ragsdale, a 62-year-old IT worker, saw the country as still unable to grapple with the negative events that began with 9/11. ""Osama did what he sought to do""--sending the country into disarray--""and we've never quite recovered."" Several, including Burak, 35-year-old welding technician Jon Johnson, and 47-year old banking analyst Sabrina Tucker, were deeply worried about Facebook, Twitter, and other social media tearing apart the social and political fabric of the republic. When Hart asked whether the next generation would be better off than the previous, no hands went up. Though the group had no love for Trump beyond the more conservative members' hope that he could preserve their Supreme Court advantage, they spoke of the ""old days"" through a similarly rosy prism. They missed the ""innocence"" of a time when negative news didn't dominate public life. The clearest analogue to a Trumplike statement came from Ryan, who described her brother's experience in Catholic schools of the ""old days,"" when nuns would slap his hands for acting out of order. ""I'm not defending corporal punishment,"" she prefaced, ""but there's something to be said for getting your hand slapped."" Ryan was leaning toward voting for Clinton. She wasn't happy about it. A moderate, Ryan had wanted to find an excuse to vote for Trump. ""I so much wanted Trump. I so much wanted a nonpolitician. But I don't trust him, and I've become afraid of him,"" she said. ""I just don't think he knows when to shut up. If he could just [say], 'I'm a businessman, I'm not a politician, I'm gonna make American great again,' and stop right there, then I would vote for him."" During Trump's postconvention meltdown, though, she would watch as he ""just went on and on, and his face [would get] all red."" The face reminded her of a ""little boy,"" like her five brothers growing up. ""I remember that face. And that's when I got scared. And so I started to listen to Clinton. I don't love Clinton--I don't trust her. But I think she's the lesser of two evils."" The imagery of the red-faced little boy dominated one ""lightning round"" section of the group, when members were asked to fill in the blank on the question of ""[Candidate]'s behavior reminds me of ______."" For Trump, the answers included several ""school boys,"" a ""spoiled brat,"" ""child having a tantrum,"" ""rich kid,"" and ""George Brett with the pine tar."" But the descriptors for Clinton weren't any better: ""robotic,"" multiple ""liar""s and one ""liar liar pants on fire,"" ""maleficent,"" ""privileged,"" ""too poised,"" ""polished politician,"" and ""cool operator."" When Hart asked what they thought motivated her, ""power"" and ""ambition"" were the dominant responses. For the Clinton-leaners and the pure undecideds who couldn't see themselves voting for Trump, the choice came down to competence. ""She knows what she's doing,"" Ragsdale said, ""so I'm going to have to lean that way."" The Trump-leaners held onto the Supreme Court as their best excuse. The last question Hart asked after more than two hours of questions was who everyone thought would win the election. It was unanimous for Clinton. Hart was a good-humored host. He cracked jokes in the room to ease the tension. When one panelist suggested that the polls may be off, he mocked offense, saying, ""I beg your pardon."" (Hart co-conducts the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll.) He kept a running banter with a select few participants. Some levity was necessary in that room. Afterward, though, he admitted that he too was struck by the salty, surly, despairing negativity in the room. He saw Ryan and a couple of other undecideds, who with any other GOP standard-bearer would be with the Republican and against Clinton, as the election in a nutshell. Even if Trump-leaners may have narrowly outnumbered Clinton-leaners on the panel, that wasn't a bad result for a Republican-leaning sample. Ryan ""never came to Hillary; she was forced to Hillary,"" Hart said, and voters like her are the reason Clinton is likely to both win the election and suffer from an extremely difficult presidency. ""She's got the votes,"" he added, ""she's just not going to have the support."" I was struck by Hart's cynical take on how Clinton herself would have viewed a focus group like this, where not one participant could admit to liking her but where several said they would reluctantly vote for her. Hart believed Clinton would have seen this as a ""success"": She had achieved the goal of making her opponent look worse than her to enough people in order to win the election. Clinton's the type of person who can take a task that's right in front of her, he said, and execute it, but the broader vision either isn't there or is never clearly relayed to the public. ""If the job was to get elected president, she did it,"" he said, ""or she's going to do it."" And after that, what? Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign.

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/rudy_giuliani_vs_donald_trump_who_would_you_vote_for.html	"Donald Trump is the most-disliked presidential candidate since polling firms started tracking Americans' distaste for major-party contenders. While Hillary Clinton is the second-most-loathed candidate of modern times, she's still no competition for the Republican nominee. Is there anyone on this or any other planet who's sufficiently disliked to lose to Trump in a one-on-one election? In the runup to Nov. 8, we'll attempt to answer that question by presenting a series of hypothetical presidential matchups. While Slate readers voted for Dick Cheney in his matchup with Trump, will they show the same ardor for former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani? Read the arguments in favor of both candidates below, then vote in the poll at the bottom of the story. Vote for Giuliani: Look, I found the manic Mussolini schtick Giuliani pulled at the Republican National Convention as unnerving as the next guy. His attempt to resurrect his political career by glomming onto Donald Trump's historically corrosive candidacy has been nothing short of disgraceful. But one of these men is a race-baiting, adulterous, megalomaniacal reality TV star who allegedly sexually assaults women, lacks even a bare trace of public policy knowledge, and is actively undermining the norms of American democracy. The other is a race-baiting, adulterous, megalomaniacal former mayor who competently ran the most important city in the country for eight years before steering it through a national tragedy. Given that choice, I'll take the race-baiting, adulterous, megalomaniac who hates ferrets. Giuliani was a mixed bag even at his best, and he's always been a disaster on race issues. Before he got elected to City Hall thanks largely to white voters, he helped whip up a police riot against the New York City's first black mayor. His NYPD gave us Abner Louima and Amadou Diallo. I shudder to think what horrors would emanate from the Giuliani White House in the era of Black Lives Matter, which he's called ""inherently racist."" But Giuliani could on occasion be smart, pragmatic, and even reassuring. The cliche is that he proved New York could be governed after years of (literally) riotous disorder. There's a lot of truth to that, even if the city's astonishing drop in crime wasn't totally (or even mostly) his doing. He was the sort of Republican mayor who, faced with a massive budget gap upon entering office, worked with the city's unions to find savings without laying anybody off. He backed a Democrat, Mario Cuomo, for governor. And for all the self-mythologizing B.S. that came after, he was good and steady on Sept. 11, which counts for something. Can you begin to imagine what it would have been like having Donald Effing Trump as mayor that day? Can you, Henry? The man has since curdled into a caricature of his darkest impulses--on civil liberties and national security, he comes off a bit like Dick Cheney with a lisp. But when he's not talking about how swell it'd be to put electronic tags on Muslims, he still sometimes shows flashes of decency. He seems to have been a voice of sanity in Trump's circle on immigration, for instance. Just as the faint embers of fatherly love turned Darth Vader back toward the light, perhaps there's just enough of the old moderate city pol left in Rudy to make him a less disastrous president than Donald Trump is guaranteed to be.--Jordan Weissmann Vote for Trump: Obi Wan-Kenobi asks: ""Who's the more foolish: the fool, or the fool who defends him on the Sunday shows?"" That's easy: The greater fool in this case is and always will be Rudy Giuliani, that humorless engineer shoveling coal on the Trump train. My colleague Mr. Weissmann is not wrong when he describes America's saffron ape-clown as a unique threat to the polity. I won't defend Trump. He is indefensible. And yet there is one man who will excuse his behavior when no one else will, one vile ghoul who rationalizes all of Trump's improvised idiocy and inherent nastiness, often with more fervor and more desperate circumlocutions than the candidate himself. Supporting Donald Trump in the manner Giuliani has supported him is more damning than even being Donald Trump. Trump and Giuliani share all the same reprehensible views. (Like the belief that black Americans and women don't know what's best for them. Trump as president would be ""better for the United States than a woman,"" Giuliani said.) But there is something disarming about Trump's relentless bumbling, his total lack of calculus, the way he gritted his teeth and tore up his notes after the debate, his goofy grin as Hillary roasted him at the Al Smith dinner. Trump lies constantly, but he doesn't lie strategically--he seems incapable of any long-term thinking at all. In the rigid context of Washington politics, that makes him a less frightening figure than his conniving surrogate. Consider the brownshirt ex-mayor, 15 years out of work, waving the frog flag in Trump's parade. Watch his scowling death's head as Hillary mocks him. This is a man who would chew through his own leg for power. That dog whistle that Trump wears around his neck? Giuliani built that. He's the link between the open hatred of Trump's campaign and the more calculating, corporate-friendly oppression and war-mongering of the mainstream Republican Party. As president, he would give us the worst of both worlds. (And if I even need to say it anymore: He was a carny mayor and would never have been posing with a bullhorn on the streets of Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11 if he had not opted, against expert advice, to place the city's emergency command center on the 23rd floor of the World Trade Center.)--Henry Grabar Previously in Who Would You Vote For?

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/donald_trump_and_the_paranoid_style_in_american_fascism.html	"Donald Trump is mentally ill. After 16 months of campaigning and three general election debates, this has become all too clear. Trump sees himself as the victim of a web of conspiracies encompassing House Speaker Paul Ryan, the FBI, the CIA, and the Iraqi military. He sees events in his life--women who claim to have met him, violence by supporters at his rallies--as tentacles of these plots. He refuses to accept the outcome of the election, and he demands that his opponent be jailed, not because Trump is cynical but because he is paranoid. In Wednesday's debate, as in previous encounters with Hillary Clinton, Trump kept his composure for the first 25 minutes. But he couldn't hide his self-preoccupation. The first question was about the Supreme Court. Trump answered it by complaining that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had made ""inappropriate statements towards me."" Later, Trump did what he has done at campaign rallies: recast bad news for others as good for himself. ""The end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report,"" he said. ""I should win easily, it was so bad."" Half an hour into the debate, Clinton challenged Trump to condemn Russia's attempt to influence the election through cyberespionage. Trump responded with his usual pro-Russian arguments: that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is too strong to play ""chicken"" with, that we should try to get along with Putin, and that we should soften our commitments to NATO countries. But Trump also rejected the verdict of U.S. intelligence agencies: Clinton: We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyber-attacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. ... Trump: She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else. Clinton: ... Do you doubt 17 military and civilian agencies? Trump: And our country has no idea. The moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, affirmed Clinton's assessment: ""The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks."" But Trump wouldn't budge. He refused to trust American intelligence officials, even--or particularly--in a dispute with Putin. Twenty minutes later, Wallace turned to Trump's treatment of women. ""Nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent,"" Wallace observed. ""Why would so many different women, from so many different circumstances over so many different years ... why would they all make up these stories?"" Trump responded with a demonstrably bogus denial: ""I didn't know any of these--I didn't see these women."" He accused Clinton of orchestrating their allegations: ""I believe it was her campaign that did it. ... She got these people to step forward. ... [It] is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign."" In the same answer, Trump blamed Clinton for violence at Trump's campaign rallies. He cited a recording in which a Democratic operative had discussed how to provoke Trump supporters by wearing anti-Trump or pro-Planned Parenthood T-shirts. Trump took no responsibility for having encouraged assaults at his rallies. ""She talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence,"" he said of Clinton. Trump tried to change the subject to Clinton's emails. But then he had to explain why FBI Director James Comey, a longtime Republican, had decided after investigating the emails that Clinton shouldn't be prosecuted. ""What the FBI did"" was ""a disgrace,"" said Trump. In rallies over the past week, Trump has all but indicted the bureau, claiming that Clinton and her henchmen have ""corrupted the director of the FBI,"" that ""this is a conspiracy against you, the American people,"" and that a special prosecutor must be appointed to ""investigate the investigation."" With half an hour left on the clock, Trump lost it. Wallace asked him: ""You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you. ... Do you [pledge] that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?"" Trump refused to say yes. ""I will look at it at the time,"" he said. For one thing, Trump argued, there are ""millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote."" That might be a valid reason to challenge the election results, if there were evidence of significant voter fraud, which there isn't. But Trump gave two more reasons why he might not accept the election's outcome. First, said Trump, ""the media is so dishonest and so corrupt ... and they've poisoned the mind of the voters."" Second, he complained:"	The Third Debate Settles It: Trump Isn't Just Cynical. He's Paranoid.	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

After the first presidential debate, the Republican Party nominee called for monitoring and intimidation at polling places in cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland. During the second, Trump announced his plan to investigate Clinton using the power of the presidency, and promised to put her in jail for unnamed crimes against the state. He later turned that into a bona fide campaign slogan: ""Lock her up."" For the last week, he's decried the entire election process as ""rigged""--a shadowy conspiracy meant to deny him a victory at the ballot box. And at the final presidential debate at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, Donald Trump refused to commit to conceding the election, should he lose on Nov. 8. ""I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time,"" said Trump after moderator Chris Wallace asked if he would honor the election results. Wallace pressed the question a second time."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/twitter_commentary_about_the_final_presidential_debate.html	Simply put, Donald Trump needs to win Wednesday's debate against Hillary Clinton clearly and decisively if he is to maintain even the puniest shred of hope of winning the election. He's down by an average of about 7 points in national polling. He's losing in most polls of swing states--and slipping in polls of traditionally red states like Arizona, Alaska, and Utah. Not that a strong showing at the debate will guarantee Trump a victory: Third debates, historically, have had a low impact on polling. Trump may not even want to win at this point. He seems more interested, lately, in justifying his increasingly likely defeat. In recent weeks, he has repeatedly warned his supporters that the election is going to be stolen from them, drawing a harsh rebuke from the president and measured disagreement from Republican leaders, his running mate, and his campaign manager. If Trump really thinks he can't win, we might be in for one unhinged performance. What the hell does he have to lose? Pundits and politicos will be watching closely.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/down_ballot_democrats_just_want_to_talk_about_trump.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Sen. Marco Rubio dropped the oppo near the end of Monday's Florida Senate debate with Rep. Patrick Murphy, the Democratic opponent he can't fully shake off. All night Murphy had been trying to tie Rubio to Donald Trump. Over and over he would come back to the same line: that he couldn't believe, could not believe, that Rubio would continue to support a man who had bragged about groping women. This time, Rubio shot back: ""You're the one that posted a picture four years ago on Facebook of you groping a woman."" He was referring to this photo, where the youthful Murphy's cupped hand is positioned conspicuously near a woman's breast. ""That's inappropriate behavior."" The Murphy campaign would say after the debate that it was a photo of Murphy with his then-girlfriend. But at the time Rubio mentioned it, Murphy seemed to have been wrong-footed. He awkwardly changed the subject. ""Let's just talk about Donald Trump again,"" he said. It was inartful, but ""Let's just talk about Donald Trump again"" neatly summarizes the strategy of the Democratic candidates in each of the four Senate debates--Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, and Ohio--I had the misfortune of watching recently. The Democrats in each had their moments, but the self-limiting strategy didn't move the needle against their well-prepared opponents. The debates were a reminder, at least in the cases of Pennsylvania, Florida, and Ohio, of the strength of Republicans' 2010 recruits and why polls in these states show far more split-ticket voting than historical trends suggest should exist. Even if the Democratic candidates were inconsistent and couldn't produce any devastating moments--as New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan did in her debate against Sen. Kelly Ayotte--I'm not sure they'd consider the debates ""losses."" As with Tim Kaine's performance against Mike Pence in the vice presidential debate, the Democratic candidates seemed content to get edged out in round after round so long as they were able at some point to reference Donald Trump. This is the blessing and the curse of running against Trump in a down-ballot race: He's a walking catastrophe who pulls your Republican rival into striking distance; he also narrows your vocal range and condemns you to unimaginative, cookie-cutter, one-note campaign strategies. Katie McGinty had some painful moments in her debate against Sen. Pat Toomey, the incumbent with whom she's locked in a dead heat, perhaps because she was focused so squarely on cornering him on Trump. You can't really blame her. Pat Toomey is in quite the corner with Trump, and his strategy for the final weeks of the campaign seems to be to stay in the corner, take his beatings, and hope to survive. Pennsylvania is a lean-blue state whose interior Republicans--working class, small town--are very much Trump Republicans. Toomey negotiates this by not negotiating it: He still hasn't taken a position on Trump. In the debate's opening segment, after repeated prodding from the moderators and McGinty, Toomey wouldn't budge, saying it was a difficult choice for him and he might make up his mind later. It was a fine segment for McGinty. But after those 10 minutes passed, she had 50 more minutes to fill. She had a difficult time disproving attacks on her record in public office and a real foot-in-mouth moment during a discussion about police endorsements. When Toomey said that he had picked up every major police union or association endorsement in the state, McGinty responded that she had police endorsements, too. He asked her to name one she had received. She couldn't. She also couldn't explain specifically how she wanted to fix the Affordable Care Act beyond working to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Trump and Rep. Joe Heck poll similarly in Nevada, and the state's a toss-up in their respective presidential and Senate races. Heck risked base disenchantment by cutting ties with Trump following the release of the Access Hollywood tape--just days before his one and only debate with Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto, who was preparing to eat his face off over that support. Cortez Masto ate his face off over his prior support for Trump anyway in the debate held on Friday. Following President Obama's playbook, she asked Heck how he could have supported Trump up to that point. ""It is astonishing to me that for eight months, nine months, [Heck] was Donald Trump's biggest supporter, when Donald Trump was attacking POWs, attacking Gold Star families,"" she said early in the debate. ""When Donald Trump was making fun of the disabled, attacking Mexicans, calling them rapists and criminals, and calling women names and denigrating women--which we know why he was, because he thinks he can sexually assault women--Congressman Heck had high hopes Donald Trump would be president."" Once that segment was out of the way, Heck--whether one agrees with his policy preferences or not--was just more fluent on federal issues. This was a gap Heck exploited well during a later section of the debate when the candidates were allowed to pose questions to each other. ""What, if anything, should the United States do to combat China's territorial assertion in the South China Sea especially in light of the recent Hague decision?"" Heck asked. Cortez Masto had no answer to this question, beyond pointing out that we needed a steady, non-Trump commander in chief to ""hold China accountable."" Fair enough. It still would have been nice to hear a United States Senate candidate explain her thoughts on the territorial dispute in the South China Sea. And yet I have little doubt that redirecting a question about existing foreign policy disputes with China into an answer about how Donald Trump is bad is the high-percentage play. That's what made these debates, and makes these campaigns, so drab and flavorless. For Democrats running in competitive races for federal office, redirecting any question into a criticism of Donald Trump is probably the high-percentage play. It's absolutely embarrassing for the Republican Party that Donald Trump is its presidential nominee. He's the reason Democrats are slight favorites to take back the Senate; he's the reason they have even the slightest chance to take back the House. Everyone knows him, knows he's a Republican, and knows he's terrible. There's more political hay to be made in Democrats pointing and gawking at him than in straightforwardly addressing any given question at hand. That's where Democrats are trapped in these races: adhering to the same, safe strategy of saying Trump's name a million times, which keeps them close to their rivals but suffocates the strategies elsewhere that might reveal them as inspiring candidates in their own right, running their own races. Unless the Republican candidates really do have unalloyed support for Trump, too, there's a ceiling to what running against Trump earns Democrats. In Monday's Ohio debate, poor, wholly uncompetitive Ted Strickland's every other answer was about Donald Trump, and Sen. Rob Portman got into the habit of responding that Ted Strickland's running against him, not Donald Trump. It's a stock line ... but he's not wrong. Pat Toomey, Rob Portman, Joe Heck, and Marco Rubio aren't lying when they say they're distinct entities from Donald Trump. They've chastised him when necessary and stray from plenty of his policies. Democrats are trying to force these Republicans down to Trump's polling levels, and these Republicans are holding their own. Democrats' next move is: Let's just talk about Donald Trump again. And again. And again. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Blessing and Curse of Running Against Trump in a Down-Ballot Race	['Portman', 'Trump', 'Toomey', 'Pence', 'Rubio', 'Hassan']	[]
21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/why_obama_is_focusing_his_post_presidency_on_state_politics.html	"Barack Obama is a relatively popular politician, itself quite an accomplishment in the Age of No National Politicians Being Popular. Once he retires from the Oval Office and the public firing line, history will begin to buff his halo, the way it has with other recent ex-presidents. Like him or not, he has been an iconic figure in American history since the day he won the 2008 election. He still has a long life ahead of him. One would expect him to spend his post-presidency on something commensurate with this lofty status. Ending global hunger? World peace? The elimination of death? The death of sadness? Eh, he can get to all that jazz eventually. But first: How about working on some state legislature campaigns? The Democratic Party, ""in close consultation with the White House,"" has launched a new political group ""which will coordinate campaign strategy, direct fundraising, organize ballot initiatives and put together legal challenges to state redistricting maps,"" Politico reported Monday. Former Attorney General Eric Holder will chair the new group, named the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. And Obama himself, as Politico writes, has ""identified the group ... as the main focus of his political activity once he leaves office."" The group will focus on the ""gubernatorial, state legislative and House races"" in 2018 and 2020 that will determine the design of the next congressional redistricting maps. Why would Obama concern himself with such seemingly small-fry politics? One reason could be tradition: Ex-presidents like to give their successors room to breathe, so hieing off to state-level battles is one way for Obama to remain active without meddling in the day-to-day grind of national politics. The other, more important reason is that control of state legislatures is in no way small-fry politics. By throwing his name behind the effort, Obama is trying to fix the colossal infrastructural damage his party sustained under his tenure: the Republican state-level domination--and thus congressional domination--achieved first in the midterms of 2010 and iced in 2014. What happened in the 2010 ""Tea Party wave"" election, anyway? President Obama has a go-to explanation. ""We just didn't pay a lot of attention to politics that first year,"" he told New York magazine in a recent interview, ""and the [2010 Senate special election] loss in Massachusetts reminded me of what any good president and any good elected official needs to understand: You've got to pay attention to public opinion, and you have to be able to communicate those ideas."" The explanation is a self-flattering one: We were just so busy implementing perfect policies that we forgot to communicate them properly. One doubts that a more cleverly crafted party message--nipping and tucking an adjective here or there in public speeches--would have overridden the factors that led to Democrats' catastrophic 2010 losses. The flat economy, the party-line stretch to pass the Affordable Care Act, the gravitational pull that was bound to drag Democrats down to Earth after their big successes in the 2006 and 2008 congressional elections. It was the election that finally saw conservative whites switch jerseys in states with long Democratic state-level traditions, while governorships and chambers across the Rust Belt states fell into Republican hands and haven't been recovered since. The 2010 elections may have tethered the Republican Party to a base-centric strategy that's made it agonizingly difficult for them to retake the White House. But the damage it did to the prospects of the Democratic Party at the sub-presidential level is no less rotten. It was a census year, i.e. the best cycle for a party to have a ""wave"" election. The pickups in governorships and state legislative chambers allowed Republicans to redraw favorable maps for themselves. In 2014, the second Republican-wave election of Obama's tenure, the Democrats' hole only got deeper. The GOP won 52 percent of the votes cast for the House that year but won 57 percent of the seats. Democrats might make gains across the board in 2016 with a Clinton victory--or, more aptly, a Trump loss--but they'll be fragile. They would once again head into midterms with the presidency, and the contemporary Democratic presidential coalition just doesn't turn out reliably in those midterms. It will be a difficult environment for Democrats to pick up the statehouses and governorships they'll need, whether to draw their own favorable maps or at least to block unified Republican governments from keeping the crayons and drawing whatever they want. Democrats can't expect the 2020 presidential cycle to serve as much more of a counterweight. Hillary Clinton, who probably won't have awe-inspiring approval ratings, will be vying for a fourth consecutive Democratic term, probably against someone who isn't such a thick cut of Westphalian ham. If it's at all doable, turning around the party's state-level health will require Democrats to avert their focus solely from the bright, shiny object of presidential races. It means getting voters from the Obama coalition to recognize that state-level races aren't afterthoughts, and that losing the ""farm team"" races means dooming your preferred causes for decades at a time. Even though he won't be in office anymore, Barack Obama will be the most famous politician in the country for the foreseeable future. For both the preservation of his legacy and his party's future, he should be the one who grabs his coalition by the shoulders and points it toward the statehouse races. He can't change all of the structural factors that have contributed to down-ballot Democratic suffering. But at least he can communicate the ideas. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

While Hillary Clinton is the second-most-loathed candidate of modern times, she's still no competition for the Republican nominee. Is there anyone on this or any other planet who's sufficiently disliked to lose to Trump in a one-on-one election? In the runup to Nov. 8, we'll attempt to answer that question by presenting a series of hypothetical presidential matchups. First up: Dick Cheney vs. Donald Trump. Read the arguments in favor of both candidates below, then vote in the poll at the bottom of the story. Vote for Cheney: Ugh! The only thing that matters is that Dick Cheney is an adult politician who has experience managing the federal government. He understands how the government and all of its branches work. We could get cute here and litigate who would be better or worse on any particular issue. But those are secondary questions. The only reasonable way to frame this debate is, which one of these two men is qualified and capable to serve as president? Cheney is. Trump isn't. Just for kicks, let's get into those secondary questions. The biggest concern with Cheney is that he would get us into another war within hours of taking office. That's not great! Despite his unearned reputation for dovishness, Trump seems more likely than Cheney to nuke some country because it looked at him funny. Beyond foreign policy, the only other policy issue that Cheney really cares about is deregulating energy, so he and Trump are in the same ship there. Neither Cheney nor Trump cares about spending, so there wouldn't be some major push to gut the welfare state in either president's regime. Speaking of getting too cute: The argument that a competent authoritarian (Cheney) would somehow be scarier than an incompetent authoritarian (Trump) is stupid. You want a competent person in charge of something as critical as the United States government, duh. --Jim Newell Vote for Trump: The question here is not whether it would be a good thing to give Donald Trump unlimited despotic powers. It would not. The question is, given our system of checks and balances, which of these people would do more damage as president? Dick Cheney is the answer. First, the current GOP nominee has been a failure at everything he's tried other than being a clownish showman. There's no reason to think he will become hyper-competent as president of a divided Washington, where the courts and a likely Democratic filibuster in the Senate--not to mention a contentious relationship with important members of the House--would prevent him from enacting his unconstitutional and impractical agenda. Cheney, meanwhile, has shown himself to be an effective bureaucrat. The former vice president would get more bad stuff done. Second, Cheney is a hyper-partisan, hyper-conservative politician who is determined to score points for his team at all costs. Trump's positions, meanwhile, have changed with the wind, and he has shown little interest in actual governing. Trump will get bored on Day 1. Cheney will govern with ferocity for four years. Finally, and most importantly, the next president will exert enormous influence over foreign policy. Despite his ugly rhetoric about Muslims, Trump is at heart a fairly typical isolationist. Cheney is America's arch-interventionist. He has said ""I was right"" about the Iraq war, has repeatedly suggested we need a large troop presence to fight ISIS, and has long advocated military action against Iran. With a President Cheney, American aggression in the Middle East would reach new heights, with consequences much more disastrous than the already extremely disastrous invasion of Iraq. That is the scariest thing either man would be able to accomplish as president, and only one of them has the capacity and the desire to pull it off. --Jeremy Stahl"	Dick Cheney vs. Donald Trump: Who Would You Vote For?

That maxim, known as Godwin's law, has deterred most journalists from comparing today's politicians to Adolf Hitler. But sometimes, what brings the Nazi analogy closer isn't the length of the discussion. It's the behavior of the politician. That's what is now happening in the case of Donald Trump. In Godwin's honor, let's stipulate: There will never be another psychopath quite like Hitler. The German dictator preached such overt hatred, murdered so many people, and earned such infamy that every demagogue since, from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to David Duke, has learned to draw at least tactical distinctions between himself and the Fuhrer. Then there's Trump. He's a salesman, not a fanatic. He doesn't foist his hatreds on others. Instead, he reads and plays to the resentments of his crowds. He tells them that President Obama was born in Kenya, that Ted Cruz is a Canadian-born Cuban, and that Ben Carson is a Seventh-day Adventist. Trump will go after a Mexican American judge, a Muslim Gold Star family--whatever he thinks will work. Jews aren't on Trump's target list. His son-in-law and grandkids are Jewish. His daughter, Ivanka, is a Jewish convert. But Trump's habit of retweeting alt-right material--Hillary Clinton with a Star of David, for instance--has immersed him in the muck of anti-Semitism. And in the past few days, Trump has turned to an ideology of global conspiracy that resembles the speeches of a certain politician from a century ago. For Trump, the principal enemy is Muslims. He blames Muslim Americans collectively for domestic terrorism--falsely claiming, for instance, that many of them saw but didn't report the preparations for last year's attack in San Bernardino, California--and says we should never have let their parents into the country. For Hitler, the interlopers were Jews. Speaking in Munich on July 28, 1922, he lamented that they had been given German citizenship. Jews ""have always formed and will form a state within the state,"" said Hitler. That's uncomfortably close to Trump's warnings about Sharia in the United States. Why did Hitler target Jews? In part it was his personal pathology. In part it was the spirit of the times. But in part it was because Hitler focused on a different kind of crime. Trump campaigns against violent crime. He blames it on immigrants, both legal and illegal. Hitler talked more about financial and cultural crime. In his July 1922 address, the German demagogue criticized the rise of ""share-capital' over ""the nation's labor-strength."" Through this process, Hitler charged, ""the stock exchange came to control the whole national economy."" He called for an uprising against foreign financial interests: ""We shall possess once again a true German Reich of freedom and of honor, a real Fatherland of the whole German people and not an asylum for alien swindlers."" Hitler returned to these themes in many speeches, complaining that Germany had become a ""puppet of alien forces"" (September 1923) and that ""the state is not a plantation where the interests of foreign capital are supreme"" (April 1923). In April 1922, Hitler explained where his analysis pointed:"	Let's Just Say It: Trump Sounds More and More Like Hitler	['Carson', 'Cruz', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/how_the_trump_clinton_race_turned_into_a_national_referendum_on_sexual_assault.html	"It feels like an eternity since the first presidential debate, at Hofstra University, where Donald Trump unraveled in real time before an audience of 85 million Americans, consumed in a knot of anger, rage, and incoherence. It's only been 18 days. In less than three weeks, we've seen several years' worth of political controversies, and the result is something we haven't experienced since Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign or George McGovern's in 1972: the breakdown and collapse of a presidential campaign. In short order, Trump has gone from a close race with Hillary Clinton--a virtual tie, with narrow margins in most of the major swing states--to a free fall, with near double-digit deficits in national polling and open infighting within the Republican Party. And in those 18 days, Trump has also managed to instigate a national referendum on misogyny and sexual assault, one first sparked by his televised humiliation at the hands of Hillary Clinton. It started with Alicia Machado, the one-time winner of the Trump-owned Miss Universe beauty pageant whose story Clinton highlighted in the Hofstra debate. After Machado's 1996 win, Trump took it on himself to scold her for gaining weight. ""This is somebody who likes to eat,"" he said, after inviting journalists to watch the then-19-year-old Machado exercise in a gym. A competent campaign would recognize this was a fight best avoided and try to move it to more favorable terrain. Instead, Trump reopened the controversy. ""She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,"" said Trump the morning after the debate, attacking Machado in a phone interview with the hosts of Fox and Friends. This back and forth--culminating in Trump's false claim that Machado had a ""sex tape""--lasted five days before the GOP nominee's campaign faced another crisis, this one over the revelation that he'd possibly gone two decades without paying federal income taxes. The New York Times story--which centered on an almost $1 billion business loss that Trump seems to have turned into regular deductions--was devastating, a glimpse into a world where the wealthy escape the costs and obligations shared by the majority of American workers. How did Team Trump respond? With an attack on Clinton's gender. ""Don't you think a man who has this kind of economic genius is a lot better for the United States than a woman, and the only thing she's ever produced is a lot of work for the FBI checking out her emails,"" said former New York mayor and top Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani. That lasted just a day, eventually consumed by the vice presidential debate and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence's remarkable performance, where he denied a year's worth of offensive statements from his running mate. That strategy ""won"" Pence the debate but came at the cost of renewed focus on Trump's prejudiced and offensive rhetoric. Still, Pence had energized Republicans wary of Trump's erratic behavior and worried about his crashing poll numbers. But just as the GOP recommitted itself to Trump, another storm hit, this one in the form of a 2005 tape from the show Access Hollywood in which he is seen and heard bragging about sexual assault. ""You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful--I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait,"" he said, while speaking to Billy Bush. ""And when you're a star, they let you do it. ... You can do anything."" The tape split the Republican Party in two, creating a schism between hard-line Trump supporters and a new group of opponents, including lawmakers in the House and Senate who withdrew their endorsements. And more than any previous outrage, the tape led to the event that transformed the last days of the election into a national conversation about predatory sexual behavior. That event was the second presidential debate, held at Washington University in St. Louis, wherein Trump denied any history of sexual assault or unwanted touching. ""You described kissing women without their consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault,"" said CNN's Anderson Cooper, who moderated the debate alongside ABC's Martha Raddatz. ""You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?"" ""No, I didn't say that at all,"" Trump replied. ""I don't think you understood what was said. This was locker-room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologized to my family, I apologized to the American people."" The exchange continued. ""Just for the record, though,"" asked Cooper, ""are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago, that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?"" ""I have great respect for women,"" Trump responded. ""Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Frankly, you hear these things--they're said."" Cooper pressed on. ""Have you ever done those things?"" Trump finally answered the question: ""No, I have not,"" he said. But this wasn't true. On Wednesday, following three days in which Trump worked to wield Bill Clinton's infidelities and misconduct against his wife, Americans were inundated with stories that exposed Trump's history of sexual assault and offensive behavior. Among the women who accused Trump: a business executive who said Trump groped her on a flight more than three decades ago. (""He was like an octopus,"" she said. ""His hands were everywhere."") A woman who, as a young receptionist in 2005, was kissed on the mouth by Trump in an unwanted advance. Several Miss USA contestants who accused Trump of groping them or entering their dressing rooms while they were unclothed. A journalist who, in a first-person account, wrote that he cornered her during a 2005 interview, ""pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat."" Trump has called these allegations ""false smears,"" a ""horror show of lies, deceptions, and malicious attacks"" from a secretive cabal of elites bent on destroying the United States. And his surrogates have followed suit, challenging the credibility of the accusers and explaining away Trump's behavior. ""The New York Times goes back over 30 years to find somebody who had a bad airplane flight,"" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. This, in turn, has brought ferocious pushback, not just from Clinton but from ordinary women who've voiced their experiences with unwanted touching and sexual assault. On Thursday, first lady Michelle Obama spoke out against Trump's comments in a remarkable and deeply personal speech to Clinton supporters in New Hampshire. ""I have to tell you that I can't stop thinking about this,"" she said. ""It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted."" She continued, describing her reaction to hearing Trump's conversation with Billy Bush:"	How a Close Election Turned Into a National Referendum on Misogyny and Sexual assault	['Pence', 'Cooper', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/how_are_these_two_missouri_democrats_surviving_in_trumpish_missouri.html	"COLUMBIA, Missouri--Jason Kander served in Afghanistan. He mentions this. Often. Not just when he's talking about foreign or military policy. Even when he's talking about, say, legislative and campaign ethics reform, which he also talks about a lot. He was talking about both things last week in a press conference on the University of Missouri campus. ""As you know,"" the 35-year-old Senate candidate was saying, ""I did anti-corruption investigations as a military intelligence officer in Afghanistan."" This was Friday, last Friday, and in a few hours the events of the day would move very heavily on Donald Trump's campaign for president. But here in a small room on the second floor of the university's student union, where Kander was flanked by three state legislators focused on improving Missouri's near-negligible state government ethics laws, the election was unfolding very differently. ""And then,"" Kander went on, ""I came home, and I got elected to the state legislature and I found, unfortunately, there was plenty of anti-corruption work to do there."" Ethics reform is a common focus of ambitious young politicos in a hurry. It allows them to float over the partisan fray without weighing themselves down with any political baggage. Barack Obama, to name the most prominent hit in the genre, attached himself to ethics-reform initiatives as both a state and United States senator. It's also not a coincidence that Kander, Missouri's secretary of state, is playing up his good-government, taking-on-the-establishment credentials when his opponent, incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, has been in Washington for decades, owns a million-dollar-plus home there, and has several lobbyists in his immediate family. Blunt is not a bad senator. Like a lot of ""Washington insiders,"" he can be quite effective in delivering the goods for his state and in closing deals while his more self-righteous colleagues, such as Sen. Ted Cruz, promote themselves for the cameras. But the ""insider"" label still makes Blunt quite vulnerable this cycle, and Democrats are moving in for the kill. What makes Kander vulnerable, aside from his nonincumbency, is that D next to his name. Crafting a post-partisan message on issues like ethics reform is more of a necessity for Kander in Missouri than it was for Obama in Illinois. That's because running as a partisan is a certain way for a Democrat to lose a statewide campaign here. Kander knows it. His fellow Democrat running for governor, Chris Koster, knows it, too. And as a result, both have had to run races that bear little resemblance to the kinds of races Democrats run nowadays. Missouri isn't the swing state that it used to be. In all but one election between 1904 to 2004, the winner of Missouri's electoral votes was also the winner of the presidential election. The state, famously, was the national bellwether. This ended in 2008. Barack Obama lost the state by 3,632 total votes, or one-tenth of a percentage point, in an election he won nationally by 7 percentage points. It was the state watched by Obama staffers, already well into their celebratory champagne, as a post-victory side amusement. The domino never fell. By 2012, the state was wholly uncompetitive: Obama lost it by 258,644 votes, or 9.38 percentage points. That was far more than his national drop-off in support between 2008 and 2012. Missouri, on the presidential level, is a red state--and a red state of the Trumpish variety. Between 2010 and 2015, its population grew a modest 1.6 percent with little net in-migration. Like Ohio, another state that's leaning redder on the presidential level this year, its racial demographics are mostly stagnant, and the share of the elderly population (65 and older) increased from about 14 to 16 percent in the five-year window. Donald Trump could lose Missouri, but only in the event of a (possible!) Clinton landslide. So it comes as some surprise, then, that Democrats in the state's two other marquee races, for Senate and for governor, are not just holding their own, but in a decent position to win. In the former, Blunt has held a narrow lead over Kander throughout. But reporting suggests Kander is leading in some internal polling, and forecaster Larry Sabato this week moved the race to ""toss-up"" status. And in the governor's race, Koster, the state's 52-year-old attorney general, has long maintained a comfortable advantage over his opponent, the peculiar Eric Greitens. Missouri politicos expect that race to tighten as Republicans--still torn following a divisive gubernatorial primary--come home in the final weeks of the campaign. However these races finish, the Republican candidates will almost certainly finish behind Trump's percentage in the state, the opposite of the trend we're seeing in close races in Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Florida, and Arizona. The two Missouri Democrats aren't the most elegant exponents of the party's ideas, but their success in this cycle might offer their colleagues a model for how to expand in the reddening parts of the country. * * * The two Democrats share few outward similarities. Koster is more of a Missouri political veteran. He's a self-described ""conservative Democrat"" who in 2007, left the Republican Party, for whom he served as a high-ranking state senator. A pro-gun, pro-death penalty fiscal conservative who's never going to light up progressive circles, Koster is nevertheless a fierce ally of organized labor and opponent of the overwhelmingly Republican state legislature's efforts to make Missouri a so-called ""right-to-work"" state. Kander, meanwhile, is one of the top long-term Democratic prospects in the country, a post-partisan who focuses less on Democratic issues than on loftier goals, like fundamentally changing Washington. (As with early Obama, members of the Democratic Washington establishment speak in superlatives of this young man who seeks to disrupt them.) He is widely credited, too, with producing the single most effective ad of the cycle in a state where being perceived as ""anti-gun"" is effectively a nonstarter. Few expected him to have a shot at Blunt's seat. After a lengthy career in the House and a tenure as its Republican whip, Blunt was supposed to assume his rightful place in the Senate in 2010 and hold his spot there comfortably for the rest of his life. In his seven congressional races and one other Senate race, the closest general-election victory he's ever posted was a 14-point rout. But Blunt, a Chamber of Commerce Republican, found himself at distinct odds with the flavor of his party and its new squeeze, Donald Trump. By the end of 2015, Kander's ability to stay in striking distance of Blunt earned him National Journal's label of ""trendy upset pick of 2016."" ""A person's financial background, or their connection to lobbyists, doesn't qualify anybody to represent anybody else,"" Kander continued at the press conference, taking care not to mention anyone's name in particular. ""It is a person's record of service, it is their character, it is their values and their commitment to the best interests of others that make them fit to hold office."" Among Kander's ethics proposals for Washington: extending the two-year ban on members from serving as lobbyists to a permanent ban. Apparently Kander doesn't just want to put Blunt out of political office; he wants to preclude him from then joining what the campaign is calling Blunt's ""family business."" Kander also said that a top priority of his would be overturning Citizens United. When he finished his statement, I asked him what his preferred vehicle for doing so was: confirming a fifth Supreme Court justice against it, pushing for a Constitutional amendment? Something else? ""We need to do it as fast as possible,"" he responded, not answering the question. The cameras were still rolling. ""Our democracy is hurting everyday that Citizens United is in place."" So then ... no preference? ""Whatever gets this done fastest,"" he said. I'm sure he could have answered the question if he'd wanted to. But why bog down the message with the sort of Beltway-insider jargon that a Beltway insider like Beltway-insider Roy Blunt might use? Should he win, one need not strain to see the ways in which he'll disappoint what Robert Gibbs famously called ""the professional left."" He supports a self-destructive balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution and opposes the Iran nuclear deal. He leans hawkish, but triangulates neatly between foreign-policy caricatures so as not to sound like an out-and-out Republican: ""When I look at one side saying that ISIS is at the doorstep in suburban America, and the other side saying that it's not really something to be that concerned about, the truth is that it's something to be very concerned about."" I asked him which senator he looks to as a model for how he would serve. He didn't name any, but did say that he hoped he could work with fellow Iraq and Afghanistan veterans Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst, and would-be Sen. Tammy Duckworth on fighting ISIS. The idea of one of their own working with Tom Cotton on combatting ISIS is a thought that will terrify many Democrats. But that's a conversation for the future. The first step is getting him to Washington, and he has a far better shot of doing so than many envisioned a year ago. A few more revelations about Donald Trump of the ""grab them by the pussy"" variety may be enough to put Kander over the top. * * * State-level politics work a little differently. Last Saturday morning, while the national political media focused exclusively on Donald Trump's comments, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster gathered volunteers from local unions to canvass south St. Louis. Dozens of working men and women clad in yellow shirts gathered at the Operating Engineers Local 148 hall to hear from local labor leaders, UFCW International President Marc Perrone, and ultimately from Koster himself for a pep rally ahead of a day of door knocking. A wood-paneled folding table was set up with donuts and pastries, along with coffee and nondairy creamer for Styrofoam cups. A vendor at the next table was selling political buttons for $3 apiece. ""I would tell you that [Koster] is honest, has integrity, and he certainly has a radio voice,"" Perrone said, to laughs, ""and a TV face."" Koster supported labor ""viciously and ferociously against the onslaught of right-to-work."" He then introduced Koster as the ""person who's gonna take care of hard-working men and women in Missouri."" Chris Koster is a complicated story. He's a former Republican state legislator who in 2007, flipped parties over Republicans' interest in banning stem-cell research and a general sense that his colleagues had gone off the deep end. At least that's how his campaign tells it. The more cynical interpretation is that there was less of a queue for nomination to statewide office in the Democratic Party. Maybe it's a bit of both. But becoming a Democrat in red-trending Missouri would be a risky move for someone consumed purely by opportunism. So far, he's made it work, serving two terms as attorney general and now holding the edge over his Republican gubernatorial opponent, first-time candidate and former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens. ""There's a woman, standing back by that refrigerator, a St. Louis County police officer,"" Koster said as he began, pointing out the cop doing security by the back entrance of the hall. ""Poke your head out, young lady. She and I said hi when I came and I tried not to get choked up."" A St. Louis County police officer had been shot two days earlier. Koster is a conservative Democrat, a term he self-applies. So maybe he's pro-choice and an advocate for stem-cell research, but he's also pro-gun enough to earn the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. He's fiscally conservative, and forthrightly conservative on agriculture issues. As attorney general, he joined other states in suing the federal government over both the EPA's proposed ""Waters of the United States"" and power plant emissions rules. He won the Missouri Farm Bureau PAC's endorsement, the first Democrat running for statewide office ever to earn that endorsement. But he also has labor's back, and it's a priority of his to finally get Missouri to accept the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion--something outgoing Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon was unable to get through the Republican legislature during his second term. Koster's opponent doesn't have a neat political history of his own, and has drawn his own accusations of opportunism. Prior to this race Greitens had no history as a candidate for public office, though he did turn down a recruitment effort to run for the House in 2010--as a Democrat. ""I am a conservative Republican, but I didn't start out that way,"" reads the opening sentence of his July 2015 Fox News opinion column, ""Why I Am No Longer a Democrat."" Two months later, he would throw his hat into the Republican gubernatorial primary, a dirty, expensive race between four candidates that Greitens won with a modest 34.6 percent of the vote. (Like Jason Kander, Greitens ran a gun-trick ad that went viral. Unlike Jason Kander, Greitens blew shit up in his ad.) The story of a Republican political novice winning the nomination with a modest plurality in a nasty primary that left lots of bitter feelings and prevented party unification heading into November may sound ... familiar. But the Koster campaign expects the race to tighten to a razor-thin margin by the end. What Koster has that national Democrats don't is a cachet with the white working-class voters who've drifted away from the party at-large over the past several decades. That Koster will need a lot of split-ticket, Trump-Koster voters this November, though, won't stop him from calling out Trump's bogus appeals to working people. Near the end of his pep talk to union volunteers, Koster said that when Donald Trump tells one of his favorite stories--about Carrier's decision to close its Indiana plant and move to Mexico--he tells only half the tale. He tells the part about Carrier wanting to pay neither a union wage, nor half a union wage, nor even the federal minimum wage; they just wanted to leave the country. ""That's where Donald Trump stops the story,"" Koster said. ""Folks: Indiana is a right-to-work state. This was never supposed to happen. Because the leaders of that business community, who had these lower wages and lower working securities in their heart, had already gone to the people of Indiana long ago and said: 'Give us your collective bargaining rights ... you will be secure.' That even after they had taken everything from working folks in Indiana that they wanted--their pension, their collective bargaining, their security--the folks who had made these promises still picked everything up and left to go to Mexico."" These are strange words to hear from a fiscal conservative, but Missouri is a strange place now. No longer a bellwether, it is tilting Republican by virtue of not really changing at all. But the Democrats recruited candidates who are well-tailored to the state's needs. Kander, who served in Afghanistan, fits the profile of a charismatic, natural talent running against an insider at odds with the distinct outsider leading his party. Koster's done time in both parties and knows how to speak to voters in each. It's a reminder of that cliche that's reasserting itself this cycle: Candidates matter. The ascendance of political science and data journalism in political coverage in recent years, and the belief that fundamentals like underlying economic conditions largely determine outcomes, haven't so much been undermined this year as they've been tempered. Donald Trump potentially losing the presidential race by 10 points in an environment slightly more favorable to Republicans is the most glaring example of this. It turns out this stuff isn't just a matter of showing up. Of course, allowing for Missouri's weird electoral imperatives, both men also deploy a few carefully chosen apostasies--a balanced-budget amendment? fiscal conservatism from a fierce defender of collective-bargaining rights?--as a way of distancing themselves from the national Democratic Party. The near-total wipeout of conservative Democrats, aka ""blue dogs,"" from leadership during the Obama years has led some Democrats to give up hope on reclaiming those redder districts. A lot of progressives, frankly, were happy to see them go. But a party that cedes dozens of governor's seats, most state legislatures, and any chamber of Congress is a party that's not really living up to its raison d'etre. Democrats managed to elect a conservative governor in Louisiana, and the result was a Medicaid expansion that benefited hundreds of thousands of people. They're worth it. Blue dogs aren't extinct; they're just barking differently now. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	How Are These Two Down-Ballot Democrats Surviving in Trump-Friendly Missouri?

The diversion of Afghan resources and Western aid for private gain would, the public and private reports all said, drain vitally needed funds from the country's reconstruction and alienate its citizenry. That would in turn fuel renewed public support for the West's enemy--the Taliban, whose social brutality notoriously included draconian punishments for official corruption. But the U.S. officials in charge of rebuilding the country largely failed to heed these alarms, according to their own assessments. ""The ultimate point of failure for our efforts,"" said Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador from 2011 to 2012, in a newly released interview with a team of official auditors, is Afghanistan's corruption. Washington has paid a steep price for its mistakes--it has invested more than $800 billion in Afghanistan, including about $100 billion in direct payments, and lost more than 2,300 American lives over the past 15 years. (The anniversary of the U.S. invasion was last Friday.) At least a tenth of the country's population is under the Taliban's control now, with another 25 percent now being contested, and these numbers have lately been rising, not falling. Nearly 40 percent of the population subsists on less than $1.35 a day. In fact, Washington has so little to show for its efforts that a group of 10 former U.S. ambassadors and military commanders in Afghanistan declared in a joint statement last month, published by the National Interest magazine on Sept. 14, that stabilizing the country and ending its continued incubation of terrorism will require at least another generation of U.S. effort. Meanwhile, the U.S. costs alone are now running at roughly $1 billion a year for reconstruction, plus another $4 billion a year in direct payments meant to continue to prop up Afghanistan's persistently weak (and partly imaginary) security forces. Efforts to uncover all that what went wrong may yet take a while. (The Pentagon Papers analyzing American mistakes in Vietnam were leaked to the public two years after they were completed in 1969 and 21 years after America undertook its disastrous military meddling there.) But the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded in a 2014 report that military and civilian leaders alike grievously underestimated the gravity and impact of Afghanistan's corruption. More ""Lessons Learned"" analyses are now emerging from within the government, and the most recent one points some sharp fingers of blame at the Obama administration--including the State Department while Hillary Clinton was at the helm, and at the CIA, during the entire period of the Bush and Obama administrations. While trying to stabilize the country, these two organizations undertook two actions that made its problems worse, the latest study says: The CIA partnered over a long period with politically connected warlords that engaged in ""rampantly corrupt activities,"" largely out of political expediency; meanwhile, U.S. aid organizations helped stoke the country's historic corruption by pouring in more funds than the country could responsibly absorb, all the while measuring their achievements by how much, rather than how well, money was spent. With short military deployment stints and high turnover in civilian oversight roles, no one in Washington or in Afghanistan took effective responsibility for fixing these problems. These are the unvarnished critiques in a Lessons Learned report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko, who has been studying the Afghan effort for four years and whose team interviewed 80 participants and solicited comments from five of the key agencies or departments in charge. ""We must recognize the danger,"" Sopko said at the Carnegie Endowment's Washington offices while presenting the report on Sept. 14, ""of dealing with characters or networks of unsavory repute, tolerating contracting abuses, accepting shoddy performance, and delivering unsustainable projects."" But we didn't, his study shows, and so the desultory results of the U.S. intervention shouldn't have been a surprise. Afghanistan was at the bottom of annual corruption rankings by the World Bank at the outset of the U.S-led occupation and, beginning in 2005, near the bottom of an annual corruption list published by Transparency International. A cable sent to Washington by the U.S. embassy, entitled ""Confronting Afghanistan's Corruption Crisis"" and newly declassified for Sopko's study, warned that corruption was ""the hallmark of daily life"" in Afghanistan and ""a major threat to its future."" Conquering it, the cable said, ""is fundamental to the success of U.S. policy."" The U.S. Agency for International Development, or AID, which dispensed most of Washington's nation-building funds, also remarked in an internal strategic plan that year that government institutions at all levels are ""tainted by high levels of corruption."" An internal Pentagon review in 2006 bluntly warned that ""enormous popular discontent is building against corrupt and ineffective governance."" That was the year that then-President Hamid Karzai appointed as the head of his chief anticorruption agency a man who had been convicted in the United States on drug charges, Sopko's report points out. It was also when Karzai notably accepted the appointments of 14 senior police officials ""who have links to criminal networks,"" according to a secret memo (since declassified) written by a senior adviser to the secretary of Defense. A study by an Afghan integrity group in 2007 warned that ""a strong and interwoven spider web of illicit networks"" controlled power at all levels. Two years later, at the outset of the Obama administration, the U.S. embassy in Kabul warned in another cable, also recently declassified, that official corruption--including Afghan officials' protection for the narcotics trafficking that produced around a half of the country's gross domestic product--was ""as likely as is the insurgency to undo our efforts in Afghanistan."" British diplomats were no less aware of the risks: Their chief foreign aid agency warned in a 2009 report that corruption was then ""a major reason for supporting the Taliban."" In 2010, at a meeting with U.S. diplomats, Afghanistan's national security adviser acknowledged that ""corruption ... is the system of governance."" Washington's response during the first seven years after the invasion, according to Sopko's report, was to prioritize its counterterrorism and development aims, not fully understanding how dependent these ambitions were on thwarting the impulse and ability of Afghan officials to steal their public resources. The creation in 2008 of a special U.S. military intelligence unit devoted to the topic produced shock in Washington at ""how bad this situation was and who was involved in it,"" according to Kirk Meyer, the unit's leader from 2008 to 2011. Polling data during Karzai's tenure bore out how poorly illicit funds transfers outside the country were being controlled. A comprehensive annual survey in Afghanistan by the Asia Foundation found that the number of respondents who experienced corruption at the customs office rose from roughly 40 percent in 2006 to 61 percent in 2015--even though U.S. diplomats, in a rosy 2013 cable, hailed Afghan reforms there. The average value of a bribe increased by a fifth from 2010 to 2014, and the number of respondents who said they experienced corruption in the court system rose from 42 percent to 61 percent. The public's sense of corruption within the national police--a major recipient of Western funds--remained largely unchanged through the occupation. (Half of the respondents experienced it.) Even after Washington finally grasped the centrality of the corruption problem in 2009 and President Obama publicly called for a crackdown on such behavior, top officials essentially blinked: A comprehensive anticorruption strategy drawn up by the embassy in Kabul and sent to Washington in 2010 never won Secretary Clinton's (or anyone else's official) endorsement. When a key advocate--Richard Holbrooke, a top adviser to Clinton and veteran diplomat who had seen the debilitating effects of corruption up close during a previous assignment in the Balkans--died in December 2010, no one else seized the plan and compelled its formal approval. At another key moment the following year, Washington blinked again. That's when the International Monetary Fund was negotiating a new $133 million 3-year loan to Kabul, and various foreign donors--including the Obama administration--initially withheld their funds to force Karzai to implement financial reforms and aggressively reclaim nearly a billion dollars that politically connected Afghans had looted from the national bank. (The scale of this theft there was comparable, Sopko's report notes, to the looting of a trillion dollars from the U.S. economy.) After some back-and-forth with the donors produced Afghan promises to crack down, Washington and its allies eventually agreed to endorse the loan. Clinton, speaking to a donors conference in Bonn, Germany, that December, said while hailing the resumption of U.S. and allied aid that economic reforms Karzai ""has outlined are promising."" But Sopko's reading of the moment--a time of high leverage for the West--was different: ""The Afghan government suffered no major consequences ... for its failure to hold accountable and recover significant assets from the politically connected individuals who had defrauded the Afghan people."" Washington could have demanded measurable progress but did not, he said. At that moment, or at other periods during the long occupation, ""State, in consultation with other agencies, might have pursued revocation of visas against corrupt Afghan officials and their families and more robust law enforcement actions against corrupt Afghans with dual U.S. citizenship."" An international group that included Treasury Department officials concluded in November of that year that those finally indicted by the Afghan government in 2012 for the bank's looting did not include ""officials from accounting firms that created false documents for Kabul Bank, airline employees that smuggled money out of Afghanistan, or shareholders who received funds from loans at zero-interest, apparently without the intention of repayment,"" many of them politically-connected. The final decision about who to indict, the group's report said, ""was made at the political level."" Asked for comment on these events, including Clinton's failure to approve the embassy's anticorruption plan, presidential campaign spokesman Jesse Lehrich said that Clinton had helped ensure ""that U.S. resources in Afghanistan were responsibly utilized ... [and] made it clear each step of the way that the US was not offering a blank check."" Lehrich said that as a result of her efforts, civilian and military contracts, purchasing operations, and vetting procedures were all improved. But Gen. John Allen, the former commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2013, memorably told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2014 that ""for too long, we focused our attention solely on the Taliban. They are an annoyance compared to the scope and the magnitude of corruption."" Moreover, diplomats and experts from key donor countries who gathered in April at the U.S. Institute of Peace to discuss what went wrong during the West's intervention noted that the Afghans early on figured out how to play one country against another whenever they were pressed to institute anticorruption reforms. ""Conditionality,"" meaning the threatened withholding of grants to compel action, was ""undermined by the presence of multiple donors that could provide alternative sources of aid,"" the conferees concluded. There was also an added wrinkle in the West's policymaking challenges: Throughout this period, key Afghan officials--including those in Karzai's office--were on the CIA's payroll, according to multiple media reports and Karzai's own admissions. ""There has been a consistent pattern by the CIA ... to focus its energy on targeting [terrorists] and therefore to be at the head of colluding and collaborating with corrupt and abusive officials,"" said Sarah Chayes, a former reporter who lived in Kandahar from 2002 to 2009 and became an adviser on Afghanistan to several U.S. military commanders there, plus the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""I experienced it on the ground in Kandahar [where I often saw] CIA station chiefs getting in the way of corruption investigations that were underway."" She said Washington needs ""to take a good look at how the agency performs its functions."" Many Afghans wanted Western powers to do more to stem local corruption, she said. ""People detested it ... [and] our complicity was driving people into the arms of the Taliban. So, while working with the military, ""we built a very detailed campaignwide anticorruption program."" But she said it had to be abandoned ""once it became obvious there was not political will in Washington."" Asked for comment, CIA spokeswoman Heather F. Horniak said that ""while we will not comment on any specific claims, our goal is always to improve the capabilities and professionalism of foreign allies. We have taken significant steps to help Afghan partners address areas of concern."" Recent trends in the country are not good. The Taliban has recently taken control of some additional Afghan districts and made gains in Helmand and four other provinces, many of them past battlegrounds for U.S. forces. Civilian deaths are presently running around 3,000 a year, with nonlethal casualties more than twice that number. The Congressional Research Service, in a Sept. 26 report, said the government's leadership arrangement is ""troubled, by many accounts."" The National Interest experts' group, which included all the key U.S. military commanders in the country from 2009 to 2014, rated only two to four of the country's six army corps commanders as effective--after the expenditure of roughly $40 billion from the U.S. treasury on the Afghan Army so far. (Another $28 billion went to other security forces, including the perennially ineffective police.) Only a little more than a third of the population there is optimistic about the future, while two-thirds say the security situation is poor. Officials in the National Interest group, which was pulled together by Michael O'Hanlon at the Brookings Institution, are nonetheless having a hard time giving up. They urged a ""quiet and more patient approach"" and warned that ""predatory corruption in particular needs to be targeted."" They said Washington needs to apply serious pressure on neighboring Pakistan, where key Taliban leaders and soldiers have long had a refuge--an idea that key Obama administration officials have repeatedly opposed. They also wistfully noted that in 2013, the U.S. military ""developed an option"" for dispatching 5,000 more foreign troops to the country and blamed the plan's rejection in both capitals for some of the ""deterioration in the Afghan security environment"" going on now. Sopko's report notes, however, that even though Karzai has left office and his replacement, Ashraf Ghani, in 2014vowed a genuine crackdown on corruption, its achievement is now ""a generational goal""--an estimate that mirrors the length of time that former U.S. diplomats and generals say is needed for Western success there. He notes that no significant recovery of National Bank assets has occurred under Ghani, and the country's judiciary remains under substantial political pressure. Transparency International, in a September report, similarly said Afghanistan still lacks a ""comprehensive legal framework for preventing, detecting, and prosecuting corruption,"" which it noted remains rife in public institutions. The country's anticorruption agencies, the group said, have had ""little evidence of success in fulfilling their mandates."" Last week, Western officials at a donors conference in Brussels agreed to pledge another $15 billion in aid to the country over the next four years, on top of the more than $125 billion in aid that it's received from all donors since the September 2001 attacks on the United States were hatched on Afghan soil. A joint communique by the donors noted that corruption ""remains a major obstacle to development and stability"" but welcomed ""the steps taken so far."" ""They find themselves stuck, unable to extricate themselves, because of guilt, pressure, and the fear of what a collapsed Afghanistan would mean for their own security,"" said Heather Barr, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, who decried the donors' failure to hold Afghan officials accountable for their many promises of reform. Whether U.S. lawmakers will have appetite for spending a major share of this won't be clear until after the November elections.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/donald_trump_s_supporters_are_standing_by_their_man.html	"WILKES-BARRE, Pennsylvania--After a dismal weekend marked by leaked audio about vagina grabbing, a deluge of defections from Republican officials, a snorting and incoherent debate performance, and some deflating poll numbers, Donald Trump went to Pennsylvania as planned for a rally in Wilkes-Barre on Monday night. So I followed him, thinking I might find his core supporters feeling weak in the knees. Instead I discovered an arena full of deplorables--unbowed, undiscouraged, standing by their ogre of a candidate. Very little had changed since the last time I visited a Trump rally, back in the primaries. Outside the venue, a woman dressed as Trump led a woman dressed as Hillary around by a metal chain attached to a neck shackle. Inside, a man wore a T-shirt that read, ""She's a cunt. Vote for Trump."" The crowd began to chant ""CNN sucks!"" all on its own, before anyone had even prompted it to. A solemn recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance bled into ""USA! USA!,"" which morphed into that old standby: ""Lock her up! Lock her up!"" Scanning the mob of several thousand as best I could, I counted fewer than 10 nonwhite people. (I'd seen nearly as many nonwhite folks at the gas station a few blocks away when I filled up my tank.) Every speaker up on stage was white. Chris Cox, the 48-year-old founder of Bikers for Trump, began his remarks by crowing, ""You might remember us from Cleveland, at the RNC, where we stood toe to toe against Black Lives Matter."" He later added a pun that delighted the gathering: ""At least we're not a basket of deportables."" When Cox rejoined the crowd, I asked him how he felt about the elected Republicans who'd distanced themselves from Trump in the past day or two. ""They will be weeded out,"" he said. ""When Donald Trump is elected, they'll be the first to go. The people are taking over the Republican Party."" Up in the stands, a 65-year-old woman in full Trump gear who'd driven two hours from central New Jersey told me that GOPers who disavowed Donald were ""not true Republicans."" Even Paul Ryan? ""I don't care for him,"" said the woman. ""He's a conservative Democrat. Trump is a real Republican, born and bred."" But Trump used to be an actual Democrat, I pointed out. ""Just for a short time,"" the woman insisted. I asked her if the leaked footage of Trump yukking it up about genital assault had given her pause. ""What he said is really vulgar,"" she began, before telling me that she'd been crassly propositioned by multiple men at her workplace over the years. ""I was demoted three times for saying no,"" she said. And then, in a flurry of words that made little sense to me, she transformed her experiences with sexual harassment into a pro-Trump argument, concluding, very confusingly (and inaccurately): ""That soap actress, she said no and he accepted it."" Pennsylvania state Rep. Tarah Toohil was on hand, holding the book Clinton Cash in her hand and recommending it to all who'd listen. She told me she'd been holding back from endorsing Trump for a while but had finally decided she needed to do it. When, I asked? Sunday, after the Billy Bush brouhaha. ""You're like a reverse commuter,"" I said. ""A lot of other elected Republicans went the other way this weekend."" ""They're just doing it to be popular, to get elected"" she replied. ""I felt morally compelled."" Did Trump's comments not give her pause? ""I'm a woman in a world where men are in power,"" the 37-year-old Toohil said. ""I've heard trash talk. It's unacceptable, but he made a sincere apology. I don't think he did those things. He was just an arrogant man boasting about women. You hear that stuff from the entertainment industry, and back then he was an entertainment guy."" When Trump at last took the stage, it was as though his wretched weekend had never happened. He didn't mention the Access Hollywood disaster at all. Instead, he played his old hits: ""The Snake."" We're gonna build that wall. Look at those dishonest reporters, they're so dishonest, I have to tell you, such disgusting people. He read out poll numbers he liked (ones from idiotic online insta-polls) and said the ones he didn't like must be ""crooked"" and ""rigged"" (ones from legit, scientific polls). There were, however, a few new wrinkles since last I'd boarded the Trump train. Lately, Trump's been urging his supporters to be freelance election observers in ""certain communities""--even soliciting them to sign up for such duty on his website. He made further leering insinuations along these lines. ""I hear such reports about Philadelphia,"" he said. ""I hear these horror shows, and we have to make sure we're protected. We have to make sure this election isn't stolen from us and isn't taken from us. And everyone knows what I'm talking about."" Trump also reprised a version of his debate breakout moment, when he threatened to toss Hillary in jail. It was back in July, at a rally in Colorado, that Trump first went from dismissing the ""lock her up"" chants to indulging them: ""I've been saying let's just beat her on Nov. 8. But you know what, I'm starting to agree with you,"" he said then. By Monday night in Pennsylvania, the concordance was complete. ""Lock her up is right,"" he barked when the chants began, to the rabid glee of the crowd. There was even a new nickname. Longtime Hillary confidante Sidney Blumenthal has become ""Sleazy Sid."" Not bad! Not even wrong! But the target of the epithet is telling. This is no ""Low-Energy Jeb"" or ""Lyin' Ted."" The average voter has no clue, and doesn't care, who Blumenthal is. It's Trump's dead-enders--the ones still trudging out to rallies to cheer on a confirmed cretin and then trudging home to wallow in the latest on Breitbart--who thrill to this stuff in their shrinking bubble, in their hate-filled arenas, in the grimy dusk of a dying campaign."

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/keith_olbermann_and_our_vogue_for_eviscerations_and_epic_rants.html	"An evisceration is a very specific and very simple procedure: the removal of the viscera. With whatever weapon you might have, you cut someone open across the belly, laboriously pull out all the guts in their wormy coils, red and steaming, and dump them on the ground. Death is inevitable, but excruciatingly slow, unless you choose to speed it up. Human intestines are about 25 feet long, end to end, so it's possible to get quite inventive here. In one account of the punishment, from the Icelandic Njals Saga, one end of the victim's gut is nailed to a tree, and he is then forced at spearpoint to walk around it in slow agonizing circles until his entire intestine is wound around its trunk. Many versions, like the hanging, drawing, and quartering on the books in English law until 1870, also include castration, decapitation, and the removal of the heart--to eviscerate someone is to not just kill them but to utterly destroy them, to show that this was never a human being, not even a body, only some stinking flesh with ideas above its station. No wonder it was most often used for the crime of treason: What it represents first of all is the impotence of bodies before the awesome power of the state. Evisceration is a horrific punishment, which is why it was phased out over the course of the 19th century. But like so many horrors of that age--debtor's prisons, wars of plunder, long and stultifying literary novels--it's back. A couple of headlines, just from the past few weeks: ""Watch Elizabeth Warren Eviscerate 'Gutless' Wells Fargo CEO,"" ""Trevor Noah Eviscerates Matt Lauer's Presidential Forum Performance,"" ""Soledad O'Brien Eviscerates CNN,"" ""This Celebrity-Packed Political Ad Eviscerates Donald Trump."" The only other arena that sees nearly as much evisceration is sports, but it's not even close: Politics has become incredibly dangerous. There must be some kind of brutal revolt in progress, an insurrection in which nobody is so secure and powerful that he might not find his guts suddenly sliding out of a gashed-open belly; the halls of government are blood-flecked and stink of human garum, and politicians wade to work through the dug-out viscera of their fallen colleagues. An incredible massacre, surely. So where are all the bodies? Every week brings news of gruesome tortures, but the next day the victims are still there, guts still wobbling happily inside their skin, and still pumping out the same old shit. Wells Fargo is still printing money; CNN is still seeping blather; Donald Trump might still stomp his way to a big, beautiful nuclear arsenal. Nothing is tamer, nothing is more toothless, more flaccid, more uselessly limp and passive and sterile than the click-mediated evisceration. In a recent column, the New York Times' Ross Douthat writes that various liberal monologists have built a new political consensus, ""an echo chamber from which the imagination struggles to escape""--which probably says far more about the powers of Ross Douthat's imagination than it does about the state of the discourse. Political invective is weak, far weaker now than it's ever been. Look at the gleeful pornographic slanders of ancient Rome or revolutionary France, Marx tearing into Louis-Napoleon, or Malcolm X declaiming the sins of white America, and try to find even an echo of that caustic fury in a talk-show host raising his eyebrows. It's not just that these things are ineffective (after all, what have you or I ever actually done to stop the banking system? What could we do?), they're not even polemical. Instead of exposing the evils of the world, our ranters have resigned themselves to laughing at stupid people. Real polemic surges up from below; these people look down and sneer. The left--and these eviscerations are always almost from something that, at the very least, calls itself the left--has lost something important. It still likes to see itself as an agent of merciless justice, cutting through the stomachs of its enemies, but it's had a bad turn; it can no longer stand the sight of blood. Some of this has to do with the limitations of the form. It isn't entirely the fault of the eviscerators themselves, your Jon Stewarts, John Olivers, Samantha Bees, the whole snide phalanx of late-night takemongers; they're only doing what they can, being as entertaining as possible with the airtime and the politics they have. They're not the ones who started talking about evisceration. That word is a function of the 21st century's legitimized content piracy: TV shows are snipped into little click-worthy segments to be redeployed across the internet and to ramp up engagement on social media. Everyone does it--august press titans as much as shameless media thieves such as the Huffington Post and Slate or the hundreds of algorithmically edited clickbait plankton nets. They need a headline that'll draw as much interest as possible, and a term as lurid as evisceration is the obvious choice. But as soon as it's used, it becomes a lie: evisceration is slow, the steady dismantling of a human body; it was a spectator sport, but one you could while away a whole day watching. There's no such thing as a snappy five-minute evisceration. But in a media economy where everything is always a distraction from something else, there's no point taking risks on sustained nastiness. And when a company's survival depends on every post being shared as much as possible, real polemic--the kind that doesn't make you feel secure in your prejudices but shocks and grates and summons forth the sort of bilious hatred that starts revolutions--is only going to limit your brand engagement potential. But this is only half the story. To see why these interventions are invariably so weak, it helps to look at them in their most concentrated form, and the most concentrated form is The Closer, with Keith Olbermann. The Closer is a web series put out by GQ in which the liberal rant is stripped down to its barest essentials: There's no need to slice it apart into fungible snippets; each episode is already only five or so minutes long, a context-less, free-floating slice of sound and anguish. It's also the most embarrassing thing humanity has ever produced. Keith Olbermann sits behind a bare desk and in front of what appear to be two giant paint swatches, a cheap square-faced film prophet wearing a three-piece suit and a dense cloud of invisible but suffocating pomposity, endlessly berating Donald Trump--or ""Donald John Trump,"" as he calls him, affecting the superior tone of some disappointed national dad. This is with the help of some terrible accents--his Trump imitation is, bizarrely, a low, gruff, thuggish grunt, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to the candidate's actual wheezy petulance--along with some clunky rhetorical grandstanding (""our shock and revulsion have been refracted like light through a prism""), his worrying habit of pretending to read off the clearly blank sheets of paper in his hands rather than the obvious Autocue, and a few jokes, none of which successfully lands, most of which crash screaming into the surrounding wordscape, scattering awkward debris everywhere. The first episode was shared more than 1 million times in two days and also coincided with a significant dip in Hillary Clinton's poll ratings. Coincidence? It takes the form of a long expose listing all Trump's various misdeeds, but there's a weird flattening effect here--the genuinely awful stuff, such as Trump's racism, is placed on the same level as petty partisan bickering (he accused Obama of ""having lower approval ratings than Vladimir Putin""), ordinary political gaffes, or bad sartorial choices (he ""appeared, in a joint news conference with the president of Mexico, with two bobby pins visible, holding his hairdo in place""), and comments that are actually fairly accurate but impolitic to the Keith Olbermanns of the world (such as when he ""attacked the United States of America and claimed it is in a 'death spiral.' "") And it's all utterly impotent. Stranger things have happened, but it's almost impossible to imagine a Trump voter, surrounded on all sides by drudgery and decay, the rotting, precarious hell that is life in the 21st century, listening to Olbermann chastise her candidate for being rude to Hillary Clinton, and then concluding that, no, actually, America is already great. The usual complaint that attends this kind of thing is that it's geared toward people who already agree with the conclusions. Abetted by the self-affirmative nature of the social media platforms by which it's disseminated, the evisceration clip functions to reinforce an already existing consensus, rather than to change anyone's mind. It's not for a lack of trying, though. Olbermann really is trying to reach out to Trump voters; he's trying to explain to them why their candidate is a bad choice by listing every bad thing he's ever said or done, because he thinks they don't know. All of these rants are overtly didactic; in the political universe they inhabit, liberals are liberals because they are in possession of all the facts, while people who disagree are not. The notion of politics as a sphere of competing interests has vanished. Instead, political differences are arranged by degrees of knowledge and ignorance. You don't need to actually offer people anything to induce them to vote the right way; they just need information. And those who persist in making the wrong choice can only be stupid. Olbermann and his colleagues don't understand that their own politics rise out of their own narrow interests; their bourgeois ideal has assumed the status of a depoliticized civic universal. A broad consensus--socially inclusive rhetoric at home combined with endless, distant war abroad--has become ingrained in the mainstream, but for such a stupid and contradictory doctrine to function it needs to make itself indistinguishable from the whole truth system of reality itself. It's not just that, as Marx noted, in every age the ruling ideas are those of the ruling class; as far as the new aristocracy of well-paid but constantly besieged political comedians are concerned, they're the only ideas worthy of the name. Their rants are so ineffective because they don't see any opposing ideologies to combat or even real enemies to fight, only a mass of idiots who need to be hectored out of their idiocy. No wonder nobody's listening; no wonder the left is doing so badly. If progressive politics of any stripe are to have any kind of a chance, we need to ditch the modern style of evisceration, and learn once again how to get nasty.

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/donald_trump_has_gone_full_breitbart.html	"ST. LOUIS--Jason Miller at least had something to work with this time. ""Great night for Trump! That was a knockout!"" the Trump campaign spokesman said as he entered the spin room at Washington University. What about the first segment of the debate, though, when Trump was pounded over the leaked tape? ""Mr. Trump did absolutely fantastic tonight,"" he responded, not missing a beat. ""I think Hillary Clinton looked absolutely rattled."" This is what the team was going with. ""I would say Donald Trump had a knockout tonight,"" Rudy Giuliani, a few feet away, was saying to reporters. ""This was one of the stronger performances I've seen in any presidential debate."" Clinton, ""by the end, by the second half of that debate, she was tired, she found it hard to finish sentences, and then she kept going on and on and on."" It is their job to say such things. In terms of pure energy, though, the Trump spinners were far more animated than the Clinton spinners. Trump's surrogates and spokespeople sounded like an enthusiastic pro-Trump comments section, while Clinton's spinners sounded like data analysts measuring the effect of Trump's performance on the long arc of the campaign. This breakdown sounds much like the race as a whole: one candidate with a steamed, from-the-gut minority, another with a cooler, analytics-focused majority. Trump gave his comments section some love Sunday night. What did he offer everyone else? Firing up his core supporters has never been Trump's problem, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said: ""He's been at 42 percent pretty consistently through the horserace, if you look the race nationally, to date."" ""His problem has been he can't extend his appeal. He has no way to grow with those persuadable, undecided voters,"" he went on. ""He didn't help them tonight, to reach out beyond his core supporters. In fact, I think that his whole strategy tonight is to revive and to motivate core supporters who were probably in danger of falling into a depression and funk."" Campaign chairman John Podesta framed Trump's performance through a similarly dismissive lens: ""I think that if he needed to change the trajectory of the race today, he didn't do it."" The early response seems to bear out Fallon's and Podesta's readings. CNN's instapoll again showed Clinton pulling off an easy debate victory, 57 percent to 34 percent. YouGov's survey had it closer and more representative of the national horserace figures. Eerily representative, really. Forty-seven percent said Clinton won. And Trump's number? It was exactly the figure Fallon said he was stuck on in the national horserace: 42 percent. Which made it all the odder that so many pundits, beyond the figures paid by Trump to say nice things about him in spin rooms, would instantly conclude that Trump had scored an upset to reset the race. What were Trump's most memorable sound bites, and to whom were these supposed to appeal? Trump referred to Bernie Sanders' support of Clinton as Bernie signing on ""with the devil,"" which is to say he referred to Clinton as the devil. He trotted out some oldies--Benghazi, ""basket of deplorables."" He said Clinton has ""tremendous hate in her heart ... she's got tremendous hatred."" He bitched at the moderators incessantly, saying it was ""three on one"" against him and railing about unfair time constraints. Was he really mad about his allotted time? Or was he just reaching into his primary-season muscle memory, where whining about the refs was always a savvy move? He said--remarkably--that Clinton would ""be in jail"" if he were in charge of the country. There was also the thing where he invited Clinton accusers from times past to attend the debate and psych Clinton out. Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones were in the debate hall, and Trump finally got in his digs about Bill Clinton's alleged sexual crimes over the years. That was his big ""play"" for the night. And that play almost certainly made the lives of the Breitbart comments section and the segment of the country that has believed and will continue to believe every awful thing ever floated about the Clintons until the day they die. Trump's performance wasn't his worst; to his core supporters, it was easily his best. But he won the race for president of the Breitbart comments section a long time ago. He's supposed to be trying to win something else. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."
