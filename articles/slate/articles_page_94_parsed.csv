When Time questioned Perry about his ""controversial rhetoric,"" including his claim that Social Security is a ""Ponzi scheme,"" he didn't shrink one bit. ""There may be someone who is an established Republican who circulates in the cocktail circuit that would find some of my rhetoric to be inflammatory or what have you, but I'm really talking to the American citizen out there,"" he said. ""I think American citizens are just tired of this political correctness and politicians who are tiptoeing around important issues. They want a decisive leader."" This is a familiar construction: Leadership requires candor. John McCain ran as a ""straight talker"" in 2000 and, to a lesser degree, in 2008. It's also the line Barack Obama gave us in 2008, promising to tell uncomfortable truths and saying the way he talked told us something about the way he would lead. But do voters really want truth--or merely a reasonable facsimile? In a time when the country is sick of duplicitous (or at least misleading) Washington politics, a ""truth-telling"" newcomer might be crushed in the mob of well-wishers. But usually these truths consist of forceful statements about uncontroversial propositions. That's what Obama meant in 2008, and so far Perry is following a similar script. When a candidate makes so much of his candor while showing so little of it, he is engaging in the very sleight of hand that makes voters so thirsty for candor in the first place. The immediate benefit of Perry's claims is that they distract from what might be a political liability stemming from his remarks and past writings about Social Security. His proclamations of honesty are meant to show anyone just tuning in that he is merely under attack for being the one honest man in the race. Longer term, being seen as a ""truth teller"" is a big political advantage. Sarah Palin, Gov. Chris Christie, and Rep. Paul Ryan are all GOP heroes in part because they are ""truth tellers."" Sticking to your guns is arguably the single most important quality GOP activists are looking for in their nominee. They bring it up in interviews all the time. They want someone who will go to Washington and not get corrupted. That's what Perry's cocktail-circuit crack is about. He's not against the same cocktail circuit he must ride to raise money, mind you--just the one inside the Beltway where the GOP establishment stands around complimenting itself and raising concerns about Perry's controversial remarks. It's also a nice political wedge for Perry against Mitt Romney, who has been dogged since his last campaign by questions about his constancy. If you are seen as a candidate who tells it like it is, then it doesn't really matter if on various issues you might not be ideologically in sync with the base. This is why one of the stock phrases in any ""truth-teller's"" script is, ""You might not always agree with me, but you know where I stand."" In Perry's case, the larger hope is that his frankness and anti-Washington posture--as well as his other attributes like his Christian faith--will connect with voters in their gut. That bond will overcome individual items that might worry conservatives, like his position on the HPV vaccine or allowing illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges. On these issues, Perry has pretty much stood his ground, even getting booed at the last debate for his position on immigration (though he may be wobbling on the HPV vaccine decision). Mike Huckabee benefited in this way in 2008. Voters overlooked his spending record as governor and the clemency decisions that went wrong. Telling the truth is different from being blunt. When Perry talked about roughing up Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke if he ever made it to Texas, it was controversial--and it may have even been truthful--but it wasn't exactly relevant. Which is to say, it wasn't a straightforward assessment about the current state of the nation and what is necessary to improve it. The former is nourishing to voters, but Perry is claiming credit for the latter. Nor is it a particularly courageous act in a party primary to hold a position your base agrees with but which upsets your opponents. In 2008, Obama was against the Iraq war when his party was against it. Likewise, while liberals may be offended when Perry questions global warming and evolution, for the purposes of the Republican primary, it does not qualify as truth-telling. To his base, these are noncontroversial issues. During the 2008 campaign, Obama regularly proclaimed that he would tell voters ""hard truths,"" but he never really did. What he meant was that he would say one mildly controversial thing, not that he would shoot himself with truth serum before answering every question. So he talked about how, at a speech in Detroit, his mention of raising fuel-efficiency standards received a cool reception. This sounded like classic truth-telling: speaking candidly to an interested party in a way that might cause you political pain. But speaking sternly to auto executives is a narrower feat than speaking candidly to voters. That's why at the end of the speech Obama referred to, he got a standing ovation. The story seemed a little small for the sweeping speak-truth-to-power claims that were being made for it. So, too, do Perry's claims about telling the truth on Social Security. He's taking a big stand on a small plot of land. Perry is claiming candor for speaking the ""truth"" about Social Security's long-term fiscal condition. In the last debate, he said younger voters should know that he is someone ""who came along that didn't lie to them, that didn't try to go around the edges and told them the truth."" He has dropped calling it a ""failure,"" so what remains is not very controversial. Plenty of people agree that the program needs to be fixed. Perry says no one has tried to do anything about the problem; he may want to talk to George W. Bush, who did try--and failed. Where Perry does have an opportunity to tell the truth is on the specifics of his plans to fix Social Security. This is not advisable. Specificity gets you in trouble, which is why candidate Obama, after saying reforms such as raising the retirement age and indexing benefits were on the table, then took them off. In his book, Perry makes the case for having the states run Social Security. This qualifies as truth-telling--and may even count as exciting, if we can use that adjective about Social Security reform. But when pressed on this issue during this week's debate, Perry retreated from specifics. (To his credit, Perry has not always retreated. In Dubuque, Iowa, in August, before the Social Security issue became so touchy, he said state control might be an option to consider, and he has also suggested that those with fixed incomes should contribute to their Medicare or Medicaid costs in order ""to have skin in the game."") The question now for Perry, as it is for every politician who proclaims his loyalty to the truth, is how and when to tell it. Sometimes politicians really do tell people things they don't want to hear. Other times they just maintain the posture of telling hard truths as a way to obscure their positions. A truth-teller knows the difference."	Rick Perry's Social Security rhetoric: Truth-telling in politics is hard to do.	['Obama', 'Paul', 'Perry', 'McCain']	['guns']
1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/political_inoculation.html	"""It's kind of bullshit that Rick Perry is backing off of the HPV thing,"" says Debra Medina. The ""HPV thing"" is Perry's executive order, as governor of Texas in 2007, to mandate an anti-cervical-cancer vaccine named Gardasil for girls between 10 and 12. The issue arose in the presidential debate on Monday after Wolf Blitzer brought it up and two of Perry's rivals pounced. Rick Santorum accused Perry of ""having little girls inoculated at the force and compulsion of the government."" Michele Bachmann, with her usual flair, added that ""to have innocent little 12-year-old girls be forced to have a government injection through an executive order is just flat out wrong."" When the debate was over, Ron Paul took a swing, too. Perry tried something new: unrepentant humility. ""If I had it to do over again, I would have done it differently,"" he said. ""I would have gone to the legislature, worked with them. But what was driving me was, obviously, making a difference about young people's lives."" All of this was old news to Medina. In 2010, she challenged Perry and Kay Bailey Hutchison in the Republican primary for governor. She'd never won office before, but it was a good year to be a first-time citizen politician waving the Gadsden flag: She surged so high, so fast, that Perry was almost forced into a runoff. One of the issues she pounded him was Gardasil. Hutchison joined in. Perry beat them, but he was on safer turf than he is now. ""What's interesting about this whole drama,"" she says, back at work at her medical billing company, ""is that even through the gubernatorial campaign, he maintained it was the right decision and he'd do it again. Now, all of a sudden, he becomes a presidential candidate, and says once the legislature passed bill contradicting him, he heeded their advice."" She laughs ruefully. ""He didn't veto the bill, but he continued to maintain publicly that the executive order was the right thing to do, he wanted to protect these girls."" How did this become a problem for Perry? Not too long ago, the only people complaining loudly about this were the sort of people who thought he was building a superhighway to Mexico, or reupping his membership in the Bilderberg Group. Perry welcomed their outrage as just another example of what happens to strong leaders like Rick Perry. ""We instigated, with HPV, a national debate, and I think appropriately,"" Perry told Evan Smith in a 2007 interview. ""As a matter of fact, the more I know about this disease, the more I know that we are absolutely, unequivocally correct. I don't think anyone had any idea that it was as widespread or as costly. I tell my Republican friends, 'If you want to focus on the good old fiscal side of it, we spend $350 million per biennium on this disease with cancer treatments and hysterectomies and the cost to the state.' "" The 2007 interview gives us a Perry who's punchy, annoyed, not sure why this is such a controversy. The people who doubt his strategy are ""Monday morning quarterbacking."" He's basically saying the same thing now, betting that he can get past this issue by admitting a tiny misjudgment, then putting sandbags up and waiting for the fury to burn itself out. It's a pretty good bet. It helps when Bachmann is leading the opposition. Within an hour of the debate, she told Fox News about a mysterious woman who said that Gardisil had mentally disabled her child. On Tuesday Rush Limbaugh was speculating that Bachmann had ""jumped the shark."" The FDA has judged Gardasil to be 100 percent effective. According to the CDC, there have been 35 million doses of the vaccine, with 0.05 percent of them causing any side effects. Pro-vaccine groups, who have spent quite enough time on Jenny McCarthy, have taken after Bachmann with the smiles and vigor of a shortstop chasing a fly ball. ""Congresswoman Bachmann telling that story showed reckless disregard for science and the health of children in her stating that vaccines can cause mental retardation and other developmental issues,"" says Evan Siegfried, a spokesman for the Global and Regional Asperger Syndrome Partnership. ""By joining the ranks of 'vaccination-truthers,' she is giving a widely discredited 'theory' a voice and putting the health and safety of children at risk."" But ""anti-vaxxer"" conspiracy wasn't actually at the root of the HPV struggle. Perry's original problem was that social conservatives vehemently opposed a vaccination for pre-pubescent girls. Why? They viewed it as an usurption of the parents' rightful role in making medical decisions and bright-red matador flag that girls could go ahead and have pre-marital sex with no worries about the human papillomavirus to kill the mood. There's good news for Perry here: So far, he's smoothed over the social-conservative panic. Before launching his campaign he met with influential movement leaders, answering their questions with the same two-step he gave in Tampa: I was mostly right, but I shouldn't have made the vaccine mandatory. That's significantly softer than his original answer to questions like this. Perry still faces at least one more HPV problem, though. It's the Republican problem of the moment, thanks to Sarah Palin. It's ""crony capitalism."" Bachmann's most coherent attack on Gardasil came when she accused Perry of forcing the program through because his former chief of staff, Mark Toomey, lobbied for Gardisil's maker, Merck. Perry said he'd only gotten $5,000 from Merck; that lowballs the actual figure by about $25,000. Pushing through a massive vaccination program in order to benefit his friend? Is Perry some kind of cackling villain in a direct-to-video Rutger Hauer movie? Well, no, but the crony argument helped sink the plan in 2007, causing a mess big enough that Merck simply stopped lobbying for mandatory vaccinations. (Lucky for Merck, Palin's Alaska got its plan in under the wire.) Perry's flub inspired reporters to pry the coffin nails off of the HPV story and prove that his financial ties to the drug company ran deeper than he admitted. So there may be is a skeptical conservative voter who has a question he didn't have on Monday: Will this guy sign legislation or executive orders with one eye on what people have donated to his campaign? That's how this could hurt Perry. If the shiny Bachmann bauble gets all the attention, he's home free again--just like he was when he beat Debra Medina."

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/americas_tea_party_network.html	"CNN's coverage of Monday's CNN/Tea Party Express Republican presidential debate was anchored all day by special coverage of the Tea Party movement, documentaries about where it came from, and steady commentary from CNN's in-house Tea Party star, Dana Loesch, whose Twitter feed has taken on the feel of one of those ""They're Just Like Us!"" spreads in US Weekly. Huntsman will be swinging by the tent soon.Huntsman just walked in to makeup. I think he's competing with Cain for the youngest entourage.Just met Huntsman. Nice guy. Wouldn't vote for him but nice guy. The Tea Party Express debate features questions from real, live Tea Party activists. The questions-from-real-Americans debate format isn't new. What's new, we're told, is the hands-on involvement of America's grassroots-iest conservative movement. What's actually happening is the culmination of a few decisions that made the Tea Party into what it is today--a wing of the GOP that attracts cameras like a massive electromagnet. There are Tea Partiers who wince when they think about this. Tea Party Patriots, the most disaggregated of all the movement's organizations, is not present in Tampa, Fla. Mark Meckler, the group's co-chairman, offered a crisp ""no comment"" when asked why. For him, it's rhetorical question. In the early days of the movement, Meckler and other Tea Party leaders viewed the Tea Party Express (TPX for short) as a rehab center for Republican strategists--which, in a way, it was. In 2009, the brains behind the middling Our Country Deserves PAC--most famous for a post-2008 election ad thanking Sarah Palin for being herself--realized that the ""Tea Party"" was seeding some fertile, unclaimed territory. ""We have to be very very careful about discussing amongst ourselves anyone we include 'outside of the family,' "" wrote OCDPAC's Joe Wierzbicki in an organizing memo obtained by Politico's Ken Vogel, ""because quite frankly, we are not only NOT part of the political establishment or conservative establishment, but we are also sadly not currently a part of the 'tea party' establishment."" The movement, in listservs and in interviews with the press, started an internal argument that never quite finished. A former flight attendant, Amy Kremer, was pushed out of Tea Party Patriots for the crime of joining the TPX's first tour. It was an irresistible story of ""Tea Party tension."" It wasn't hype: There was tension. There would be a lawsuit filed against Kremer. ""They are ... working to position themselves as *THE* Tea Party Movement Spokespeople, for the purpose of gaining gravitas, for the purpose of raising funds, TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES,"" wrote California Tea Party activist Laura Boatright in an October 2009 email about the controversy, on the Tea Party Patriots listserv. ""It's a BUSINESS for them. They make their living doing it. And building a reputation is important to their success, and FUTURE PROCEEDS."" For some Tea Party activists, joining up with TPX meant losing the movement's innocence. It meant becoming partisan, getting wrapped up in the mania of national politics, getting wedded to the GOP. ""Supporting candidates was not what the Tea Party was about,"" says Judy Holloway, who co-founded the Austin (Texas) Tea Party Patriots in 2009 and raged against the rise of TPX. ""Now, it's been overtaken by the Republican Party."" She shut down the local organization in March 2011, turning her effort to local issues, still annoyed at the fundraising and candidate-endorsing turn the Tea Party had taken. ""I think ... I can't tell you what I really think."" Holloway and her like minds were the exception; the TPX enjoyed more and more success. One big reason for that was that CNN started embedding with the TPX tours. At an April 2009 Tea Party, the network's Susan Roesgen started challenging the premises of activists, and spotlighting one protester who compared Obama to Hitler. She was eased out of her job. The crackdown was followed by glasnost; reporter Shannon Travis climbed on the bus, getting regular interviews with activists and defending the movement from attacks. ""Being at a Tea Party rally is not quite like seeing it on TV, in newspapers or online,"" Travis wrote in an April 2010 article that went viral. ""That's the reason CNN is covering this political movement--and doing so in ways few others can or choose to do."" He ran down a list of things the rest of the media was leaving out: ""Patriotic signs professing a love for country; mothers and fathers with their children; African-Americans proudly participating; and senior citizens bopping to a hip-hop rapper."" So began the CNN-TPX romance, to be consummated tonight in prime time. The movement's skeptics were partly wrong, partly right, about the effects. It did not make the Tea Party look partisan. The TPX's leaders were reliable critics of the GOP, who would endorse candidates that Karl Rove didn't like--Christine O'Donnell, Sharron Angle. The rallies were wonderfully random affairs--no one who's seen the cowboy-hat-clad singer Lloyd Marcus sell CDs of his ""Tea Are the World"" singalong, or heard him write Tea Party lyrics to ""New York, New York,"" could think ""Wow, that's one well-oiled Republican machine."" What were the skeptics right about? By folding so neatly into the left-right framework of cable news, the TPX helped the Tea Party become what it is today. No one wonders anymore how to define the Tea Party, or whether it will break up American politics as we know it. The debate is whether the Republican Party is an arm of the Tea Party, or the other way around. A movement that grew out of anti-TARP, anti-American Recovery Act anger was mostly tamed. Tonight, says TPX's political guru Sal Russo, the group has encouraged CNN to ask more economic questions, fewer questions about social and foreign policy wedge issues. This is what Tea Partiers want to ask; it's also what every Republican campaign, so very, very tired of questions about evolution and poll numbers, wants to be asked. ""We would like to find more Democrats to endorse,"" says Russo. ""But it's hard to find any that are opposing Obama's policies. We will find more when there is a Republican President, just like the Boll Weevils during Reagan's tenure."""

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/obamas_jobs_gamble.html	"President Obama is the first president to use the word ""tweet"" in an address to a joint session of Congress. And his message Thursday night was tidy enough to fit in 140 characters: @barackobama Hey @HouseGOP pass my plan or else--BO. The more than 4,000 words the president spoke contained details of his American Jobs Act, a $447 billion program aimed at giving the economy a jolt. Obama promised a continuation and expansion of the payroll tax cut that would give $1,500 a year to working people, tax breaks for hiring veterans and the long-term unemployed, and major investment in infrastructure to rebuild schools and roads, among other measures. Obama said he would pay for it all and made it clear that if Congressional Republicans didn't pass it quickly, he would blame them. If it didn't pass at all, he would blame them in the general election. A president who started his administration with finessed attempts to find bipartisanship is now relying more on force. He made no extravagant offers to listen to the other side. The president outlined each element of his plan and footnoted each with proof that it had been supported by Republicans in the past. Message: If you don't pass this quickly, it's only because you're being political. Over and over again, the president said ""pass this bill"" or the equivalent. And he was calling on Republicans not just to pass it but to pass it fast. The president was aggressive in a way he has never been in speeches to Congress. He charged those who opposed his plans with threatening ""the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning."" Later in the speech he said he would fight against Republican policies that would make people chose between their job and their safety. After the speech was over, Speaker John Boehner clapped twice--the statutory minimum for his position. His tepid response wasn't a consequence of irritation so much as a result of the impatience someone might feel after having to sit through a seminar from HR on company compliance standards. In public, Speaker Boehner and House Majority Eric Cantor said they could work with the president on some elements of the plans. They hoped he would listen to their ideas. They can read polls and know their standing is even lower than the president's, and they saw no point in proving the president's point by immediately dismissing his ideas. Their rank-and-file members were far less judicious, saying Obama was simply offering another failed stimulus package like the first one. A recent Pew poll showed that people blame Republicans for not being willing to cooperate, so people may be receptive to the president's message. But members of the GOP will be selling the idea that this is more big spending from a big-spending president--which the country also believes. Seventy percent, in a recent Washington Post poll, say Obama favors larger government, which only 38 percent of respondents say they would prefer. Fifty-six percent would prefer a smaller government. Whether the president succeeds will depend on whether those rank and file Republicans start to feel any pressure from voters, and that will depend on whether Americans are actually listening to a president who has given a lot of speeches and whose approval rating is low. It will also depend on whether Americans who feel a record-low faith in government will believe that these programs will change anything. The president said these programs would offer a ""jolt"" to the economy, but he didn't make wild claims. If Obama was offering a serum to cure a raging epidemic and Republicans were knocking it from his hand, he might have a strong case, but he was talking about another set of federal government programs: How many voters will believe that this particular set of programs can cure the sick economy? Obama no doubt strengthened his base by putting Republicans on the spot.  He also suggested he wouldn't abandon the fight as he has before, when, after a strong speech, he flees the ring. ""This plan is the right thing to do right now,"" he said. ""You should pass it. And I intend to take that message to every corner of the country."" Liberals such as Paul Krugman liked the proposals on policy grounds, arguing that its incentives for hiring will provide a large return on the investment. The president made a case to the broader electorate that he's leading on the issue they care about. Will he be able to make Republicans pay for obstructionism if his program or some modification doesn't pass? He'll have to make good on his promise to campaign across the land, and he'll have to lay blame and point fingers. That won't be enough to win him re-election, however. If the political strategists are right and the natural tendency is for this election to be a referendum on the incumbent, then the president will have to work to overcome that. He'll have to give people an affirmative reason to vote, rather than simply stay home out of frustration. That's a pretty grim prospect that he can only hope will be improved by the GOP nominating a terrible candidate. The end of 2011 was already shaping up to be brutal in Washington, D.C. Congress had been tasked with finding $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction. Obama just added roughly one-third to that load. The president finished his speech just in time for the kickoff of the NFL season. The speech had already been moved from the previous night to accommodate the GOP debate. It was a fitting bounce-around for a president who has constantly been acted on by other events. Woodrow Wilson said a presidency can be as big as the man wants to make it. This is true, but only within the constraints of the particular moment. The question of the speech is the question of the Obama presidency. How much can he realistically achieve in an office that is constrained by the Constitution, the opposition and a public that is angry, scared, and sending mixed signals. Is Obama doing the best anyone could, or is he playing a bad hand badly? His speech was an attempt to show that he's trying to break through the limits in every way he can. After he was over he stopped to speak to the Senate chaplain Barry Black. A little divine help couldn't hurt, either. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/attack_attack_attack.html	"Pour a glass of 2 percent milk and moisten a towel for Rick Perry. In a couple of hours, he will take a stage in California, say the appropriate prayers to Ronald Reagan, and try to deflect questions and attacks from all the Republican candidates who now trail him in the polls. We need to be gentle, because Perry's team wants us to know that debates are very, very hard for him. ""Debates are not the governor's preferred method of communicating and not his strong suit,"" said a Perry spokesman to National Journal. Politico previewed the debate by noting ""questions about his basic smarts""--questions, conveniently enough, given flesh by a popular Politico story. This is mostly great news for Perry. Lowering everyone's expectations for a debate is one of the basic tools of politics, up there with smiling politely and learning how to beg for money. Taking punches when you're the front-runner? That's tougher, but it's what Perry's done in three conservative gubernatorial races. Talk to Republican strategists and you get two big theories. The Reagan Library debate tonight might not matter at all; Perry will stay in command, and his job will become just a bit tougher for the CNN/Tea Party Express debate next week. Or the debate could give some lucky candidate a shot at Perry, and turn the death's head of the easily-distracted media back over to him or her. Here, based on the recommendations of people with no candidate to shill for, is what each candidate could do to pull him- or herself back up to the top of the heap. Mitt Romney. He's got the easiest job of all. In 2007, bashing Mitt Romney was the price for entry in the GOP primary. Even when he wasn't in the lead, he was John McCain's punching bag. Mike Huckabee said that Romney looked like the ""guy who fired you."" But he's not the front-runner right now, so tonight he can hang back and avoid the blows. When he's prompted to go after Perry, he can blow kisses and slyly signal that the compliments work just as well for him. Say this: ""Look, Gov. Perry has done a great job in Texas. He's been a successful governor. In my economic plan, which you can download right now for the Kindle, you'll find that the states with right-to-work laws, the states that aren't held hostage by the demands of unions, are responsible for most of the job growth right now. And if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president, I Will. Not. Rest until there are right-to-work laws in all 50 states. Conservative businessmen like me, they realize that nothing could be better for the economy."" Michele Bachmann. She's lost so much already, and she has so much more to lose. Bachmann won the Ames Straw Poll a few hours after Perry jumped into the race. He surged into first; she slid back into third or fourth place, struggling to stay above the Ron Paul Line. She spent three years becoming the ""Queen of the Tea Party"" (the Weekly Standard's words, not mine!) and he seized power in a bloodless coup. Republicans agree that Bachmann can't ""pull a Pawlenty"" and punt if she gets a chance to attack Romney. They don't really worry that she will; when Pawlenty went after her in Iowa, she endured, then crushed him. But she needs a big moment to wake up fund-raisers and donors who've already started to move on. Say this: ""The sad truth of it is that this president has failed. He passed a trillion-dollar stimulus bill, which failed. And while I was taking the lead in Congress, leading the opposition to that trillion-dollar bill, there were some governors who took that money. They dodged the tough choices. Rick, you took that money, and you can't make Barack Obama a one-term president if you were going along with one of his worst ideas, which I led the fight against."" Ron Paul. Who thought Ron Paul would spend the lead-up to this debate attacking the front-runner? He's bought an ad to inform Republicans that Rick Perry endorsed Al Gore--Al Gore!--in 1988. Perry's campaign kicked back at Paul, reminding Republicans that the congressman left the party in 1987, saying Ronald Reagan had failed the movement. There has been no back-down. Paul's family wants to keep the heat on Perry. It's about ""who people have been long-term,"" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., earlier today. (I waved my don't-quote-people-with-a-bias rule for him.) ""He was one of the earliest supporters of Reagan, one of four members of Congress to support Reagan when he ran in 1976. You contrast that with Rick Perry's support of Al Gore."" Say this: ""Well, we have been making so many mistakes in this recession, and they have been happening because Washington doesn't understand monetary policy! And that's why it's so important that Republicans are consistent, and they nominate a candidate who is consistent. I don't see how you could support Al Gore for president, or you could say that Hillary Clinton's health care plan was constitutional, and then you could say, ""Oh, I'm a conservative!' It doesn't make sense!"" Jon Huntsman. In every multidimensional campaign, there is a candidate who tries to rise above the fray and scold everyone else for being so partisan. In this race, Jon Huntsman can be that candidate. He's made some subtle noises about Mitt Romney's job record, and his campaign team has been less subtle, but what's his advantage in attacking Romney or Perry now? There isn't one--he needs to be the nice guy who makes New Hampshire moderates hear the theme music from The West Wing. Say this: ""Look, I'm not going to tear anybody down. I want to have a common-sense conversation with this country. That's what Americans want. That's what Americans deserve. Let's focus on what works for America, because this sort of squabbling--why, it's not good for anyone."" Rick Santorum. In 2007, Chris Dodd weakened Hillary Clinton by forcing her to answer, again and again, what she really thought about driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. A no-hope candidate, a fringe issue, and it didn't matter--it reshaped the race. Santorum, whose entire campaign has been about the inadequacies of other candidates and the unfairness of the media, can pull this off. Say this: ""I think Rick Perry is dead wrong when he talks about states' rights. I think it's dangerous. When you say you're going to leave marriage up to the states, you're saying to the secular movement, the anti-family movement, that you're not going to fight. You're not going to lead. That's defeatism. We can't afford that. I would add that it's the kind of thinking that led Rick Perry to support mandatory HPV vaccines in Texas, which just sent such a horrible message."" Newt Gingrich. What is he still doing here? He's not out to bring anyone down. He's not campaigning as hard or as frequently as anyone else. No one views him as a threat; for him to attack Perry would be pointless and jarring. Say this: ""I want you to think about something. Think about the question you have just asked. Now, that is just a devastating indictment of how liberal politicians and an elite media have lowered expectations in this country. The question is about what Rick Perry did as governor, but that's irrelevant. The real question should be about the bold, paradigm-shifting ideas that we can implement right now."" Herman Cain. Before Rick Perry captured the Tea Party vote from Bachmann, she captured it from Herman Cain. Anything that brings Perry down is theoretically good for him. He's never showed any interest in attacking fellow Republicans, though, so he'll have to work it into his script. Say this: ""Ask yourself a question. Who got us into this mess? Who did it? It was politicians! And I. Am Not. A politician. Never have been! Never wanted to be! I have not held office for most of my life. I'm a businessman! There are three points I would make about why we can't afford another politician in that job. No. 1 ..."""	Republican debate: How the other GOP candidates can defeat Rick Perry.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/romneys_perry_problem.html	"Mitt Romney brought a Kindle Single to a knife fight. Today he unveiled a 59-point plan for reviving the economy. It runs 160 pages, and is available for immediate download on Amazon. It was an attempted show of force. On the issue voters care about, he is the man with the plan because he comes from the business world. Rick Perry has an economic plan that fits on the fingers of one hand. With his other hand he's throwing punches. This weekend Perry said Romney didn't create many jobs as governor. He defined Romney's private-sector experience as creating jobs overseas. A few weeks ago, Perry reflected on their life experiences and concluded that he came from the real world: ""I didn't work at Bain Capital. I didn't work on Wall Street."" Three attacks--on competence, class, and country of origin. The best rebuttal Romney could offer: Unlike Perry, he's not a career politician. If Romney were a career politician, perhaps he'd still be the front runner. Until now, Romney has benefitted in this campaign from restraint. He has ignored other candidates and stayed focused on Obama. His opponents have foundered. Romney's initial strategy was to let Perry suffer this same fate. That hasn't happened, though Perry's first debates are still ahead of him. Instead, Perry has launched pungent attacks on Romney's core selling point: that his business experience makes him the most qualified to be president. Now Romney either has to get aggressive or lose his best weapon. This isn't just about scoring cheap political points (though, alas, that is what campaigns are about). It's about winning the argument at the heart of the GOP primary. The competition in the GOP race is about which man has the better set of skills for improving the economy. So far Romney has acted as if it is self-evident that his private-sector background makes him the better candidate. It hasn't worked. What's he going to do about it? There's been a lot of talk about leadership in Washington recently. How Romney responds now will tell us something about his leadership style. Will he take action in defense of his central campaign claim? Will he rebut Perry and make a stronger case for the skills he has, or will he let events and others shape the field? Will he lead, or lead from behind? Today Romney's economic plan won the Kinko's primary. His handout was glossier and bigger than Perry's will ever be. That isn't going to help him win the GOP primary. Nor will the substance of his plan. There is nothing particularly novel in all of those pages. It's standard Republican fare--lower marginal tax rates, less regulation, stronger trade, and less spending. Rick Perry would disagree with little of it. That's why his spokesman, Mark Miner, aimed his spitballs elsewhere: ""As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney failed to create a pro-jobs environment and failed to institute many of the reforms he now claims to support."" The debate in the Republican Party is over which man can actually do the things they promise. Romney starts with a disadvantage.  The numbers are against him. As governor he created jobs, but not as many jobs as Perry has in Texas or Jon Huntsman did while he was governor of Utah. In a Web ad released today, Huntsman pointed out that Massachusetts was 47th in job creation while Utah under Huntsman was first. Huntsman doesn't threaten Romney the way Perry does, but his attack on the same front adds weight to the case that Romney couldn't translate his success in business into governing. * Romney can explain that his situation in Massachusetts has to be seen in context. He faced tough conditions--a Democratic legislature that was against him--and he can argue that without his perseverance taxes would have been increased and the job market would have been worse. But to Republican voters, this just sounds like excuse-making--the same excuse-making they bash President Obama for. Romney is never going to win a button-pushing war with Perry. Perry talks about Wall Street and foreign jobs to appeal to voters' gut feelings. When Romney talks about ""career politicians,"" he's trying to do the same thing but he doesn't have the knack for that kind of attack. Voters don't seem to mind Perry's experience as governor. To the extent that people associate politicians with changing their views to fit the moment, that's Romney's problem more than Perry's. Romney does have a sharper case to make about his good attributes, but he doesn't make it very strongly. Romney's best argument is that he has a turnaround talent at a time when that's what's needed. According to a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 81 percent of people think the country is headed in the wrong direction, the highest that number has been during Obama's presidency. Romney turned around companies while at Bain Capital, turned around the Utah Olympics, and redirected liberal policies in Massachusetts. He doesn't just merely have business skill: He has skill at taking on complex systems, diagnosing their problems, and getting as much as he can out of them. This message may be too nuanced for political debate, but Romney can make it better. He talks about having led in the private sector but voters have to infer too much about what that means. To compete against Perry's gut-level arguments, Romney has to be explicit about exactly what a ""career politician lacks,"" or, if that's too combative, he has to make the clear case about why his specific turnaround talents match the moment. It's a bit of an egghead argument, but it's close to what presidents do: making complex arguments in combative situations. If he can pull that off in the primary, Romney will have made a strong case that he is prepared for the job. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/the_lost_cause.html	"When you follow around Republican candidates for president and listen to the questions they get, something's missing. The voters at the South Carolina meet-and-greets are asking about Boeing and unions. The voters at the Dunkin' Donuts in New Hampshire are asking about the EPA. The voters in line for fried butter in Iowa are asking about jobs. Even the red-faced people in videos of congressional town halls are asking about the debt. It's an awkward question, but we've got to ask: What about social issues? One measly three-year economic depression, and voters don't care about social issues anymore? Nope, not as much as they used to. Polling shows us that voters are far, far more worried about the economy--debt, taxes, jobs, health care, everything--than about social issues. Republicans have followed suit. That's why groups like the National Organization for Marriage and the Susan B. Anthony List have to scare candidates out from under the desk with pledges, demanding that they put their social issue stances on the record. (The media salute your patriotic efforts.) Even Robby George is climbing on board. On Monday, George will join Sen. Jim DeMint and Rep. Steve King as a moderator at a five-candidate ""freedom summit"" in South Carolina. In a Friday interview with ABC News, George--a co-founder of NOM, widely recognized as the intellectual paterfamilias of the ""traditional marriage"" movement--didn't even mention social issues. ""The issue that's in front of everyone's mind today is the economic issue, the debt issue, and the jobs issue,"" said George. Does that mean George and DeMint will punt on social issues at their own event? Check back on Monday afternoon. All I know is that the Great Recession has turned the culture wars into a two-track affair. Gay marriage, abortion, and the other bugaboos of the right aren't discussed as much as they used to be. That's a little annoying for conservatives. But because these issues are so ignored, Republicans are having an easier time winning power, then acting on them when they win power. We've seen a new wave of abortion restrictions and (with the big exception of New York) successful anti-gay marriage campaigns in the states, but who's been paying attention? The move away from social issues has changed the GOP's balance of power by changing who the media takes seriously, and what the media focuses on. Take DeMint as an example. He's written three books, the last two all about the size of government and the birth of the Tea Party. He has firmed up his reputation as the party's leading fiscal conservative. But what about that first book? It's all about social issues. As such, it's a useful little reminder of what the movement still thinks about this stuff. The thesis of that book,  Why We Whisper, is that cultural political correctness is oppressing conservatives. ""Because of changes in laws and court rulings,"" writes DeMint (he shares a writing credit with J. David Woodward, who holds the Strom Thurmond Chair in Government at Clemson University), ""Americans are now hesitant to say 'it is wrong' to have sex before marriage or out of marriage, to have a child without being married, to have an abortion, and to have sex with someone of the same gender."" If anyone's about to pull the trigger on an article that calls DeMint a ""libertarian,"" or a leader of the GOP's ""libertarian wing,"" be advised: He blames ""a libertarian 'anything goes' ethic in regard to lifestyle"" as a reason for the ""corruption of social civility."" DeMint (and Woodward) take on everything that the ACLU and the ""secular left"" hold dear, but one argument keeps coming up: If society doesn't condemn the gay lifestyle, we're doomed. ""The arguments against legitimizing the homosexual lifestyle with the institution of marriage are irrefutable,"" writes DeMint. ""Many are not willing to listen to the truth about homosexuality, but this lifestyle is notoriously unhealthy and destructive, with huge financial costs to society."" Who was to blame? The courts and the ""secular left,"" argues DeMint. They were the ones arguing ""that moral behavior cannot be required, that abberant individuals must be coddled not punished, that marriage is nothing special, that homosexuality is no different than heterosexuality."" How to fix it? There are plenty of ideas in here, but the big one is a closer relationship between religion and politics. ""The constitution protects churches from government interference,"" writes DeMint, ""and it is time to encourage churches to participate in the political process."" It's hard to say that this stuff is from another time. DeMint was writing this only three iPhone models ago. But 2008 was a different era, with different obsessions, and unrecognizable wedge issues. One of DeMint's old obsessions was the legal challenges and boycott threats against the Boy Scouts of America. The Scouts, he writes, were clearly right to exclude gay scoutmasters. ""Not only are homosexual men more prone to sexually molest boys, they are prone to seek out organizations, like the Boy Scouts, where they have more intimate experiences with boys."" Yes, the Great Scouts Controversy of the '90s and 00s. It's interesting that DeMint focuses on it, because in 2008, Rick Perry wrote an entire book about it. Titled  On My Honor, resurrected this week in a Dana Milbank column about the Texas governor's views, the book is part tribute, part manifesto about how America's lost its way. ""The so-called 'War on the Scouts,'"" he writes, ""is a microcosm of a larger phenomenon, a 'culture war' that has been tearing at the seams of our society for forty years."" Perry found a way to blame critics of the Scouts for an obscene number of American maladies. The cause of the problem, of course, was the gay lobby. ""The radical homosexual movement seeks societal normalization of their sexual activity,"" he wrote. ""I respect their right to engage in the individual business of their choosing, but they must respect the right of millions in society to refuse to normalize their behavior."" DeMint's book is still obscure. Perry's isn't. As he launched his campaign and transformed into the GOP front-runner, Time's Mark Benjamin noticed this passage:"	Campaign 2012: Republicans like Rick Perry and Jim DeMint still care about social issues. But voters don't.	['Perry']	['abortion', 'gay']
10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/the_buddy_system.html	"In his younger and more vulnerable days, Buddy Roemer got some advice from Ronald Reagan that he's been turning over in his mind ever since. Roemer was a congressman from Louisiana, a comer who'd been giving Reagan the votes he needed on big tax and spending bills. The president took the congressman aside. Reagan wanted to know if Roemer was thinking about being president someday. If so, he told Roemer,""You've gotta do two things. First, you've got to be governor. That's the best training. Second, you've got to switch parties, Buddy!'"" Roemer did both. Twenty-four years ago, he got himself elected governor of Louisiana. Twenty years ago, he transferred his loyalties to the Republican Party--then lost re-election. Sixteen years ago, Roemer ran for governor again. After he lost a second time, he gave up on politics to join Business First Bank. Now he's back, and hardly anyone notices. Roemer jumped into the 2012 presidential race in July. He got a nice little interview on Greta Van Susteren's show, and some time on MNSBC, and a slot on  The Colbert Report after Herman Cain canceled. And what about Herman Cain? The food-franchise turnaround artist, who has never been elected to anything, appears in polls; he gets invited to Republican debates. Neither of those things can be reliably said about Roemer. ""Maybe it's my 20-year absence from politics, OK?"" he says. ""Let's be fair about it. I've been working on building my company. I haven't missed politics at all."" His campaign manager, Carlos Sierra, has said that Roemer's being left out of debates because of ""bullshit rules."" He said this in a letter to supporters. Roemer winces at the quote. ""I wish he hadn't done that,"" he says. ""I wouldn't use that word. I would call them 'B.S.' rules."" Roemer, who used to be one of the New South's Politicians to Watch, is now a 67-year-old fringe candidate. We can borrow the term Matt Labash once used to describe an also-ran in the 2007 race: Roemer is the sane fringe candidate. He hasn't hired known-quantity campaign strategists (one of the reasons why Jon Huntsman has been gifted with hours of free media and at least one magazine cover, despite no tangible support from actual voters), and he is purposefully refusing to raise much money, socking away $60,535 in his last report. I talked to Roemer over the phone on Tuesday, two days before he's set to give an economics speech--his second--at the National Press Club, which is often where candidates struggling for attention end up. Slate: So, what's your theory? Why aren't you getting taken more seriously? When you do appear in the media, the hook is usually ""Why isn't he getting more media?"" That's actually why I'm talking to you, come to think of it. Roemer: It's very sporadic. It's a great deal of focus, and then nothing for a while. And it depends on the quality of the reporter, I find. Some of them are just concerned about the money you raise and where you stand in the polls. That's the wrong way to look at it. When I ran for governor, I started in last place--I mean, I was at 3 percent, 4 percent, I was just discounted day after day. Slate: Like now. Roemer: Well, some reporters got what I was doing. They got that I was running against corruption. They got the ""Roemer Revolution."" They got that. I'm hoping we'll have the same two-step here. If I can get on the debate stage and point at the other candidates, and ask them, ""Where are you getting your money?"" then that'll be big. ""Who runs your Super PAC? How will you get done what you want to get done, because you're owned by your donors?"" And then, once the prairie is ablaze, there's no puttin' it out. That can happen 100 days before an election, 30 days before an election. Slate: About the donations, though--you're not taking any donations larger than $100. Roemer: Correct. Slate: When you were governor, you capped donations for everyone at $5,000. So why not have a higher cap for your own campaign than $100? Roemer: I could have done that! It's a good question. The $100 limit is arbitrary. My limit, the one I proposed as governor, was in a state where there was no limit! I mean, $5,000 was a hell of a limit for people who were getting $250,000 from big oil companies. Then, as I do now, I wanted to call attention to the corruption, set myself aside from the good old boys. I like $100 because it's reachable by every person. There's not a person who will read your article who can't do $100. Now, on the other hand, I believe the six or seven major candidates, plus the president, will all have Super PACs, where there are no limits. It's supposedly OK, to them, when a former campaign manager can go off and run a Super PAC, and say, well, this is independent from the campaign. This is corruption! This is phony! This is a lie! Slate: What those candidates say, though, and what the Supreme Court says, is that money is speech. Let's look at Mitt Romney. One of his Super PAC's big donors was anonymous, and then the media hounded the guy out, and Romney said that it was ""no harm, no foul"" to find out where that money was coming from. If we find out who the big donors are, why shouldn't big donors be allowed to contribute what they want? Roemer: That's a big if! You just dug yourself a nice, big hole for yourself with what you said there. He was forced to do it! That donor was hidden. He set up a corporation then he shut it down, just to move the money. It's a trick, it's gamed. Look, I'm a grown man, and I've been in politics most of my life. I know how people hide this money, behind PACs with fancy names that mean nothing. I'd say that sunlight cures and heals. There's no criminal charge for hiding the identity of a donor. There should be. Slate: When you were in the House you backed a few different efforts to cut spending along the recommendations that committees had come up with. Are you optimistic about the ""supercommittee""? Roemer: No. I wanted the leadership to keep the committee clean--keep 'em clean, don't let them raise money. I wanted them to request that the members not take money from lobbyists for the rest of their term, not take PAC money. This special committee could have been example of how to keep things right and straight. And before I even sent a letter asking for that, what happened, you had one member of the committee send a fundraising message out. I won't mention his name. I won't mention Xavier Becerra's name. I'll be nice about it. Slate: When you were governor, you stepped up regulation on oil companies. You've also said that we should have started drilling again, more quickly, after the BP spill. Which is it? Where are you on regulation of hydraulic fracking, for example, because at the moment that's not terribly regulated. Roemer: We shouldn't let the radical environmentalists have the last word. They never complained about fracking until two years ago. They keep shifting their emphasis. No, I think we should have a balance. We should require the industry to have a reservoir of resources for immediate cleanup. We should require regulators to be independent of the producers, and that was not the case with BP, as you well know. Now: I believe we should develop what we have. I believe that we're paying a price for foreign oil--loss of life, loss of currency. But we need to develop it, then tariff that oil and use the revenue to pay down the national debt. Slate: Also, when you were governor, you vetoed an abortion ban-- Roemer: I vetoed two abortion bans. The second one was even worse. It didn't protect the life of the mother. The Supreme Court found it unconstitutional. Slate: Two bans. Is that still your position, that there should not be a total ban on abortions? Roemer: I'm a Methodist. I would call my position the Methodist position. We are pro-life, so we would protect the life of the mother, and protect her in cases of rape and incest. Slate: So you don't mix religion and politics. What did you make of Rick Perry's day of prayer a few weeks ago, or his statewide declarations of prayer for rain? Roemer: My problem with Perry is that I haven't heard a substantive speech from him on any issue, and I know he must have a view on those issues. I've been in many meetings where they've done prayers. The difference is the publicity that they tried to generate in Texas. I don't know, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but mixing politics and religion? My attendance at church is more important to me than political speeches, and I don't do both at same time. Slate: But back to the horse race: You've got money. Why not put enough money into the campaign to run some ads and get the attention you need to get into these debates? Roemer: My wife and I have put all the money we're going to put into this. The plan is to remain eligible for matching funds. Slate: But you're sticking with the $100 limit? Roemer: My best fundraising week was last week. I raised enough money to buy a ticket to one of Obama's fundraisers."	Buddy Roemer interview: Why doesn't he get more interviews?	['Perry', 'Romney']	['abortion']
11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/bad_slasher_movie.html	"On Tuesday, as Washington rebuilt itself after a less-than-apocalyptic earthquake, a joke started to circulate on Twitter and Facebook. The popular version went like this: There was just a 5.8 earthquake in Washington. Obama wanted it to be 3.4, but the Republicans wanted 5.8, so he compromised. Funny stuff (unless your name is Pat Robertson). From the tables of Pew polls to the blogs at the Huffington Post, Democrats are yowling about President Obama's habit of giving Republicans most of what they want. It's not just policy--there's only so much you can do with John Boehner running the House and Mitch McConnell putting up sandbags in the Senate--it's also politics.  The White House's big idea right now is extending, and maybe expanding, the temporary payroll tax cut that knocked the Social Security portion of FICA down from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. * Why do Democrats like this idea? Because it has worked so well so far? According to Jared Bernstein, who was Joe Biden's chief economist when the White House got this cut included in the 2010 tax deal ... sort of. ""We don't have great evidence,"" he says. ""But, jeez, another 2 percent on your paycheck has got to help strapped families. In aggregate it was about $110 billion, and many of us believe it helped to offset the increase in gas prices this year."" Bernstein calculates that keeping the tax cut would mean 8.6 percent unemployment by the end of 2012 and that nixing it would mean 8.9 percent. But that's not why Democrats like the idea. No: According to Sam Stein's reporting, and according to a pile of quotes from frantic Democrats, they like the idea because it makes Republicans look like hypocritical jerks. Asking Republicans why they're against it makes them look so awkward. They set a goal for this week: ""hammering the hypocrisy of individual members who signed [Grover] Norquist's pledge."" And they hammered away. Rep. Russ Carnahan, D-Mo., one of the Democrats most endangered/doomed by redistricting damned the GOP with ""a level of hypocrisy that's hard to get your mind around."" ThinkProgress--a project of a nonpartisan think tank, of course--headlined a report ""Republicans To Oppose Tax Cut for Working People."" Something is getting lost in the campaign: Why goad Republicans into supporting tax cuts? It's an irritating short-term strategy. What does it get Democrats in the long term if they say this tax cut can't be undone? ""It's completely hapless negotiating!"" says Nancy Altman, the co-director of the defend-the-New-Deal-at-all-costs group Social Security Works. ""You're taking something the other side wants and then begging them to take it. I'd expect that Republicans would eventually take it, but in exchange for some other concession. What a perfect position to be in, when you're begging me and offering me more if only I'll vote for something I want already."" Altman has an agenda here--her group believes that weakening FICA for any period of time weakens Social Security--but she's not wrong about the Republicans. The point Democrats are making when they trot out this zinger is that Republicans used to support a payroll tax cut. The liberal punditocracy spent part of this week proving it. Jonathan Chait dug up the story of the early 2008 stimulus plan, $300 billion of tax cuts, and found that Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas--now one of the conservatives on the ""supercommittee""--once grooved on the idea. Greg Sargent unsuccessfully but tirelessly tried to get Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform say whether letting the tax cut expire would count as a tax hike and thus violate the group's no-taxes pledge. Maybe Altman is right, and Republicans are holding out before they vote for this. Or maybe they're sincere, and they realize that this tax cut isn't actually that great. After all, do you remember getting that cut in 2008? Do you remember it doing the economy any good? Of course not: As the former Reagan administration economist and full-time Cassandra Bruce Bartlett says, it ""did nothing to stimulate growth."" ""All tax relief is not created equal,"" says Brad Dayspring, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's spokesman. ""If the goal is job creation, we've always believed that there are more effective ways to grow the economy and create jobs than temporary payroll tax relief."" Indeed there are. According to Bartlett and Democrats, one of those ways would be increased government spending. Republicans completely rule that out. Democrats have stopped talking about it. This is the ratchet effect of economics and politics, and it goes in only one direction, as Democrats, unable or unwilling to explain why the economy's still bad, retreat and convince themselves that they're advancing. Want another example? In 2008, Obama campaigned on a different payroll tax policy--a payroll tax hike on people making more than $250,000. Raise the cap, pull in more revenue from the wealthy, and the Social Security trust fund starts looking like Croesus's guest house. It was an idea Democrats campaigned and won on for years. People who aren't rich like to tax the rich. That's not news. That particular Obama plan, however, was body-bagged before it got a chance to breathe. Nearly three years later, what's happened to idea of lifting the payroll tax cap? It's been proposed again by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the only self-proclaimed socialist in the upper house. When Sanders proposes a tax bill, it's as dead as a teenager who watches that videotape in  The Ring. That's the ratchet effect again--a mainstream Democratic idea becomes a fringe idea. One caveat: It's not really a fringe idea. Sanders's proposal is actually more popular than the one the Democratic establishment has tattooed on its forehead. Last week a Reuters poll asked voters to assess a few different stimulus proposals. Forty-six percent of them liked ""raising taxes on wealthy individuals."" Only 20 percent liked ""extending the payroll tax cut."" That's what happens when Democrats get Norquist on the brain: They become obsessed with making Republicans uncomfortable instead of with something that voters like. Or with something that's easier to campaign on. Or with something that works. Correction,  Aug. 30, 2011: This article originally referred to a cut in FICA from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. Those percentages represent only the Social Security portion of FICA (with and without the ""payroll tax cut""). FICA also includes a Medicare withholding. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/catching_pataki_fever.html	"George Pataki is thinking about running for president. He's thinking about it, and thinking about it some more. He was ""definitely considering it"" in June. On Tuesday, as he planned a trip to Polk County, Iowa, it was a ""strong possibility."" The first natural instinct is to think of Pataki as the former New York governor whose star peaked the day he was elected. (He beat Mario Cuomo, and few saw it coming.) Pataki is the inspiration for countless disappointed jeremiads from conservative economists who wondered what the point of his reign was if he wasn't going to cut spending. President? Pataki? Sure, why not? The mystery of the 2012 Republican primary is not why someone like Pataki would enter it. The mystery is why he wouldn't. If you're a Republican politician, you should pull up three pieces of information. The first is President Obama's approval rating: It's terrible. The second is a reliable projection for GDP and job growth through 2012: just as bad, or worse. The third is a poll of the primary field, in which no one has more than a 2-point or 3-point advantage. This is why someone who last made news as the man grimacing purposefully at Rudy Giuliani's press conferences is still thinking about a run. It's why conservative intellectuals, burned by Paul Ryan and Mitch Daniels and Jeb Bush and their other wonky heroes, keep begging them to jump in to the race. That's all the evidence we need: It's time to expand this field. John Engler, 62 Last-held office: Governor of Michigan. Pros: If we're going to be rehabilitating governors who were big deals in the 1990s, why not this guy? Engler won the governor's mansion three times, twice by landslides. He left office with far more conservative cred than Pataki did: charter schools! Welfare reform! One of those AAA bond ratings that people seem to care about! When he left office, unemployment in the state was 6.3 percent; under his Democratic successor, that rate has more than doubled. He fits the Daniels/Pataki mold of being objectively boring, and the Chris Christie mold of being out of shape. And he's spent his retirement years flacking for the private sector, currently at the Business Roundtable--a role that occasionally leads to heretical statements about government spending, but still, better than working for Obama. Cons: He endorsed George W. Bush in 2000, and promised to help him win the state's open primary. John McCain ran over Bush, then backed the car over him a few times until the crunching noises stopped. This is not a moment that speaks well of Engler's ability to win things. Alan Simpson, 79 Last-held office: Senator from Wyoming. Pros: In Fed Up!, his pre-campaign policy book, Rick Perry says that ""only former senators"" make it onto spending-cutting commissions, because they have nothing to lose. Here's your proof. Simpson co-chaired the president's deficit commission, which came up with a plan so good that everyone in Washington praises it while finding ways not to vote for it. He's the only noncandidate who's been endorsed for a fantasy campaign by Tom Friedman, which has to be worth something. And he's the most quotable man in politics who's not named ""Barney Frank."" Cons: He's the most quotable man in politics who's not named ""Barney Frank."" Jennifer Carroll, 51 Current office: Lieutenant Governor of Florida. Pros: You think the second-ranking job in a megastate isn't impressive? What if the Republican who holds the job is a 1) female 2) black 3) Navy veteran who 4) owned a small business before she got into politics? The Republican convention will be in Florida next year, which gives her the chance to swoop in and become the savior of a brokered mess. And what do Republicans like more than black conservatives who discredit all the mean things Democrats say about them? Nothing. Cons: She was also 5) born in Trinidad. Scratch that. Colin Powell, 74 Last-held office: Secretary of State. Pros: Sooner or later, one of the people Bill Kristol endorses for president has to make the leap. If it can't be Ryan, or Daniels, or Rubio, or McCain, why not one of the most popular Americans in public life? Cons: Endorsed Obama in 2008. Shades of Jon Huntsman. Tan Parker, 40 Current office: State Representative for Texas' 63rd district. Pros: Pitted against a ""generic Republican,"" Obama would lose the 2012 election. Parker is the first person who comes up on Google when you search for ""Republican state representative"" and skip past the ones who are only famous for sex scandals. Cons: There are already two Texans in the race. Also, there may be a more generic candidate who has also managed to stay off of Google, showing real mastery of the generic arts. Sarah Palin (as seen in The Undefeated), 47 Last-held office: Governor of Alaska. Pros: Once upon a time there was a brave and brilliant reporter and mom who out-hustled corrupt politicians and got elected mayor of a small town, then governor of Alaska. She had the highest approval rating of any state executive. She pushed through a reform of the state's oil-tax laws, past the party's establishment and past the best efforts of the mighty industry. All of this was done to a booming soundtrack and lots of file footage of protests and things exploding. She was on track to win the vice presidency before the economic crisis hit and the media treated her so unfairly. Cons: Not many people saw the movie; most other people have soured on the real-world Palin. David Koch, 71 Current role: Featured player in liberal nightmares. Pros: One of the wealthiest men in the world, worth at least $17.5 billion, is also one of the men who made the conservative counterrevolution and the Tea Party possible. No one on the right doubts that Koch fully understands how markets work, or that Obama can destroy America if you let him. Koch has political experience, too--he was the Libertarian Party's vice-presidential candidate in 1980. He spent $2 million on that campaign. It was just a bad year to be a right-wing candidate not named Ronald Reagan. Cons: The ""Human Origins"" exhibit at the Smithsonian's Natural History Museum, funded in part by Koch, claims that man-made climate change is happening. That may be impossible to get past in a Republican primary. Tom ""Terrific"" Morrison, age unknown Current office: Governor of an unnamed state. Pros: A military veteran, businessman, governor, and non-Mormon who, in Mark ""Anonymous"" Salter's novel O, is probably able to defeat Obama. (The book ends on election night.) Cons: He's fictional. Also, no one actually read that book unless they had to. I'm pretty sure this is the first reference anyone has made to it in six months. Tim Pawlenty, 50 Last-held office: Governor of Minnesota. Pros: A young, dynamic rising star in the GOP, who won re-election in an awful year (2006) and has a nearly spotless conservative record. He was on John McCain's V.P. shortlist. He's an evangelical who can dodge Mitt Romney's religious problems, attract the sort of voters who backed Huckabee in 2008, and not scare off centrists. If any ""Sam's Club Republican"" can win this thing, it's him. Cons: It may be a little late for him to jump into the race. Wait. He did what?"

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/next_up_the_endless_primary.html	"Karl Rove says""we are likely to see several other candidates think seriously about getting in"" on the GOP primary. His intentions are clear: He's making life unpleasant for Rick Perry. He's also telling the truth. Perry just entered the race after weeks and weeks of hype, and he hasn't settled anything. The din of the draft campaigns-- Ryan! Christie! Rudy! Palin! hell, even Pataki!--rings just as loud and fills just as many midday Fox News segments. Democrats, who have so little to be cheery about, are cheery about this. Iowa Democratic Party Chairwoman Sue Dvorsky sort of likes the idea of a bone-crunching, time-sucking Republican primary. ""It's an internal family discussion that plays out in public,"" Dvorsky says. ""While they're doing that, we're able to take our messaging, take our field organization, and begin it. We've had months of a jump on this, and we're going to get months more. It's a historical change for them. Gone are the days when it's 'Bob Dole's turn,' and they have their next guy up."" Once people start voting, of course, the field will narrow. Maybe. Can Mitt Romney and Rick Perry stay deadlocked well into 2012? Can the legions of Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul sweep the caucuses and refuse to quit? Can Jon Huntsman ironically tweet his way to victory in the Puerto Rico primary and become the power broker at the Tampa convention a year from now, summoning candidates into his hotel suite to lecture them on global-warming data? Theoretically. Sort of. The Republican primary schedule is still in flux, and there's time for states to try power plays that will move the map around. Based on the moves so far, though--California moving from February to June, Florida punting its timing decision to an independent committee--there will be nothing like of 2008's 22-state Super Tuesday to sort of the field. Fewer states will go winner-take-all and award all of their delegates to the candidate who carries the popular vote. ""I like it, because I'd like to have a longer nomination process,"" explains Morton Blackwell, a member of the Republican National Committee from Virginia. ""Yes, it could very well extend the period when it isn't clear who our nominee will be."" Curly Haugland, an RNC committeeman from North Dakota who sits on the rules committee, takes that one step further. ""I've been spending a lot of time on this,"" says Haugland, ""and it seems like there's no possibility for anything but a contested convention."" That's fine with him. ""The media and pollsters want this to be decided in primaries? Well, who gives a rip who wins New Hampshire? There's a bunch of left-leaning lunatics up there."" Thus the scenario--floated every four years--in which the race drags on, no one locks up the nomination, and the convention doesn't pick a candidate on the first ballot. This is the first GOP presidential primary of the Tea Party era, with state parties that have been taken over by the sort of people who decapitated Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah, Rep. Mike Castle of Delaware, and (less successfully) Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. It's the first post-Citizens United primary, which makes it theoretically possible for candidates to be bailed out by Super PACs funded by the sort of people who really started sweating when President Obama went after private jets. Officially at least, only Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada are permitted to have primaries in February--and that's the earliest the party wants them to start. Any other state that goes earlier (and a few are floating the possibility) gets its delegation to the convention cut in half. No state that holds a primary in March is allowed to make it winner-take-all. After April 1, there are no such restrictions--California, New York, and Pennsylvania can go winner-take-all if they want to. But if the current schedule doesn't change much, only about half of the delegates will be assigned before April 1. And that, potentially, is the set-up for a long, agonizing primary. Just how agonizing? Republicans are confident that it won't be as bad as Obama-Clinton. The main reason: Their version of balanced, non-winner-take-all primaries isn't as bend-over-backward fair as the Democrats' version. Even in the scenario in which Romney, Perry, and Bachmann take chunks out of one anothers' hides for a couple months, there'll be more decisive results than the ones Obama and Clinton got. The reason for that, explains election-watching academic Josh Putnam, is that the GOP's ""balanced"" primaries aren't really balanced. In next year's primaries in Michigan, Virginia, and other states tweaking their systems, some delegates will be assigned, proportionately, to the biggest vote-getters in those states. But most will be assigned on a winner-take-all basis, congressional-district-by-congressional district. In 2008, the states that used this system allowed John McCain to lock down his nomination with slim wins. In California, he only beat Mitt Romney by seven points, 42 percent to 35 percent. He won the state's delegates in a landslide, 155-15. Does that mean that the GOP primary's messiness won't matter, and that one of the frontrunners will win in a hurry anyway? Well, it depends what the word ""win"" means. Go back to that new X-factor of state Republican parties that have been taken over by Tea Party and Ron Paul activists. If the race is still inconclusive in late spring, what's to stop these activists from crashing the state conventions and sending a bunch of Bachmann or Paul delegates to Tampa, instead of Romney delegates? Technically, nothing is stopping them. ""The reality is that the primaries and causes that the media covers in the early months are just the first steps,"" explains John Yob. He was the McCain campaign's political director in 2008. ""After the initial contests, there are contests where the actual delegates are elected. Those delegates aren't necessarily bound to vote the way the primary electorate voted. I'll give you an example: In 2008, the McCain campaign sent teams to roughly 35 state conventions across the country in order to make sure McCain delegates were elected. This was after the media had coronated him as the nominee."" What would one of the GOP's nightmare scenarios look like? The simplest one starts with a Bachmann win in Iowa, followed (possibly, if the state sticks with a current plan) by a win in her own state's caucuses the next day. It continues with an indecisive Missouri primary, with the state punished for moving the date up. It goes on to a Mitt Romney win in New Hampshire and a too-close-for-comfort Romney-Bachmann-Perry-Paul split in the Nevada caucuses the following Saturday. Perry wins South Carolina. Romney wins Michigan. There are no surprises as we head into March. (There's no use guessing what happens in Florida yet, but if the other primaries are split, it may not be decisive.) On March 6, Super Tuesday, Romney wins the his home state and neighboring Vermont, while Perry wins his home state and neighboring Oklahoma. At this point, Perry has more delegates than Romney, but Bachmann's not out of the race yet, and neither is Paul. Paul does well in the Hawaii caucuses, Perry wins the Mississippi primary, and March ends with a slugfest in Illinois and another winnable Perry primary in Louisiana. After that, we're mostly done with the South, and we're done with non-winner-take-all primaries. The race moves back to the Midwest, West, and East Coast. If Perry's rivals are still in the hunt, and Super PACs are still playing, then there's no obvious Republican front-runner. And that would give Republican activists more than enough motive to start showing up at state conventions and steering them to the candidates they like. Republicans can avoid the drawn-out mess. By Oct. 1, 2011, states have to give their final delegate selection rules to the RNC, with whatever don't-screw-with-delegates rules they can dream up. And it's entirely possible that someone will break out of the pack and be a clear frontrunner and consensus choice before the first vote is cast in Iowa next February. In which case the hopes--and fears--of a brokered convention will have to wait until 2016."	Tampa 2012: How likely is a brokered convention for Republicans?

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/fear_of_a_fed_planet.html	"Rest easy: Rick Perry probably isn't going to execute Ben Bernanke. When he told a crowd of Iowa Republicans Monday that ""we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas"" if the chairman of the Federal Reserve ""print[ed] more money between now and the election,"" it wasn't exactly a Kinsley gaffe, defined as when a politician tells the truth. Instead, call it a ""Perry gaffe"": when a politician doesn't mean what he says, but means to say it. Castigate Perry for his crude style. Go right ahead. On substance, however, Perry is clearly within the bash-the-Fed mainstream of the Republican Party. His comments came two days after Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, scored a strong second place at the Ames straw poll, and eliminating the Fed is one of the causes of Paul's life. Paul lost narrowly to Rep. Michele Bachmann, who was one of the GOP's loudest voices against the Fed's 2010 plan to spent $600 billion on mortgage-backed securities--the second round of ""quantitative easing."" Both of them voted for Paul's 2010 ""audit the Fed"" legislation, an effort to crack open the central bank's books that passed with bipartisan support. In the modern GOP, you either hate the Fed or you go home. Fed fatigue isn't just for Republicans. Pollsters ask few questions about the Fed, but the information we do have shows a public that has turned wildly against it. In the 1990s, and even in the 2000s, polls showed that longtime Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was one of the most popular political figures in the country. Occasionally, voters gave him more credit for the economy than Bill Clinton. Before Greenspan finished his last term, the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll gave him a 43-percent approval rating and a disapproval rating of 12 percent. Americans have never felt that way about his replacement; the comparable figures for Bernanke in a late 2009 Bloomberg poll were 35/26. Republicans just grew colder on the Fed faster than anyone else. In 2008, according to Gallup, 61 percent of them approved of Bernanke. In 2009, only 36 percent did. Fed watchers can't quite believe what Perry said. ""To call it treasonous or almost treasonous, to me is outrageous, really,"" says Donald Kohn, who spent most of his career working at the Fed, and retired as vice chairman of the Board of Governors in 2010. Bernanke is ""trying to follow what Congress has given as its goals for the Fed,"" he said. ""To threaten, to use names like that, is not productive."" So what do Americans think of the Fed now? What inspired the question to Perry? And what gave him the confidence to start talking treason? ""I think it reflects two things,"" says Kohn. ""One is that the economic recovery has been disappointing. The Fed has been trying to help the recovery along. But the efforts of the Fed and the government haven't been enough to put people back to work. So they look at the economy and think, surely, the government could have done better. They include the Fed in that sentiment. Two, I think it reflects a feeling that the Fed, through its actions in the crisis, helped the large banks and didn't do anything to help ordinary people."" Anger at the Fed, and mistrust in the Fed, did not spring up because Ron Paul willed it to. It's a reaction to failure. ""The Fed has become politicized,"" argues Allan Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon and a historian of the central bank. ""It's doing fiscal operations. It's doing a lot of things that the public doesn't like, like bailing out the banks. So it's unpopular, and deservedly so."" You need to understand that narrative to understand why Perry thinks the public is with him when he paints prison stripes on Bernanke. In the Academy Award-winning documentary  Inside Job, the Fed comes off as a sleepy, reckless institution; Frederic Mishkin, a Fed governor who resigned just as the crisis was building, is presented as a stuttering ninny. In Too Big to Fail, the film adapted from Andrew Ross Sorkin's reporting on the crash, Bernanke is played by Paul Giamatti in full cynic mode. He has Al Capone's pistol on his wall; he plays harder with members of Congress than bankers, in whom he has blind faith. When the second round of quantitative easing went into effect, Bernanke had to sell it hard, warning of higher unemployment and slower growth if the central bank didn't spend $600 billion to buy up bonds. When the process was over, unemployment was as high as ever, but commodities cost around 25 percent more thanks in part to a slightly weaker, inflated dollar. ""The fact that Rick Perry says something does not necessarily mean that he's wrong, and that the institution has conducted itself in an impeccable way,"" says James Galbraith, an economist and professor at the University of Texas's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. ""The Fed allowed a great overstatement of its powers to become conventional wisdom. It pretended that QE1 and QE2 would achieve something substantial in the economy, when in fact it couldn't."" Make too many promises, break too many hearts, and sooner or later you've got politicians accusing you of ""treacherous, treasonous"" politics. Perry, a latecomer to the race, is also a latecomer to the Fed-bashing cause. For a while, Herman Cain served on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and that one line on his resume has caused him no end of grief. ""I've been in the belly of the beast,"" he explained in a YouTube video, after talking to Iowans who were terrified of his Fed record. ""The current leadership of the Federal Reserve has pumped billions of dollars into the economy in an effort to fight unemployment, only to see the value of the dollar decrease."" That's easy for voters to understand. What's harder for them to understand, especially after the Fed has disappointed them so badly, is that the central bank really can play a role in responding to a new economic slowdown but is not being allowed to: Two seats on the Fed's Board of Governors sit vacant. President Obama has seen holds put on previous nominees, and had real trouble getting candidates to replace them. The trouble starts with a public that doesn't trust the Fed any more. To them, Perry makes sense."	The Ron Paul effect: Why Republicans like Rick Perry feel comfortable criticizing Ben Bernanke.	['Obama', 'Paul', 'Perry', 'Clinton', 'Ross']	[]
15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/college_prank.html	"Dominic Pileggi is the most hated man in liberal America. This puzzles him. The majority leader of the Pennsylvania State Senate plans to introduce a bill that would split up the state's 20 electoral votes, apportioning them by congressional district instead of awarding them all to the winner of the popular vote. Democrats see a partisan motive: If the plan had been in effect in 2008, Barack Obama would have won only 11 of Pennsylvania's electoral votes instead of all 21. Pileggi sees it differently. ""I'm getting more complaints from Republicans!"" he says. ""Some Republicans believe 2012 is going to be the year we win the popular vote in Pennsylvania again."" He is thinking only of the commonwealth. ""This would be good for Pennsylvania,"" Pileggi says. ""The results would reflect which candidate won the popular vote. Is there a better way to closely conform the electoral vote to the popular vote? I'm open to suggestions."" We should pause for a moment, because redistricting plans and Electoral College reform plans are a fertile pasture of spin and cant. Where did this idea come from? In Pennsylvania, it came from a little-known pressure group that spent $75,000 to bend the ears of Republican operatives. That's sort of how similar plans have come up in other states--Colorado in 2004, California in 2007. Why is Pileggi's idea so terrifying to Democrats? Those doomed Colorado and California plans were ballot initiatives. In 2004, the Democratic-aligned strategists behind the plan to split the state's electoral votes lost by a 2-to-1 margin. (The main group opposing the initiative was evocatively called Coloradans Against a Stupid Idea.) In 2007, Democrats branded a Republican-aligned vote-split plan as the ""dirty tricks initiative."" In a bad year for the GOP, the money dried up; the initiative never made the ballot. There are no such Republican problems in Pennsylvania. Pileggi's Republicans control the state legislature and the governor's office. Democrats who want to stop this must place their hopes in other Republicans--like the state chairman, Rob Gleason--who oppose this for picayune local political reasons, or are willing to bet it all on Republicans winning the state for the first time since they crushed Dukakis. If Democrats find six Republican to oppose it in the Senate, or 11 in the House, they can stop it. Otherwise, it's splitsville. In the meantime, what's wrong with the idea? There are two people who can best answer the question. One of them, sadly, is dead. In 1800, when some states actually divvied up their electoral votes like this, Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Monroe with his thoughts about the relative fairness of vote-split plans:"	Pennsylvania's Electoral College reform plan: dastardly, or just dumb?

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/hard_truths.html	"TAMPA, Fla.--Rick Perry served five years in the Air Force, and at his second presidential debate, he must have had flashbacks. He stalled, climbed, and clattered into a few hard landings. He was under fire from the left, right, and above. Ron Paul said Perry had raised taxes as governor of Texas. Mitt Romney said Perry wanted to end Social Security. Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum repeatedly criticized Perry's decision to vaccinate young girls against HPV. After Perry peeled off into the clouds during an answer to a question on Afghanistan, GOP strategist Mike Murphy wrote on Twitter: ""Listening to Perry try to a put a complicated policy sentence together is like watching a chimp play with a locked suitcase."" Mayday, Wolf Blitzer, Mayday! Perry took the attacks like a veteran, but it was not a good night for him. Romney was polished, he had his answers prepared, and his attack lines honed. If you were scoring this as an academic exercise, Romney would be the clear winner. But the audience of Tea Party activists in the hall for the debate co-sponsored by the Tea Party Express and CNN weren't  grading on that scale. They appeared to like Perry much more than Romney. That's the broader split that exists in the larger Republican electorate: Do GOP voters want the ragged, forceful, conservative Perry--or do they want the measured, methodical, and less ideological Romney? The early heat and pushing started over Social Security. It was a bit of a jumble as Romney and Perry rolled around on the ground. There's a really good chance it's going to get confused (Perry got cheers when he shouldn't have), so let me try to pull the two men of good hair apart and assign points. The two governors traded barbs about  who has minted the more baroque criticism of Social Security. Perry has called it a ""Ponzi scheme."" Romney has compared it to a criminal enterprise. This is boring and inconsequential. They can both claim they're talking about aspects of the current system.  Romney has a more pointed critique, though. He points to comments in Perry's book Fed Up! where Perry argues that Social Security is a 70-year fraud forced on the American people. He argues that it should have been a private or state-run system and should be again. Romney asked Perry if that's what he still believes. Perry dipped, dived, and dodged, reasserting that he was the truth teller in the race. Here's his problem: If Perry is asking for truth-telling credit for diagnosing Social Security's  problems (which everyone diagnoses), then he should also accept the deduction for not honestly embracing his position in his book. He's ducking while simultaneously asking that he be given points for standing tall. Why does this matter? First, the politics. In 2008, 44 percent of the GOP primary voters in Florida were over 50. That number is slightly higher in Iowa. Right now Perry leads with those voters. According to the latest CNN/ORC International poll, Perry currently has an 18 -percentage point advantage among Republicans aged 50 and over, leading Romney 38 percent to 20 percent. This debate is part of a larger one, which can essentially be reduced to a single question: How big a sandwich do you want to eat with this new president? Social Security is going to get reformed. What do you want to have happen in that instance? Do you want to change the retirement age, index benefit increases to prices and not wages, maybe flirt with some private accounts? That's what you'll get with Romney. Or do you want the whole program to be under the purview of the states? Tea Party activists I talked to earlier in the day wanted to scrap it and move it to the states. I'm not sure general election voters want that. Do House and Senate Republicans want to run on that platform? They're already running on the Ryan plan, which offers a fundamental change in Medicare, turning it into a voucher-like program. That's a lot of change the 2012 GOP will be promising a country already fatigued with change. Perry hasn't actually put forward a Social Security plan that sends the program to the states, but that's the scope of his ambitions on a whole host of things. By contrast, Romney gave his sharpest and most effective argument for his candidacy: ""The country needs a turnaround, that's what I do."" Romney deflected attacks on the health care plan he implemented in Massachusetts and pressed his case again for why Perry's record in Texas owed more to the state than Perry's magic. Asked if Perry deserved any credit, Romney said that being dealt four aces ""doesn't make you, necessarily, a great poker player."" Ron Paul came to Romney's aid, saying that Perry had raised taxes in Texas and joking that he didn't want to be too critical because, as Perry's constituent, he worried Perry ""might raise taxes on me again."" The toughest moment for Perry came during a few rounds of abuse over his executive order to mandate the HPV vaccine for young girls. Perry reiterated that he had only put the policy in place because he was trying to save lives. He said he'd never do such a thing as president because governors are allowed some leeway to experiment whereas presidents are not. The argument matched the one that Romney makes in defense of his health care experiment in Massachusetts. Michele Bachmann went after Perry not only on mandating treatment for little girls--she also suggested Perry had put the policy in place in exchange for a campaign donation. A release from Bachmann's campaign accused Perry of ""Crony capitalism."" Perry said he was offended. Bachmann wouldn't let it go, saying she was offended for the girls who were forced into treatment. Both Bachmann and Santorum had better performances in this debate than in previous ones. It's just Perry's misfortune that some of their best dance moves were on his head. Even when Perry was taking a principled stand of the kind voters say they want, he ran into trouble. Defending his decision to allow the children of illegal immigrants to attend college--""It doesn't make any difference what the sound of your last name is. That is the American way""--he was booed. Romney said the plan created an incentive for lawbreakers, scoring points (for the moment) with the Tea Party crowd. The political question is that if Perry is taking criticism from the right, who will benefit? Romney is not a conservative darling, and conservatives don't appear to think that Bachmann can actually win. If this all feels a little inside, that's because at times the debate was. The HPV issue touches on whether Perry lives up to the principles he espouses. But it's a little much to hang a man's entire commitment to limited government on one decision. A round of questions that allowed candidates to offer their Fed-bashing talking points also ate up some time on the clock. I'd have much preferred to learn what the participants thought about the collapse of the European banking system. Or perhaps they could have weighed in on the collapse of the Middle East. Israel is being kicked out of Egypt, and Saudi Arabia is pressing the United States to allow Palestinian statehood.  These probably would have elicited sound bites, too, but perhaps we might have learned something about the world view on these issue sets where the new president will have actual control. Only Newt Gingrich seemed to have his eye on the ball when pitched questions of national security. Ron Paul made the case he did last election about why Bin Laden attacked the United States, and he was booed for it. He was simply quoting Bin Laden, but his opponents attacked him as if he shared those views, a fundamental attribution error. The moments of comic relief came from Jon Huntsman. They were not intentional. A reference to the band Nirvana fell flat. Later he made a joke about treason that also thundered against the backboard. He mumbled an aside about Romney's changing positions. He was like a garden hose turned on full, flopping around the front yard. Huntsman wasn't the oddest contribution to the night, however. Discussing the individual mandate, CNN's Blitzer asked Paul a hypothetical question about a young man without insurance who is severely injured and requires hospitalization for six months. Who would pay for his care? Should society ""just let him die?"" ""Yes,"" came a few calls from the crowd. It was chilling. Paul said charities would pick up the tab as they did when he was first practiced medicine, in the pre-Medicare era. The macabre audience response wasn't the first. At the last GOP debate, the mention of Texas' more than 200 executions drew cheers. There are five more debates scheduled for this year. At this rate, they should schedule one for Halloween."

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/1667_times_squarestyle_attacks_every_year.html	"This is adapted from Mueller and Stewart's new  Terror, Security, and Money: Balancing the Risks, Benefits, and Costs of Homeland Security. Read earlier pieces about why the government refuses to subject homeland-security spending to  cost-benefit analysis and how the government overestimates  the risk of terrorism. Is it possible to measure the risk of terrorism? Measuring risk can be difficult, but it is done as a matter of course in such highly charged areas as nuclear power plant safety, airplane safety, and environmental protection. There is adequate information about terrorism: There is plenty of data on how much damage terrorists have been able to do over the decades and about how frequently they attack. The insurance industry has a distinct financial imperative to understand terrorism risks to write policies for it. If the private sector can estimate terrorism risks and is willing to risk its own money on the validity of the estimate, why can't the Department of Homeland Security? A conventional approach to cost-effectiveness compares the costs of security measures with the benefits as tallied in lives saved and damages averted. The benefit of a security measure is a multiplicative composite of three considerations: the probability of a successful attack, the losses sustained in a successful attack, and the reduction in risk furnished by security measures. This product, the benefit, is then compared to the cost of the security measure instituted to attain the benefit. A security measure is cost-effective when the benefit of the measure outweighs the costs of providing the security measures. The interaction of these variables can perhaps be seen in an example. Suppose there is a dangerous curve on a road that results in an accident from time to time. To evaluate measures designed to deal with this problem, the analyst would need to estimate 1) the probabilityof an accident each year under present conditions, 2) the costs of the consequences of the accident (death, injury, property damage), and 3) the degree to which a proposed safety measure lowers the probability of an accident (erecting warning signs) and/or the losses sustained in the accident (erecting a crash barrier). If the benefits of the risk-reduction measures--these three items multiplied together--outweigh their costs, the measures would be deemed cost-effective. These considerations can be usefully wrinkled around a bit in a procedure known as ""break-even analysis"" to calculate how many attacks would have to take place to justify a security expenditure. We apply this approach to the overall increase in domestic homeland security spending by the federal government (including for national intelligence) and by state and local governments. That is, we assume homeland security measures are in place before the attacks continue, and we evaluate the additional funds that have been allocated to homeland security, almost all of it designed, of course, to deal with terrorism, the only hazard that notably inspired increased alarm after the attacks. By 2009, this increase totaled some $75 billion per year. This is a very conservative measure of the degree to which homeland security expenditures have risen since 9/11 because it excludes items such as private sector expenditures, hidden and indirect costs of implementing security-related regulations, and the costs of the terror-related (or terror-impelled) wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. To evaluate the reduction in risk provided by security measures, we need to consider their effectiveness in foiling, deterring, disrupting, or protecting against a terrorist attack. In assessing risk reduction, it is important first to look at the effectiveness of homeland security measures that were in place before 9/11. The 9/11 Commission's report points to a number of failures, but it acknowledges as well that terrorism was already a high priority of the government before 9/11. More pointed is an observation of Michael Sheehan, former New York City deputy commissioner for counterterrorism: ""The most important work in protecting our country since 9/11 has been accomplished with the capacity that was in place when the event happened, not with any of the new capability bought since 9/11. I firmly believe that those huge budget increases have not significantly contributed to our post-9/11 security."" There is another consideration. The tragic events of 9/11 massively heightened the awareness of the public to the threat of terrorism, resulting in extra vigilance that has often resulted in the arrest of terrorists or the foiling of terrorist attempts. In our analysis we will assume that risk reduction caused by the security measures in place before 9/11 and by the extra vigilance of the public after that event reduced risk by 50 percent. This is an exceedingly conservative estimate not only because of Sheehan's observation but because security measures that are at once effective and relatively inexpensive are generally the first to be implemented--for example, one erects warning signs on a potentially dangerous curve in the road before rebuilding the highway. Furthermore, most terrorists (or would-be terrorists) do not show much intelligence, cleverness, resourcefulness, or initiative, and therefore measures to deal with them are relatively inexpensive and are likely to be instituted first. Dealing with the smarter and more capable terrorists is more difficult and expensive, but these people represent, it certainly appears, a decided minority among terrorists. In addition, we will assume that the increase in U.S. expenditures on homeland security since 2001 has been dramatically effective, reducing the remaining risk by an additional 45 percent. Total risk reduction, is generously assumed, then, to be 95 percent with the pre-existing measures and the extra public vigilance responsible for 50 percent of the risk reduction and the enhanced expenditures responsible for the remaining 45 percent. Putting this all together, we find that, in order for the $75 billion in enhanced expenditures on homeland security to be deemed cost-effective under our approach--which substantially biases the consideration toward finding them effective--they would have to deter, prevent, foil, or protect each year against 1,667 otherwise successful attacks of something like the one attempted in Times Square in 2010. In other words, we'd have to foil more than four major attacks every day to justify the spending. We are not arguing that much of homeland security spending is wasteful because we believe there will be no more terrorist attacks. Like crime and vandalism, terrorism will always be a feature of life, and a condition of zero vulnerability is impossible to achieve. However, the frequency and severity of terrorist attacks are generally very low, which makes the benefits of enhanced counterterrorism expenditures of a trillion dollars since 9/11 challenging, to say the least, to justify by any rational and accepted standard of cost-benefit analysis. Our findings dealing with the total enhanced homeland security expenditures should not be taken to suggest that all security measures necessarily fail to be cost-effective: There may be specific measures that are cost-effective. But each should be subjected to the kind of risk analysis we have applied to the overall increases in expenditure. We have done so for several specific measures. It appears, for example, that the protection of a standard office-type building would be cost-effective only if the likelihood of a sizable terrorist attack on the building is 1,000 times greater than it is at present. Something similar holds for the protection of bridges. On the other hand, hardening cockpit doors may be cost-effective, though the provision for air marshals on the planes decidedly is not. The cost-effectiveness of full-body scanners is questionable at best. Overall, by far the most cost-effective counterterrorism measure is to refrain from overreacting. We have assessed the hazard terrorism poses under present conditions--which include, of course, the existence of counterterrorism measures specifically designed to reduce that hazard. The analysis suggests that additional efforts to reduce its likelihood are scarcely justified. It is possible, of course, that any relaxation in these measures will increase the terrorism hazard, that the counterterrorism effort is the reason for the low-hazard terrorism currently present. However, in order for the terrorism risk to border on becoming ""unacceptable"" by established risk conventions, the number of fatalities from all forms of terrorism in the United States would have to increase 35-fold, equivalent to experiencing attacks as devastating as those on 9/11 at least once a year or 18 Oklahoma City bombings every year. Even if all the (mostly embryonic and in many cases moronic) terrorist plots exposed since 9/11 in the United States had been successfully carried out, their likely consequences would have been much lower. Indeed, as noted earlier, the number of people killed by terrorists throughout the world outside (and sometimes within) war zones both before and after 2001 generally registers at far below that number. We have been using ""historical"" data here, and these suggest the chances an American will perish at the hands of a terrorist are about one in 3.5 million per year. However, although there is no guarantee that the terrorism frequencies of the past will necessarily persist into the future, there seems to be little evidence terrorists are becoming any more destructive, particularly in the West. In fact, as discussed earlier, according both to official and prominent academic accounts, the levels of violence likely to be committed by Islamist extremists within Western countries seems, if anything to be in decline as fears about large, sophisticated attacks have been replaced by fears concerning tiny conspiracies, lone wolves, and one-off attackers. Those who wish to discount such arguments and projections need to demonstrate why they think terrorists will suddenly get their act together and inflict massively increased violence, visiting savage discontinuities on the historical data series. Risk reduction measures that produce little or no net benefit to society or produce it at a very high cost cannot be justified on rational life-safety and economic grounds: They are not only irresponsible, but, essentially, immoral. When we spend resources to save lives at a high cost, we forgo the opportunity to spend those same resources on regulations and processes that can save more lives at the same cost, or even at a lower one. Homeland security expenditure invested in a wide range of more cost-effective risk reduction programs like flood protection, vaccination and screening, vehicle and road safety, health care, nutritional programs, and occupational health and safety would likely result in far more significant benefits to society."

The reporters followed, quickly overwhelming the space they'd been given. Members of the protest group Code Pink, which materializes whenever more than three cameras are placed on tripods, took their seats and showed off their ""billionaire"" garb--top hat, evening gown, stacks of funny money. The House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing room was officially open for the first meeting of the supercommittee. Fine: Technically, it's not the ""supercommittee."" It's the Special Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction. Its members differ on the adjectives and powers they use to describe it. When Ohio's Republican Sen. Rob Portman leans into his microphone, he calls it ""extraordinary."" It had better be. The committeeis tasked to cut $1.5 trillion or more from the next 10 years of budgets. If it fails, that much money will be automatically cut from the budgets, willy-nilly, as if hacked off by a dull ax. The supermembers appear to take their responsibilities seriously, judging by their effort to find and deliver the best cliche. ""The late Spanish philosopher George Santayana,"" says Republican co-chair Rep. Jeb Hensarling, ""once said that those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it."" ""The committee members have refrained from drawing lines in the sand,"" adds Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. She also says that they will not be ""boxed in or pigeonholed by special interest groups,"" that they will be inspired by ""people from all walks of life,"" and that they are ""not starting from scratch."" The supermembers wish to remind voters, who may have forgotten the horror of the debt-ceiling showdown, how important their committee is. S&P has downgraded the U.S. credit rating. Stock markets across the world are jittery. Faith in government is at all-time lows. Portman brings his own spin. ""The truth,"" he says, is that ""nothing else has worked."" And the supercommittee might not fail! Really, it might not. The combination of back-slapping negotiations and threats of automatic cuts has been tried before. Sort of. In the 1980s, when the idea came out of another joint commission, sequestration looked like a nice incentive for Democrats and Republicans to agree on budget deals. But the Supreme Court challenged the way they'd devised it, and future Congresses just ignored it. The difficult reality can wait for the backroom. Today was the day for dreams. Each of the committee's 12 members fantasizes about a deal that would be both 1) happily bipartisan and 2) exactly what they wanted. ""We can grow by expanding energy production,"" says Republican Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee, ""by harnessing our nation's great resources."" Message: Drill here, legalize light bulbs now. ""It's not just spending we need to look at,"" says Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ""It's also revenues."" Message: We can raise taxes, or at least nuke some loopholes. ""Tweaks and one-time savings could add up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years,"" says Portman. ""Yet they would leave in place soaring future deficits caused by unreformed entitlements."" Message: We should do an end-run around Congress to raise the Social Security retirement age. All of a sudden, there is a loud din outside the room as 20-odd protesters start screaming call-and-response slogans. ""What do we want? Jobs! When do we need them? Now! Jobs, not cuts!"" The Code Pink protesters leap from their chairs to join the protest. The security staff can't keep the noise out of the room, because the cords piping audio and video out of the room have been duct-taped to the threshold of the door. Republican Rep. Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who has talked about starting tax reform in the supercommittee, tries to speak. ""By reducing the burden--"" ""Jobs now!"" ""We can get our economy back on track.""""Jobs now!"" Camp gives up until the room is cleared. There is bipartisan socializing. John Kerry chats with Pat Toomey. Upton jokes with James Clyburn. The protest ends with no arrests--""You rock!"" says an organizer to his crowd of underemployed shouters--and the committee picks back up for more speeches and a vote on the rules. By noon, the work, if public speeches can be called that, is done. Chris Van Hollen warns that there are only 77 days to power this through, and the members scatter. Toomey tells me he's ""cautiously optimistic."" Murray, who's being followed by at least 20 reporters, says that when it comes to taxes, ""everything is on the table."" Kyl, the Senate minority whip who's retiring next year, finds his way over to another event. The Foreign Policy Initiative, the group co-founded by Bill Kristol to keep Congress hawkish in the Obama era, brings him in for a session about defense spending. Will there be cuts? ""I'm off the committee if we're going to talk about further defense spending,"" he says. The 77 days have begun."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/the_duel.html	"Going into Rick Perry's first presidential debate the question was whether he would play it safe or shoot from the hip. He did neither. He used both hands and took careful aim. He went after Mitt Romney for his jobs record, Ron Paul for his lack of support for Ronald Reagan, Karl Rove for being over the top, Dick Cheney for defending the bankrupt Social Security system, and President Obama for being everything from a big-government meddler to an ""abject liar."" The Republican race has suddenly gotten intense and exciting. Tonight's debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., revealed disagreements--some ideological, some personal--about how to fix health care, the talents required to revive the economy, and the best way to transform Social Security. Throughout, the candidates debated which attributes--candor, restraint, or reason--make the best conservative leader and whether such a leader could get elected in a general election. Perry kept shooting, sometimes hitting his targets and sometimes missing. For a first debate performance, he did pretty well, but that doesn't count for much. He's the front-runner, which means he was expected to be on top from the very first question. He clearly came prepared not just to offer his smaller-government pitch but also to deliver opposition research about his opponents. Almost immediately, the debate turned into a fracas between Romney and Perry over their jobs records. ""Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt,"" Perry said. His defense of his doubts about global warming and the death penalty in Texas will delight conservatives. (When Brian Williams of NBC mentioned that 234 people had been executed in Texas, the audience applauded--which they did not do when Perry credited Obama with ordering the operation to kill Bin Laden.) Voters looking for a strong, tell-it-like-it-is candidate saw plenty to like in Perry. There were clumps of flour in the batter though. He may have set himself up for long-term problems with his position on Social Security. Asked about his claim in his book that the program was all but unconstitutional and a Ponzi scheme, he both ducked and doubled down. He shifted away from his writings by arguing that the Ponzi scheme is merely the current state of the system, but he also reiterated the ""ponzi scheme characterization"" and said that the program was a ""monstrous lie,"" arguing that truth-telling was a job requirement: ""Maybe it's time to have some provocative language in this country."" Romney didn't let that pass, saying that such language would help Obama get re-elected. Romney said he wouldn't say such a thing about Social Security, because Americans depend on the program--by which he meant, Voters of Florida, please elect me. Afterward, Romney's top strategist, Stuart Stevens, made it clear their campaign hope to make Perry eat those remarks morning, noon, and night. ""It's disqualifying,"" he said of Perry's remarks. ""No one can get elected in a general election saying that about Social Security."" Jon Huntsman also hinted about Perry's electability, arguing that his positions on global warming and evolution would make him a toxic general-election candidate unable to win independent voters. ""By making comments that basically don't reflect the reality of the situation, we turn people off."" Mitt Romney had survived the first few debates by standing in place. Today he came with new tactics. He joined the jobs battle pointing out with some specificity why Perry's Republican legislature and Supreme Court and an energy boom make it easier for him to govern. ""Those are wonderful things, but Governor Perry doesn't believe that he created those things. If he tried to say that, well, it would be like Al Gore saying he invented the Internet."" Romney was strongest when making the case for his own private-sector resume. Romney highlighted his skills as a turnaround expert (where have I heard that before?) and explained why that was different than being a ""career politician."" Romney also showed the benefits of having run for president before. When Perry was on the defensive for signing an executive order requiring young girls to get inoculated against HPV, Romney let him off the hook. He said he assumed Perry's ""heart was in the right place."" He then turned to attack Obama. It showed discipline, generosity, and elan gained from experience. What of Michele Bachmann and the others on stage? They aren't going to get the nomination. That doesn't mean they can't shape the race or contribute ideas, but with three governors running--all of whom have strong leadership credentials--the GOP is not going to replace a president with no executive experience with someone like Bachmann, who has almost none. Which brings us to that third governor, Huntsman. He came alive in this debate. He argued that his jobs record was better than either Romney or Perry and that he had put in place a better health care plan in Utah than either Massachusetts or Texas. He was far more compelling on the debate stage than he was last debate, but he still has to find a way to break into the major grapple going on between Romney and Perry. Early in the evening Newt Gingrich complained when the moderators tried to get him to engage in the debate over whether Romney or Perry has a better health care record. ""I'm frankly not interested in your efforts to get Republicans fighting each other,"" Gingrich said. ""Whoever the nominee is, we're all for defeating Barack Obama."" That's a shame, because Gingrich has interesting views on health care, and it would have been useful to air them. There are four more debates in the next six weeks. Let's hope that Gingrich's opponents, like the voters, don't listen to him and continue to actually debate each other. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/does_the_united_states_spend_too_much_on_homeland_security.html	"This is adapted from Mueller and Stewart's new  Terror, Security, and Money: Balancing the Risks, Benefits, and Costs of Homeland Security. Check back tomorrow for a second excerpt about why the government always overestimates the risk of terrorism, and the day after for a final article on how there would need to be 1,667 Times Square-style attacks every year to justify current homeland security spending. In seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of the massive increases in homeland security expenditures since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the common and urgent query has been, ""Are we safer?"" This, however, is the wrong question. Of course we are ""safer""--the posting of a single security guard at one building's entrance enhances safety, however microscopically. The correct question is, ""Are the gains in security worth the funds expended?"" The key fact is this: At present rates (and including 9/11 in the count), the likelihood a resident of the United States will perish at the hands of a terrorist is 1 in 3.5 million per year. And the key question, one almost never broached, is this: How much should we be willing to pay to make that likelihood even lower? We have, in fact, paid--or been willing to pay--a lot. In the years immediately following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 on Washington and New York, it was understandable that there was a tendency to fashion policy and to expend funds in haste and confusion, and maybe even hysteria, on homeland security. After all, intelligence was estimating at the time that there were as many as 5,000 al-Qaeda operatives at large in the country, and as New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani reflected later, ""Anybody, any one of these security experts, including myself, would have told you on September 11, 2001, we're looking at dozens and dozens and multi-years of attacks like this."" The intelligence claims and the anxieties of Giuliani and other ""security experts"" have clearly proved, putting it mildly, to be unjustified. In the frantic interim, however, the U.S. government increased its expenditures for dealing with terrorism massively. At the 10th anniversary of 9/11, federal expenditures on domestic homeland security have increased by some $360 billion over those in place in 2001. Moreover, federal national intelligence expenditures aimed at defeating terrorists at home and abroad have gone up by $110 billion, while state, local, and private sector expenditures have increased by $200 billion more. And the vast majority of this increase, of course, has been driven by much heightened fears of terrorism, not by growing concerns about other hazards. Tallying all these expenditures and adding in opportunity costs--but leaving out the costs of the terrorism-related (or terrorism-determined) wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and quite a few other items that might be included--the increase in expenditures on domestic homeland security over the decade exceeds $1 trillion. See the following table. This has not been enough to move the country into bankruptcy, Osama Bin Laden's stated goal after 9/11, but it clearly adds up to real money, even by Washington standards. In our book, we apply conventional cost-benefit and risk analytic approaches to this massive increase in expenditures in an effort to provide an answer to the key question. These approaches have been recommended for many years by the United States Office of Management and Budget, and they are routinely used by such agencies as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Federal Aviation Administration. In 2004 the 9/11 Commission specifically called on the government to apply these approaches to assess the risks and cost-effectiveness of security measures put in place to deal with terrorism. However, it appears that this simply has not been done. Upon taking office in 2005, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff did strongly advocate a risk-based approach, insisting that the department ""must base its work on priorities driven by risk."" Yet, a year later, when DHS expenditures had increased by some $135 billion beyond those already in place in 2001 and when the department had become the government's largest non-military bureaucracy, one of its senior economists wistfully noted, ""We really don't know a whole lot about the overall costs and benefits of homeland security."" By 2007, RAND President James Thomson was contending that most DHS programs are implemented, ""with little or no evaluation"" of their performance or effectiveness, and the agency ""receives little analytical advice on issues of policy, program, and budget."" And, after an exhaustive assessment, the Congressional Research Service concluded at the same time that DHS simply could not answer the ""central question"" about the ""rate of return, as defined by quantifiable and empirical risk reductions"" on its expenditure. Indeed, at times DHS has ignored specific calls by other government agencies to conduct risk assessments. In 2010, the department began deploying full-body scanners at airports, a technology that will cost $1.2 billion per year. The Government Accountability Office specifically declared conducting a cost-benefit analysis of this new technology to be ""important."" As far as we can see, no such study was conducted. Or there was GAO's request that DHS conduct a full cost-benefit analysis of the extremely costly process of scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound containers. To do such an analysis would require the dedicated work of a few skilled analysts for a few months or possibly a year. Yet, DHS replied that, although it agreed that such a study would help to ""frame the discussion and better inform Congress,"" to actually carry it out ""would place significant burdens on agency resources."" Clearly, DHS focuses all or almost all of its analyses on the contemplation of the consequences of a terrorist attack while substantially ignoring the equally important likelihood component of risk assessment as well as the key issue of risk reduction. Moreover, we have been able to find no reference whatever to the likelihood of a terrorist attack beyond rather vague references such as ""high,"" ""imminent,"" ""dynamic,"" ""persistent,"" and ""emerging."" In general, risk assessment seems to be simply a process of identifying a potential source of harm and then trying to do something about it without evaluating whether the new measures reduce risk sufficiently to justify their costs. This conclusion was strongly supported by a 2010 report of the National Academy of Science. Requested by Congress to assess the activities of the Department of Homeland Security, a committee worked for nearly two years on the project and came up with some striking conclusions. Except for the analysis of natural disasters, the committee ""did not find any DHS risk analysis capabilities and methods that are yet adequate for supporting DHS decision making,"" and observed that ""little effective attention was paid to the features of the risk problem that are fundamental."" Therefore, it concluded, ""only low confidence should be placed in most of the risk analyses conducted by DHS."" It also found an ""absence of documentation"" with the result that it sometimes had to infer details about DHS risk modeling. Indeed, in some cases it was unable to determine what problem was being addressed. It also found ""a pattern"" of ""trusting numbers that are highly uncertain."" And, concluded the committee rather glumly, ""it is not yet clear that DHS is on a trajectory for development of methods and capability that is sufficient to ensure reliable risk analyses"": although it found that ""there are people at DHS who are aware of these current limitations,"" it ""did not hear of efforts to remedy them."" Overall, it seems, security concerns that happen to rise to the top of the agenda are serviced without much in the way of full evaluation--security trumps economics, as one insider puts it--and such key issues as acceptable risk are rarely discussed while extravagant worst-case scenario thinking dominates, and frequently savagely distorts, the discussion. It is clearly time to examine massive homeland security expenditures in a careful and systematic way, applying the kind of analytic risk management approaches emphasizing cost-benefit analysis and determinations of acceptable and unacceptable risks that are routinely required of other governmental agencies and that have been standard coin for policy decision-making for decades throughout the world when determining regulations even in such highly charged and politicized decisions as those regarding where to situate nuclear power plants, how to dispose of toxic waste, and how to control pollution--decisions that engage the interests and passions of multiple groups. Political and emotional conditions do supply an understandable excuse for expending money, but not a valid one, and they do not relieve officials of the responsibility of seeking to expend public funds wisely. It is particularly important to do so with homeland security expenditures. They deal not with bridges to nowhere or with crop subsidies, but with public safety--or domestic tranquillity--the central, fundamental reason for the existence of government in the first place. It is imperative that decisions be made sensibly and responsibly in this area. To be irrational with your own money may be to be foolhardy, to give in to guilty pleasure, or to wallow in caprice. But to be irrational with other people's money, particularly where public safety is the issue, is to be irresponsible, to betray an essential trust. In the end, it becomes a dereliction of duty that cannot be justified by political pressure, bureaucratic constraints, or emotional drives.

Here is how Jon Huntsman Jr. tries: He climbs out of a black SUV to catch the last weekend of the outdoor festival, and sees half a dozen curious voters waiting outside the restaurant Shibley's at the Pier. He is wearing black Ray Bans, black-and-gold sneakers, and trim black jeans. You could say he looked like he just walked out of an Annie Leibovitz shoot, but you'd be wrong: That photo shoot was weeks ago. Today, he's meeting swing voters who love him instantly. ""I'm pleased that you're civil,"" says Joe Polidoro, a pharmaceuticals salesman who'd brought his young daughter Stephanie to meet Huntsman. ""You make sense, compared to some of your competitors."" Huntsman finishes the script. ""Well, this country is ready for a common sense conversation. A common conversation based on practical, real-world solutions. You know, like the kind you do as governor. That's where we are. You'll like the economic plan we've put together."" He tousles Stephanie's hair. ""Stephanie will like it in particular, because it addresses the concerns of your generation! So you're not so saddled with debt."" The former governor of Utah and ambassador to China--he is quicker to mention the first job than the second--walks on. Polidoro explains just what he likes about Huntsman. ""I think he's smarter than the others,"" he says. ""He makes sense. I mean, look who else you've got out there--Rick Perry, he wants to secede from the country! I thought that was settled by the Supreme Court in the 19th century. You can't secede from the country."" So he doesn't like Perry, but he likes Huntsman. What other Republicans does he like? ""I voted for Obama last time,"" he says. ""The Republicans aren't giving him time to try to get us out of this [mess]. It's really a disgrace."" So, if the election came down to Huntsman or Obama, who would he vote for? Polidoro thinks about it for a couple seconds. ""I'd probably vote for Obama,"" he says. In no time at all, I've met the typical Jon Huntsman voter. It's been three days since  Huntsman replaced his New Hampshire state director, two weeks since a poll showed his campaign in the state tied with those of Herman Cain and ""Some Other Candidate."" But Huntsman's just launched a ""media blitz""--the actual term used by his campaign--and made his obvious campaign strategy even more explicit. He explains to some voters who are standing a few feet away from the departing Polidoro. ""We've got a divide and conquer strategy,"" Huntsman says. ""There are always going to be political extremes. Ten, fifteen percent on the right. Ten, fifteen percent on the other side."" It's a simple theory. I will now try to make it more complicated:"	Can Huntsman win New Hampshire?

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/im_still_here.html	"MANCHESTER, N.H.--""As much as the media would try to ignore the fact,"" says Sarah Palin, ""it was Tea Party Americans who won the November election!"" This is what the media ignoring the Tea Party looks like: Palin is speaking to a crowd of maybe 700 people. Every protester holding a reasonably witty or weird sign--or a sign with Sarah Palin's visage on it--is being interviewed by a reporter. There are at least 50 of us looking for quotes. CNN is taking the event live, and the Tea Party Express, which put on the event, is raffling tickets to the presidential debate it's going to co-sponsor in seven days with that network. Palin can't acknowledge this. The media is still lying. It's still missing the point. The point is whatever she and Tea Party activists say it is. ""You already withstood the wrath, and the disdain, and the lies, from the media,"" says Palin, ""and the permanent political class looking down on us, mocking us, makin' things up about us!"" Among the things we are making up, apparently, is a dispute between Palin and some fellow Republicans. You can see where we got the idea. On Saturday, with even more reporters in tow, Palin spoke in Indianola, Iowa, where some of her fans hoped she'd announce a presidential campaign. She didn't, but she did go after some of the Republicans who'd made the race. ""Some GOP candidates also raised mammoth amounts of cash,"" she'd said in Iowa, ""and we need to ask them, too: What, if anything, do their donors expect in return for their 'investments?' We need to know this because our country can't afford more trillion-dollar 'thank you' notes to campaign backers."" She said something else that reporters--those mendacious ignore-ers of the Tea Party--had quoted all weekend. ""It's not enough to just change up the uniform. If we don't change the team and the game plan, we won't save our country."" Today, a different take: ""We patriots should not focus on petty political squabbles and media sound bites."" Those sound bites! That media! What was their problem, anyway? The people who showed up to see Palin were not checking her speech for consistency. They realized that they were watching someone who will never become president of the United States-sort of a departure in New Hampshire. The reasons they gave for that realization ranged from blaming the media, blaming Palin, or discovering that they liked some other candidates more than her. Like her, though, the media rage was most important. The press had ruined Palin's image in a way that it never would have, or could have, ruined Barack Obama's. ""I never thought George W. Bush was lying to me,"" says one activist, John Miller. ""This guy, I feel like he's lying to me every time he talks."" The media won't report the truth, he says, on stories like the EPA's implementation of cap and trade even after that legislation croaked in the Senate. (This isn't quite happening.) Bill Hudak, a Republican candidate for Congress in Massachusetts, watches Palin closely and gets backstage to meet her when she finishes. When he ran in 2010, he says, he was pilloried by the media, so he gets what's happening to her. ""It's very personality-based with her,"" he says. ""Liberals attack her because she's a threat."" True: Liberals attack Palin from every angle. She looks less like a candidate than she ever has, but she irritates them like no one else. A retiree named Jane Davis-she worked for Manchester's legendary Merrimack Diner before it shuttered-sidles up to me during the speech to inform me of how uncomfortable she is. ""I told the cops that if they find me dead, Palin did it,"" she says. She also says that she wants Palin to be the GOP's nominee, because she'd be so easily defeated. ""Her or Bachmann, if it's up to me."" This combination-conservative quasi-martyrdom, liberal obsession-means that Palin gets a national audience for everything she says. What is she using it for, if she doesn't run? It's hard to tell in Manchester, even if you discount the weird walkback from the Iowa speech. Palin makes no mention of the Democratic Party, only Washington elites. (In Iowa, it was ""Georgetown."") This is the sort of blurry political language that Democrats whine about when Barack Obama uses it, saying he's not explaining what the political stakes are. Here, as in Iowa, she calls for the crowd to ""refudiate crony capitalism."" That's a bugaboo that voters know with a name that sticks like peanut butter. But who, specifically, is practicing it? ""Perry's up to his eyeballs in it,"" says Fran Wurtele, listening intently. That's the essence of a good attack--the crowd knows whose house to storm with pitchforks before you hand them the maps. As much as Palin staggers over the map, the attack points out just how many openings Barack Obama's Democrats have made for the GOP. Americans don't instinctively want to blame ""corporations"" for what's gone wrong, but they can blame government-business collusion. And they're angry when they think that Barack Obama is scaring jobs away by criticizing business--high corporate profits don't calm them down any. ""I warn ya that the cynics, the elites, they're gonna keep mocking you,"" she says. ""They're gonna keep making things up about independent, conscientious Americans just concerned with protecting our Constitution, not letting our country go bankrupt. They're gonna keep mocking you. But you know what? Throughout history, the cynics, the naysayers, they always denounce those who have stood for truth and fought for what is right. When Abe Lincoln led, they mocked him and ridiculed him. It was the elites of his day saying that he was a clown, a hick, a fool that was unfit for office!"" Is this a hint? No: The crowd chants ""Run, Sarah, Run!"" and she only smiles and says ""I appreciate your encouragement."" She leaves the stage, shakes some hands and signs some books, then dives into a waiting SUV. A short walk away, there are slightly disappointed faces among some Palin fans. The New Hampshire branch of Organize4Palin, an ad hoc draft-her group, has teamed up with Students4Palin to staff a booth with Palin lit and ads for the little-watched Palin documentary The Undefeated. It would have been nice for Palin to come by and see them, they say. But they get it. ""She wants to run and be beholden to no one,"" says O4P's Steve Brennan. And if she doesn't run? Well, would she be saying anything different?"	New Hampshire Tea Party rally: Palin writes the GOP's campaign theme.	['Obama']	[]
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/angler_doglover_veep.html	"""From our first encounter,"" writes Dick Cheney, ""when I woke him up by stepping on him, Cyrano and I became close friends."" Cyrano is--sorry, was--a beloved family dog, a basset hound, accepted by the family when Cheney was working at President Richard Nixon's Office of Economic Opportunity. ""I took him along when the girls and I went on our Civil War excursions,"" writes Cheney. ""I think that Cyrano and I had an understanding."" The last time a retired vice president wrote a memoir, when Dan Quayle gifted the airport book-buyer with Standing Firm, the goal was to prove he was serious. That's not Cheney's problem. The purpose of Cheney's memoir, In My Time, is to prove he is human. So the reader of  In My Time gets a few stories about dogs. He gets snapshots of Cheney and his mentor, Donald Rumsfeld, having wacky adventures. There was the time they joined Elliot Richardson on a trip to Egypt, then rode camels ""in dark business suits"" to see the pyramids. There was the time Cheney and Rumsfeld left the office, moved past a protest at the reflecting pool that looked like an outtake from Hair, and noticed that one of the bare-breasted protesters actually worked in their office. These little stories are meant to humanize Cheney, which is necessary, because no one else is going to accept that mission. The first reviews of In My Time have focused on whether the former veep is lying his head off. Dahlia Lithwick looked into Cheney's new and reheated arguments about whether the Bush administration acted legally in the war on terror, and concluded that ""the reason Cheney keeps saying that torture is 'legal' is because he has a clutch of worthless legal memoranda saying so."" So: Let's make the naive assumption that the book's audience is larger than people who already adore the veep or people who want to see their names in the index. What does everybody else learn? Cheney had wanted to be an academic. He came to Washington on a political science scholarship, and his University of Wisconsin advisers were not keen on his sabbatical from academia. ""I was pretty sure that real-world experience would be an asset whether I was doing research or in the classroom,"" he writes. ""But what did I know about how the academic world worked?"" Academics: They were wrong long before they started attacking his views of executive-branch power. Cheney heads to Washington. His darkest suspicions are confirmed. Tasked with carrying out Nixon's price-control policy, he concludes that the federal government can't manage the economy and shouldn't try. He then becomes President Gerald Ford's chief of staff and understands the folly of the ""Whip Inflation Now"" campaign before Ford does. Story by story (the narrative jumps around a bit), Cheney learns that executive power works, and Congress doesn't. In 1987, Cheney--who rises to minority whip after only a few terms in the House--is selected for the joint committee investigating Iran-Contra. He's disappointed that the Reagan administration didn't consult Congress; he ignores the fact that Reagan lied about what he knew. The lesson he takes is that the people who were at fault were, like Oliver North, blessed with ""unabashed patriotism."" He concludes that the administration had a kind of excuse: It had to contend with ""congressional vacillation and uncertainty about our policies in Central America."" What does this have to do with Cheney's anecdotes about his family, friends and dogs? The popular understanding of the veep, starting some time after the rationale for the Iraq War collapsed, was that he marched heartlessly, relentlessly toward war, toward more surveillance, toward a national security state. Observers came up with theories why Ford's chief of staff, George H.W. Bush's secretary of defense, the man who had balked at creating a quagmire in 1991 by deposing Saddam Hussein, had become so unreasonable. The closest he gets to a mea culpa here is when he explains why he said, in May 2005, that the Iraq insurgents were ""in the last throes"" before defeat. ""I believed they were,"" writes Cheney. ""At the end of the day, it's important to remember that the ultimate blame for the violence and bloodshed in Iraq after liberation lies with those who created it."" The implication of what Cheney writes there is that the people who scorched him for ""last throes"" weren't angry enough at the insurgents. That's how the human stories connect to the war stories. He was reacting like any patriotic American, any father, would react to what was happening. His opponents weren't. So Cheney settles scores. The anecdotes become a little less relatable, a little more bitter. He reminisces about the 2000 convention. ""I'll never forget,"" he writes, ""looking out into the vast crowd and seeing George Schultz, a former secretary of state and one of America's most dignified elder statesman, swaying back and forth and singing, ""Hey hey hey, goodbye!"" He remembers when George W. Bush called then-New York Times reporter Adam Clymer a ""major league asshole,"" and Cheney added ""big time"" to sweeten the insult. ""The only lasting result,"" he writes, ""was that I became known as 'Big Time' around campaign headquarters and beyond."" He settles more scores with Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Brent Scowcroft, and the others who crossed him. Scowcroft, the realist whose comments would appear again and again in Cheney's-lost-it stories, gets the most unemotional of the takedowns. ""Brent was quoted later saying he believed I had changed since we'd worked together in the first Bush administration,"" Cheney writes. ""In reality, what had happened was that after an attack on the homeland that had killed three thousand people, the world had changed."""

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/every_day_is_a_rainy_day.html	"If Michele Bachmann is right, and God plagued the land with earthquakes and hurricanes to send us a political message, then He must want us to pay attention to Eric Cantor. The 5.8 earthquake that rattled much of the Mid-Atlantic started in Mineral, Va., a small town in the majority leader's district. Hurricane Irene terrorized tourists, residents, and anchormen all over the region, and it did real damage to the stretch of eastern Virginia that sends Cantor to Congress. Cantor toured his district. He saw the damage. He got asked whether Republicans would help rebuild, and then he made Democratic heads explode. ""We will find the money if there is a need for additional money,"" Cantor told Fox News on Monday. ""But those monies are not unlimited, and we have said we have to offset that which has already been funded."" Offsets? Really? For a natural disaster? Yes, really. Cantor had already said that money to restore Joplin, Mo., from devastating tornadoes had to be paid for with cuts, not loans. Even Missouri Republicans had agreed with him. Cantor's not making a mistake when he mused about cuts-for-relief in his own district. He's sounding like former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who said in 2008--correctly!--that a crisis was an ""opportunity to do things that you could not do before."" Before, Republicans couldn't even have this argument. In 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, House and Senate conservatives suggested that any aid to the Gulf Coast had to be matched by cuts. The plan that got the furthest came from a team of Senate hard-liners who called for a delay in the Medicare Part D benefit and a 5 percent cut across the board to everything but Homeland Security and Defense spending. (Since 2002, FEMA--and its pricey insurance mandates--has been part of DHS.) ""We need to separate those things that we must do from those that we would like to do,"" Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., said. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said it was a perfect time to stop the $230 million ""bridge to nowhere."" Why let a good crisis go to waste? The late Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, who kind of wanted that bridge, dismissed his colleagues as ""people looking for the headlines."" He ran the appropriations committee in the Senate. Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay said outright that it would be ""worth borrowing"" to avoid cuts and that ""taking spending from infrastructure spending would undermine our ability to create the environment for a good economy."" He effectively ran the House. The GOP's cuts-for-Katrina insurgency died in the nursery. That was six years ago. The Republicans who doubted DeMint have all been sidelined. The public that shuddered at cuts-for-Katrina grew up and learned about how FEMA money and relief funds were shelved or wasted. (We know it was more than $1 billion.) According to former staff, DeLay's jitters had a lot to do with the moral panic about how the government had failed and a sense that it would have been bad politics to cut against that. Compare 2005 to now: 1,464 deaths to 24 deaths. In 2005, the estimated cost of Katrina recovery was as high as $200 billion; the final cost was $122 billion. In 2011, the Kinetic Analysis Corporation--one of the independent groups that estimates this stuff--has cut its initial $20 billion damage estimate for Irene to between $5 billion and $10 billion. The people who fled New York and the Jersey shore and low-lying parts of Vermont, the Washingtonians waiting for Pepco to restore their damn electricity already, breathe deeply and think: This is horrible, but it could have been worse. That sets up Cantor's Republicans for the coming cuts-for-Irene fight. How will it work? Well, we don't know yet just how much the disaster is going to cost. We do know that the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund is running dry. That's a symptom of Congress' not-quite-new inability to pass anything on time; more directly, it's a side effect of the bill that would fill up the fund, the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill of 2012, sitting in limbo after passing the House. Democrats say that they'll take up the bill as soon as Congress returns. (Let's pause for a moment and remember the afternoon, right after the S&P downgrade, when a couple of members suggested that Congress return right away, then mumbled something and went on vacation.) Their problem: Republicans had already started on the cuts-for-aid strategy when they wrote the bill, and the disaster relief would be paid for with cuts to the Coast Guard, the INS, and other things that sound bad when you actually have to write them down. What will be cut in order to pay for Irene? Sorry, we don't know. If FEMA asks for a supplemental funding bill, we'll have that fight. Coburn's still in the Senate, there's no shortage of projects he thinks we can cut, and some cuts can be so back-loaded that they don't touch infrastructure funding. ""Anything could be cut,"" says Coburn's communications director, John Hart. ""We've identified $9 trillion in cuts. Part of the Oklahoma City bombing disaster money was offset in the 1990s."" And if we're lucky, this will be a sideshow. The debt deal that voters so adore created a literal rainy day fund, which would be filled up annually with enough cash to pay for disasters, based on an average of what the last 10 years of disasters ended up costing. Yes: Congress actually passed this. So let's adjust our outrage-o-meters. Cuts-for-aid is the new normal. What else is new? Well, having so many disasters handed over to FEMA is new. According to Matt Mayer, who worked at DHS from March 2004 to May 2006 and now runs the conservative Buckeye Institute, President Obama has broken the record for most disaster declarations in one year. He broke the record before the earthquake or the hurricane hit. There have been 160 declarations so far in 2011; there were 106 during the entire presidency of Dwight Eisenhower. Those declarations commit FEMA to spending money for preparation even when the disaster peters out completely. Obama is not responsible for this, either. ""The FEMA directors when I was there, under Bush, were also status quo guys,"" says Mayer. ""Why? I'd refer you back to what [former Clinton FEMA director] James Lee Witt said: Disasters are inherently political events."" Mayer doesn't have to persuade voters to like him, so he can go where Cantor fears to tread. The post-Irene slap fight will be about what can be cut in order to pay for disaster aid. The fight Congress is putting off is whether the government, with its new, creaky-sounding relief fund, and with a House that wants to starve the government, can keep getting involved in disasters at the current rate."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/the_partys_over.html	"Jamie Radtke was supposed to be the Tea Party's next giant-killer. She'd put together the biggest movement convention ever, a two-day gathering in Richmond, Va., under the banner of her Virginia Tea Party Patriots. When George Allen took the stage, subliminally begging the grassroots to support his comeback bid for Senate, the irony was just too sweet: Radtke used to work for this guy, and now he was kowtowing to her. And so, two days after Christmas 2010, Radtke announced her Senate campaign. It was national news for reporters looking for the next Christine O'Donnell, the next Joe Miller, the next Sharron Angle. When three freshmen senators launched the Tea Party Caucus in January 2011, she scored an invite to speak at the meeting. Rand Paul talked for five minutes. She talked for seven. In short order she started appearing, and talking, at all sorts of Tea Party events in Washington. She raised more than $250,000--not much, only one-tenth as much as Allen, but not fringe candidate money. So, how's the giant-killing quest going? Terribly. Earlier this month, a Public Policy Polling survey gave Allen a 68 percent-to-6 percent lead over Radtke, with the rest of the vote split among more marginal candidates. Tea Party activists in the state say they've been focused on this year's state elections, and anyway, she's not unifying the movement. On Wednesday, the Radtke campaign euthanized its old win-over-the-tastemakers strategy by attacking RedState blogger Erick Erickson and claiming that he hadn't done enough to promote her. Not so, said Erickson: He endorsed her, and then she proceeded to induce comas whenever she talked to activists, and then she screwed him over. And that's one measure of how the next round of Tea Party challenges is going. Another: Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who actually tied Sen. Orrin Hatch in some polls of Utah Republicans, just announced he was taking a pass on the campaign. Another: Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, whom Erickson says is now the ripest Tea Party target for 2012, is waiting to see whether a conservative state senator will jump into his primary, split up the conservative vote, and help him win. Another? Sure, why not. Sen. Olympia Snowe may be beatable in Maine, but she's only got to beat a fractured field of nobodies. Are we witnessing the end of the Tea Party's electoral rebellion? Did the GOP civil war reach Appomattox, and nobody noticed? Those questions assume that the Tea Party's goal was to purge Republicans in primaries. That was just one of the movement's goals, and we're finding out that, yes, it may have run its course. In 2010, when they wanted to take out Republicans, the Tea Party had relatively easy pickings. Their three biggest victories were in Delaware, Alaska, and Utah. Delaware and Alaska are, respectively, the 45th and 47th most populous states. Only 57,582 Republicans voted in the Christine O'Donnell-Mike Castle primary; only 109,750 voted in the Joe Miller-Lisa Murkowski primary. Utah nominates all candidates at party conventions, which put Sen. Bob Bennett's fate at the hands of 3,500-odd Republicans. Compare that to the stakes in Indiana. In 2010, when Dan Coats lucked out and beat a split conservative field for the GOP's Senate nod, he won more than 217,225 out of 550,000 votes. So: It's hard winning elections. It's even harder because the Republican ""establishment,"" insofar as such a thing still exists, consists of fairly smart people who know what happened last time. When Bob Bennett's slayer, Mike Lee, arrived in the Senate, Hatch started copying his homework and showing up at every Lee presser. He kept up his outreach to Utah's Tea Party leaders, like classic car dealer David Kirkham. He used his powerful position as ranking member of the finance committee to add credibility to Tea Party arguments about the debt, like the idea that the administration was fibbing about the impact of passing the Aug. 2 deadline without raising the debt limit. Yet when Chaffetz passed on the race, those Tea Partiers Hatch had been courting were still shocked. ""It was quite surprising,"" Kirkham says. ""He'll still be vigorously challenged. We're looking for someone who's been more reliably conservative, but we had been working really hard to work with Hatch."" This was a victory that looked like a loss. The Tea Party, the Club for Growth--the whole movement has succeeded in driving Republicans further to the right. Nuking a few moderates in primaries was only part of that--a great story for the horse-race media, but not something that would keep up as the GOP was purified. Think about the Tea Party as repeating (and perfecting) the strategy liberals used in 2006 and after, when online activists and unions banded together to beat Joe Lieberman in his U.S. Senate primary in Connecticut. Lieberman ended up returning to the Senate. Liberals would oust only a couple more Democrats, like Maryland's Rep. Al Wynn, in the next election cycle. But the Lieberman challenge drew a neon line in front of the party's candidates: Oppose the Iraq War, oppose the surge, or you go nowhere. The party's presidential candidates obeyed. Its next presidential nominee won the primaries in a squeaker in part because he, alone among the frontrunners, had always opposed the Iraq War. Republicans seem to have figured this out. It's increasingly likely that no incumbent Republican will lose a primary to a Tea Partier in 2012. The movement can consolidate its gains. Safe districts and the fear of primaries do more to keep Republicans straight than the occasional wins. But some activists still like to think about bloodying up the party some more. Virginia activists, while bearish on Radtke, are bemused and annoyed that Allen has his own prefab Tea Party group to make it look like he's gotten right with them. It's possible that Lugar could go down--even if the primary is split, even if his main challenger, Richard Mourdock, keeps pulling in weak numbers. ""That would all make it more difficult,"" says George Ethridge of the Corydon Tea Party, ""but Mourdock can beat Lugar."" What about Utah, where a likely coup just turned into a frantic search for a self-funding candidate with great hair? Kirkham hasn't talked to Hatch recently, but he wants to keep putting the fear in him. ""He scored a touchdown, but he shouldn't be dancing in the end zone,"" he says. ""The game is still on."""

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/republicans_for_tax_hikes.html	"It's not news when Jon Huntsman criticizes fellow Republicans. It's news when he agrees with them. On Sunday, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Huntsman found himself in a virtual love-in with Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann over, of all things, taxes. The paper asked Huntsman if ""the half of American households no longer paying income tax--mainly working poor families and seniors--should be brought onto the income tax rolls."" He agreed, crediting the GOP's current front-runner for vice president, Sen. Marco Rubio, with the insight that ""we don't have enough people paying taxes in this country."" The Journal called this position the ""new GOP orthodoxy,"" which it is. When he announced his presidential bid two weeks ago, Perry told a room of conservative activists and bloggers that ""we're dismayed at the injustice that nearly half of all Americans don't even pay any income tax."" He was following on Bachmann, who'd just told the South Carolina Christian Chamber of Commerce the very same thing. ""Part of the problem is today, only 53 percent pay anyfederal income tax at all; 47 percent pay nothing,"" said Bachmann. ""We need to broaden the base so that everybody pays something, even if it's a dollar. Everyone should pay something, because we all benefit."" Huntsman, Perry, Bachmann: All of them are taking a bold stand in favor of cognitive dissonance. The main reason Washington couldn't get a ""grand bargain"" on the budget and debt ceiling was that Republicans balked at increasing taxes on anyone. How did we get from there to the notion that it would be a good idea to raise taxes on the 60-odd million people who didn't end up owing the IRS any money last year? Conservatives have an argument: You can't, and shouldn't, balance the budget and pay for entitlements by continually raising taxes on the rich. Doing so, they say, is ""class warfare."" At the same time, however, they must contend with persistent support for the welfare state. So conservatives are betting that regular Americans are losing track of how much it costs to give them what they want. This isn't a new theory. In 2002 and 2003, long before it got Huntsman in the room, the Wall Street Journal editorialized that poor people who didn't pay income taxes were ""lucky duckies."" The poor slob with a low income and child tax credit would get a small or nonexistent tax bill, not one that would ""get his or her blood boiling with tax rage."" The problem here wasn't that the poor slob wasn't paying any taxes; the problem was that his meager tax bill failed to foment enough anger to reduce taxes on other people. Tax cuts for the rich--tax cuts for anyone, really, but the Journal has always been concerned about tax cuts for the rich--require a broad base of outrage. Republican politicians didn't make this argument--until the Obama era. What changed? For decades, the ""lucky ducky"" number, the percentage of Americans that pay no taxes, never rose above 30 percent. The Bush tax cuts pushed it over 30 percent, but not too far over. Then, in 2008 and 2009, the economy collapsed. The government responded with, among other things, new tax deductions. The result: The percentage of people paying no income taxes spiked up to 47 percent and stayed there. When the Tea Party started rallying in 2009, it wasn't protesting higher taxes, because federal income taxes were lower, with more loopholes. It was protesting the perception that productive Americans were shelling out for an ever-expanding class of moochers. And Republicans have taken the Tea Party's lead. This could be the start of a sea change in how Republican politicians--the people who actually need to win votes--talk about taxes. In 1994, the GOP won the House and Senate with a promise to introduce a $500 child tax credit. The promise was kept. That became one of many tax credits intended to make middle class life a little easier. One of the think tankers who helped Republicans develop the idea was Scott Hodge, who's now president of the Tax Foundation. In retrospect, he thinks the tax credit was a disaster. ""I don't think we fully appreciated the level of pork barrel tax policy we were engaged in then,"" Hodge says today. ""Instead of broad-based tax reform for everyone, we were engaged in targeted tax policies, selectively identifying classes of people. It was a terrible idea. It justified all manner of social engineering through the tax code. It really has created two Americas: the nonpayers and the payers."" One funny thing about the nonpayers: They do pay taxes. Everyone who works pays FICA taxes. Everyone who fills up a car pays federal gas taxes. The theory that these people don't appreciate how much the government is moving around money is just that: completely theoretical. This may be why the policy responses to the problem are so gimmicky. Bachmann said that the lucky duckies might get a better appreciation for the size of government if they paid a ""dollar"" a year. Last month, I heard Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., make the case for tax reform and suggest some sort of nominal charge that would ""broaden the base"" and make the system more fair. ""Those who are not paying any taxes but are receiving benefits from the government because of their income status-- there ought to be a reduction from the benefit they receive,"" Coats said. ""Even if it's 10 bucks, or 15 bucks, we [need to say we] have deducted for your participation in helping to support our country's needs."" Bachmann's ""dollar"" plan would net around $60 million, or two-thirds of NPR's annual federal funding. Coats' plan would net a little more. We're being generous, though, because these aren't plans. They're debating tactics. ""We should be doing this even if we had a balanced budget,"" says Hodge. ""This is not really about deficit reduction."" This idea hasn't gone totally viral yet. There is a Republican case against making sure that poorer people pay income taxes. It's being made by Ron Paul. ""Dr. Paul doesn't want to be president so he can raise taxes on anyone, especially on the poor and middle class,"" says Ron Paul's spokesman, Jesse Benton. ""If half of the American people don't pay income taxes, then we are halfway to our goal of eliminating it for everyone."""	"Tax poor people: Republicans want the IRS to nail ""lucky duckies."""

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/the_two_rick_perrys.html	"DES MOINES--Watching Rick Perry discuss policy is like watching two different candidates. One can speak easily about the levels of pollutants in the Texas air or the details of oil and gas exploration. The other talks about national issues as tentatively as a young man asking his girlfriend's parents for her hand in marriage. It's not reasonable to expect a national candidate--even one with a book--to arrive on the campaign trail with a detailed set of policy positions on national issues. Candidates that have been running for months don't usually have very detailed positions on the issues, and most hope they can get through the campaign without ever needing them. To get too specific is to get yourself in danger. So it's not a surprise that on questions about taxes, ethanol subsidies, and entitlements, Perry answers by saying that those issues will be illuminated during the ""conversation"" of the campaign. At a luncheon with businessmen in Dubuque, he takes a full beat between ""Medi"" and ""caid,"" as if to protect against the common mistake of saying ""Medicare."" Yet the governor can be clear, even vivid, when he wants to be. After following him for a few days in Iowa, my question is which Rick Perry will answer any given question. Perry's much-discussed remarks on monetary policy Monday showed how both candidates can answer at once. His instinct was not to weigh in on the issue, but he just couldn't help himself and went on to threaten Bernanke if he ever came to Texas. He concluded his answer by saying that if the Fed printed more money it would be purely for political reasons. Asked about this later, he doubled down on the idea that Bernanke, a Republican appointee, was politically motivated. After a breakfast in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Perry was asked whether misgivings about climate science fueled distrust of federal research, he said, ""I think there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects."" When asked about entitlement growth at a lunch with businessmen Tuesday, Perry suggested that part of the growth in entitlements was from greed. ""Entitlements are a safety net, not a Cadillac or another vehicle to drive around in."" His argument against President Obama's foreign policy isn't just that it's wrong but that the president might not love his country. Perry's claims are based on the idea that most problems can be pretty easily solved. When talking about economic policies, Perry regularly marvels that Washington doesn't understand the simple economic truths that have served him well as governor: Low taxes and low regulation mean growth. Securing the border, he says, ""is not one of those insolvable problems at all."" It's also helpful that brevity is part of Perry's message. ""I don't think the federal government has a role in your children's education."" Therefore, no need for an education plan. So far at least, the common thread of Perry's message is this: The solutions are simple--and those who disagree are not on the level. It's one thing to disagree with policy positions or decisions. It's another to claim such clarity on an issue that you see base motives in anyone who holds a different view. That requires either pride or a sophisticated level of understanding. And as a political matter, it ups the ante: Your opponents aren't just clueless, they're venal. Become a fan of  John Dickerson on Facebook."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/less_hat_more_cattle.html	"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa--At the end of his third day as a presidential candidate, Rick Perry discussed his novel ideas about monetary policy. Asked about the Federal Reserve, he suggested if Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke ever visited Texas, he could get strung up. ""If this guy prints more money between now and the election, I dunno what y'all would do to him in Iowa, but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas,""he told a crowd at a backyard event Monday evening. ""Printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treasonous in my opinion."" Bernanke wasn't his only target of the day. Perry also took shots at President Obama's military record and patriotism, and Mitt Romney's jobs record (though he also blew him kisses and told a reporter to ""give him my love""). In an age of packaged events and thinly ladled news, the Perry show was a refreshing and unpredictable carnival. Yet it's unlikely to continue for much longer. On Tuesday morning Perry's communications director, Ray Sullivan, tried to take the edges off the governor's remarks from the previous day. ""The governor was passionate and energized by a full day at the Iowa state fair and public events and interacting with the people of Iowa,"" he said. Perry and the American people, he added, are simply frustrated with Washington politics, and that irritation was what fueled his remarks. Perry has already shown he is a good retail politician. He has also shown that he is an effective advocate for the Tea Party activists. His task now is to show he has discipline. It's one of the traps his opponents have set for him. He may bring energy to the race--but so does a live wire. Discipline is also important to any campaign that wants to stay focused on one message for more than one news cycle. That's what candidates learn from having run before. Romney has learned this. He has been focused, not ""swinging at every pitch,"" as a campaign aide once put it (which includes sidestepping questions about Perry and staying focused on attacking Obama). By Tuesday morning, Perry was far more subdued. Dressed in a coat and tie and speaking at local roofing company, he dropped the preacherlike cadence and delivered his remarks on the economy in a softer tone. It was quite a change from the day before at the state fair, where Perry put on quite a show shaking hands, high-fiving kids, and pulling various onlookers into a close embrace. It was clear that Perry was energized by all the contact. Of course, not everyone got it. ""Governor Pawlenty!"" yelled one woman. Another bystander asked: ""I want to ask him how he's going to be different than George Bush."" And there was the woman who gave Perry the Perry treatment, putting him in a clutch. Afterward I talked to her. ""I called him 'Mr. Everything,' "" she said, beaming and explaining how his Tea Party support and executive experience meant he was the complete package. The woman, who declined to give her name, was another supporter of Rep. Michele Bachmann who has switched to Perry. (I've met several.) She hadn't completely given up her passion for Bachmann, however. Before she left Perry she pressed some Bachmann campaign literature in his hand and asked that he consider her as his running mate. Perry's main message is about the economy. He promises ""to get America working again."" His prescription is simple: Get government out of the way and allow American self-reliance to take over. ""That's what we do,"" he says, talking about how the American people are hard-wired to come back from adversity. If the theme sounds familiar, it may be because it's almost exactly the same as the one President Obama sounded at the end of his State of the Union address in January, when he reminded Americans that ""We do big things."" Which is not to say Perry agrees with Obama. Far from it: ""I think you want a president who is passionate about America ... who is in love with America,"" he said to the crowd at the fair. Asked later if he thought Obama loved his country, he told the reporter he'd have to ask the president. Perry also talked about Obama's lack of military service and how his own made him a better potential commander in chief. ""Experience matters. Having walked in a person's shoes, having done what these men and women in the military are doing matters to them,"" Perry said. ""I don't want somebody sitting in the front-left seat of the airliner who just got their pilot's license."" This is pretty charged language. It's what makes Perry appealing to conservatives. If he is nominated it will also mean a highly charged general election campaign, possibly including regular eruptions of emotional debates about duty, patriotism, and values. At his last stop of the day Monday, Perry tried to return his focus to Obama's economic policies, calling for a six-month moratorium on new federal regulations. Then his attack on Bernanke overshadowed those remarks. The softer tone Tuesday shows that the Perry campaign recognizes the candidate needs to temper his swagger. Whether it can be tempered, or how much, is another question. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	Rick Perry on Ben Bernanke: Now the candidate is trying to temper his swagger.
