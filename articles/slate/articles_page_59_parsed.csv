This is the modern instinct. I don't just mean for reporters. Everyone seems to have a couple of screens open all the time. March Madness is about to begin, and Twitter will be stuffed full of contemporaneous commentary about the games being played. This was the topic of the focus group--the changing way we all use technology. The moment I opened TweetDeck, the focus group moderator was going around the conference room table asking earnest participants whether they had ever used Twitter while they were watching something else. Had I tweeted about that question, it would have been a tweet written while watching someone televised talking about tweeting while watching other media. A meta-turducken. If I had taken a selfie while doing it, I might have won some kind of MacArthur genius award. The Tuesday evening focus group was one of two held as a part of the Off the Grid National Survey, a poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and Global Strategy Group to examine the way people consume information. If you're reading this online--and of course you are--the findings will seem familiar because you're undoubtedly one of the people the survey found who are moving away from traditional live television viewing. Instead, you are using technology to determine when and how you watch media--streaming, DVR, YouTube--and to seek out information about what you're watching--ordering P90X on your iPhone the minute you see those rock-hard abs. For political campaigns this means it is getting harder to reach voters through political advertising, which for the last 50 years has been the key tactic campaigns have used to communicate. Candidates are going to have to find people in the new spaces where they now live. That poses a challenge for political reporters, too. People are empowered by their tablets and smartphones, but when they look for information about politics, they aren't rushing to media--traditional or otherwise--because they don't trust us. This is the third Off the Grid survey in the last four years, and for the first time, only a minority of respondents (48 percent) say that live television is their primary source for watching video content. For campaigns, live television viewership is a key measurement because that's when people are more captive to ads. The second preferred method of viewing, according to the survey, is watching pre-recorded television. When participants in the focus groups in Charlotte and Des Moines, Iowa, were asked if they skipped past the ads when watching on DVR, they all said yes. People watch on their own terms. ""Whatever I want is at my fingertips whenever I want to have it,"" said one man describing how technology had become a part of his life since he was 18. In June 2012, 17 percent said they had watched streaming through a television in the past week; now 27 percent do. The same jump has taken place in smartphone and tablet use. If people are watching live television (most often sports and news, according to focus group participants), they are doing it while also doing something else on one of their other devices. Forty-one percent of respondents in the poll said they regularly or occasionally used another device while watching television. So what does this mean for political advertisers? It could mean campaigns have to make ads louder and meaner and cleverer to get people to look up from their smartphones where they've tuned out while the ads that they hate clog up the television. It was the unanimous view in both focus groups that negative advertising was a turnoff. When I talk to voters, that is almost always what they say, but it's also true that the ads that are often the most effective are the negative ones. In the Charlotte focus group, the one ad a participant could remember was a negative hit on incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. Or, these data mean campaigns have to create ads or communications strategies that meet audiences where they are migrating. That's where smart campaigns are headed--and that's why the poll was sponsored by the Republican firm Targeted Victory and the Democratic firm Well and Lighthouse. Both firms help political candidates navigate this new landscape. The key to reaching voters, says Democratic pollster Julie Hootkin, is for campaigns to grab voters when they are in information-seeking mode. Participants in the focus group said that they turned to their tablets or computers to check information they saw on television. One woman in Charlotte checked on the backstory behind two actors in a drama. Another gentleman checked to see how a local law would affect him. A third wanted to know if the Dollar Shave Club was a legitimate operation, and a cat owner bought a tool for picking up cat hair she'd seen on TV. Candidates may be able to push people from their televisions to their other devices. If an ad gets voters to visit a website with their tablets or smartphones, then it's possible they might hand over information that will let the campaign turn them into supporters. But campaigns need to be careful: If a campaign interrupts voters' smartphone time, it may lose them. People are willing to let political solicitations come into their homes (their most private actual spaces), but participants in the focus group guarded access to their smartphones like it was their bedrooms. One man called it his ""sacred zone."" If people are habituated to checking what they see on television on their phones and tablets, that would seem to offer an opportunity to news outlets. We're here to give you those facts and answer those questions you have about distorted ads, crazy debate claims, or whatever else ails you. But when participants were asked whether they used their devices to check what they'd heard in commercials or to research candidates, the answers were pretty grim for reporters. No one trusted anyone in the news business: They were either ideologically biased or influenced by money. Gallup says only 44 percent of the country trusts the news media. ""I trust MSNBC more than I trust Fox News,"" said one participant. ""But does that mean I trust MSNBC? No."" Another respondent cited the Des Moines Register as a source of information, but then when asked if he trusted the paper, answered no. ""That's why I try to stay away from TV. I don't trust anything I see there,"" said another participant. The overwhelming feeling is that the participants were frustrated with information they found anywhere other than Wikipedia because they were always discovering that the information was tainted in some way. That's why five of the 10 participants in the Des Moines focus group said they preferred to get information from candidates directly. At least they knew that information was biased, and they could make their own determinations from there. Reporters viewing the questioning were asked if we had any questions we wanted to ask the group. I asked if they spent more time researching candidates or picking out big consumer items like a car or a large-screen television. In Des Moines only one woman spent more time on politics. ""I think at the end of the day we've got a two-party system, and if you lean one way or the other, the odds that you are going to change your position is minimal,"" said one gentleman. ""I almost know what I am going to do before these campaigns start. All you're doing is picking between two cars anyway."" In Charlotte it was a mix. (The group dynamic created a brief flurry of competitive patriotism as people jockeyed to show they were good citizens, which sometimes happens in a focus group.) Those who were honest about their consumer product homework said they spent more time on it because their choice of a car or blender would actually affect their lives most directly. With an election, it isn't so clear. ""With a candidate you might think you have eight options, but then when you vote, you don't have the eight options,"" said Sheila in Charlotte. ""It's not the deluxe model you thought it was."""	How Will Candidates Reach Voters When They Won't Watch TV?	['MacArthur']	[]
1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/reince_priebus_immigration_reform_and_gop_autopsy_why_republicans_are_ignoring.html	"When you are the chairman of a political party, it doesn't pay to be subtle. So when GOP Chairman Reince Priebus met with reporters Tuesday for breakfast, he got right to the point. The Democrats are facing an electoral ""tsunami"" in November, he said. Obamacare ""is in the tank and is total poison across the country ... it is sinking these candidates into the abyss."" The Democrats, he says, ""are in the dumps."" The Senate is going to be in Republican hands by the end of the year. Mostly true! The final meteorological determination after the November elections may be something short of a tsunami, but historical patterns, current polling, and the electoral landscape suggest it is not going to be a pleasant year for Democrats. Even Mitt Romney is taking a belated victory lap. Priebus was at the breakfast, sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, to commemorate the first anniversary of his effort to modernize the Republican Party. He was there to boast about new GOP campaign tactics and the party's full-time voter outreach program. The event was a measure of how much the party's fortunes have changed in 12 months. It also marked something else--how the roar for sweeping immigration reform has been reduced to a whisper. A year ago Republicans were in a panic after the 2012 presidential election loss. Priebus, as party chairman, was pushing reform. He commissioned a report, nicknamed the ""autopsy,"" which gave you some indication of where Republicans stood. You can only do an autopsy when the body is dead. ""The November election was a wake-up call,"" he said at the time. The report offered many suggestions, a lot of them technical ones about how to change the primary process, trim the number of debates, improve outreach to voters, and boost fundraising. The headline flash was that its authors believed the Republican Party needed to make comprehensive immigration reform a priority. ""We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,"" the report said. ""If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only."" The report made no other specific policy prescription in that way. At the time, this presented Priebus with a problem. His job is to raise money and create a structure that any candidate can use to beat Democrats. He's not primarily a policy guy. But he can't build an operation to win if party policy positions limit the terrain on which the sterling operation he builds can compete. For many conservatives ""comprehensive immigration reform"" mentioned in the context of improving the party's image with Hispanic voters meant ""amnesty""--specifically, legislation that would offer citizenship to existing undocumented workers. (It suggested this to conservatives because that's what its proponents meant.) A year ago Priebus finessed that portion of the report, saying it was simply a recommendation. He also insisted, however, that the party needed to focus on comprehensive immigration reform. In the interim, the Republican Party has not focused on immigration reform, and for good reason. Why have a big internal fight when things are going so well? No one is embracing or championing comprehensive immigration reform in any significant way as a part of the 2014 campaign. Even the definition of what constitutes ""making an effort"" on immigration has gotten rather vague. In some cases it can mean as little as having a policy position, no matter what it is. On Tuesday morning, I read the line about immigration reform from the GOP report to Priebus and asked him whether the dire consequences the report predicted would befall the party if it didn't take on comprehensive reform. The chairman then switched from making bold declarations to more semantic language. ""I would ... caution you not to impose your definition of what comprehensive immigration reform is. There's a general agreement that we need to have serious immigration reform, but I don't believe there's general agreement as to what that reform is."" ""General agreement"" is obviously not the same as the report's call for ""embracing"" and ""championing."" The question is whether the political push for ""comprehensive reform""--however you define it--is just sleeping until the 2014 elections are over or has been replaced with a new view. Some proponents of citizenship or legal status for illegal aliens in GOP ranks suggest they'll have another shot after the midterms. Others suggest that any immigration reform in 2015 will be modest, consisting of border security provisions and improvements to the existing visa system, because candidates jockeying for position in the 2016 primary will inflame the debate, causing the kind of public spat everyone is avoiding this year. It's hard to argue with that view. A year ago, there were plenty of conservatives who disagreed with the idea that comprehensive immigration reform would be the political win with Hispanic voters that the authors of the autopsy report thought. (Not to mention the group that thought it was wrong to reward law-breakers). As the party's fortunes have improved, the panic that caused quick evolutions like Sean Hannity's has subsided. There is also considerable strength behind an alternative political view that Priebus himself seems to support. As long as Republicans do not say things that Hispanic voters find outright objectionable while improving their outreach efforts, they'll have a chance with Hispanic voters. So, no more talk of ""self-deportation."" Hide Rep. Steve King and his characterization of Mexicans as drug lords and put some more miles on the campaign van. Priebus told the story, as he has for the past year, of Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico. The five-term congressman does not support citizenship for illegal aliens but keeps winning in a district that was 52 percent Hispanic in 2012 because he puts 90,000 miles on his car campaigning all across the region, including in Hispanic communities, says Priebus. Given the conservative nature of the district and the sharp drop-off in Hispanic voting in midterm years, Pearce is likely to win again in 2014, though Democrats once fantasized about taking his seat from him. Elections held in nonpresidential years are quite different than those during presidential contests--that was one of the points of the 2012 autopsy--but if a loss in 2012 did not create pressure for comprehensive action, a big win in 2014 is not likely to either. Right now it looks like the GOP autopsy's support of immigration reform is the only thing that is truly dead."

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/marijuana_tax_law_reform_grover_norquist_and_dana_rohrabacher_boost_the.html	"The ""ultimate marijuana bill"" sits on a table, next to crudites and crackers but at a safe distance from the red wine. It's Tuesday evening inside the new office of the Marijuana Policy Project, where the small but ambitious cannabis lobby has cloistered before swarming Capitol Hill. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who co-wrote the ""ultimate marijuana bill,"" is filling his cup before giving a short speech. Ben Wu, the young CEO of a new California-based company called Kush Bottles, is telling me why his product can lock marijuana away from minors and transform the image of the pot business. ""All it takes is one bad event to get on CNN and discredit the industry,"" he says. Rob Kampia, the longtime executive director of MPP, quiets down the room and waves the ultimate bill--H.R. 1523, the Protect State Marijuana Laws Act--in the air. ""If you're reading-impaired,"" he says, ""this is how long it is."" It's one page long, and would clarify that some federal drug laws did ""not apply to any person acting in compliance with State laws relating to the production.""* ""Very complicated,"" interjects Rohrabacher. ""Even a congressman can understand it."" Over a few days this week, the National Cannabis Industry Association started a third year of selling Congress on quasi-legal federal recognition of marijuana. There are a few ways of doing this; H.R. 2240, also co-sponsored by Rohrabacher and Democrats, would end the tax code's current prohibition on deductions or credits for businesses dealing with controlled substances, for any ""marijuana sales conducted in compliance with State law.""  Sixty-five representatives of the 450-member business association RSVP'd for the push. Most of them made it to the Hill. Michael Correia, who's been NCIA's director of government relations for just a few months, came from the office of Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., and is now trying to sell just enough of the party on an issue that many of them identify as part of the rot of the 1960s. Kampia tells his audience--cannabis product manufacturers, lobbyists, and possible Rohrabacher donors--that their goal is to ""ultimately change the law so that marijuana is regulated like alcohol."" Rohrabacher has been trying at this for a decade, not getting very far. ""I was Ronald Reagan's speechwriter,"" he tells the crowd. ""If you take a look at Ronald Reagan's speeches on drugs, and if you looked real close, you can tell which ones I worked on. Reagan would make it clear that our goal was not to put people in jail."" But the new cannabis lobby's first problem comes straight out of the tough-on-crime push of the Reagan years. In 1982, the start of his iteration of the ""war on drugs,"" Reagan approved 280E, the line of tax law that prevents drug profit tax deductions. For decades it was a useful legal tool against dealers and an occasional source of would-you-believe-it news about people hiding their drug money. Only this year, with the birth of the legal marijuana industry in Colorado and Washington state, has this law produced the sort of victim that Congress tends to protect. Legal dispensaries are making millions and are unable to deduct the profits. They can't convince banks to take their money or place ATMs in their stores. After a few weeks of Colorado sales, the Department of Justice issued a memorandum to prosecutors, asking them to lay off and let banks work with the dispensaries. ""You can't deduct rents, payroll, so it's been a tough sale for us to come out and get capital from investors,"" says Pete O'Neil, managing partner of Seattle's C&C dispensary. O'Neil got lucky. ""We had to register with the SEC after we did our first sale,"" he says. ""I had to call to file it, and I said, 'Hey, I'm trying to get information about the Form B.' The guy on the line said, 'What are you doing?' I said, 'I own a legal marijuana dispensary.' He says, 'Stay on hold.' I think: 'Oh, shit.' He comes back, and he's like, 'Mr. O'Neil, can you repeat what you just said to me?' I repeat it, and I hear the other guy on the line say, 'Oh man, isn't that cool?' "" O'Neil laughs at the memory. ""Thank God for stoners."" But the industry can't rely on stoners alone. ""We have turned a corner,"" says Rohrabacher. ""This issue is no longer a counterculture issue. Always, in the past, when you talked about marijuana, you'd have someone say, 'Whoa man, what's going on here?' "" The congressman from Orange County summoned his best Tommy Chong impression and puffed an invisible joint. ""In fact, the turning point in public opinion has happened just in time. For the first time, the polls indicate I'm actually gaining votes by taking this stand on marijuana. How stupid it is to spend billions and billions of dollars, all of the time of our courts, to prevent someone from smoking a weed they can grow in their backyard?"" On Wednesday morning the lobbyists headed to Congress, armed with talking points and a letter from Grover Norquist. In September the president of Americans for Tax Reform had asked House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp to support the ultimate marijuana bills. ""H.R. 2240 corrects a mistake in the tax code Congress never intended to create,"" wrote Norquist. ""In an attempt to deny tax deductions connected to the illegal drug income of street dealers, Congress accidentally imposed a gross receipts tax on legal cannabis dispensaries a generation later."" ""Grover is totally on board with fixing 280E,"" says Blayne Sapelli, a 25-year-old working on a smoke-free cannabis startup and lobbying members of Congress from Connecticut. ""That's pretty sweet."" I head over to the Heritage Foundation's monthly Conversations With Conservatives panel, where marijuana's not likely to come up at all. As it wraps I ask a few of the House's most right-wing members, the guys who run the place, if there's any interest in the cannabis bills. Texas Rep. Joe Barton, who's been in the House since 1985, sounds utterly baffled when (with an assist from a more eloquent reporter) I explain the issue. ""I don't think marijuana helps people,"" says Barton. ""I think it hurts over time. I don't want Congress to pre-empt the state of Colorado. If the banks won't take the money, well, good for the banks. If inadvertent regulation of banks prevents people from using marijuana, I'm for preventing people from using marijuana."" A few minutes later, I pose the same question to Indiana Rep. Marlin Stutzman, elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, and 27 years younger than Barton. He starts out criticizing the Obama administration for its abuse of power, which makes sense, as later in the day the House will pass a bill making it easier to sue the president. ""The attorney general is, again, moving without Congress,"" he says. ""But I think that we should have hearings on it. We need to realize that there are consequences to laws and referendums that pass in the states when it comes to banks and interstate commerce. There are problems when we legalize drugs because of the infrastructure behind it. The flow of money is being forced on them. There's concern about the soundness, the integrity behind the dollars. When you have several states that are now approving marijuana, it's going to affect the country ways we may not have thought of."" In other words: Sure, he'll look at it. So will Alabama Rep. Spencer Bachus, the retiring chairman emeritus of the House Financial Services Committee, whom I talk to later in the lobbying day, and who is at least open to the idea of banks taking the money. ""If Colorado law allows them to do it lawfully, then I think the bank is entitled to take the money,"" says Bachus. ""I'd be for addressing it. I'm not for people hiding their money in mattresses and getting robbed."" When the day ends, I catch up with the lobbyists in the beige vending machine sector of the Rayburn Building. They sit and talk over packaged snacks and vitamin-infused waters. No breakthroughs just yet. ""I was in [New York Sens. Chuck] Schumer and [Kirsten] Gillibrand's offices, and they seemed disinterested in the issue,"" said Steve Trenk of AcquiFlow. ""We got a lot of platitudes about seeing what happens."" Another lobbyist says this might have been a small victory. If Schumer isn't concerned with the push, he's out of ""drug warrior"" mode. He's not going to oppose the bill--if the House actually moves the bill. If a trend-spotter like Schumer sees no upside in attacking legal marijuana banking or tax deduction (we are talking, after all, about a senator who briefly decided that the Dubai Ports deal was a threat to America), there are no enemies to the left. The next morning, on the last day of lobbying, the NCIA gather in the Cannon Building to package their message for the press. The hook: An appearance by Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who would explain that marijuana's victory was preordained. ""Demographic destiny is marching on,"" says Lake. ""Marijuana is one of the few issues that mobilizes progressive voters without any backlash."" Rohrabacher sits in the first row of chairs, eyeing Lake with no apparent reaction. He gets up; he argues that his team should already be backing these bills, his bill especially, no matter whether progressives or the counterculture or whoever else are for it. ""If it was a secret ballot,"" says Rohrabacher, ""a majority of my Republican friends would have voted for this."" *Correction, March 14, 2014: This article originally misstated that Dana Rohrabacher was discussing H.R. 2240 in his speech to the Marijuana Policy Project.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/joe_mcginniss_dead_at_71_my_friendship_with_the_true_crime_author_and_political.html	"The path to Alaska's most infamous home ended at a ""No Trespassing"" sign and a heavy chain. Joe McGinniss, holding the cellphone he'd been using to give me directions, walked to the makeshift gate and pulled it back. I'd brought some salmon, he had a grill, and we planned to eat dinner while the sun set on Wasilla's Lake Lucy. ""Don't take any pictures,"" said McGinniss. ""I had a party here a few nights ago--20 or so people came by--and everyone was very good about not taking pictures."" It was hard to resist, but this was July 2010, and the story that would accompany any pictures was played out. In May, McGinniss--the well-known political journalist and true-crime author--had rented a vacant home right next to Sarah Palin's, where he would research and write a biography of the former governor. A horrified and media-savvy Palin wrote a Facebook post, alerting her supporters to the news that a journalist was ""about 15 feet away on the neighbor's rented deck overlooking my children's play area and my kitchen window."" In between reading hate mail and changing his phone number, McGinniss had called me to describe his life under siege. ""Look, this is a pain in the ass for them,"" he told me. ""If I were her, I'd be upset."" But in the same conversation, he fueled the haters by suggesting that ""Sarah should have baked a plate of cookies, and come around the fence, and said, 'hi, and laughed about this.' "" I'd blown off most of a dinner with friends, hiding out in their bedroom, to type up what McGinniss told me. It felt like someone was being exploited in Neighborgate, but I couldn't tell who. If you cover politics, you've read The Selling of the President 1968. A 26-year-old McGinniss wrote that book from inside Richard Nixon's campaign, gaining access that no reporter would ever again fool a campaign into giving. If you're a reporter, you've probably read The Journalist and the Murderer, Janet Malcolm's study of the legal battle between McGinniss and Jeffrey MacDonald. At least you know the first line: ""Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible."" McGinniss, I figured, knew exactly what he was doing. One month later, I resigned from a reporting job after mean emails I'd sent to a listserv were leaked. More than a few conservatives remembered that I'd sided with McGinniss over Palin. McGinniss remembered, too. When I used some of my unexpected time off for a personal trip to Alaska, McGinniss invited me to come see the house, and to stay over if so moved. ""My lawyer from LA, who just departed yesterday, opted for the Best Western after he took a look here,"" McGinniss wrote in an email. ""He didn't regret it."" The house, as other guests would report, was comically close to Palin's. Alaska's first family had built a grand home that filled much of their lot, and put up a fence with the braces pointed toward their neighbors. By the time I got to Wasilla the Palins had tacked on extensions that raised the fence 14 feet high. From the porch or the dining room you could see over into the yard. McGinniss didn't care. He was half rattled, half amused by the campaign against him, after he'd been so kind as to hand-deliver a copy of his book about Alaska to the Palins' front door. So we talked, and quickly got bored with the Palins. McGinniss told stories about the golden age of magazine journalism, how he'd gotten unthinkable contracts for travel stories. How his true-crime books sold, but his passion project about an Italian minor league soccer team hadn't. How the Palin book, hopefully, would. He pointed out where he'd be running cable to watch the World Cup and (politely) argued that the salmon a friend had caught was better than the stuff I'd bought at Wasilla's Walmart. I didn't dispute him. I didn't stay the night, but returned in the morning to meet McGinniss at a diner. My source had unexpectedly become a friend. And he stayed a friend. McGinniss was curious and generous, trading emails or calls as he (figuratively speaking) watched Palin's moves. After Joe Miller bested Sen. Lisa Murkowski in a Republican primary, McGinniss sent me an email with the subject ""Not that it feels good to have been right"" and a copy of the tip he'd given another friend to ""keep an eye on this ultra Tea Party challenger."" He lived with the Palin story, but it wore on him. Some days there'd be a painstaking email about how he interviewed a source (a free lesson in the art), and some days he'd forward news about the insanity of the Mat-Su Valley. I shared the news that Levi Johnston, the father of Palin's grandson, would drop his quickie memoir the week before McGinniss' book came out. ""The publisher of that division of S&S passed on my Palin proposal in 2008,"" wrote McGinniss. ""So she winds up with Levi instead."" McGinniss' book was published in September 2011. He fretted about the sales, because ""Sarah seems to have no fans left even among conservative media,"" but when it hit the New York Times best-seller list he proudly told me about his new historical footnote. ""Random House is not aware of any prior instance in which a nonfiction author has had a Times top-ten bestseller 42 years after his or her first."" Palin's fans were outraged, just as McGinniss expected. Breitbart.com published an email that purportedly showed McGinniss telling a source that he needed more proof before putting a story in the book. ""My reporting continued beyond the date of the email,"" McGinniss told me, going on to mock his critics and attach a few more examples of how he went back and forth with sources who teased scoops or demanded money. ""I go to where the story is,"" McGinniss told me. ""I don't sit in my office and pass judgments designed to get me airtime on Sunday mornings. I work sources. That's called journalism. It's not always pretty, but without it, all we'd be reading are ghost-written celebrity memoirs. The homicide detectives I've gotten to know over the years have told me that their line of work isn't always fun either. But it's a necessary part of the effort required to keep our society from becoming any more dysfunctional than it already is."" Weeks later, when Palin announced that she wouldn't run for president, my friend who'd spent a year of his life researching this subject sent me a terse email: ""No surprise. Glad the show is over."" He moved on from politics, happily so, returning to true crime stories and eventually re-reporting the Jeffrey MacDonald case for a lengthy e-book. From time to time he'd email to criticize some horse race journalism that he found particularly stupid. ""The media have been dying for a neck and neck race because they needed viewers and page views, which lead to advertising, which they're dying without,"" McGinniss wrote after reading a story about the Obama-Romney race. ""There's no orchestrated conspiracy, but it's understood in [the mainstream media] that 'the closer we can make it seem, the better we'll do ... and, boy, are we ever in need of ad money.' "" What I didn't know, what McGinniss didn't reveal until January 2013, was that he spent most of the election year being treated for advanced prostate cancer. He headed to the Mayo Clinic, where a doctor named Eugene D. Kwon introduced him to a just-approved, miraculous-seeming drug called ipilimumab. McGinniss reacted to this in the only reasonable way he knew how: He pitched a book. Last May, he sent me some passages from the proposal. ""I'm planning to write a book about Kwon from the dual perspective of author and patient,"" McGinniss wrote. ""My personal story--the last chapter of which remains unknown--will provide a narrative thread, but the larger story will be about an institution that is already a household name around the world, and its charismatic hero who is on the leading edge of a revolution in new modalities of cancer treatment."" McGinniss died yesterday, before the story could be told the right way."	What Joe McGinniss Taught Me	['Murkowski']	[]
4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/obamacare_s_ground_zero_is_florida_13th_congressional_democrats_want_to.html	"CLEARWATER, Fla.--They sat in their chairs, smiling politely, and strained to hear what the heck Alex Sink was talking about. Her fault, not theirs. Sink is the Democratic candidate for the March 11 congressional election in Florida's 13th district, which covers most of the sun-bleached and peninsular Pinellas County. On Feb. 25, she was in Clearwater for a local Chamber of Commerce forum. Her chief rival, Republican lobbyist David Jolly, had given an agreeable statement about ""what's wrong in Washington"" and ""how to fix it,"" without specifying the what or how. Lucas Overby, a 27-year-old Libertarian whom Sink is counting on to split votes, had done the same. Sink's turn came, and she forgot to grab her microphone. Only those sitting in the first few rows of the Capitol Theatre could hear her boast about her four years as state CFO and her 30 years as ""a Chamber leader."" The moderator tossed Sink a question. She started to answer, still unamplified. ""Your microphone,"" said a voice in the crowd. ""Turn your microphone on."" ""I'm sorry!"" said Sink. She found her footing. When her turn came, she sarcastically thanked Jolly for changing his positions. Jolly, a far more adroit speaker than Sink, passionately accused her of lying. Neither candidate talked much about the Affordable Care Act. The moderator, a college professor who had brought her class to the debate, asked one question about the law. ""We have employees who are on the lower side of the wage gap who are having their hours reduced under 40 hours because of Obamacare,"" said Jolly. Sink ignored that. She talked about Medicare and Social Security. So it is, every day of this campaign--Republicans reminding voters how much they hate the health care law, Sink reminding them of how much they like, want, and need the Great Society. Florida's 13th is bluer than the rest of Florida, and much bluer than the states--Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina--that will decide control of the Senate. But it's grayer than any of those states, too. Nearly 1-in-4 FL-13 residents is over 65. The electorate, which started returning absentee ballots weeks ago, is even older. In 2010, the senior vote broke for the GOP by 21 points. In 2012, it fell back to a 12-point gap. Right there--that was the difference between a narrow Republican loss and a historic Republican victory. If Obamacare could break Sink, it could break anyone. If she can defend the law, Democrats in tougher races will start to believe they can, too. The debate didn't test this, but reporters in the room could try. Sink and Jolly retreated to the VIP rooms of the theater for one-by-one interviews with the assembled hacks. Sink came out first, telling a local reporter that ""people in Pinellas County don't know David Jolly"" just as the Republican candidate strolled in behind her. I started to talk to him. A helpful but insistent handler intervened, explaining he'd be ""talking to local press first."" And so would Sink. So she thought. After she'd talked to two local stations and to a reporter from the Tampa Bay Times, Sink found herself in front of Fox News reporter John Roberts. ""Hey, John!"" said Sink. ""Good to have you here in my district. Haven't seen you lot ever here."" ""Well,"" said Roberts, ""we come down when it's important."" ""Oh, you're national,"" said Sink. ""You're not the local Fox station. I apologize."" Sink hadn't recognized the Fox team. She swigged from a bottle of water. Roberts wasn't there to banter or ask how the debate went. ""There are many Democrats across the country who are running away from Obamacare,"" he said. ""You see negative ads. But you have taken a different tack. You have embraced it, to a degree. What do you know about Obamacare that other Democrats in other places don't?"" ""Well,"" said Sink. ""I wouldn't describe my position as having embraced Obamacare."" The talking points flowed like oil from a new well. ""This is what I've said about it, and it's reflected from what I'm hearing from the majority of people in my district here. My--my opponent's position is that we should outright repeal Obamacare. I totally disagree with that, because we can't go back to what we had before, where people were being denied for pre-existing conditions, seniors were being exposed to donut holes ... For small businesses, health care insurance premiums were rising, year after year. The system was broken!"" Roberts dug in. ""Do you acknowledge or not acknowledge that the Affordable Care Act, when it comes to small business, is reducing people's hours?"" he asked. ""Has it had negative impacts on small businesses?"" ""Well, I'm not sure about that. I don't necessarily agree with that. One of the things we have seen, not in Florida but in other states where they expanded Medicaid, is that more and more people are qualifying for Medicaid benefits."" ""Do you think that Obamacare will be a deciding issue in this race?"" asked Roberts. ""In many races, it's going to be a deciding issue. Senate races: Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alaska."" ""I really do not,"" said Sink. ""I'm out and about extensively, and have been for months now, and that is not the first issue on some people's minds. In fact, sometimes--in fact, quite often--just the other day I was at a senior center and someone pulled me aside and said, 'Please don't let them repeal Obamacare.' People are beginning to see the benefits, people who've never had insurance in their entire lives. A 39-year-old man who's never had health insurance. That's more of what I'm hearing of when I'm out and about."" ""I'm sorry,"" said Sink's handler, one of those people paid to create a realistic simulation of friendliness when the candidate no longer could. ""We need to head out now. Thank you."" Alex Sink did not ask to be Obamacare's representative in Florida. It just happened a few months ago, after Republican Rep. Bill Young passed away. He'd spent 53 of his 82 years in politics, most of them representing what became Florida's 13th district, which he shaped and built with federal money. In 2011, the state shrunk the district to fit most of Pinellas County, a peninsula resting between the Gulf of Mexico and Tampa Bay. Republicans watched the county go for George W. Bush, then for Barack Obama, then for Barack Obama again. They watched it vote for Alex Sink, in 2010, when she ran for governor. ""This district was trending Democratic,"" explained Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for the conservative 527 American Crossroads. ""I worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006, and I remember looking at maps and thinking: If Bill Young ever retires, this seat is gone."" But it's not ""gone."" American Crossroads, like basically every big-spending political organization in the country, has bought airtime, sent mail, and attempted to test its theories. Outside groups have burned $8.2 million in the Sink-Jolly race, with Democrats outspending Republicans by almost $1 million. In the week after the Chamber of Commerce forum, American Crossroads spent another $200,000. Democrats still hold the advantage, and they've apparently outplayed the Republicans in early voting, but they're nervous, the way Democrats usually find a way to be. ""It was surprising to us, a month ago, when a couple of the groups polled this race a month or so ago and saw it deadlocked,"" said Collegio. ""It may demonstrate the severity with which the Obamacare law has the potential of defeating Dems this cycle."" A drive through the district, which covers all but the most urban parts of Pinellas, doubles as a tour of an Obamacare panic zone. There are a dozen hospitals, more than a dozen diabetes management centers, plenty of health care centers where people can meet Affordable Care Act navigators--or, if they miss them, pick up brochures with pictures of a man whose confusion is giving way to anger. Confused About the Affordable Care Act? You can read this on the way into the district's countless radiology centers where you can listen to eloquent groans about the cost of the Affordable Care Act's medical device tax. You can find the people whose plans were canceled last year, right when this special election started, because they didn't gibe with the law's new requirements. The day of the Sink-Jolly forum I drove half an hour south of Clearwater and parked near the campus of the St. Petersburg College health education center. Carie Jackson, a 28-year-old student there, had spent most of a decade on an Aetna plan that covered her dental insurance and doctor's visits: $78 a month, $2,000 deductible, $45 copays. ""I got a letter by the middle of November, telling me that plan was canceled,"" said Jackson. ""I'm like, OK, great. I guess this is because of the new requirements. They told me, 'You don't have prescription coverage,' and I'm like--I don't want that. They tell me I can pay to extend the plan but only for 12 months. I don't want that. I certainly don't want to pay even more than I'm paying now for stuff that I don't need."" Jackson can't find the initial letter that broke her coverage, but she has spent plenty of time clicking around for a replacement, and she had the numbers down cold. ""The closest one to my old plan was $129 a month and a $6,300 deductible,"" she said. ""Nothing is paid until you hit that deductible. So, what is the point of me paying 75 percent more with a triple deductible? They offered one plan that was right around the same price, $60, but the deductible was $7,000, and everything else was out of pocket. That wasn't even close. And it didn't even cover dental."" Will some people benefit from the law? Sure. Her ""boyfriend--now ex-boyfriend"" had no insurance. He navigated healthcare.gov and found a plan. ""Yeah, $53 a month--oh my God, this is awesome. Well, that may be great for people with crazy pre-existing conditions, but do you have that deductible? I don't know anyone with $6,000 just sitting around."" No one really knows how many Carie Jacksons there are in Pinellas. There are estimates of hundreds of thousands of canceled plans in Florida, generally--those are the numbers that appear on-screen in the TV ads from the national Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber has been relentless, focusing on Obamacare to the exclusion of all other issues: ""Canceled plans, higher premiums, Medicare cuts, people losing their doctors."" Some of the other independent groups have gone granular. When the Congressional Budget Office estimated that millions of people would reduce their hours thanks to the health care law--a goal of both parties, for years--Republicans held it up as proof of incipient job-killing. Sink didn't bite. Leaving a job because you no longer needed it to insure you was ""an exciting prospect,"" she said. Trackers and the NRCC turned that into a campaign spot within microseconds. An #ExcitingProspect hashtag was born; a later ad made it look as if Sink called Obamacare itself an ""exciting prospect,"" as if any clueless person would. Jack Hickman, 57, actually agreed with Sink. He was a software engineer until 2012, when he started to ponder early retirement. ""My wife challenged me about it,"" Hickman said, after ordering a craft beer at the counter from Pinellas' Rapp Brewing. ""She said, 'I'm ready to retire. Do you think we can do it? Do you think we can retire in our 50s?' That's when I got really serious. Knowing that you're not going to have to pay more than $10,000 a year is a reasonable gamble. We made a moral choice. We invested; we saved like maniacs the last 30 years. And we retired. We live off capital gains and dividends."" Hickman and his wife had it relatively easy. Signing up for new insurance, determining whether they'd get subsidies, meant plugging in details about their income. They could adjust their income, take what they needed in a year, without making the number so low that they'd grab the subsidies. ""We're paying a couple hundred bucks a month to Aetna for a $10,000 deductible,"" said Hickman. ""We plugged that in and it worked. It was fine. It's perfect! It's perfect for retirees, for entrepreneurs, for people who hate their jobs, and are just doing them for the health insurance. I'm always amazed at the crap people think about it--you know, I don't even think they've looked at the options. The year before, their premiums went up 15 percent. Now it goes up 10 percent and they're like""--he shook his fist in a mock gesture--""goddamn Obamacare!"" To Hickman it all sounds incredibly naive. He's a registered Republican now, but he signed up mostly so he could cast a protest vote for Michele Bachmann. It seemed, two years ago, that the GOP had reached an insurmountable peak of farce. It doesn't seem like that anymore. ""Marco Rubio came here on a campaign stop,"" said Hickman, ""put his arm around Jolly, and said: If you elect David Jolly to the House, he is going to come to Washington, D.C., and repeal Obamacare! I just about lost it. They've already repealed Obamacare, what, 35 to 40 times? That is the most insane statement, to tell everybody in Florida-13 that he is going to go to D.C. and waste everyone's time."" Not far from the microbrewer, next to a Starbucks, volunteers were making phone calls for Jolly. Barbara Stephens, a 78-year-old retired teacher and Republican activist, had a few minutes to talk about her own nightmare. She's invited Jolly to Republican events, and determined that ""he could be another Ronald Reagan,"" what with his easy charisma. That makes her optimistic. Nothing about the health care law does that. ""I had United Health Care Advantage,"" she said. ""I've had to take out insurance for eyes, and teeth, and hearing. Advantage, for no cost, covered that. Now I pay $400. Can I afford it? Yes. But I'd certainly like to use that $400 for something else in my life, and not something I didn't have to pay for before. The idea that we're using our monies for health care for these illegal aliens, who are here illegally--that's for the birds. I'm at an age where I'm expendable. Let's say I got a terrible disease. Would I get any coverage? The death panel would probably decide--we'll give it to them, not to her."" Stephens leaned in to share her larger, encompassing theory of the law. Why would the Democrats get behind something so obviously kludged and doomed? What would possibly make him do that, even at the cost of hurting his fellow Democrats? ""I think Obama put this in to bring America down economically,"" said Stephens. ""Just like in Germany, so people had to depend on him totally. You get people so poor that they have to depend on the government. You're probably too young to remember that."" This wasn't the end of Stephens' theories--she had her doubts about the president's religion, and his citizenship--but none of it was about health care. Paranoia like this frames the health care discussion, for some people, but not enough people share it to swing an election in a county like this. So I left Pinellas for half a day. One morning, a short drive across the bridge, I joined a chipper and busy group of doctors and activists for what could best be called an Obamacare enrollment party. Members of Doctors for America, which claims 15,000 members across the country, were traversing Florida in a van decorated with enrollment slogans, to promote the law. In Tampa, they'd be joining Get Covered America, which is itself a product of Enroll America, which is a 501(c)3 founded to max out coverage by the March 31 deadline. The goal, nationally, was to enroll 7 million people by then. The most optimistic count of the enrollments by the end of February: 4 million. Not good enough, not yet, but Florida's reportedly bailing out the rest of the country. Any activist you talk to in Pinellas, anyone familiar with the numbers, can tell you that the state has signed up 300,000 people, and that this is a surge second only to California, which wasn't cursed to use healthcare.gov, and that Florida didn't expand Medicaid coverage to people above the poverty line. I arrived at the enrollment party around 9 a.m., just when it was scheduled to start. The health center was right off I-275, where the roads open up into strip malls and housing to serve Floridians who are barely making it. People wait for the bus here, in a city that doesn't run them around the clock. People walk to the corner store, though the corner is an embankment en route to another highway. The health center is located on the nicest and best-paved lot, which is being decorated by ambitious volunteers who imagine a full, fun, inspiring day of sign-ups. On the way in, one Get Covered worker is putting together a sort of instant Skee-ball set. Inside, a table is piled high with fresh fruit, provided gratis; another table shows off some sensible kitchen tools that will be raffled off as the day proceeds. All that's missing is a crowd. The Doctors for America and the Get Covered helpers--clad, respectively, in smocks and in maroon shirts--vastly outnumber the walk-ins. Twenty navigators sit behind laptops, ready to help people research their options, and for a half hour only a couple of them find takers. After 44-year-old Kristal Williams gets up from her table, a member of Doctors for America brings me outside, to meet her. Williams, she said, is a prime example of the people who'd have coverage if the state would only expand Medicaid. ""I was trying to see if they had insurance that would help somebody that actually don't have a job,"" said Williams, who had moved from Orlando to Tampa a few weeks earlier. She wore a bedazzled red sweatshirt and gray sweatpants. ""I don't have a steady income to pay for insurance. I learned about the expansion, but I guess I don't qualify."" I thought the people with Doctors for America had already told her, but to be safe I repeated it: Florida hadn't expanded Medicaid. ""Oh, OK,"" said Williams, visibly perplexed. ""Oh, wow, they should. There's a lot of people out here that needs, and I know I need it. I have to have back surgery. I've needed it for about three years. I have sciatic nerve damage and I have scoliosis in my lower back. It's mild to moderate right now. They want to fix all that up before it gets worse. I have carpal tunnel in both hands, which has gotten really bad. Sometimes my fingertips turn like a slight blue because I guess whatever is going on here and here. I'm bipolar. Paranoid schizophrenic. So there's medication I have to take for that. I can't yet. Even though I'm not on it, luckily, my friend, he paid for it for me, but I had to go in the mental hospital. They asked me how I'm gonna pay for it, I said, who? I have no money and I have no insurance. And then I have high blood pressure. I have to take medication for that."" Not long ago, Williams had a job and could at least find the money for check-ups. She was a hair and nail stylist before the carpal tunnel set in. ""I used to be able to do, like, two heads, maybe three, depends on the style,"" she said. ""And one day I went down to doing one, and then I went down to not doing anything. Now, I don't do nothing. My main passion is going to be in nursing. And I can't do none of that. I can't lift up nobody. I can't even hold up my grandgirls. And I have seven grandgirls."" Right then a Get Covered worker bounded over, unaware of how miserable our conversation had been. He carried a digital camera, and crooked under his arm was a white piece of paper with the event's hashtag: #GetCovered. ""Do you want to tell people about getting covered, on Twitter?"" he asked. ""Oh, no, no, no,"" said Williams. She was polite; the eager volunteer hadn't been close enough to see that her eyes were watering. No, she wasn't the ideal candidate for a meme. Who would be? The morning ticked away and the room started to fill up, but the people most eager to talk about their health care had signed up already and appeared to show their support. Mike Long, a 27-year-old film editor, regaled me with the story of how he dithered about coverage, bought a bronze plan on Jan. 1, then spent the day after New Year's in the hospital after eating ""bad all-you-can-eat sushi."" The plan paid for itself. ""Instead of a $2,500 hospital bill, I had a $90 hospital bill."" A beat reporter from the Tampa Bay Times showed up to cover the Doctors for America event. The media population on the scene had doubled, to two, and would rise no higher. A Get Covered organizer let me in on the joke: As soon as the website started working and the sign-ups became real, the media had stopped covering the enrollment story. At 10:30, Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn arrived to inject some energy into the gathering. The coverage campaigners adored Buckhorn, a Democrat who carried himself like the world's oldest and most optimistic cherub. President Obama adored Buckhorn, telling a recent conference of mayors that this guy had gone ""all in"" on the health care law, and they could, too. Buckhorn toured the health center and planted himself next to the Doctors for America and enrollment helpers who'd been delivering a lengthy, challenging PowerPoint about the law. He broke it down easily. ""I'm sure there will be some people who'll continue to try to derail this,"" said Buckhorn, ""but the more people who get registered the more popular it will become. I think people realize that a lot of this is political. There are people, you know, who can't get beyond the fact that President Obama was elected to a second term. And unfortunately, the rollout was not as smooth as we had hoped."" The rollout--that's what most Democrats, Alex Sink included, lead with when they talk about the law. They talk about the first troubled weeks of healthcare.gov, and then they offer that, sure, the law needs to be fixed. They're comforted by polling, which--if framed the right way--finds a substantial majority against flat-out repeal of the law. Sink's pollster now says voters trust her message, the fix-what-we've-got message, more than Jolly's unspecific pledge to repeal. Buckhorn was optimistic that Sink would win out. ""It'll be interesting to see,"" said Buckhorn, ""because my sense is that district is far more moderate than the Republicans would have you believe. We'll know in the exit poll how much of an effect this will have."" Before leaving the enrollment event and driving back to Pinellas, I found another unsatisfied customer. Sarah Taylor, a 61-year-old Jamaican-British immigrant from a town an hour up the road, worked pro re nata and needed coverage. She got information, but no concrete plan. ""I'm hoping I won't have to change my doctor,"" she said. ""It's time consuming to figure that out. I'm going to go home and look in a more conducive environment, if you know what I mean. But having said all that, I think this""--she pointed at the navigators--""this is great!"" As Taylor talked, there was a yelp of delight from near the raffle table. The homeless woman, skinny and skittish and hanging around long after she failed to sign up for coverage, had won a new Crock-Pot. Taylor's sister, who lived closer to the health center, shot the woman a frown. ""She's going to sell it,"" she said. ""I see her everywhere! She not leaving here today. Anything free happening anywhere, she is there."" ""And she won the Crock-Pot,"" said Taylor, shaking her head. ""That is going to be sold."" Taylor shrugged. ""There's that type of person who always think that the world owes them everything."" I left Tampa and drove back to the 13th district, making it to the parking lot of Haslam's Book Store in St. Petersburg. It was the final stop on a quasi-campaign, quasi-literary tour for Charlie Crist, the one-term Republican governor of Florida who'd become a Democrat and declared for his old job. An art gallery across the street displayed a sign that made good use of Crist's tanned trust-me visage and of current Gov. Rick Scott's unfortunate habit of looking like a bald shark or a Harry Potter villain when he laughs. Vote Crist, read the sign. Defeat Voldemort. Crist started signing his books, hugging anyone with a ticket. When a paraplegic voter couldn't make it all the way to the signing desk, Crist jumped out in front of it, taking a knee, talking politics. ""The Democratic Party--party of the people!"" he said. ""Jesus was a Democrat."" He paused for effect. ""Probably."" The sort of person who'd wait in line for a copy of The Party's Over was inclined to vote for Crist in November and for Alex Sink on March 11. Nobody I talked to at Haslam's was aided in any real way by the Affordable Care Act. They didn't blame the president for that. ""I have type one diabetes and I've been without health insurance for about seven years now,"" said Erin Mitchell, a 43-year-old book editor. ""And I take thyroid pills. Actually, when Charlie was governor he managed to get a new benefit passed, and I get those pills cheaper to this day."" But the ACA didn't do anything for her--she made too much to earn a subsidy--so she relied on dual citizenship in a country with socialized health insurance. ""Basically, my health plan is always having enough cash to get on a plane to Ireland."" One of Crist's endorsers, state Rep. Dwight Dudley, stood over to the side. He was checking his smartphone for news about the Crystal River nuclear plant, an existentially important issue that wasn't affecting this congressional election at all. The health care issue was, however. Dudley started to talk about the bad will engendered by healthcare.gov, but I nagged him to explain whether the Democrats could survive the canceled or expensive plans. ""I'm not going to say some people won't be disappointed,"" said Dudley. ""They clearly are. But in the main, I know a lot of people paying less for their insurance now. Is it all great? No, it's not. Should it be worked on, and fixed? Yes."" It was just the sort of answer Alex Sink was giving on the stump. ""There's enough of a polarizing, negative attitude that it's not a great thing to run on,"" said Dudley. ""It could have been rolled out so much better."" Democrats have no better answer. They'll have better, crisper candidates than Sink, who bristles when she has to deliver the fix-it-don't-repeal-it Obamacare answer. Some of them will have said ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" in the unforgiving view of a video camera, and Republicans will have the money to play that on repeat for voters. The candidates who endure will learn how to handle themselves when Americans for Prosperity or the Chamber of Commerce locate the people--and there are plenty of them--willing to go on camera to describe how their care was ruined by Obamacare. ""I'm hesitant to say that a race in Pinellas County will be echoed in Montana,"" said Rob Engstrom, national political director for the Chamber of Commerce. ""But I don't think the problem goes away if Sink wins. Look at the verbal gymnastics she's going through to defend the law. It's like the comedy hour when I read these clips. The health care law was a liability before this race started. It's going to keep on being a liability."""

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/republicans_debate_party_s_future_at_cpac_the_gop_argument_over_its_own.html	"The Republican Party is having a debate about its future. Before it can have the debate, its leaders must agree on just how it should take place. At the Conservative Political Action Conference this week, there emerged several distinct theories about how to approach the GOP split. Play it down: Rep. Paul Ryan said the Republican Party wasn't having a fight about its future direction, but simply a disagreement about tactics. ""I don't see this great divide in our party,"" he said. ""I like to think of it as creative tension."" Eject the establishment: Sen. Ted Cruz knows there's a fight and he is taking a side. He said conservatives should stand for principles and not support weak establishment candidates like Bob Dole, Sen. John McCain, and Mitt Romney. ""When you don't stand and draw a clear distinction; when you don't stand for principle, Democrats celebrate,"" he said. That message undermined Ryan's claim that the differences in the party were small, since Cruz was saying that the GOP ticket the budget chairman ran on last year was an example of a catastrophic loss of principles. (McCain has since called on Cruz to apologize to Dole.) Overrun the establishment: Sen. Mike Lee started his remarks with a well-told Emo Phillips joke about carrying ideological distinctions too far. ""We as conservatives have got to be far more engaged in finding converts than discarding heretics,"" he said. Lee said he was offering a formula to rebuild the movement and the party, and it sounded for a moment like he was offering a softer version of Cruz's pitch. Maybe he was going to create a synthesis between the establishment and grassroots segments of the party. No heretics! Everyone would get to join in! But then the senator told the story of anti-establishment forces in the mid-'70s who rallied around Ronald Reagan. They worked quietly and diligently, said Lee and ""those in the establishment never knew what hit them."" Lee wasn't offering to convert the establishment; he was promising to ambush them. Pragmatism: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Republicans needed to make peace to win elections. ""I'll remind you of just one simple truth in this democracy: We don't get to govern if we don't win,"" he said. ""So please, let us come out resolved not only to stand for our principles, but let's come out of this conference resolved to win elections again."" That may sound like a simple truth, but in the ideological discussion going on in the Republican Party, what Christie is calling for is pragmatism that eschews distinctions because an imperfect coalition is better than the alternative. Save the world: Mike Huckabee wasn't concerned about something as small as politics. If the party didn't unify, said the governor-turned-talk-show-host, the whole bundle would perish. ""Conservatives need to focus on how we need to lead America, not just how we will bleed each other in the context of our conservative world. Too much is at stake. The future of our country and the future for our children and our grandchildren is far too important for us to spend our time fighting with each other when the real battle is not even a fight against liberals or a fight against Democrats, it is a fight for the soul and future for this great republic of ours."""

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/michelle_rhee_s_studentsfirst_education_policy_is_becoming_a_new_source.html	"Three weeks before Tennessee's August 2012 primary election, state Rep. John DeBerry Jr.'s Memphis-area district was flooded with $52,000 worth of get-out-the-vote efforts supporting the then-nine-term incumbent. Six days later, another $52,000 in materials appeared. By Election Day, the Tennessee affiliate of StudentsFirst, the education-focused organization behind the influx of support, had spent more than $109,000 backing DeBerry, a rare Democrat who supports voucher programs and charter schools. The state branch of the American Federation for Children, another education group, chipped in another $33,000. DeBerry faced another Democrat, state Rep. Jeanne Richardson, whose district was eliminated through redistricting. DeBerry won. ""I couldn't counter it,"" Richardson said of the funds StudentsFirst introduced late in the race. ""I had to raise money by calling people. There wasn't enough time left."" StudentsFirst--created by former Washington, D.C. schools chief Michelle Rhee--is leading a new wave of ""education reform"" organizations, funded largely by wealthy donors, that are challenging teachers' unions and supporting mostly conservative candidates up and down the ticket in dozens of states. These groups promote charter schools, voucher programs, and weakening of employment safeguards like teacher tenure, all ideas bitterly opposed by unions. StudentsFirst flooded at least $3 million in outside spending into state elections in 2012, putting the group roughly on par with the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, across 38 states examined by the Center for Public Integrity and the National Institute on Money in State Politics. The Sacramento, Calif.-based group is far from the only education reform organization that has gained prominence in the aftermath of the 2010 Supreme Court decision that made it easier for corporations to fund political campaigns. Among the biggest spenders: the American Federation for Children, 50CAN, Stand for Children, and Democrats for Education Reform. The organizations flooded states across the country with independent advertising and canvassing efforts in the run-up to the 2012 primary and general election. They have been funded by a slew of billionaire donors, like philanthropist Eli Broad, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, hedge fund manager Dan Loeb,  and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. However, the full list of funders opening their checkbooks for the education reformers remains a mystery since StudentsFirst and many of the other groups are so-called social welfare nonprofit organizations, which fall under section 501(c)4  of the U.S. tax code. Such groups are not required to reveal their donors. Since 2012, the funding onslaught by these groups and their backers has shown no signs of slowing. Spending has reached unheard of heights, even at the school board level. The race for Los Angeles school board in May 2013 attracted nearly $4 million in spending on reform-minded candidates. Major supporters of the pro-reform committee include Bloomberg, StudentsFirst, and Broad, a Los Angeles resident. The organization was countered by roughly $2 million from labor groups. The American Federation for Children spent $110,000 in outside spending supporting three candidates for the Wisconsin State Assembly in the run-up to an election on Nov. 19, 2013. Great Seattle Schools, an education reform-focused political action committee, spent just shy of $62,000 in outside spending in the months leading up to the city's November 2013 school board election. Democrats for Education Reform was among the committee's backers, as were local wealthy figures like Chris Larson, a former Microsoft executive who owns a minor stake in the Seattle Mariners, and venture capitalist Nicholas Hanauer. At the helm of this movement, StudentsFirst has dominated campaigns for state legislators and ballot initiatives that often seem outside the group's education-focused mission statement. As StudentsFirst faces off with labor groups and labor-backed candidates, the group's considerable financial heft may be shaping more than education policy. Battling the unions Rhee, the controversial former chancellor of Washington's public school system, established StudentsFirst not long after resigning her post in 2010. The new organization's goal, she said, would be to provide some much-needed opposition to the teachers unions' political power. ""The problem to date has been that you've had these incredibly powerful teachers unions that have lots of resources, and they use those resources to have influence on the political process,"" Rhee said last year during an interview at the Commonwealth Club of California. Rhee said StudentsFirst is the first education-oriented national interest group to seriously challenge the unions. Since leaving Washington, Rhee has backed legislation curbing collective bargaining rights in several states. In the 18 states where the group is active, StudentsFirst has fought to eliminate ""last in, first out"" provisions in teachers' contracts and to increase the role that quantitative evaluations play in teachers' job security. Accordingly, StudentsFirst tends to oppose candidates who align with unions. Among these union-supported candidates in 2012 was Michigan State Rep. Rashida Tlaib, an incumbent who ran against fellow incumbent Rep. Maureen Stapleton in the Democratic primary as a result of statewide redistricting. Though Stapleton was a former teacher in the Detroit Public Schools, Tlaib received the endorsements of the Michigan Education Association and the Michigan Federation of Teachers. Stapleton, on the other hand, backed charter schools and linking teacher salaries to performance, both key components of StudentsFirst's mission. Between July 20 and the Aug. 7 primary, StudentsFirst poured $195,000 in outside spending supporting Stapleton. Meanwhile, the Michigan Federation of Teachers, the Michigan Education Association, and several other labor groups contributed directly to Tlaib's campaign. ""You almost never see a state house race in the city of Detroit go over $30,000, so when StudentsFirst put $190,000 into that, that was an extraordinary amount of money for a Democratic primary,"" said Rich Robinson, executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network. A couple months earlier, voters in Whittier, Calif., saw a similar phenomenon. The teachers unions supported Democrat Rudy Bermudez to represent the overwhelmingly Democratic district in the state assembly. But StudentsFirst backed a different Democrat, Ian Calderon. A then-26-year-old surfing champion who had never held public office, Calderon's father is former state Sen. Charles Calderon and his uncle is state Sen. Ron Calderon. According to Al Jazeera America, Rhee's representatives met in February 2012 with assemblyman-turned-lobbyist Thomas Calderon, brother of Ron and Charles, to gain support for a bill that would eliminate the last-in-first-out clause of California teachers' contracts. The next day, Ron introduced the bill. Rhee's group then spent more than $378,000 backing Calderon in the 11 days before the primary election on June 5, most of which paid for broadcast advertising, campaign finance records show. Calderon defeated Bermudez by 337 votes in the primary before handily defeating Republican Noel Jaimes in the general election. A new player in the game Historically teachers unions have been the major voices in education politics with little education-specific opposition. ""In the old days, it was all the service-provider organizations--so all the unions--or the consumers,"" said Kenneth Wong, an expert in education policy and education reform at Brown University. ""We are seeing the broadening in terms of the type of actors who get involved in campaign issues in education."" Even parents, who in the past often took a backseat to the unions when it comes to politics, are becoming more engaged in campaigns surrounding education issues, he said. The result is a highly competitive, highly expensive environment in which the still-powerful teachers unions face coalitions of traditional conservative, anti-union players aligned with education reform activists. Politics aren't new to education. For example, the American Federation for Children has been around, though under a different name, and has been fighting the teachers' unions for more than 15 years. What's new is the unprecedented level of education-focused political spending at state and local levels. ""They're the recipients of money from Wall Street and Silicon Valley and some of the wealthiest people in America,"" American Federation of Teachers spokesman Michael Powell said of StudentsFirst. ""And they've raised it at a fairly high clip, and it makes them more competitive in these races around the country, there's no doubt about it."" Karen White, national political director for the National Education Association, traced the new dynamic to the aftermath of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that invited corporate spending into the political process. White said, she sees no distinction between Rhee's StudentsFirst and the other corporate-backed special interest groups the union has begun to face in recent years. ""We're going to get outspent,"" she said. ""We're going to do everything we can to fight back and be strategic with our spending, but we are never going to be able to compete with the folks who are trying to corporatize education ... It's clearly a national battle that they've taken on all across the country."" Despite White's concerns, the NEA's outside spending in 2012 state races was at least $6.4 million, more than double the amount spent by StudentsFirst in the states examined by the Center for Public Integrity. Any comparison between education reform groups and the NEA is ""really a David and Goliath situation,"" said Matt Frendewey, spokesman for the American Federation for Children. ""They are one of the largest unions in the country. Period,"" he said. ""They carry a tremendous amount of clout, especially in relation to how many members they have, and they have a tremendous influence."" ""Education reform"" or just ""reform""? The unions demonstrated their strength in numerous races across the country. Brian Johnson, who lost the 2012 primary race for a seat in the California Assembly, was the beneficiary of outside spending by StudentsFirst and other education reform advocates. Before running for office, Johnson was the executive director of Los Angeles' Larchmont Schools, a network of charter schools, and before that he was the executive director of Teach for America in Los Angeles. He now works for the Teach for America-affiliated Leadership for Educational Equity. So it's unsurprising that Johnson benefited from $1.5 million in outside spending by education reform advocates, including $419,000 from StudentsFirst. Most of Johnson's support came from political action committees whose major donors included Broad, Hastings, and Walmart founder Sam Walton's granddaughter Carrie Walton Penner. Bloomberg, Hastings, and the California Charter Schools Association--which received 52 percent of its funds from Hastings--also gave directly to Johnson's campaign. Meanwhile, the California Teachers Association, the California branch of the National Education Association, spent nearly $467,000 opposing Johnson, and the campaign of Adrin Nazarian, Johnson's top opponent, was funded largely by labor groups. In other races, the education connection was less apparent. In Michigan, StudentsFirst spent nearly $187,000 in independent expenditures to back then-state Rep. Deb Shaughnessy in what was ultimately a losing bid for re-election. StudentsFirst was just one of many groups supporting Shaughnessy's bid for re-election. The Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the Michigan Republican Party, the National Rifle Association, Business Leaders for Michigan, and Right to Life Michigan all funded outside spending campaigns either supporting Shaughnessy or opposing her labor-backed opponent, Theresa Abed. More than half of the contributions to Shaughnessy's campaign came from the House Republican Campaign Committee. And neither Shaughnessy's background, nor the issues at the forefront of her campaign emphasized education. Lawmakers like Shaughnessy have become targets of education spending thanks to an ongoing national debate surrounding the new federally endorsed Common Core curriculum in public schools and the role charter schools should play in public education, Powell said. State legislators will have leading roles in deciding these issues. Federal government gridlock in Washington also means political action committees and political nonprofits are increasingly turning to state lawmakers as the country's primary policy makers. ""Nothing's really happening in Washington,"" Powell said, ""so anything that's happening is happening in the states."" The influence web StudentsFirst is made up of a coalition of nonprofit organizations and affiliated political action committees in a handful of states, a structure that's common among political groups. There's StudentsFirst, the main ""social welfare"" nonprofit or 501(c)4, and the Great New England Public Schools Alliance, another 501(c)4 nonprofit that operates mostly in Connecticut. There's also the StudentsFirst Institute, which is not allowed to participate in elections since it falls under section 501(c)3 of the U.S. tax code. Together these groups spend millions on lobbying, direct campaign contributions, and outside spending. Since 2011, the StudentsFirst Institute received $9 million in grants from the Walton Family Foundation, $7 million from billionaire philanthropists Laura and John Arnold, and $1 million from billionaire hedge fund manager Steven Cohen and his wife Alexandra. The StudentsFirst Institute reported spending just shy of $1 million on lobbying between Aug. 1, 2011 and July 31, 2012, the most recent fiscal year whose tax reports are available. The group also gave $1 million in that period to the affiliated Great New England Public Schools Alliance, or GNEPSA. GNEPSA, in turn, made just shy of $158,000 in independent expenditures in Connecticut legislative races in 2012 and received contributions from Bloomberg and venture capitalist Nick Beim, campaign finance records show. StudentsFirst, the 501(c)4, spent another $346,000 on lobbying during the 2012 fiscal year. State records suggest the group far exceeded this number in the following fiscal year, between Aug. 1, 2012 and July 31, 2013, though the group's tax filing isn't yet available for that time period. Because StudentsFirst is not required to disclose its donors, it's impossible to know where most of the group's funds come from, a point that detractors use as a reason to question the group's motives. Those donors whose names appear on the occasional lobbying disclosure report or tax filing include high-profile figures in political, financial, and technological industries. For example, StudentsFirst spokesman Francisco Castillo indicated a 2012 Huffington Post story that named billionaire New Jersey hedge fund manager David Tepper, a major Mitt Romney supporter, among StudentsFirst's funders. The article also named the Broad and Arnold families. Castillo declined to further detail the group's donors, citing organization policy. Many other education reform groups are more open about who's providing the means to their methods. As a result, they offer a small window into the rolls of donors injecting cash into the education reform movement as a whole. An example of this is the Coalition for School Reform, which spent nearly $4 million on school board races in Los Angeles last year. The group received $1.4 million from Bloomberg, $500,000 from Broad, and $250,000 from former Univision owner Jerry Perenchio, according to city campaign finance records. Other donors included StudentsFirst, Hastings, the Arnold family, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, former New York School Chancellor Joel Klein, and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. The high-profile donors help give prominence to the groups and their causes, according to Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School who serves on the Los Angeles Ethics Commission. But above all, these donors have money to spare--a lot of money to spare. ""It's clear that these groups are funded by people who seem to have an endless supply of corporate money,"" said Tenoch Flores, spokesman for the California Democratic Party. Motives vary Why the groups and their donors have chosen to support charter schools and voucher programs is sometimes less clear. The American Federation for Children chooses which races to back based on where the group feels it can help increase educational options available to parents, according to Frendewey. StudentsFirst's Castillo echoed these sentiments. ""Our organization supports candidates that will be important partners in our ongoing push to ensure that every student attends a great school and is taught by a great teacher, and that's the reason we're pleased to support local and state reform-minded candidates,"" he said in a written statement. Rhee's group and many other education reform organizations believe that privatizing education will prove beneficial for the country's students, explained Michael Apple, who specializes in education policy at the University of Wisconsin. The same is true of the groups' donors. ""If you look at Broad, Bloomberg, they're in favor of strong mayoral control of education,"" he said. ""Some of it is also this belief that the corporate sector is the last remaining set of institutions that form the engine of our society."" But changing the way public education functions also opens windows for private corporations and individuals to make a profit, which is likely a factor in at least some donors' decisions to open their wallets, he said. He compared education to health care, ""meaning the sources of profit are immense."" The education reform agenda creates opportunities for companies that operate online learning programs and computerized testing, said White, of the NEA. The agenda also places a heavier emphasis on standardized testing, offering potential financial benefits to companies that offer those services. In the past, K-12 education has been a ""sluggish,"" highly regulated market that investors were wary of jumping into, said Patricia Burch, an education professor at the University of Southern California. Not so anymore. The technology schools use to administer tests and supplement coursework has emerged as a multibillion-dollar industry, according to Burch's research. In 2002, the education sector spent an estimated $146 million on technology. By 2011, that number was estimated at $429 million, according to Burch. Burch points to recent transactions and mergers as signs of the potential windfalls this market can offer. In 2011, textbook giant Pearson purchased SchoolNet, a tool that helps districts track students' achievement on standardized tests, for $230 million. Providence Equity Partners bought online educational platform Blackboard Inc. for $1.6 billion. For the low price of $13 million, K12 Inc. acquired Kaplan Virtual Education, which offers computer-based learning for public and private schools in nine states. (Disclosure: Kaplan Virtual Education was owned by Graham Holdings, which owns Slate.) In 2012, Apple also partnered with Pearson, McGraw-Hill, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to offer digital textbooks for the iPad. ""It's in the early stages. We know that there's potentially tons of revenue to be generated,"" Burch said. Campaign costs spiral Though few elections occurred in 2013 around the country, the education reform movement continued to inject an historic volume of funds into local and state races. The most expensive was the race for school board in Los Angeles that attracted more than $6 million in outside spending. In the month leading up to the May mayoral and city council election in Jersey City, N.J., the Better Education for New Jersey Kids, Inc., PAC dumped more than $342,000 into advertising and mailers. The PAC is associated with the nonprofit Better Education for Kids, which is not required to disclose its donors but lists Tepper among its trustees. A special legislative election in Wisconsin and a school board race in Seattle proved ripe battlegrounds for political spending arms races between education reformers and their opponents. In Denver County, Colo., a committee whose largest donors were Bloomberg and the political arm of education reform nonprofit Education Reform Now spent $103,000 on a school board race. In nearby Douglas County, Colo., the labor-backed Committee for Better Schools Now spent $935,000 on a school board race. That spending was countered by the Colorado chapter of Charles and David Koch's Americans for Prosperity Foundation, which claims to have spent $350,000 on campaign efforts. No public records exist of the group's spending. Each of these races suggests that education reform spending is going to continue on an upward trajectory, at least for the near future. ""Historically we haven't seen that kind of spending on school board races here [in Los Angeles], but it's likely to become a lot more commonplace in the future,"" said Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist who is running for California secretary of state. ""My guess is in five years, we'll be looking back at the relatively restrained fundraising levels of 2013 with some nostalgia.""

From the Associated Press: ""Republican Cornyn Wins Primary in Texas Over Tea Party Foe."" From Politico: ""Two Pillars of the Republican Establishment Crushed Their Tea Party-Inspired Primary Challengers in Texas."" Hadn't it just been a few days since the movement gathered in Washington and celebrated for its five-year jubilee? Hadn't Sen. Ted Cruz said they were winning? What happened? Nothing happened. That was the point. Neither Sen. John Cornyn nor Rep. Pete Sessions was ever at risk of losing his primary. The organizations and people that claimed these establishment Republicans were in danger inspired headlines, trend stories, TV buzz--fundraising. They followed that up by expending exactly zero effort. Tea Partiers and other conservatives did quite well down the ballot. On Wednesday morning, a Texas Tea Party organizer copied me on a memo about the votes in ""major races,"" like lieutenant governor and attorney general and various state legislative districts. He didn't mention Cornyn's campaign against Rep. Steve Stockman, or Sessions' 2-1 landslide over Katrina Pierson. You could describe the choice for activists as one between the scoreboard and the school board, between ""challenging"" the leaders of the GOP in a way the press can cover and changing the GOP with unsexy local election wins. Tuesday was an apocalypse for the team scoreboard. Stockman, who lost to Cornyn by 40 points, keeps getting eulogized as a ""Tea Partier."" That was never true. Stockman won an upset in 1994, the first modern Republican wave year, and lost in 1996, making such a buffoon of himself in the interim that future Republican leaders would cite him as a cautionary tale. He returned in 2012, running as ""Congressman Stockman,"" a title he hadn't held since Bill Clinton's first term. But his tactics never changed. Republican voters found ""conservative newspapers"" in their mail, loaded with negative stories about Stockman's opponent, yet mysteriously bereft of bylines or sources or anything about Stockman's own inscrutable finances. Stockman didn't run a Senate campaign. He ran a kamikaze mission with no fuel, map, or targets. He lied relentlessly, often through a Twitter account ghost-written by his spokesman and always in a manner that could be debunked with a quick phone call or Googling. Stockman claimed to have won ""Tea Party straw polls"" that were held months earlier. His campaign sites (which accepted bitcoin donations, naturally) featured a chintzy Photoshop that made it look like Cornyn had hugged Obama, and a list of ""past and present endorsements,"" one of them from an activist who'd been dead for most of 2013. Days before the election, Stockman claimed an endorsement from ""the head of one of the biggest Tea Party groups in America."" Jenny Beth Martin, the head of Tea Party Patriots, had not endorsed him. She'd given a nice quote about him to WND--in December. Actually, if you'd been following Stockman's race on WND, Tuesday's result would have stunned you. The conservative news site reported that Stockman was following a ""Cruz missile"" strategy and closing the gap with Cornyn, citing one Human Events/Gravis poll that ended up missing the result by 25 points. Jerome Corsi, the author of the investigative journalism classic Where's the Birth Certificate?, endorsed Stockman and wrote credulous WND columns about his race. Stockman had blown off Texas reporters and made no public campaign appearances since January. He gave Corsi an exclusive interview. The broader right has an uneasy relationship with Corsi and WND. It's not just that the site obsessively covered conspiracies about President Obama's citizenship or that it bought billboards to advance the conspiracies. It's that the site twins conservative news with get-rich-quick, survive-the-apocalypse, buy-buy-buy ad scams. Eric Hoffer's theory that every political cause becomes a ""business, then eventually degenerates into a racket,"" is proved every day at WND. It's proved in less noticeable ways on the email lists of defeated presidential candidates like Herman Cain that have been sold to quacks. Stockman was a uniquely incompetent scammer, but he didn't have the field to himself. The danger of ""scoreboard"" politics, of choosing big targets, is that you'll likely lose. The upside is that you'll definitely raise money. The Stockman race was a cruder, less ethical version of the Tea Party Leadership Fund's promise to ""Defeat Boehner."" Sure, the speaker of the House is even safer than Cornyn, but the Tea Party Leadership Fund has raised millions and kicked back most of it to consultants. And the ""Defeat Boehner"" campaign is mirrored by FreedomWorks, the Washington-based Tea Party group that's running its own ""Fire the Speaker"" campaign. The first time most national reporters heard of the Pierson-Sessions race was when FreedomWorks brought her to Washington, and FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe called her ""one of the best activists in Texas."" According to the Federal Election Commission's records of independent expenditure, FreedomWorks spent no money on Pierson's race. In the last week, the Conservative Campaign Committee spent around $16,000. The Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund spent around $5,000, having endorsed Pierson officially on Monday--the day before the primary. But FreedomWorks spent elsewhere. I asked what the group had done in Texas's primaries and got no response. If you'd been following FreedomWorks's claims about Texas, this didn't make much sense. The group had bet heavily on Cruz's 2012 primary campaign, sending its then-director of campaigns, Brendan Steinhauser, down to Texas to organize events. In July 2012, FreedomWorks brought 14,000 conservative activists to Dallas for a ""FreePAC"" rally in support of Cruz. In June, after former Obama campaign strategists started a voter registration program called Battleground Texas, FreedomWorks announced an agenda named for the flag of the Battle of Gonzales: ""Come and Take It."" Politico obtained the full plan, which asked for $7.95 million to blanket Texas in ads and full-time canvassers. The number was eye-popping--and fanciful. A few months after the ""Come and Take It"" announcement, FreedomWorks revealed that it had raised $40 million in 2012. BuzzFeed's Rosie Gray reported that less than $10 million had come in through 2013. FreedomWorks didn't deny this. Its spokeswoman cautioned that the group worked on a two-year fundraising cycle. But nothing suggested, then or now, that ""Come and Take It"" had evolved beyond a pitch to possible donors. It certainly couldn't save Katrina Pierson. And it couldn't tap Steinhauser, the organizer who'd worked in Texas on the Cruz project. In July, he was hired to run Cornyn's re-election bid. Texas reporters matter-of-factly mentioned Steinhauser's 2012 work. FreedomWorks took the unusual step of demanding a correction, telling the press that ""as a 501 (c3) and (c4) employee, Brendan Steinhauser was not involved in the decision to endorse Ted Cruz early in the Texas Republican primary."" That was a pointless distraction. Cornyn's campaign wasn't hurt in the slightest. His victory, and Sessions' victory, will end up convincing plenty of reporters that the GOP establishment has finally conquered the right. The outside groups that overpromised in Texas will raise money by promising to take better scalps in other races. The racket only stops when the checks stop."

""A couple of my favorites,"" he told the thousands of activists gathered at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference. The 2008 Republican nominee for president put on his best sarcastic face. ""Tell Vladimir I'll be more flexible when I'm re-elected."" McCain's eyes bugged out; he repeated the sentence: ""Tell Vladimir I'll be more flexible when I'm re-elected""? The senator issued a deep and mournful sigh, like some disappointed math teacher watching his student fail to carry the one for the umpteenth time. His crowd got the joke, though McCain had slightly bowdlerized the reference. In March 2012, at a summit in South Korea, President Barack Obama had one of his last meetings with outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. He was the only Russian head of state Obama had ever worked with, a placeholder from 2008 to 2012 until Vladimir Putin could legally return to power. Obama wanted him to tell Putin, who'd be back in a couple months, that he'd have ""more flexibility"" to oppose expanded missile defense in NATO nations once he'd dispatched Mitt Romney. Even at the time, Republicans didn't allow the remark to be about missile defense. It came to encompass everything Obama was surely hiding from the American voter. ""There's no time for our president to be pulling his punches with the American people,"" said Romney, ""and not telling us what he's intending to do with regards to our missile defense system, with regards to our military might and with regards to our commitment to Israel, and with regards to our absolute conviction that Iran must not have a nuclear weapon."" The Obama campaign swatted away the criticism. It was forgotten, like a lot of what McCain and Romney said about Russia, until Putin's soldiers started showing up on the Crimean peninsula. The Crimean crisis has retroactively proved right every critic of Obama foreign policies--name 'em, any of 'em. Obama has been shamed, rightfully so, for insisting that al-Qaida was obviously America's greatest geopolitical adversary and that anyone who doubted this lacked the wisdom to serve. He would say this right before claiming that al-Qaida had been ""decimated"" and sent ""on the run."" The media never caught the paradox because in the heat of a campaign, the quality of a zinger is only tangentially related to the truth of a zinger. Turns out the same thing is true in a war. The conflict in Ukraine has micced-up and emboldened anyone who warned that Obama's foreign policy would (or maybe was intended to) destroy America's clout. Count the ways. He didn't commit to missile defense in Europe. ""The Poles and the Czechs are already upset with the administration for pulling out our anti-ballistic missile defensive program that we were working on with them,"" said California Rep. Ed Royce on CNN this week. ""That gave us some real credibility with the Russians because we were setting up a program there to help defend Europe and the United States against Iran. The fact that we signaled that we were willing to do that in the face of Russian pressure makes the administration look weak."" He let sequestration happen. Ohio Rep. Mike Turner dropped that bomb in a Monday interview with Bloomberg TV. ""This is a result of what the United States is projecting,"" he said, ""imposing the sequester on our Department of Defense and cutting the military. This is a president that is retracting the U.S. policy at a time when obviously Russia sees an opportunity."" He didn't strike Syria. That's a bipartisan hawk complaint, one that came from Delaware Sen. Chris Coons at AIPAC and came again from Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a young Republican from whom the party expects great things. ""When you put a red line down--as done in Syria--and you fail to enforce that red line, this is the result you get,"" he said. ""People that are willing to test you."" He left men behind in Benghazi. It took South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham to go there, though it took long enough. ""It started with Benghazi,"" Graham wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. ""When you kill Americans and nobody pays a price, you invite this type of aggression. Putin basically came to the conclusion after Benghazi, Syria, Egypt--everything Obama has been engaged in--he's a weak indecisive leader."" He wears mom jeans. That was the succinct assessment of Sarah Palin, who had been derided in 2008 for saying that Obama's weakness would spur Russia to invade Ukraine and whose subsequent gloating has been calibrated for maximum liberal hate-clicking. ""People are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil,"" Palin told Sean Hannity, the most sympathetic conservative interviewer in the history of live television. ""They look at our president as one who wears mom jeans and equivocates and bloviates."" He let in too many Russian tourists. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio came up with this one, part of a very good week for a politician who thrives when he gets to question the tyranny-fighting mettle of the other side. ""The Obama administration should immediately add more Russian officials to the Magnitsky list,"" wrote Rubio in a quick Politico piece about America's options, ""which places travel bans and other sanctions on them--something President Obama failed to do in December."" In the Washington Convention Center, cheered on by AIPAC members, McCain was suggesting the very same thing. If it wanted to, ""the most powerful and biggest and strongest nation in the world"" could add some of these ""kleptocrats, these corruption people"" to a no-go list. ""It'd be their last trip to Las Vegas,"" he said. Decent line, depressing context. In that speech, just like in the interviews he'd done since the conflict started, McCain admitted that there was no military option that made sense in the Crimea. It was true when the tanks rolled into Budapest in 1956 and into Prague in 1968 and into Georgia in 2008. There were no mom jeans in the White House then; the invasions happened anyway. There was, by 2008, molecular-level fatigue about the war in Iraq, which limited America's options in the region and helped make a less interventionist candidate than McCain into the president of the United States. But Republicans can't say that."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/u_s_passport_why_is_the_american_passport_so_boastful.html	"Here's a change Obama can make by executive order: redesign the ""new"" U.S. passport adopted by the State Department in the late Bush years. Isn't it kind of an embarrassment? I knew nothing of the redesign until I renewed my passport last fall. While the cover is still in basic blue, what unfolds now inside is a whole tie-dyed history of the United States. On nearly all of its 26 multicolored pages, there are quotes from great Americans, usually presidents, or at least their speechwriters, pumping up America. Look, I'm a patriot, but aren't 26 pages of quotes overdoing it? There are little patriotic koans on page after page; first, one from Francis Scott Key, with a sketch of him, climbing the rigging of his ship, looking out over burning Baltimore, in its pre-Wire incarnation; then one from Lincoln; then a picture of a frightening American eagle, its eyes rolling as wildly as Jack Nicholson's in The Shining; then there is a page for you, the passport holder (yes, you still get a page); then the preamble to the Constitution; then Daniel Webster (""The principle of free government adheres to the American soil. It is bedded in it, immovable as its mountain.""); then a line from George Washington; then an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence, which does not identify Thomas Jefferson as the sole author, no doubt to the pleasure of John Adams; and then one from Martin Luther King Jr.; then come more pages, which belong respectively to John Kennedy, Theodore Roosevelt (""This is a new nation, based on a mighty continent, of boundless possibilities.""), Dwight Eisenhower (""Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America.""), and Lyndon Johnson; then the inscription from the golden railroad spike. Then, in the back of the book, like the back of the bus, quotes from Anna Julia Cooper, Ellison Onizuka, and a Mohawk Indian who isn't named. Should I go on? Well, the passport does, and by the last page we're orbiting the moon. I miss the way the old passport got to the point: ""The Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen/national of the United States named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful aid and protection."" This venerable request is still in there, but now it's competing with all this other patriotic blaring. Something about this passport doth seem to protest too much. Page after page, it starts to seem neurotic. A border guard might begin to wonder whether we're as wonderful and democratic as we insist we are. The old passports, not just in Jefferson's time, but in Lincoln's, in FDR's, had nothing to prove. We knew we were a democracy, and in fact the only real democracy. Without us, back then, there would be no democracy. But in the 21st century, we're just one of 150 or so. Look at Lincoln's quote on page 2: ""... And that government of the people, by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth."" In Lincoln's time it was literally true. If government by the people perished with us, it would perish from the earth. Now, like it or not, it wouldn't perish at all. I visited Germany in September to see part of the German election. It was civil, well-behaved: There was a large turnout. I had to go abroad to see what a civil, high-turnout election looks like. And I'll say this about Germany and countries like it: Even if their democracies are less than perfect, at least they don't endlessly gloat in their passports how they are the great democracy. They lead from behind as we now might say. They just try to set a good example. I met a woman from Australia at the German election night party. I showed her my passport, to let her get a quick history of the United States. Could I see what was in hers? After all, it's arguably Australia and not our country that's the No. 1 democracy: It has compulsory voting and the highest voting rate in the world. What's in the Australian passport? There are wombats, dingoes, koalas, emus, and kangaroos, but they don't say a word."	The U.S. Passport Is Absurdly Boastful	['Webster', 'Ellison', 'Obama']	[]

It temporarily rewired your brain. When from your hand let slip the rhyme'd page, backward did run the lines in your hot brain. Verily. This happened to me after watching the first eight episodes of House of Cards all at once. (I'm still in the first season; I also have a manual transmission). I felt the warp. I started thinking Congress was actually engaged in passing legislation. I walked around the house pursued by House Majority Whip Frank Underwood's aphorisms. There are two kinds of SodaStream users in this world. ... A real man can destroy his enemies just by hanging up his jacket. ... Salt is for weaklings. The show pays attention to the little details of Washington life--the different kinds of White House badges, the fetish for the president's pens, and the anonymous power of the black SUV. So as a part of the fever, I am newly alive to the details of my banal life. In the middle of a phone interview with a political strategist in one of this year's hot races, I suddenly felt like I was in the show. Not because we were having hike-up-your-pants-and-give-it-to-me-straight exchanges, but because a Washington behavior emerged that was such a part of the everyday commerce of this city, I was surprised it hadn't already appeared in the show: the power dynamics of checking your email. In its most benign form, this power move simply comes across as a kind of aphasia. You're doing an interview on the phone and suddenly your source starts to trail off. ""The president's health care plan isn't just bad for people who ... "" It might be that he's stopping to think of something even more interesting to say. Then he repeats himself, ""The president's health care plan isn't just bad ... "" Sometimes he just stops talking altogether. Or he quickens the sentences. You recognize this as a guilt reflex. He's trying to make up for the fact that he's been checking his email and getting distracted by its contents while he has ostensibly been carrying on a conversation with you. This is the electronic equivalent of the fellow who looks over your shoulder when you're talking to him at an event, to see if someone more important has come into the room. Washingtonians, like competitive and striving people everywhere, are terrified that they are going to miss something crucial. What you are saying has to be as important as what your source imagines is the most important revelation in his inbox. If a phone interview is scheduled for a half-hour, that doesn't mean you'll get a half-hour of a person's attention. Maybe you'll get 100 percent for part of the time and 44 percent for the rest. Or maybe you'll just get an even 72 percent. They are doing a status calculation about you, where you fit in, and what damage they will suffer from offering a lower percentage of attention to you than something else. If the interview is on background and not for quotation, sources can get so distracted by their email you wonder whether they're not also folding their laundry. The less benign form of this behavior is when checking email is used as a shield. You'll notice the aphasia kick in every time you ask a difficult question. They're stalling for time or they're hoping that the artificial interruption keeps you from pressing the point. It's a sleight of hand. They're trying to change an exchange of information into a vital interruption, like you've barged in during heart surgery. The least tolerable version of this behavior is when someone engages in email abuse in person. One source once scattered his devices out on the table before an interview--a tactic that Jane Goodall would have recognized as a primitive marking exercise. Nothing was going to get between this fellow and his emails. (If a LinkedIn notification came in, it might throw the entire exchange into turmoil.) Another time, a White House press secretary started the interview by pretending to stretch in order to get a glance at his screen. Eventually his contortions became so extensive and protracted, I thought he'd conclude the interview by going into child's pose. With some sources you allow the aphasia because while they're checking their email they're also forgetting their rote answers, or they're showing fear of a benign question in a way that can highlight what really worries them. Or, they're useful and goodhearted, but like the rest of us they are enslaved by their email and a world where everyone expects your answer immediately. (Imagine working for this guy!) In some cases, though, you can imagine what Frank Underwood would do if someone tried to hide behind their Very Important Emails. It is not physically possible to put an entire BlackBerry up someone's nose, but that's what makes fiction great."	How Washington Players Use Email to Denote Power, Hierarchy, and Rank	[]	[]

They start arriving at 5:30 p.m., some of them buying hotel-priced beverages from a pop-up bar, some of them moving immediately to the tables where they can sign up to help Katrina Pierson get elected to Congress. I pick up a door-hanger, one of thousands that will be deployed over the next week. It's like a Bayeux Tapestry of Tea Party history. There's the candidate, and beneath her are celebrities outdoing each other with superlatives for Pierson. She's ""utterly fearless,"" (Sen. Ted Cruz), ""a friend of America"" (blogger Michelle Malkin), ""a strict constitutionalist"" (Rafael Cruz, the senator's dad), and she ""doesn't care what's politically correct"" (Joe the Plumber). The other people who've shown up, all supporters of the candidate, are picking up campaign buttons and chatting about the 11th hour dredging-up of her 1997 arrest for shoplifting. ""She's always told the truth about that."" ""Look what she's done with her life! Can you say redemption?"" If there's one test for the Tea Party on the Texas ballot this year, it's here--it's Pierson versus Sessions. And the gathering tonight has all the trappings of a classic 9-12 meeting, from back when Glenn Beck still had an afternoon hour on Fox News. Shortly after 6:15 p.m., a MacBook is plugged into a projector. An image of a waving American and Texas flag pops up on a portable screen. We pledge allegiance to one flag, then the other, and then comes the invocation, all of it raising the ""meet and greet""--Pierson's 40th campaign event, she thinks--to the heights of solemnity. ""We ask for your anointing to be on Katrina, father,"" says Stephen Broden, a black conservative radio host who'd run for Congress four years earlier. ""Help her to articulate and to be the voice of the constitutionalists in this state. We ask that those who are here will come not merely to observe, but to participate."" Pierson, clad in a white dress and black fur wrap that people kept complimenting, bows her head. She's been running for five months, challenging incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions with the backing of national and local Tea Party groups. For years she worked as a hospital administrator who founded the Tea Party in Garland, a midsized city in the district; she went on to campaign for Cruz, jumping the bandwagon before the wheels were attached. ""Isn't it interesting,"" asks the evening's emcee, a Republican activist named Russell Ramsland, ""how many people now say they donated to Ted Cruz before the primary? And yet there's no record of their donations."" Pierson passes that litmus test, no sweat. ""I left the hospital, lived on my life savings--which will be gone really soon--to help elect Sen. Ted Cruz,"" she says. She speaks slowly and deliberately, with a sort of suspense, as if she's daring someone to leap up and interrupt her. ""When he won, we were happy, but crying, because everybody else lost."" Sessions had led the Republican campaign to take over the House, and it was hard to argue that he did that poorly. But he wasn't a Tea Partier, and he wasn't a star, and he wasn't trustworthy--not as far as the right could tell. ""He's pretty condescending,"" says Mike Wallis, a businessman who planned to take two weeks off to get out the vote for Pierson. Wallis had listened to Sessions, in March 2013, repeat the Republican line that sequestration would put pressure on the president to cut a health care deal. ""I was like, OK, he's a professional politician. But then Obama comes in, waves a magic wand, pays 75 percent of their health care costs, blows through the sequester. Sure, now he votes against the debt ceiling, because he's got to mollify the electorate in Dallas. He wouldn't do that if no one was running."" Exactly--Pierson was running to be everything Sessions couldn't. It's five years exactly since the Tea Party movement began, since CNBC commentator Rick Santelli stood on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade and decried plans to bail out the mortgages of ""losers."" And it had been less than two years since Cruz defeated Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in a primary runoff for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate. The Cruz win was a moon-shot moment, something you hear local Tea Partiers refer to constantly, proof that the establishment can be crippled by a well-timed kidney punch. This race isn't going as well, not nearly, but it's the race they've got. ""This particular race can really set the tone for the remainder of the 2014 cycle,"" Pierson says. ""We're the first in the nation. All those other races? Months away. When grassroots, in the stronghold of Karl Rove's district, oust the sitting chairman of the rules committee--self-proclaimed John Boehner's guy--we are going to have so much clout."" This year's Republican candidates are clinging to the Cruz name like it's the last life raft on a sinking yacht. Ken Paxton, a conservative running for attorney general, has bought TV ads that consist entirely of Cruz talking about him. Dan Branch, his chief opponent, has countered with endorsements from Cruz's legal advisers and reminders that he and Cruz ""fought religious discrimination and defended my moment of silence law."" Pierson's claim on the Cruz brand is more intimate. Nanoseconds after she announced for Congress, she was endorsed by FreedomWorks, the D.C.-based Tea Party powerhouse. FreedomWorks has warred for its own Cruz pixie dust--when Sen. John Cornyn's campaign hired the group's old grassroots coordinator Brendan Steinhauser, FreedomWorks insisted that he ""was not in charge of our political efforts in 2010 or 2012."" Steinhauser strayed, at least in the view of FreedomWorks. Pierson did not. She's a pure Tea Partier, one of the shrinking group of conservative activists who gained unimagined political stardom, compared to the average freshman congressman, thanks to media interest in the movement, especially from Fox News. She's biracial, which she insists will drive the left batty when (never ""if"") she wins. ""You could call me a racist,"" she says. ""Good luck with that! You could say I'm out there pushing the war on women. Good luck with that, too."" What does she want to do with this clout? ""My legislative priorities will definitively be the Constitution,"" she says, somewhat confusingly. ""That's what I've been on Fox News for the last five years for, and I'll fight for it every way I can."" Indeed, she's been a steady presence on Fox News and Fox Business, tapped to comment on divergent issues within the rubrics of ""black issues"" and ""things that might anger the Tea Party."" Her commentary on the gauche commercialization of MLK Day by brick-and-mortar businesses: ""You know, it's a free market capitalistic society, and I applaud them."" On the abuses of the National Security Agency and the deep state: ""How many congressmen have gone home to their constituencies and told them about the automatic biometric identification system that went into place in 2012?"" That did not happen, but Fox Business host Neil Cavuto was a perfect gentleman, and didn't press the point. Some of Pierson's appeal is visceral, personal, and she spends much of her speech describing how she clawed out of poverty and overcame tragedy, from laying with her grandmother when she was killed by a botched operation to finishing a college paper after her computer caught fire and deleted it. This campaign hasn't taken off like FreedomWorks wanted it to. Pierson's raised $76,000, a bit more than 5 percent as much as Sessions and a fraction of what Cruz raised before winning his race. Pierson, like the people in this room, believe that a politician like Sessions has adapted too well to a norm that should be unconscionable. That's clear throughout the night, from when a voter tells me that her Vietnamese friends have planned to commit mass suicide when America finally goes Communist to when Broden, the radio host, waves a Constitution in the air and demands the end of the Obama regime. ""When you read 'impeachable offenses,' and you read about 'treason,' and you read about 'high crimes and misdemeanors'--How many of you know it's a high crime to violate the Constitution?"" The crowd murmurs in disgusted agreement. ""This administration has done it repeatedly!"" Sessions, they say, has become complicit. Voter after voter says that the Benghazi attacks of 2012 should disqualify him from re-election. He runs the rules committee; he has not moved a bill that would create a special investigative committee. Pierson wants that committee yesterday, and doesn't believe Sessions' reasons for spiking it. Can Republicans wait two years and use Benghazi against Hillary Clinton? No. They can't risk it. ""Do the Clintons ever let a witness survive?"" Pierson's speech wraps after 45 minutes. The crowd takes its sweet time to exit. At worst, they're meeting and sharing ideas with a future Republican star; at best they're meeting with their next congresswoman. Ted Cruz won, and so can she. ""It's just like Nixon said,"" says Mike Wallis. ""I firmly believe there's that silent majority. Most Americans believe the same way, and they have the same core values. You just have to get to everybody, get 'em energized, and I think we can have another landslide like we did in 2010. The big thing they say about Cruz is that he has no plan for success. Of course not! But he fought. And when you fight, you prove there's a fight to be had."" Two days later, I catch up with Cruz at a speech in Beaumont, the place where the Texas oil rush began. Cruz's exact destination is the Spindletop-Gladys City Boomtown Museum, a barns-and-surreys recreation, where he can speak about his new energy bill between a podium and an antique oil well. After the speech, he takes a few questions and I ask him about Pierson and Paxton and the rest of the candidates copping his likeness for their campaign ads. ""Both Katrina and Ken are people I've worked with a long time,"" says Cruz. ""I know them, I respect and admire them, and I've said so publicly. The fact that some candidates have chosen to reference that--you know, what I think that's an acknowledgment of is the energy and the passion from the grassroots. I think that's seen as a sign from a candidate that they're going to listen to the grassroots as well. And I think every candidate should be held accountable by the grassroots. I think that dynamic is a very positive one. It's certainly a reality in Texas and beyond."" Half a dozen cameras are on hand to capture this. Dozens of people are there to listen and ask Cruz to speak at their local party events. Sen. John Cornyn, who's actually on the ballot in a couple of weeks, hasn't been getting anything like this kind of attention, or these kinds of questions. One local TV reporter hounds Cruz on the way out to ask him, ""Are you gonna go for it? Are you gonna run in 2016?"" Cruz doesn't answer that question, though he gets it all the time. It's five years since the Tea Party started and the movement sees no limit to what it can achieve, or who it can force out of politics. A few hours later, Sarah Palin endorses Katrina Pierson for Congress."	The Tea Party in Texas Doesn't Have Much Left Beyond Ted Cruz's Name	['Cruz', 'Obama', 'Russell', 'Nixon']	[]

You're probably not thinking much about it, which is healthy. No wonder you're looking so trim and your cheeks are pink. But the candidates in the thick of it can't ignore the noise, and that's not healthy. In the political world, the pace of 2016 conversation has been quickening. Will the George Washington Bridge investigation kill New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's chances? Is it smart for Republicans to keep talking about the Clinton-era scandals?  The latest round of analysis has been kicked off by the disclosure of 27,000 emails from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's staff. In 2009 and 2010 when he was Milwaukee County executive, his staffers were coordinating his political activity while on government time, which is illegal. If you haven't heard about these emails, don't let anyone know or a member of the Democratic National Committee will visit you to perform a live reading. (As I type this, an email has arrived from the Democratic Governors Association linking to an editorial calling on Walker to disclose what he knew). Trying to evaluate the political impact of events almost two years before the first primary is not an effective use of time. Voters are living their lives and not paying attention, and other issues will be more important come voting time. But potential presidential candidates can't ignore these developments. They have to weigh their significance even to dismiss them. The corrosion of the campaign is now taking up more time in their day. Hillary Clinton has lived in this world since her husband announced he was running for president, and retirement hasn't shielded her from the heat. Walker and Christie have been covered closely at the national level, but they are facing a new kind of teeth cleaning as potential presidential leaders. Each of these politicians deserves some of the scrutiny--government investigations are news, so are the private diaries of close friends--but the permanent partisan war increases the intensity and the tempo of each new development. My inbox is full of Democrats trying to diminish Walker's chances in his re-election this year, damage his aspirations for the future, or paint a negative image of the GOP by exposing one of its leading lights. Last week the Republican National Committee chairman was using the latest news about Hillary Clinton as an organizing tool. All of this swirl leads to a back-and-forth about relative levels of sin. Was Hillary Clinton's abuse of power in the Travelgate firings worse than Christie's Bridgegate? Is Bridgegate worse than Bengahzi? The DNC wants us to compare Walker's troubles to Christie's. The candidate reaction to increased scrutiny is timidity and increased calculation. The level of attention and constant pressure is likely to squeeze out the innovation, risk-taking, and spark that we want in our presidential candidates. If they can somehow retain these qualities, they don't dare show them, for the searchlights will be on them immediately. There was once a period in which two years before the primaries presidential candidates could roam around Iowa and New Hampshire without these constraints. That gave us a better chance to see them before they were encased like Robocop in armor and artifice. It wasn't a genuine view, but it was less rigid than the full battle-readiness now required. Christie's office used to promote YouTube videos of the governor in heated conversations with constituents. No more of that now--the governor doesn't want to reanimate the image of him as a bully. So after his latest town hall, the governor's office released a picture of him giving a little girl a high-five. Next week: puppies. The early onslaught has other downsides. Candidates must raise more money than ever to battle against being defined too early (as Mitt Romney was). That means more time in double-staircase mansions shaking the tin cup and more attention spent answering and anticipating the fishtailing attacks being peddled in the noise machine. It also means more time playing tit-for-tat. So Walker is on the defensive about his emails and he sends a little return fire aimed at Clinton, who he said was a creature of Washington with few achievements. The earlier you have to retreat to friendly venues like the Hugh Hewitt radio show, the greater chance you'll stay in that comfortable space and not venture out to more challenging venues, which might illuminate who you are or what substance you bring. The early onset of the campaign vise means that if a candidate ever makes it to the White House, she has been under the klieg lights for so long that her equanimity is a faded memory. Campaigns have always been high-pressure and absurd, but when they started later, candidates had time to engage in activities unrelated to campaigning, which meant they might stumble on a few talents that could be useful in governing. Now, the earlier campaigns start, the earlier you have to start campaigning. In both Christie's and Walker's cases, their troubles result from staffer's plotting for the next election. The 2012 presidential campaign wasn't uplifting, nourishing, or full of worthwhile debates about the issues of the day. It could have been. The debates were there to be had. It just never felt like they genuinely took place. Everyone gets a share of the blame for that, particularly those of us in the press, but part of what made things so calorie-free is that the candidates had become habituated to offering only the safest bromides. The earlier candidates get into the micro-cycle of answering attacks and launching them, the greater likelihood we're all going to get stuck going around the same stingy circle from now until November 2016.

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/john_cornyn_is_crushing_the_tea_party_in_texas_the_senior_senator_doesn.html	"HOUSTON--A pattern was beginning to emerge: Sen. John Cornyn entering a room and discovering people who sound much more conservative than he sounds. On Tuesday morning, shortly after early voting began in his primary, the senior senator from Texas rolled into the offices of a local courier service to accept an endorsement from the National Federation of Independent Businesses. He shook hands and took his place at a table of job creators, asking them for ideas to bring back to Washington, apologizing for what the city had wrought. ""What I regret is that the federal government, instead of facilitating what you do--encouraging it, incentivizing it--is doing the opposite,"" said Cornyn. ""[Former Sen.] Phil Gramm used to talk about doing the Lord's work in the devil's city. Sometimes I think it's like a forward operating base in hostile territory."" Will Newton, the well-attired executive director of the NFIB in Texas, went with it. ""One of the old leaders of the NFIB in Washington is famous for saying that he considered Washington, D.C., a 'work-free drug zone,' "" he said. Everyone broke out laughing. So did Cornyn. A little while later, a trucking company owner named Darrin Forse went on a tear. ""You get people to come in and apply for jobs,"" said Forse. ""First thing they ask is, 'What's it gonna pay?' The government's giving them whatever they want anyway. A lot of them come up and sign a card and say, 'OK, I can get another free check and whatever else.' That's what's happened. They're getting their insurance for nothing, and here we are, the working people."" Cornyn's eyes darted around the table, seeking someone else to talk to, finding him in another businessman who'd talk more generally about Obamacare. The roundtable only lasted 30 minutes, and the crowd wasn't hostile. It just wasn't satisfied as the senator explained that the GOP could finally deliver for them if it won six more Senate seats. It wasn't quite satisfied with Cornyn. Still, Cornyn isn't losing. Observers outside Texas have not convinced themselves of this fact. Last week Cornyn joined GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell and cast a vote for a one-year delay in the debt limit, punting the issue past the 2014 elections. In Washington this was portrayed as Frodo and Sam locking arms and walking to the mouth of Mount Doom. ""[Sen. Ted Cruz] had forced McConnell, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and other Republicans to cast votes that could cause them to lose primaries to weaker general-election candidates,"" wrote Dana Milbank. ""Mr. McConnell and Mr. Cornyn chose to expose themselves to primary attacks,"" wrote two of the New York Times' lead political writers. The open secret is that Cornyn isn't facing a typical primary challenge. He's facing the sort of ""threat"" that used to meet incumbents in the Bush years, before the Tea Party, when a few candidates would put their name on the ballots, spend a few thousand dollars, and lose. McConnell's consistently ahead of his primary opponent, but Cornyn is seen to be so far ahead of his field that the usual Texas pollsters haven't even bothered checking. The void has been filled by polls paid for by conservative media. The latest poll, which suggested that Cornyn could win less than 50 percent of the vote in the primary and be forced into the runoff, ricocheted around a movement/Twittersphere/blogosphere that badly wants a race. Cornyn's opponents want a race, too, though it can be hard to tell. Hours before the filing deadline, four months before the vote itself, East Texas Rep. Steve Stockman entered the race. Few Texans have seen him since then. Stockman had won in the 1994 GOP wave, lost in 1996, spent nearly a decade caring for a father with Alzheimer's, and returned in one of the new seats created by redistricting. He legislated by tweet and by press release, all crafted with care to get ""likes"" on the right and outraged reactions on the left. That's exactly how he's run for Senate, a race he started nearly $100,000 in the hole. One campaign office was condemned. After he tweeted, ""If babies had guns, they wouldn't be aborted,"" and it caught on, he started selling the recycled quip as a bumper sticker. Reporters don't know where he's campaigning, or whether he's campaigning at all--when I asked a spokesman, he said, ""We're not interested."" On Tuesday, as Cornyn campaigned in Houston, Stockman's campaign Twitter account claimed--five times--that Cornyn had declared Ted Cruz a ""threat"" to the nation. Cornyn hadn't even said that. It didn't matter. The point was that he wasn't Ted Cruz, that Cruz had managed to win a primary in 2012 by making it into a runoff, and that conservatives could force Cornyn into a runoff if they believed hard enough. The point is that every conservative knows at least a few people who want to protest Cornyn. Some of them even show up to his rallies. ""I can't say I'm against the senator,"" said Bud Johnson, a businessman who showed up at the NFIB roundtable. ""I've just got a real problem with the growth of Washington. When I was in graduate school, I used to get the federal register delivered to my house. It was a few pages. I think it was 75,000 pages last year. When we start controlling the light bulbs in people's homes, we've gone awry."" Two days earlier, in the East Texas town of Longview, Cornyn had joined Karl Rove and country singer Neal McCoy for a two-hour fundraiser and jamboree. Mickie Hand, a local Republican parliamentarian, danced in the aisles as McCoy's band played a cover of ""Billie Jean."" Her necklace, a cross built with nails, swayed as she moved. She paused just long enough to condemn Cornyn's debt limit vote. ""If every household did that, we'd be broke,"" said Hand. ""But we have a good senator in there who has time, who's worked his way up. I'm very hesitant to get rid of that for someone who's not overwhelmingly better."" Over a long afternoon, I heard many, many iterations of that sentiment. Cornyn was tolerable at best; his opponents weren't worth looking at. One Longview donor who'd shelled out to attend a pre-jamboree fundraiser with Cornyn and Rove started to tell me that her party needed to recapture the center, or else it couldn't win in Texas. Realizing what she'd said, she asked me not to use her name. My search for some actual enthusiasm led me to a college auditorium in Arlington, Texas, where the six Senate candidates who were not Cornyn or Stockman held their final pre-vote debate. One of them, Ken Cope, had asked Stockman to quit the race because his ""antics and embarrassing actions will steal the limelight from the serious candidates."" Another candidate, Dwayne Stovall, actually knew Stockman. ""He's not a stupid guy,"" Stovall told me over chips and salsa at a sports bar near campus, as a trio of undergrads sang along to Beyonce songs on an iPhone. ""He's been perpetually trying to be a politician for decades. I think he saw the writing on the wall and said, Cornyn's gonna be in a runoff. The polls said that six months ago. He rolled the dice. I just wish I knew that when we had breakfast two weeks before he got into the race and he asked how much I'd raised. If I'd have went, 'I have $5 million in the bank and I'm gonna whip him!' then I don't think he'd have gotten in."" Stovall had not raised $5 million. He was running $4,975,000 short of that. He was driving around Texas, trying to sync up campaign events with the schedule of his emissions-testing business. ""You're looking at a guy who puts 100,000 miles on his car every year,"" said Stovall. He'd showed up at Tea Party meetings and candidate forums, winning endorsements after nine of them. And it was easy to see why. Stovall, a former high school wrestler with a shaved head, described a political awakening that started when he was traveling internationally for his old business, linking up with builders in Japan or the Middle East. They explained all the benefits that came America's way because the dollar was the reserve currency. Stovall looked at America's debt obligations and imagined how the party would end. ""There's not enough currency in circulation on the planet to pay that off,"" he said, ""and yet we think we can keep on doing it."" Stovall had gotten some pre-primary publicity, finally, with that old standby of the underfunded candidate: a viral YouTube video. In his most widely circulated statement of principles, Stovall sat on a pickup truck with his dog and listed the crimes of John Cornyn. ""You don't stab her in the back by voting for cloture on Obamacare,"" he said, referring to Texas. ""You don't enslave its children with unconstitutional laws and overwhelming debt. And you certainly don't do all this to please some guy that looks and fights like a turtle."" Cue: a picture of Mitch McConnell and a cartoon turtle. Stovall thought the ad was ridiculous. He'd shot it weeks before, and told the campaign not to run it. Then came the debt vote, which made the ad look prophetic; Stovall told his team to ""cut it loose."" The attention paid to that video boosted him almost as much as it depressed him. ""You talk about the Congress enslaving your kids and future generations for no other reason than to grow this government, nothing. You put a talking dog and a turtle in the media, and people talk."" Tuesday night, Cornyn's campaign arrived at a Republican donor's home in the exclusive Royal Oaks neighborhood of Houston. Young professionals, neatly dressed from days at the law firm or the medical device company, paid $25 each for a meet-and-greet. The whole thing was put on by Maverick PAC, started by veterans of the George W. Bush campaign who now find themselves representing the center, if not the left, of their party. They drank wine or light beer and ambled through the house until about 8 o'clock, when Cornyn and local Rep. Ted Poe were shepherded to the living room. ""Personal involvement is what's required for a democracy to secede,"" said Poe. He corrected himself. ""Succeed! Not secede. That's what Texas is gonna do!"" Everybody laughed at the accidental joke, but just in case, Poe waved his hand, looking at Cornyn, as if deleting the comment in the air. The senator took his place. ""It's pretty hard for anybody to get to my right, I have to tell you, when it comes to the issues,"" said Cornyn. ""It's important to welcome people who maybe don't agree with us 100 percent of the time. The fact of the matter is that that's an impossible standard. How do we accomplish 80 percent of what we want?"" The young professionals, people who'd be funding Republican campaigns for decades to come, nodded and kept listening. ""I've found this to be an irrefutable rule of politics,"" said Cornyn. He brought his right hand down on his left, like a gavel hitting a desk. ""The candidate who gets the most votes wins."""

In fact, let's not discuss any of the ""events"" in the Clinton marriage. You should embrace this view whether you think Hillary Clinton should be president or not. First, we'll start with the Republicans who are revisiting these issues or flirting with them. Talking about Bill Clinton's personal relationships, or the scandals of the Clinton years, is likely only to improve Hillary Clinton's standing with the public. In the 1990s, Hillary Clinton's approval rating went up when her husband's affair with an intern was on the front pages. Politicians who bring up these issues risk reanimating these feelings of sympathy. It also diminishes you in the process. If there is some way in which this old topic can be potent, talking about it now, almost three years before an election, is too early to affect anyone's thinking. Mostly, though, going down this road conveys the feeling that Republicans are obsessed. The verdict the country rendered during the Clinton impeachment trial was that the obsession had gotten in the way of reason. In the elections of 1998, which Republicans tried to make a referendum on Clinton's morality, Democrats lost no ground in the Senate and picked up five seats in the House--a historic aberration. It was the first time since 1822 that the nonpresidential party had failed to gain seats in the mid-term election of a president's second term. You can try to convince people that Bill Clinton's behavior is important, but while you're doing that you're not talking about whatever programs you support that are actually going to improve people's lives. During the 1990s, voters decided that they preferred peace and prosperity to moralizing. Why then, when there is anemic prosperity and a much more dangerous world, would people be interested in pawing over that old ground? Sen. Rand Paul, who hopes to run for president, has talked the most about Bill Clinton as a ""sexual predator."" Perhaps it's a bid to show evangelicals in the Republican Party that he shares their moral code. But throwing ""red meat"" to evangelical voters feels awfully 1996--a conventional and tiny approach to coalition building when held up against Paul's larger sweeping promises of creating a futuristic new coalition that attracts Millennials, conservatives, and libertarians. If you are a Republican and you are asked about these issues, you should follow the example of Mitt Romney. On Meet the Press he said if Hillary Clinton ran for office, she should be judged on her career and not on her husband's past personal failings. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican Party, is following a more dangerous path. In the last few days he has been tweeting about Clinton with a frequency usually reserved for attacking Obamacare but with far less obvious cause. ""Remember all the Clinton scandals,"" he writes. ""That's not what America needs again."" The Tweet links to a site that asks people to sign a petition to ""keep the Clintons out of the White House."" The Clintons are unpopular in conservative circles, so the RNC is using their name as flypaper to get conservative voters to sign a meaningless petition, with the genuine purpose of capturing their email addresses. (Later they can be asked for money or other kinds of support.) That in itself isn't a big risk to the party, but the risk it flirts with is that the Clinton attacks distract the GOP from its primary goal: presenting a vision for the future. The post-election party autopsy that wrestled with creating a modern GOP that spoke to women and minorities claimed that the GOP was too old and backward-looking. It quoted from focus groups in which former Republicans described the party as ""scary,"" ""narrow minded,"" ""out of touch,"" and the party of ""stuffy, old men."" Reprising the anti-Clinton talking points of the 1990s will not help undo those impressions. If you are in Hillary Clinton's camp, the reasons to not talk about Monica Lewinsky are obvious. It diminishes Hillary by defining her simply as a spouse. But even engaging in a debate about whether this is a worthy topic of conversation is a trap for Hillary fans. Every second you spend dismissing it implicitly supports the idea that it is a worthy topic in evaluating her qualifications for the presidency. That keeps the issue alive, which at the very least creates a fog through which it's harder to make the new Clinton pitch if she decides to run. If you're not rooting for Clinton one way or another and are just interested in presidential politics, then you can safely avoid this issue without being bereft of things to talk about. Hillary Clinton was a senator, ran a rocky but nearly successful presidential campaign, and served as secretary of state. There are at least 10 questions worth analyzing from these years that would actually bear on what kind of a president she would be. That's enough to keep us all busy."

Vivek Murthy, the 36-year-old nominee to become the next surgeon general, may have supported Barack Obama for president and agreed with his political views. You're still sitting, right? That's good. Murthy's done a downright terrible job of concealing his liberalism. Not long after his residency, the Yale-educated doctor and MBA co-chaired Doctors for Obama--look, right there in the name!--and campaigned to elect a Democratic president. After Obama took the White House, Doctors for Obama became Doctors for America, and Murthy promoted the Affordable Care Act. On his Twitter feed, Murthy chatted with organizers and boosted the Obama re-election campaign and even criticized the NRA. This tweet still haunts Murthy. As of last week, his nomination hangs in jeopardy because Senate Democrats--who can afford to lose every Republican vote and four of their own--aren't confident they can confirm him. Months after reforming the filibuster, after lowering the vote threshold from 60 to 51, Democrats are facing their second defeat of a nominee in less than a month. The most-stated reason is that in his tweets and in his work at DFA, Murthy couldn't help himself from criticizing guns as a ""health care issue."" In a post-Sandy Hook letter, DFA even supported an assault weapons ban. He earned the ire of the National Rifle Association, and the NRA scared off the necessary rump of Democrats. Every other Democrat, in Congress and in the White House, is baffled. They went into the confirmation vote for Justice Department nominee Debo Adegbile expecting to lose a few of their own--Adegbile had joined a defense team for Mumia Abu-Jamal and criticized the role of race in the justice system--but not to lose. Joe Biden didn't show up for the vote to lose. He expected to cast a tie-breaking aye. They didn't expect the NRA to oppose a nominee for surgeon general because, as one White house source put it, when has that ever happened? Here's the irony: By ending the filibuster, and by allowing the 55-seat Democratic caucus to confirm nominees with no Republican buy-in, the majority has complicated life for its red-state members. They can no longer expect a Republican filibuster to kill a ""controversial"" nomination. They have to kill the nominations themselves. That's a challenge, because the Murthy nomination went from yawn-inducing to Fox News A-block material faster than any of them noticed. Day by day: Feb. 4: Murthy appears before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. His opening statement makes no mention of the gun tweets (and why would it), and he rather cheekily describes Doctors for America as an organization designed to ""strengthen dialogue between physicians, patients, and policymakers about pressing health matters."" Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander calls him out on this. ""Much of your credential, it seems to me, is a political credential,"" says Alexander. Murthy had advocated for the Affordable Care Act, when there was ""at least a large majority of Americans and a large number of the Congress who disagree with that law."" He'd tweeted critically of the NRA, when ""Americans have a First Amendment right to advocate for the Second Amendment or any amendment."" Murthy backs down immediately, saying his priority in office would be fighting obesity, not gun ownership. ""My concerns with regard to issues like gun violence have to do with my experience as a physician,"" he says, ""seeing patients in emergency rooms."" The issue seems to peter out. Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi says he's ""glad"" Murthy walked back the gun talk, and adds that ""in the West, violence is mostly caused by people taking away guns."" Feb. 10: The conservative press catches on. Emily Miller, a former Republican flack-turned-author/editor with a focus on gun rights, devotes her Washington Times column to the ""rabidly anti-gun"" Murthy. The doctor, she warns, is a ""political lackey"" who's opposed by at least one former surgeon general and whose ""Twitter timeline is chock full of his anti-firearm screed."" Feb. 26: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul sends Majority Leader Harry Reid a letter announcing his intention to put a hold on the Murthy nomination. ""In his efforts to curtail Second Amendment rights, Dr. Murthy has continually referred to guns as a public health issue on par with heart disease and has diminished the role of mental health in gun violence,"" writes Paul. ""As a physician, I am deeply concerned that he has advocated that doctors use their position of trust to ask patients, including minors, details about gun ownership in the home."" Reid's office hardly tries to suppress the chortle. ""As the sun rises in the East,"" says Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson, ""Sen. Paul has placed yet another hold on yet another qualified nominee."" On the same day, the NRA sends a letter to Reid and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell officially opposing the nomination. Feb. 27: The HELP committee moves Murthy's nomination to the full Senate on a 12-9, party-line vote. March 5-6: Eight Democrats join every Senate Republican in voting down the nomination of Debo Adegbile. The next day, in an atypically dramatic speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey tells the story of how conservatives built on the effort of the Fraternal Order of Police and took down Adegbile. Democrats who didn't join the GOP, like New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, take press release mortar fire from Republicans and local press. March 11-12: At the start of the Senate's last week before a short recess, Fox News starts covering the Murthy nomination. ""Do you want a partisan physician?"" asks Elisabeth Hasselbeck, rhetorically. Megyn Kelly's prime-time show books Chris Cox, the NRA executive who wrote the no-Murthy letter, where he claims the nominee ""is hell-bent on treating a constitutional freedom like a disease."" March 14: Toomey, the co-author of the 2013 gun control amendment that the NRA opposed, comes out against the Murthy nomination. ""Dr. Murthy, as the president of a partisan political organization, has been an active promoter of Obamacare,"" he explains. ""Dr. Murthy also has advocated for policies that would erode our important Second Amendment rights."" Later that day, the New York Times runs ahead of the curve and reports that the Senate is ""balking"" at a vote on Murthy, with ""as many as 10 Democrats"" refusing to vote aye. That piece ran before senators scrambled for their home states. That's made it easier for Democrats to dodge questions (pesky reporters can't collar them in the Capitol) and wait for the White House to use the media and other channels to resuscitate the nomination. While they wait, they convince Republicans that they are white-knuckle panicked about losing the Senate this year--and, as Democrats tend to do, they confuse the trappings of panic for the sort of moderation that voters like."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/defending_obamacare_why_aren_t_democrats_using_the_approach_republicans.html	"Late last year, on the first day that Arkansans could buy into the state's ""private option"" for expanded Medicaid, a farmer named Mary Francis Perkins got herself covered. Then she got famous. A media firm, which had been tracking the progress of the private option, stayed in touch with Perkins and shot her story for an ad. At the start of January, voters in a special senate election saw Perkins, in her home, explaining how Obamacare actually did her good. ""Because of my Parkinsons, I've been denied health insurance for years,"" said Perkins into the camera. ""Thanks for Arkansas's private option, I'm covered now."" Her story and the possible fate of Medicaid-deprived hospitals were framed as reasons to vote against Republican state Senate candidate John Cooper. Millions of dollars have been spent this year on Obamacare-related TV ads. Many of them featured people who look just like Perkins, but blamed the new law for ripping away their coverage at moments of ill health and weakness. Millions were spent in Florida's special House race, the one that Democrats blew a 20-point lead to lose, the one Republicans claim to have won by ripping apart Obamacare. Democrats, being Democrats, are hopelessly divided. Do they keep panicking and finessing the law, as candidate Alex Sink did in Florida? Or do they ""go on offense"" and explain what would be lost if the Republicans won? The Perkins video appears to be an outlier--the only ad in which Democrats defended the health care law by talking to someone who benefited from it. Steve Spencer, who shot the video, said it was easy to shoot but hard to find a taker for it. ""There are compelling stories out there,"" says Spencer, ""but who can afford to air enough ads to balance the Koch brothers?"" That's the irony: Democrats perfected this strategy, and Republicans have turned it against them. Americans for Prosperity, founded and partially funded by David and Charles Koch, has found tremendous success with its sob-story ads. When Democrats or fact-checkers have complained about them, they've been accused of bullying ""cancer patients,"" and the search for victims has proceeded. ""Some we've seen from interviews on other news/media,"" says AFP spokesman Levi Russell. ""Some came to us directly, others we found through their congressman."" Republicans, whose desires sync up nicely with AFP's, have crowd-sourced the effort. In January, House Republicans designed an online form to collect complaints from average Americans who hated the law, for whatever reason--""higher premiums,"" ""lost coverage,"" ""website problems."" Democrats scoffed, but then more than a dozen Republicans showed up at the State of the Union with special guests--real Americans who hated the health care law. In March, when Sen. Harry Reid started attacking the ""phony"" anti-Obamacare campaigns being funded by ""the Koch brothers,"" Republicans accused him of demeaning real people suffering from the law he'd never read. ""There's no question that all the attacks have a chilling effect,"" says Russell. ""I've talked with a number of people with very compelling personal stories, but are nervous about speaking out. I have no doubt that is exactly the strategy from Reid and others who are working overtime to destroy the credibility of anyone willing to speak up."" But the Kochs, in the depths of their nefariousness, were just copping a trick from the Democrats. In 2012, the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA realized it would be outspent by Republicans--the Koch brothers being the easiest to demonize--and came up with a narrative strategy. Research director Brennan Bilberry, then just 26, tracked down workers who'd felt victimized by Bain Capital's investments and sell-offs. They appeared on camera, and the resulting ads cut Romney so badly that he never recovered in Michigan or Ohio. Bilberry did the same for Terry McAuliffe's 2013 campaign for governor of Virginia, driving around coal country to find people who'd lost out on a settlement approved by the Democrat's opponent. ""Political people hate to admit this, but the press is a good partner if you're looking for stories,"" says Bilberry. ""If you've been running campaigns for years, you probably can find people through local organizations, through your field team. They probably know people who've been affected in a positive way."" Maybe they do, but Democrats haven't figured out how to reach them. Take Families USA, the decades-old health care awareness organization, which regularly connects journalists to sources. Last October, Families USA received $1 million from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to finance more reporting, more vetting, more sharing of stories. That money helped Families USA expand its team of full-time vetters from one to three. It has not, so far, helped any Democrats running terrified from Obamacare. ""We do not pass along stories to political campaigns,"" says Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA. ""When reporters are doing stories, we pass on leads--that's what we call them--if the individuals consent. But we do not ever send stories to political campaigns."" The campaigns will simply have to find the stories on their own. They've done this before, and located blue-collar-looking people to make the argument for liberalism. Hey, they even did it with Obamacare, when a group called Know Your Care turned the story of one bagel shop owner into a happy cinema verite case study. But Know Your Care's been dormant for more than a year. Democrats need to find Obamacare success stories when few want to fund the work, during a midterm election when all the key races are on Republican turf, while the donors are already thinking about 2016. ""There simply is no liberal Koch operation,"" complains Paul Begala, a former Clintonite and a strategist for Priorities USA in 2012. ""Rather than a national ad campaign, which is not realistic, Dems should look to smart 2014 candidates to engage this issue along [these] lines. Once someone does it, and it works, others will replicate in their states/districts. Do I think Dems should respond to the Koch ads? Absolutely. But it is going to be a piecemeal response."" Even then it's not a guaranteed winner. Mary Francis Perkins did everything Democrats could have asked for. They lost the special election anyway. The ""private option"" that saved Perkins was nearly killed by a Republican legislature that's on track to win in November."	Why Aren't Democrats Taking This Simple Approach to Defending Obamacare?

In the case of Senate investigators, you do it by adopting some of their methods. During the five year investigation into the CIA interrogation and detention program, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, working in a windowless room at the spy agency's headquarters, suspected that key documents had been removed from their computer network. Luckily, they had a hard copy. To keep it from being destroyed, Senate sleuths spirited the document from the CIA and put it in a safe in the Hart Senate Office Building. The move set off a chain of events that broke open on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the intelligence committee, accused the CIA of spying on her investigators. CIA Director John Brennan insists the CIA isn't trying to thwart her investigations. The Justice Department is now conducting two inquiries: one looking into whether the CIA illegally snooped on congressional investigators and another looking into whether those investigators broke the law. The accusations include lying to Congress and to the Justice Department, and spying on congressional investigators to hide what the CIA was doing. Frank Underwood will no doubt be weighing in soon. Since the rolling revelations from Edward Snowden began last year, members of Congress tasked with overseeing the government's sprawling spy network have been trying to find a new balance between security and civil liberties. The president says there have been no abuses but admits that some changes must be made. This public struggle between Feinstein and the CIA illustrates just how hard it is to keep an eye on people who are paid to go undetected. Even if Feinstein's accusations aren't true, the painstaking process of cat and mouse that is revealed in this story suggests that the oversight process is so time-consuming, frustrating, and opaque that it's almost impossible to apply the necessary scrutiny to the numerous programs that make up the government's intelligence system. It's hardly news that the intelligence community resists congressional oversight, but it usually appears to be part of the predictable tussle--resistance based on a desire to maintain the secrecy of security techniques that keep everyone safe. Feinstein's accusations have nothing to do with that. She is claiming that the CIA engaged in a prolonged effort to cover its tracks and that this deception now includes a trumped-up Justice Department criminal report alleging that Senate investigators broke the law. We are no longer in a predictable fight between two branches of government anticipated by the framers. These are public accusations of criminal activity and a cover-up. It's a class of warfare that people have been craving since Snowden started leaking secrets about the U.S. surveillance state. Whether you think the intelligence agencies have gone too far or not, it's important to have the people's representatives battling for their right to do the job the Constitution puts before them. Otherwise the system gets out of whack. That was one of the lessons of Snowden's revelations and it's also the point of the story Feinstein took to the Senate floor to tell. The saga starts in 2006, when members of the intelligence committee were first briefed about a CIA interrogation program that had been in place since 2002. This briefing initiated an investigation by Senate staffers who by 2009 offered a preliminary report on the program that Feinstein described as ""chilling"" and far different and harsher than the way the CIA had described it in the past. The first level of oversight had failed massively. The findings from the first review initiated another one by the committee--a second attempt at oversight--which the CIA fought at every turn, according to Feinstein. They dumped an un-indexed 6.2 million documents on the Senate committee and requested that each document go through a multilevel review process before handing it over, making the investigation tedious and protracted. As investigators waded though the documents, some of the information that had been initially provided by the CIA started to disappear from the computer network. When asked about the unauthorized removal, the CIA blamed contractors, and then said the order had come from the White House. In 2010, Feinstein had to get the White House counsel to resolve the matter and order the CIA to return the missing documents, which it did. Not long after, documents started going missing again. This batch of ghost papers would come to be known as the ""Panetta review,"" referring to Leon Panetta, the former CIA director. They represented an internal summary of what had been provided to the intelligence committee. ""What was unique and interesting about the internal documents was not their classification level, but rather their analysis and acknowledgment of significant CIA wrongdoing,"" said Feinstein. The power of these Panetta documents and the fact that they had gone missing didn't become apparent until the Senate put together its final report in 2012, six years after first learning about the program and 10 years after the program had started. The CIA responded to the 6,300-page Senate report with a 122-page rebuttal in June 2013. What surprised investigators was that the agency's rebuttal contradicted the conclusions that had been in the Panetta documents. ""Some of these important parts [of the Senate report] that the CIA now dispute ... are clearly acknowledged in the CIA's own internal Panetta review,"" said Feinstein. ""How can the CIA's official response to our study stand factually in conflict with its own internal review?"" The contradiction suggests that the CIA was trying to conceal its wrongdoing when it removed the Panetta documents from the network investigators were using. Fortunately for Senate investigators they had printed out the Panetta review before it disappeared. When they saw the discrepancy between what had been written internally and what was being said in public, they decided to remove the physical copies from the CIA in case someone there tried to destroy them as they had previous evidence. The only problem is that the Senate team had agreed to clear anything it took from the building with the CIA first so that any sensitive information could be redacted. Senate investigators skipped this step with the Panetta documents. Feinstein is unrepentant on this point. ""Our staff did just what CIA personnel would have done had they reviewed the document,"" says Feinstein. The purloined Panetta review now sits in a Senate safe. Members of the Senate intelligence committee tried to get a full copy from the agency, but in January the CIA refused. By asking for the official version, they spooked CIA personnel, who then secretly searched the computers the Senate committee had been using to prepare the report. The CIA rationalizes that search on the grounds that the committee had somehow obtained the Panetta report by unauthorized means, which Feinstein denies. Feinstein issued a series of letters to the CIA director asking for some answers and an apology. She's gotten neither. The CIA inspector general has asked the Justice Department to look into the CIA's Senate snooping. Weeks later, the CIA general counsel filed a crimes report to look into the actions of the Senate investigators. Feinstein claims the agency is trying to intimidate and stonewall. In fact, according to Feinstein, the general counsel is a star of the Senate report, mentioned 1,600 times. It is not likely that he is mentioned as an awesome guy. The last time the CIA got into a big public fight like this it was with George W. Bush's administration over claims that Iraq was trying to buy uranium yellowcake from Niger. Ultimately, CIA Director George Tenet had to take the fall for the faulty information that made it into President Bush's State of the Union speech. Before Tenet's resignation, the agency and the White House traded several rounds of damaging accusations. Referring to their fight with the CIA,  a White House official at the time said, ""We brought a knife to a gun fight."" Feinstein has started a public confrontation with those same forces for which she will have to be well armed. This story has a simple message: The system that is supposed to maintain the balance between secrets and civil liberties has broken down. Many believed that it already had, but Feinstein, for good reason, had argued that even if changes needed to be made, the essential relationship between her committee and the agencies it oversees was operating within bounds. What she described Tuesday was a total lack of trust on both sides. The level of trust was so low that people may have felt it was necessary to break the law to fulfill their obligations. That's not just bad for this particular relationship; it throws the balance between the two branches into even greater turmoil than it was already in."	Why Sen.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/rand_paul_foreign_policy_and_military_service_the_kentucky_senator_just.html	"Sen. Rand Paul may not be a foreign policy hawk but he is a political one. He wrote, in a recent critique of his Republican colleagues: ""What we don't need right now is politicians who have never seen war talking tough for the sake of their political careers."" Incoming! Paul was talking about grandstanding responses to the Ukraine crisis. It wasn't a pinprick attack about a policy disagreement: Sen. Paul is claiming his rivals--ignorant to the sacrifices of war--are too cavalier about committing American troops to foreign conflicts in their rush to make names for themselves. He made this point in an essay where he also charged these performance hawks with misappropriating Ronald Reagan's legacy, a special desecration in a party where the 40th president is revered. So: ignorant, heartless, self-absorbed, reckless, and distorting history. Paul's charge against his competition was a solid tremor in the vibrating football game of the 2016 presidential campaign, but it also raised interesting questions about the experience required to be president. Can you only be a legitimate foreign policy hawk if you have fought in a war? If you haven't, and you're behaving like a hawk, does that automatically make you a craven politician? Or does it mean you just have a higher bar to clear for the case you make? Paul is not the only one to link the issue of sacrifice and hot rhetoric. That was a central message of former Defense Secretary Robert Gates' book: Both parties are too quick to threaten war. It's a fascinating question that should engage us between now and the next presidential election. Paul's words pose a problem for all of the GOP's would-be commanders-in-chief, including himself; his charge undermines his party's foreign policy critique of President Obama, which operates on the blunt formula that if you are not rhetorically tough, you invite global aggression. It wasn't immediately clear who Paul was attacking. He did not name names, but that may simply have been because he had too many targets. He could have been referring to several of his potential rivals for the presidency. Sen. Ted Cruz told ABC News ""I don't agree with him on foreign policy. I think U.S. leadership is critical in the world."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has talked about the dangers of the isolationism running through the party (which led to a public spat with Paul months ago.) Sen. Marco Rubio has been staking out the hawkish position as a part of his effort to present himself as the foreign policy voice in the GOP field. Paul had more advice: ""I will remind anyone who thinks we will win elections by trashing previous Republican nominees or holding oneself out as some paragon in the mold of Reagan, that splintering the party is not the route to victory."" That was clearly a shot at Cruz, who had criticized Bob Dole, Sen. John McCain, and Mitt Romney in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference last week. Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment reads: ""Thou shall not speak ill of a fellow Republican."" It is up to the elders of Simi Valley to determine whether an attack so clear in its target but that doesn't actually invoke his target's name is still in keeping with this rule. It's not the first time Paul has employed this loophole. ""The GOP of old has grown stale and moss-covered,"" Paul said last year at CPAC. ""I don't think we need to name any names here, do we?"" The senator didn't need to name names because it was obvious he was attacking John McCain, a previous Republican nominee with whom he was having a spat at the time. Paul's central argument is that some Republicans have turned Reagan into a cartoon of hawkishness. So Paul reminded readers of the various times that Reagan had been called an appeaser, like when he negotiated with the Russians, and when he withdrew U.S. troops from Lebanon after the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 Marines. What the critics of the time called weakness was the right approach, Paul argues. (Those signed up for the graduate level seminar will discuss the limits of criticizing others for using Reagan's legacy while simultaneously using Reagan's legacy to bolster your own views.) By adding the war service element, Paul raises the stakes, arguing that there is a human cost to witless hawkishness. Usually when a candidate talks about service it is to champion his own. Paul doesn't have military service he can invoke, but he can use the lack of military credentials among his rivals to launch a preemptive attack on them--and diminish their ability to criticize him. (More graduate study: Reagan never ""saw war"" (except in the movies) and neither did FDR, so what does that say about the relationship between service and foreign policy excellence?) Paul's charge arrives at a moment of flux in American foreign policy. The question of whether a president's posture invites aggression from other countries is open for general discussion again in a way it was not during the Bush years and in their aftermath. Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential campaign in part because voters thought the previous administration was too concerned with appearing tough. But now, only 39 percent of the country approve of the way the president is handling foreign policy, according to the recent CBS/New York Times poll. The Washington Post says Obama's foreign policy ""is based on fantasy."" Republicans see a chance to regain their foreign policy edge with voters, and hawks see a chance to regain ground in the debate over how to approach the world. Paul is providing an inadvertent defense of President Obama's foreign policy in this debate. The Republican critique of President Obama operates on a simple switch. He is weak, which invites peril. Condoleezza Rice, for example, argued recently that Obama's weakness invited Russian aggression. Paul is also a target of this critique. At CPAC, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton said that while isolationists came to their ideology by a different route than the feckless Barack Obama, the views were effectively the same. There are specific ways in which the president may appear weak--his fishtailing Syria policy is a good example--but the critique doesn't rely on specifics. It simply relies on Obama being in office while bad things are happening in the world. If he were strong, goes the critique, these things wouldn't be happening. Paul would sign up to parts of the general Republican critique, but by attacking the chest thumping as the product of political opportunism, it's hard to then argue that what also sounds like chest thumping is sometimes valid and not craven. Perhaps even less helpful to Republicans is that Paul's argument would seem to offer aid and comfort to Hillary Clinton. She, above all likely 2016 candidates, has had actual experience with the topics of war and peace. That's part of what gives the Benghazi attacks their potency. She was in a position of responsibility when one of her ambassadors died in a terrorist attack. But if Paul is claiming that seeing war gives you some special insight, she has seen its costs from a closer perspective than anyone in the Republican field. It would be cleaner for Republicans if the Obama team, including Clinton, could just be labeled weak. Rand Paul is calling for a more reasoned and fact-based discussion of foreign policy; he is asking people to assess whether the people taking hawkish positions have the standing to take those positions. This is the way we should all want to talk about foreign policy in a presidential campaign, but it bears little resemblance to the way that it is is discussed. In a campaign, the conversation is reductionist and appeals to emotion. The current tussle with Russia offers a good example. Mitt Romney had a view about the global threat posed by the Russians. It might have been wrong and it might have been right. It looks more right every day. President Obama didn't engage with the argument, but dismissed it with a smug and self-satisfied quip, a blunt reply intended to call into question Romney's entire worldview. Like Paul, the president may not be a hawk, but he knew how to attack when it came to politics."

Twenty-three years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And yet here he is, the ever-more grizzled ""host of 'War Stories' with Oliver North,"" standing between American flags and issuing warnings about the Russian bear. ""The people of Ukraine are this very minute paying the terrible price for America's leadership deficit disorder and the Obama organization's utopian rush to unilateral disarmament,"" says North. ""That's where we're headed. We don't need a head of state who guts our defenses and draws phony red lines with a pink crayon."" North pauses for the guffaws. ""Yeah, I did say that."" North's crowd is in on the joke, and they're too young to remember how it started. The Conservative Political Action Conference skews toward 20-somethings. The 2013 in-person straw poll found that 54 percent of attendees were younger than 25 and 74 percent were younger than 40; the crowd didn't look any older this year. The conference also skews libertarian, more and more every year since Ron Paul ran for president (2008) and Rand Paul went to the U.S. Senate (2010). Large-print placards around the conference center warn attendees not to distribute ""campaign material."" Stretch your legs and you'll see a half-dozen students wearing STAND WITH RAND T-shirts, bright red, decorated with silhouettes of the Brillo-haired Kentuckian. In that same 2013 poll, CPAC-ers were asked whether their ""most important goal"" in politics was to ""promote individual freedom"" or to ""secure and guarantee American safety at home and abroad."" Seventy-seven percent chose liberty. Eight percent, basically a rounding error, pushed the hawk button. And now, Russia was starting a small war. Conservatives had been hating the Russians long before they had been Standing With Rand. All day Thursday, the thousands who packed into CPAC's main ballroom heard their movement's icons cry out against isolationism. They'd known foreign adventurism and intervention as Obama policies, blights on both parties, not part of the Republican Party they were rebuilding. They were being tested, and by people who claimed to know much more about how the party should defend America. ""Can you just imagine Ronald Reagan dealing with Vladimir Putin?"" asks onetime UN Ambassador John Bolton, one of the only representatives of the George W. Bush administration to show at CPAC. ""Reagan called a strong defense budget the 'vital margin of safety.' We are losing that vital margin all around the world. ... Putin has a growing defense budget and ours is shrinking."" If you're Standing With Rand, that's never worried you. The senator had supported the forced cuts of sequestration, encouraging his colleagues to ""jettison some of the crap"" in the defense budget and live with lower spending levels. If you're, say, a 21-year-old CPAC attendee, you were born after the Soviet Union dissolved. You were 8 years old on Sept. 11, and maybe 10 for the start of the war in Iraq. You've never been a hawk. And at CPAC, you're seeing the hawks sprint back into the spotlight. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio uses his Thursday speech to rally conservatives in a global fight against ""totalitarianism."" Afterward, he tells the New York Times that ""there are forces within our party, there have always been in American politics, that basically say, 'Who cares what happens everywhere else? Just mind our own business.'"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ventures from the main conference to an alternative all-day meeting of hawks--itself, a sign of how much ground has been lost to the libertarians--and explains how he differs with Paul. Sure, the Kentucky senator was right about Syria, but the hawks were right about Iran. ""When Iran describes Israel as the Little Satan,"" he says, ""and America as the Great Satan, we have every interest to make sure they don't acquire the weaponry to kill millions of Americans."" Cruz and 42 other Republican senators had signed on to new sanctions against Iran. Paul had not. On Friday, Paul arrived at CPAC for a full day of movement building. Around noon, he was scheduled to talk to Fox News' Greta Van Susteren, so his advance team encourages Stand With Randers to get Paul in full view of the camera. Hassan Sheikh, 26, a law student who runs Nebraska's branch of Young Americans for Liberty, talks about Ukraine while the shot is being blocked. ""We've got to make sure we're not goading ourselves into yet another expensive adventure in a foreign country,"" he says, wearing a Stand With Rand shirt over a white shirt and tie. ""Our allies in Europe and Asia don't need us the way they used to. It's absolutely preposterous that we have more than 440 military bases all across the world. That's just an expense that taxpayers don't need."" Paul arrives, talks, and leaves, so he can be guided to a crowded book signing in CPAC's exhibit hall. Aaron and Elizabeth Littlefield, aged 21 and 18 and newly married, come away with valuable copies of Paul's Government Bullies. They didn't follow politics when the war in Iraq began; they have only really paid attention to the Obama foreign policy. And they don't like it. ""Obama's foreign policy has shown the United States to be weak--that we don't want to do anything,"" says Elizabeth. ""Countries don't take our red lines seriously. We are starting to lose our standing."" ""Ron Paul was a staunch isolationist,"" says Aaron, ""whereas Rand Paul does believe we live in an international community. That's one of the big differences between supporters of Ron and Rand."" It truly is. Not far from the book signing, waiting to be interviewed by RT (formerly Russia Today), is Richard Spencer. Years ago he and some fellow paleo-conservative 20-somethings co-founded the Robert Taft Club, a conservative society for talks and debate; it had booked Ron Paul during his 2008 campaign. Since then Spencer had edited one of the magazines that Jack Hunter--Paul's old co-author--had written for. Hunter resigned from Paul's staff after the media belatedly discovered his career as the ""Southern Avenger."" To Spencer, the new-old hawk feel of CPAC was absolutely pathetic. ""They want to claim Obama's not doing enough and he's weak,"" he says. ""Conservatism is a child of the Cold War. It's probably hard for some people to imagine not having a Cold War mentality. It's very hard for someone to come hear and talk about reaching out to Russia, and to say we have so much more in common with Russians as human beings, and as a society."" It's hard because the millennials who adore Rand Paul didn't necessarily sign up for non-intervention. Shortly after 2 p.m., Paul gives his CPAC address. He mentions his 2013 filibuster that asked the Obama administration whether it thought it could legally kill American citizens with drones. The crowd, packed to the walls, erupts with applause. It's the only thing Paul says about foreign policy. So he's off to a McCormick and Schmick's for a meet and greet with Greg Brannon, Tea Party candidate running for Senate in North Carolina. ""Ron Paul is the statesman of our generation,"" he tells a supporter. He repeats the line in a short speech, standing beside Paul. When more supporters talk to him about Ukraine, he says he's been studying up to ""understand every rock and blade of grass"" in that country, wrestling with how America should respond to Russia. Dozens of CPAC ticket-holders crowd the room, angling for pictures with Paul or ordering a boozy concoction called ""Senator's Iced Tea."" Travis McCormick, a 24-year-old campaign worker from Texas, says he voted for Ron Paul's campaign twice. He's stayed in politics to manage a race for railroad commissioner. ""I was in middle school when the Iraq war started,"" he says. ""I didn't think much of it. As I got older, I figured going over there wasn't the best idea."" ""It's kind of indicative of this entire administration,"" he says. ""Foreign policy's been put on the back burner. When Romney got criticized for bringing up Russia, I think that was a key moment."" Brannon's supporters linger, and Paul leaves. He stops by a happy hour for his RANDPAC--in and out, done before 6. Some students and activists migrate from that bar to one hosting a happy hour for the Leadership Institute. That's where I run into Pete Chamberlain, a liberty activist who'd been selling T-shirts with Edward Snowden's face (that one thoughtful-looking shot, from the first interview he did) and the word ""HERO."" He wore one of the shirts under a blazer and talked about the return of the hawks. ""Putin's a strongman,"" says Chamberlain. ""I don't like any politician that rules in such a way. I would say it's no different than Obama. So I see the Bill Kristols of the world, the Charles Krauthammers, say we've got to stand strong on Russia. But we've got no dog in that fight. People say, 'Oh, we're for smaller government and less spending,' and we spend more on defense than, what--the next seven biggest countries, combined, spend on defense?"" The new, young, skeptical branch of the conservative movement would keep puzzling this, into the night, as the Russians dug in."	Young Conservatives Wrestle With What It Means to Be a Foreign Policy Hawk	['Israel', 'Hunter', 'Romney', 'Rubio', 'Cruz', 'Hassan', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]
20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/cpac_supported_by_gun_oil_and_cigarette_industries_american_conservative.html	"This week hundreds of college Republicans and men sporting Founding Father costumes are in National Harbor, Md., down the Potomac from Washington, D.C., for the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual meeting of the American Conservative Union. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist calls it ""Woodstock for conservatives."" But while the American Conservative Union, CPAC's parent, refers to itself as the ""nation's oldest and largest grassroots conservative organization,"" an examination of the group's finances shows the organization receives support from some of America's biggest and least popular industries:  guns, big oil, and cigarettes. Rarely seen and previously unreported tax filings for the ACU and ACU Foundation, the group responsible for staging CPAC, reveal that in the 2010 tax year, the National Rifle Association provided $225,000 of the ACU Foundation's overall revenue. In 2010 the ACU Foundation reported $288,670 in grant revenue and $1,063,103 in ""program service revenue."" The NRA's executive vice president and CEO, Wayne LaPierre, has been a regular featured speaker at past CPAC events and he again spoke at the gathering on Thursday. The 2013 CPAC included an event titled ""NRA University"" at which CPAC attendees could ""learn more about NRA, Second Amendment, gun control debate."" It even offered participants ""a FREE one-year NRA membership,"" according to the conference schedule. The NRA is a ""presenting sponsor"" at the 2014 conference--a sponsorship level requiring a $110,000 contribution. In 2010 the billionaire Koch brothers' companies contributed a total of $50,000 to the ACU and the ACU Foundation. In the same year, cigarette giant Altria contributed $25,000 to the ACU, and the conservative Anschutz Foundation contributed $25,000 to the ACU Foundation. Perhaps more importantly, the ACU promotes the tobacco industry when new regulatory measures are proposed. The ACU publicly defended the interests of the tobacco industry when the FDA proposed imposing restrictions on menthol cigarettes. Responding to a July 2013 invitation for public input from the FDA, the ACU wrote to express its ""strong opposition to the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration of a tobacco product standard for menthol in cigarettes."" The ACU also used its influence to promote legislation benefiting the oil and gas industries. In addition to contributions from the Anschutz Foundation, funded by oil tycoon Philip Anschutz and the Koch brothers, Chevron contributed $20,000 to the ACU Foundation in 2010. The oil and drilling industry found no shortage of support from the ACU. In December 2011 the ACU wrote to Rep. Jim Jordan, then-chairman of the Republican Study Committee, urging Jordan and all members of the House to support the ""Jobs Through Growth Act,"" which would ""reverse the absurd finding of EPA that carbon dioxide is a 'pollutant.' "" ""The bill would also expedite the construction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline,"" said the ACU letter. The bill gained 59 co-sponsors but died in committee. Koch Industries, a major player in the U.S. oil and gas industry, sponsored the ""VIP Ronald Reagan Dinner Reception"" at CPAC's 2013 meeting. (Former Koch Industries Executive Director of Federal Affairs Matt Schlapp appears as a board member on ACU tax filings starting in 2009.) CPAC's 2014 annual conference website lists Koch and the NRA as sponsors but doesn't disclose the precise amount of either's support. When contacted for comment about its corporate donors and the appearance of advocacy for the oil, cigarette, and gun industries, ACU National Communications Director Laura Keehner Rigas said, ""ACU does not discuss the details of contributions beyond what is publicly available through our Form 990 and our website. Please reference our website for a sampling of CPAC sponsors, co-sponsors, and exhibitors."" Positive PR and the appearance of ""grassroots"" support are much-needed by the oil and gas industry. It topped the list of most disliked industries in the United States, narrowly beating out the federal government, in an August 2012 Gallup poll. The NRA and tobacco industry have also seen their popularity suffer. The NRA's favorability dropped to 42 percent, with 45 percent reporting an unfavorable view of the organization, in a January 2013 Public Policy Polling survey. And 22 percent of Americans support a complete smoking ban, up from 12 percent in 2007, according to a July 2013 Gallup poll. The two industries are so contentious that even some in the largely conservative world of NASCAR are distancing themselves. In April, ESPN reported that two drivers were advised by their public relations directors to avoid doing interviews with the NRA logo behind them. NACSCAR itself, once strongly associated with tobacco sponsors, has moved on to other sponsors following the June 2010 implementation of new FDA rules ending smokeless tobacco and cigarette sponsorships for sporting events. The gun, tobacco, and oil industries will undoubtedly continue their PR efforts. And it would seem that CPAC is the ""grassroots"" outreach wing of their corporate public relations strategy."

Chris Christie wasn't invited to CPAC. This year he addressed the American Conservative Union's annual meeting on its opening day. The New Jersey governor didn't say anything that will keep him from getting invited back. As my colleague David Weigel has pointed out, this is the least surprising news in politics. Christie wasn't going to get booed, and he wasn't going to do anything that might risk that reaction. For a politician trying to unite the party around the areas where they agree, there were plenty of ways he could appeal to the conservative audience on issues like abortion, unions, and a shared dislike for the media. Unity was important, Christie said, not just because it meant the party could focus on its actual accomplishments, but also because it kept the GOP from fighting among itself when the opposition was so much worse. Oh, and let's not forget President Obama. Though Christie has taken grief from conservatives for cozying up to Obama in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he was clear to point out that he was no friend to the president. He never mentioned the Sandy episode, but instead talked about the supercommittee and the president's refusal to engage with its work. ""If that's the attitude, Mr. President, then what the hell are we paying you for?"" On Thursday, the political task before Christie was to get a good reception from a skeptical crowd without saying anything that might be used against him in a 2016 presidential bid. He achieved that modest goal. The Democratic Party, in its instant analysis of Christie's CPAC speech, couldn't actually find anything noteworthy in the speech. It criticized him for what he ""didn't talk about."" The first notable elision was Christie's defense of the Koch brothers, the wealthy backers of Americans for Prosperty, the pro-free-markets activist group. You wouldn't know that's who he was defending, because Christie never mentioned their names. Instead he attacked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has been going after the Koch brothers by name and at length on the Senate floor. This attack on ""two American entrepreneurs"" was a sign of how pointless Washington had become, according to the governor. Reid should ""get back to work and stop picking on great Americans who are creating jobs."" No ad can be run in which Christie can be found praising the Koch brothers, whom liberals are working hard to make household names of horror. When Christie stood up for his pro-life abortion views that was recognizable enough, but he didn't make a moral point about the sanctity of life. He turned the issue into a weapon to use against Democrats. When had they invited pro-life Democrats to speak at their conventions? Never, he pointed out. It was Republicans who have invited Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Tom Ridge to speak, all of whom support abortion rights. It was a sturdy partisan attack, but not one that would turn off a single pro-choice voter who might some day consider Christie. This speech was of more than just passing interest because of last year's snub--in 2013, organizers thought Christie wasn't sufficiently conservative, though he'd spoken to the organization before--and because if Christie runs he'll have to find some way to woo grassroots conservatives who see him as the candidate of the establishment. A recent Washington Post poll found that 30 percent of Republicans say they definitely would not vote for Christie, the highest percentage for any Republican tested. Among those who identified themselves as conservatives, 35 percent said they would not vote for him. Christie might have changed a few minds by not overtly offending anyone, but in a conference where so many speakers referred to the divisions within the party--especially the rift between the establishment and grassroots wings--there will be thousands of chances for Christie's fortunes to rise and fall among conservatives before he becomes the party's nominee or even before next year's CPAC."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/barack_obama_the_1_percent_and_income_inequality_why_the_rich_don_t_need.html	"If you are a member of the 1 percent, be wary, the politicians are coming for you. They'd like a donation to their campaign. Given all the talk about income inequality, you might have worried that they'd be supporting policies that could hurt you. Rest easy: Control of the Senate hangs in the balance this election year and the political system needs your donations more than your hide. Pollsters and strategists are telling candidates that targeting the rich or talking too much about income inequality isn't a smart strategy. So you're not even likely to receive a righteous rhetorical scapegoating. History suggests you've dodged a bullet, too. Today's popular ferment for change is small by historical comparison. Proof of how gently politicians are treating the wealthy was on display last week when President Obama spoke to the Democratic National Committee. The president has said that addressing income inequality will be the centerpiece of his remaining time in office, but when the president spoke to the DNC, he didn't mention income inequality at all. Democrats support ""opportunity for all,"" he said, whereas Republicans support ""opportunity for a few."" Dropping the word inequality--which is about disparity of outcomes--shifts the conversation away from the wealthy who are enjoying those outcomes. The president has also changed the target of his political jabs. He is attacking Republicans now, but in 2012 the president talked relentlessly about a country in which everyone had a ""fair shake and did their fair share."" Who, according to the president, wasn't doing their fair share? The wealthy, because of the way they were shielded by the tax code. It's not just the president who has removed hints of class warfare from his language. Democratic candidates are being coached to do this, too. Polls consistently show that Americans of both parties believe that income inequality exists and that it is a problem, but as Democratic pollster Mark Mellman explains, when you ask voters to rank ""income inequality"" among other issues, only 1 percent say it is a priority. ""The polling imperative is to make sure you're attacking opportunity inequality, not income inequality,"" says one veteran Democratic strategist. ""Obviously, one creates the other. But the public sees a distinction. One seems American. The other, Communist."" Voters are more likely to back specific items that address inequality, like raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, or ensuring equal pay for women. These are the kinds of policies the president and Democrats are pushing, but none of those items actually represent a broad attack on the wealthy. The limits of this agenda are why Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, recently said that the 1 percent's fears that they are under assault were ""just hyperventilation around not paying attention to specific facts and data."" Politicians can be trusted to seize on a popular notion that will help them get re-elected, particularly if that notion stirs anger and envy, emotions that propel people to the polls. If class warfare were the big Democratic idea, we'd see it dripping from every ad and speech. Look, for example, at how Republicans use House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in political advertising. It's not subtle. Republicans are hanging her on any Democrat they can find. Nevertheless, to some, like Rep. Paul Ryan, the president's toned-down rhetoric is just a sleight of hand. The president is still focused on redistributing wealth and stoking class warfare, Ryan recently told CNBC. Ryan has plenty he can point to. For years the president has been talking about  the unfair breaks that go to millionaires and billionaires. Also, the president's budget released on Tuesday is designed to highlight trade-offs that define Republicans as the party of the wealthy and not the middle class. The budget includes a provision that would pay for the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credit--programs that benefit low-income and middle-income Americans--through the elimination of loopholes that benefit the wealthy, including the ""carried interest"" tax loophole, which allows private equity and venture capital executives to treat such income at a lower tax rate. This budget is a purely political document, and will never become law. Ryan and his House colleagues offer a firewall against whatever the president might be plotting in the White House basement. No tax increases on the wealthy are going to pass on their watch, but that is no comfort to some on the heated driveway side of the gated community. For some conservatives, the very mention of ""income inequality"" means pitting one class against the other. That's why during the last presidential campaign Mitt Romney said the issue of income inequality should only be discussed in ""quiet rooms."" Venture capitalist giant Tom Perkins is certainly spooked. He famously compared progressives and their ""rising tide of hatred"" of the 1 percent to the Nazi extermination of the Jews. He wasn't the first to see a Reich around the corner. In 2010, Stephen A. Schwarzman, founder of Blackstone said that Obama's proposal to tax ""carried interest""--a big source of income for private-equity managers--reminded him of ""when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939."" These comparisons are not just loony, they're also a waste of historical analogy miles. There's obviously an increase in sentiment against the rich--polls show a modest increase in those who believe the wealthy unfairly benefit from the current economic system--but you don't have to travel all the way to Nazi Germany to see whether today matches the past. There are several periods in American history--the Populist, Progressive, and New Deal eras--when the rich were on the run. Today's wealthy face nothing approaching what their predecessors did. ""The 1 percent should count themselves lucky,"" says Yale historian Beverly Gage. ""If this were the turn of the century, they would be afraid of bomb-throwing anarchists."" Gage is the author of The Day Wall Street Exploded about the largest terrorist attack on American soil before the Oklahoma City bombing. (Editor's note: She's also an occasional contributer to Slate.) That was just one of the violent acts that sprung from ideological, class-based violence at the turn of the 20th century. In 1892, Henry Clay Frick was shot three times and stabbed during a steel strike. John D. Rockefeller and executives of Standard Oil faced several bomb plots. Labor unions tried to redress the imbalances with crippling work stoppages like the Pullman strike and the Homestead strike. Ironworkers were engaged in a multiyear bombing campaign that culminated in the destruction of the Los Angeles Times building in 1910. Compare that level of action with Occupy Wall Street, which so frightened Perkins. The movement managed to take over some parks and irritate some people with its drumming. It did change the public conversation but still never achieved anything near the influence of the Tea Party, the other grass-roots movement of the age, which is responsible for changing control of the House and reshaping American politics for the past five years. President Obama's rhetoric, even before its recent watering down, has never approached the level of his predecessors. The starkest example of this was the president's speech in Osawatomie, Kan., which was designed to echo the one Teddy Roosevelt gave at the same location a century earlier. In the president's 2011 speech, and the one he gave last December in Washington, which was meant to echo its themes, Obama never came close to the wealth bashing of Roosevelt's original. T. R. raged against ""a small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power"" and said government's ""prime need is to change the conditions which enable these men to accumulate power which it is not for the general welfare that they should hold or exercise."" Roosevelt, who coined the phrase ""malefactors of great wealth,"" was campaigning in support of the graduated income tax and the estate tax on the theory that without them a moneyed royalty would rise, a direct threat to a functioning democracy. Twenty years later, FDR took up the same charge against the wealthy, campaigning against ""economic royalists"" who built ""new kingdoms ... upon concentration of control over material things. Through new uses of corporations, banks and securities, new machinery of industry and agriculture, of labor and capital--all undreamed of by the Fathers--the whole structure of modern life was impressed into this royal service."" Are people so enraged today that there might be social unrest? Political strategist Doug Sosnik thinks so. The former Clinton adviser wrote that the question of the next election will be ""which side of the barricade are you on?"" James Madison warned that the greatest danger to democracy was the factions that were created by ""the various and unequal distribution of property."" But for  some time, the theory has been that while Americans recognize economic inequality, they tolerate it because they believe success is the result of talent and hard work, not a tilted playing field. Or, if people believed that the field is tilted, they didn't think it was so askew that it kept people from gaining access to the American Dream. There was a respect for the wealthy that derived from this. When labor-backed groups considered criticizing the Walton family for Walmart's labor practices, the polling showed it was a losing tactic. People respected the family, even though they didn't like their wage policies. ""The rich have made themselves a smaller target today,"" says Michael McGerr of Indiana University, an expert on the Progressive Era. ""There are fewer ways that they are villains. There was a time when the rich lived an alien lifestyle. They had pleasures others didn't--homes and vacations. In the last 50 years, in part because of New Deal tax policy, ordinary people live a lifestyle that is closer to what the rich has. Some of the mystification is gone."" What might lead to more restlessness, however, is if people feel their opportunity to share in the American Dream is disappearing. Views about opportunity have changed with economic conditions. At the end of the prosperity of the 1990s, according to Pew Center polling, 74 percent of the country believed that people who were willing to work hard would get ahead. That number has now dropped 18 points down to 60 percent. Thirty-eight percent of the country now believes that even if you work hard you might not get ahead; only 23 percent held that view in the late '90s. The Gallup poll results on this question are stark, showing a more than 20-point drop in the percentage of Americans satisfied with the opportunities to get ahead by working hard. Only 54 percent say they have such opportunities, compared with the 76 percent who said so in 2001. Meanwhile in the Pew poll, by a 60 to 36 percent margin, most Americans feel the economic system unfairly favors the wealthy, as opposed to being fair to all. Majorities of the country may still believe that while the wealthy benefit, you can get ahead through hard work, but it is a majority that has been shrinking for the past 14 years. But just because people believe opportunities are shrinking doesn't mean that they blame the rich. Since the mid-'80s voters have told pollsters that government should do something to level the disparity between rich and poor, but it's not clear what role people want government to take. In 1984, 60 percent said money and wealth should be evenly distributed, almost the same figure as today, but when Walter Mondale suggested raising taxes to do so, it led to such a resounding defeat it is perhaps the most oft-repeated truth in politics that no one can campaign on raising taxes. Today there is still no national cry for higher marginal tax rates on the wealthy. One explanation may be that increased tax rates would just bring more money to the government, an institution people don't trust. (Eighty-one percent of the public tells Gallup they trust government only some of the time or never.) When Gallup asked last year whether taxes should be increased to redistribute wealth, 52 percent agreed and 45 percent disagreed. That's not the basis for a national movement, particularly when Republican voters are more passionate about stopping tax increases than Democrats are about raising taxes. The most overt recent attack on wealth in American politics took place in the 2012 Republican primaries--and it was smashed almost instantaneously by Democrats and Republicans alike. Newt Gingrich tried to frame Mitt Romney as a rapacious fat cat and was immediately denounced by his fellow Republicans. When the Obama campaign tried to pick up the charge, Bill Clinton stood up for Romney's business career and made a broader claim about the wisdom of evaluating the morality of a person's work. ""I don't think we ought to get into the position where we say this is bad work; this is good work,"" said the former president. Cory Booker, who was planning to run for the Senate and therefore would have been primed to jump on the bash-the-rich bandwagon if it were a political winner, spoke out against the president's campaign saying he should ""stop attacking private equity."" Why were high-profile Democrats defending Bain and private equity? Because they were raising a lot of money from people who worked at Bain Capital or companies like it. Obama outraised Romney in donations from Bain Capital and well outraised him in large individual contributions. As a whole, Congress is not only more dependent on the money of the 1 percent, it also looks more like them. For the first time in history a majority of Congress members are now millionaires. Unlike the previous century, there is no ideology ready to carry the anti-wealthy crusade outside of the political context. There is no global socialist or communist revolution to attract American adherents or even a domestic agrarian revolution of the kind that fed the Populist Movement. ""People 100 years ago thought they had an alternative,"" says Gage. ""There were these transformative social visions people really believed in. People thought they were headed into this terrifying or fabulous future and today what are those ideas?"" Labor unions, once powerful institutions that maintained the class struggle when liberal candidates failed, are on the ropes. Still, inequality continues to grow, the economic recovery is weak, and the public view is souring. Seventy-six percent now agrees with the statement that ""the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer."" On the left, Peter Beinart argues that the millennial generation might lead the next ideological revolution. Its members have suffered under a prolonged period of shrinking wages and falling benefits, and they believe in redistributive government action. The spirit of Occupy isn't over, Beinart argues, it's just sleeping. But before Tom Perkins starts nailing plywood over his windows, a lot more must happen. The movement still needs a leader, and if Hillary Clinton decides to run for president, it's unlikely a liberal alternative will defeat her in a party where liberals, while on the rise, are still outnumbered by conservative and moderate Democrats. On the right, Ben Domenech has written about how libertarian populism is also becoming energized by today's inequities. The target of that movement is not the wealthy in general, but the elites who profit from working the current system--the lobbyists, cronies, rent-seekers, union bosses, and overpaid school administrators. But Domenech's solution isn't more government but less of it. ""The important thing is that this wealth (and power) is naturally determined (and checked!) by the market, instead of artificially determined by the state,"" says Domenech. The challenge for this theory is that the rent-seekers and establishment powers in Republican politics have the money and the organizations to keep backing candidates who share their views. Plus, most Republicans would rather win after eight years of Barack Obama than back a revolution. It's a lot to ask people who are hungering for certainty--or at least the illusion of certainty--to tear apart their party. People's frustration is going to find an outlet somewhere, but it's not certain that it will be aimed at the wealthy. President Obama is a more likely scapegoat than rich people. Public dissatisfaction with Obama's stewardship at home and abroad could simply lead to support for a Republican who promises to promote the opposite of all that Obama stood for. That fellow will be asking for a donation from you, too."	Why the 1 Percent Have Nothing to Fear	['Clinton', 'Deal', 'Romney', 'Clay', 'Paul', 'Pelosi', 'Obama']	[]

Mr. L, as we called him, brought our country's story to life. So when he taught us about the Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears, Andrew Jackson's campaigns to force at least 46,000 Cherokees, Choctaws, Muscogee-Creeks, Chickasaws, and Seminoles off their ancestral lands, my classmates and I were stricken. It was unfathomable that thousands of Native American men, women, and children were forced to march West, sometimes freezing to death or starving because U.S. soldiers wouldn't let them bring extra food or blankets. It was hard to hear that the Choctaw Nation lost up to a third of its population on the death march. It was disorienting to learn that what amounted to ethnic cleansing had come at the insistence of an American president. But then it was lunchtime, and we pulled out our wallets in the cafeteria. Andrew Jackson was there, staring out from every $20 bill. We had been carrying around portraits of a mass murderer all along, and had no idea. Andrew Jackson engineered a genocide. He shouldn't be on our currency. Symbols matter. Many people, for example, are inspired by the symbolic implications of Jackson's path to the presidency: He was born two weeks after his father's death to a widowed immigrant mother and, despite his poverty and lack of education, reached the highest office in the land. That's a powerful story. So is the more precise telling of how Jackson climbed the American socioeconomic ladder. Jackson was the only president who worked as a slave trader, and he accumulated much of his fortune that way. In fact, Jackson later pursued his ""Indian Removal"" policies specifically so that the stolen lands could be used to expand cotton farming and slavery. Even in historical context, our seventh president falls short. His racist policies were controversial even in his own time. After the Indian Removal Act only narrowly passed Congress, an 1832 Supreme Court ruling declared it unconstitutional. (Jackson ignored that decision.) In 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a passionate letter calling Jackson's policies ""... a crime that really deprives us as well as the Cherokees of a country, for how could we call the conspiracy that should crush these poor Indians our government, or the land that was cursed by their parting and dying imprecations our country any more?"" Ironically, the biggest supporter of any campaign to remove Jackson from the $20 bill might be Jackson himself. He was a fierce opponent of paper money and the central banking system, and would probably be horrified to see his face on our national currency. Leaving him on the bill as a form of mockery could be the best insult. But complicated historical slights don't translate: His face on our money implies an honor that Jackson's legacy doesn't deserve. Worse, it obscures the horrors of his presidency. Of course, contemporary Native American communities have much bigger problems than whose face is on a bill. The Pima Indians in Arizona have the highest rate of diabetes in the world. A Native American woman has a 1-in-3 chance of being raped during her lifetime--more than twice the national average. There's an epidemic of suicide among Native American teenagers and youth. Rates of unemployment in Native American communities are disproportionately high--not surprising, since inferior reservation lands are often unsuitable for farming and a lack of infrastructure makes it difficult for other businesses to succeed. Dropout rates at reservation schools are among the highest in the country. There's a housing shortage on tribal lands. Native American areas have been disproportionately used as radioactive waste dumps. Jackson's visage on the $20 doesn't compare. But this issue isn't merely cosmetic, or a nod to political correctness. Symbolic change and practical change have a symbiotic relationship. By confronting and correcting the symbols of our violent and racist histories, we prompt conversations about how that legacy continues to affect marginalized communities today. This wouldn't be the first campaign to change a face on our currency. In 2010, H.R. 4705 called for Ronald Reagan to replace Ulysses S. Grant on the $50 bill, and in 2003 the ""Ronald Reagan Dime Act"" tried to bump Franklin Delano Roosevelt off the dime. (Amazingly, those weren't the only recent legislative attempts to put Reagan on money. There were at least two others.) If our government wants to spend time arguing about who should be represented on dollars and coins, it can start by booting off the man who championed a genocide. No historical figure is perfect, but we don't need perfection. In fact, it's a low bar to clear: We just need someone better than Andrew Jackson. Given that Jackson's image has been on the $20 for nearly 90 years, it might be appropriate to celebrate his opposite. Frederick Douglass is a prime candidate, both for his work as an abolitionist and for his campaigns on behalf of Native Americans, women, and immigrants. Osceola, a Seminole Native American, led a war of resistance against his people's forced removal from Florida. Davy Crockett risked his political career to fight against the Indian Removal Act. Ralph Waldo Emerson would also deserve the honor, both for his timeless writing and for his eloquent arguments against Jackson's policies.* Personally, my vote goes to Harriet Tubman. If Jackson's humble origins inspire people, you can't start much lower than Tubman, who was born into slavery. Although Tubman escaped to Philadelphia, she bravely risked her life to return to the South and help more than 300 enslaved people escape to freedom through the Underground Railroad. During the Civil War, she served our country as a nurse, armed scout, and spy for the Union Army, and wrapped up her heroic life by campaigning with Susan B. Anthony for women's right to vote. It doesn't get more inspirational than that. Andrew Jackson's legacy opened the door for Americans from all economic backgrounds to participate in politics. For that, he deserves our thanks. But let's not whitewash Jacksonian democracy. Let's elevate a more honorable American instead. Correction, March 4, 2014: This article originally misspelled Frederick Douglass' first name. (Return.)"

For the past several years, chroniclers of the relationship between the president and Republicans in Congress have searched in vain for new ways to describe chaos. When chaos wasn't on order, the task was to find new ways to connote stasis--the lack of progress that filled the exhausted interregnum between periods of chaos. Now the job has changed a bit. Crisis budgeting that led to tense moments is largely gone, mostly because House Republicans have decided not to stage confrontations. That is healthy, but there seems to have been a collective decision that like the convalescent, no politician is going to risk tearing the stitches by doing much more than padding around the ward. No one is going to do anything big or risky. The pace of action is neither chaotic nor energetic but just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon. This is, of course, pathetic. Republicans and Democrats are both so frightened about creating fights within their own parties during an election year that they are leaving the big questions unanswered. Today, House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp put forward a set of fundamental tax reform proposals. It was the product of years of work between Camp, a Republican, and his Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Max Baucus. The two traveled across the country holding hearings, taking in mountains of input, and engaging in all the other kinds of activity that most people like to think of when they think of elected representatives doing their jobs. All that work is going nowhere. No one in either party wants to risk taking on the complicated and tricky issue that might offend big contributors or stir up voters in the wrong way. There will continue to be talk on both sides, but no one is going to get anything done. Budget expert Stan Collender thinks that means no action on this issue until 2019. Trade and immigration are two other items that have gone from the back burner to the freezer. House Speaker John Boehner won't start a fight in his party by bringing up immigration reform, and President Obama won't force his party to take up trade legislation that the president says will help the economy. The stakes are so low in Washington that Obama and Boehner could even sit down and meet again after a long pause. Tuesday, the two men talked for an hour in what was their longest noncrisis conversation in years. Boehner emerged calling it a ""nice meeting"" and then went back to beating up on the president and his health care law. So if nothing is going to get done, what did they talk about? Well, just because no one in Washington is going to do anything big or meaningful doesn't mean they have totally banished their chance to do a little something. There is a possibility that the appropriations process will actually take place in some form this year. Spending items may actually be considered by a committee in which people will have their say about the merits of each program. Although the big budget questions of our time--big new spending or entitlement reforms--are still out of the conversation, at least spending levels won't be determined by sequestration. There's also a slim chance that Congress might work together on the transportation bill, flood insurance, and a water resource bill in the way that members worked together to pass the farm bill. Those are not grand pieces of legislation, but they are what one top congressional aide calls the ""meat and potatoes"" of operating a government. A cynic might also call them the least lawmakers can be expected to do and still deserve the name. Of course, even limited progress is the optimistic view. Though the temperature has lowered and chaos is on pause, it's still possible that lawmakers could slip from risk-free coasting to a full-on coma. Given how few legislative days are scheduled for this election year, it may be impossible even to handle the meat-and-potato basics. Congress may, for example, once again resort to passing a continuing resolution instead of having a proper appropriations process. This week, Rep. John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress, announced that he is retiring. He's out of a job, but a sculptor just got a new one. The House will no doubt commission a monument to commemorate Dingell's more than 58-year career of legislative action. All the other sculptors can take off, though. Even if there are a few achievements this year, they won't be anything to chisel home about."	Washington's New Bipartisan Consensus Is to Do Nothing at All	['Obama']	[]
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/piers_morgan_loses_cnn_show_the_british_host_was_rubbish.html	"Sunday night, after David Carr broke the news that Piers Morgan would be ending his CNN show, I searched Twitter to find how his fans were taking it. This was a mistake. Really, who was a Piers Morgan fan? Have you ever met one? No, reaction to CNN's scheduling news ran the gamut from suppressed glee to running-naked-through-the-streets glee, from gun lovers declaring victory over the ""Brit"" to nonpartisan journalists reminiscing about Morgan's finest ethical lapses. The negative reviews didn't bring Morgan down. He popped them like vitamins. On Twitter he actively trolled his perceived enemies, a hobby that jumped like fleas to his producers. The January 2011 debut of Piers Morgan Live was preceded and promoted by a ""Twitter war"" between the host and Madonna. ""There was a bread roll throwing incident in London in the mid '90s,"" Morgan explained to an interviewer. ""There was an incident at a hotel in the south of France."" This set the tone for Morgan's show, a marriage of checkout-line hype with complete pointlessness. But the critics couldn't kill that show. Viewers killed it. The live broadcast of Morgan's show drew around half the viewers that MSNBC did, and a fifth as many as Fox News. Morgan welcomed Fox's Megyn Kelly to 9 p.m. by telling her (on Twitter) to ""bring it on."" She did. In fact, Morgan's humiliation was so total that he's at risk of becoming a martyr for True Journalism. Carr's scoop was fairly sympathetic to the host, asking how much of his unpopularity had to do with his British accent and values. Americans, said Morgan, remained skeptical ""about this British guy telling them how to lead their lives and what they should do with their guns."" Carr confessed a ""reflex to dismiss"" Morgan because ""he just got here."" Were we wrong about the guy? We were not. Morgan was the beneficiary of a curious American habit. We assign 20 extra IQ points to anyone who speaks with a British accent, redistributing them from the people who speak with Southern accents. This was what led people, like Alec Baldwin, to assume that Martin Bashir ""might help get MSNBC to a higher place,"" and why every B-movie producer has assumed he could elevate the material by casting Malcolm McDowell or Ben Kingsley. That way lies madness--that way lies Thunderbirds and Piers Morgan Live. It wasn't that Morgan was stupid. In his time (and he's only 48, just two years older than Anderson Cooper), he was a bold and ambitious tabloid journalist. Four years before phone-hacking brought down the News of the World, Morgan called the technique ""an investigative practice that everyone [knew] was going on."" He was extraordinarily good at running a newspaper and nailing a certain kind of celebrity story. Sometimes that meant carrying on feuds. Fine. Worth it, for the story. That's a very different skill than getting the best possible interview--particularly, the best interview for a show and time slot that can reel in powerful people. Carr's piece mentions that Morgan has booked powerhouses like Bill Clinton and ""dug in"" when they got to his set. Has he? Morgan's most recent interview with Clinton, last year, made news for the president's (genuinely funny) impression of Bono. But before that, Morgan gave Clinton acres of running room to answer questions he must have been ready for. ""How do you get stuff done in this dysfunctional Washington?"" asked Morgan, days before the government shutdown. ""What will it take to change America's culture of gun bans given that we [have] seen some of the worst outrageous [shootings] in American history in the last year?"" Morgan was asking Clinton to endorse Morgan's own politics. Surprise, surprise--the president pulled it off. When time came to prod Clinton about his family's political future, Morgan tried silliness (""Who do you think might make the better president, your wife or your daughter?"") and flattery (""I met your wife for the first time and your daughter today and she looks fantastic"") to get nothing Clinton hasn't said in other interviews. Guess what: Clinton was not yet ready to declare his wife's candidacy for president. The Clinton interview was instructive, because the host's approach varies (present tense, as CNN plans to keep him on in some capacity) depending on how much power his subject wields. If Morgan likes the subject, or is honored to have him on, he asks friendly questions and maybe gets a fresh on-air response to the controversy of the day. This was generally Morgan's approach with Sen. John McCain, who made it on the show, on average, every few months. ""We've got footage of you when you went to the Ukraine,"" said Morgan in his latest McCain sit-down. ""What kind of country is it?"" This was a follow-up question about breaking news. When Morgan grabs another sort of guest--a weaker, freakier guest--he's a wholly different interviewer. He pounces. He interrupts. He calls the subject ""gutless"" or ""an idiot"" if they can't take his grilling. One of the (many!) problems here, as Zack Beauchamp wrote, is that Morgan's righteous anger rises not when he's failing to get a good answer, but when he's being disrespected. This happened, torturously, shortly after Michele (Mee-shell, as Morgan called her) Bachmann left the 2012 presidential primary. Morgan asked her, naturally, about some gay-skeptic comments by Kirk Cameron. Bachmann said she couldn't ""judge"" the TV star. ""You've been pretty judgmental in the past,"" said Morgan. ""Come on!"" ""Me?"" said Bachmann. ""Yes, you,"" said Morgan. ""One of the most judgmental people in America probably."" The two of them kept going on like this, with Morgan insisting she had been ""very, very outspoken about gay marriage, about homosexuality, in the past and people will view it whether you think it is judgmental or not as very judgmental."" When the segment wrapped, Morgan sought solace from comedian Lewis Black about how this mad guest ""called me rude and was indignant because I had the impertinence to suggest that she was judgmental, when some would argue she's the most judgmental woman in American politics."" This was more than pointless--it was self-defeating. It was the same issue that undermined Morgan's campaign for gun control, carried out over a year against a series of straw-man guests. The crusade was doomed from day one, as Morgan revealed a few months ago to the Guardian. ""Watching the first episode of Aaron Sorkin's The Newsroom was the trigger point,"" he said. ""Jeff Daniels' character is bored in his job, ticking time, hasn't got a clear voice, then he suddenly explodes about the state of America, and it transforms his show."" Forget, for the moment, that Morgan was inspired to retool his real-life show because he saw something that worked in a fictional TV series. In The Newsroom's first season, the fictional team botched an episode about Arizona's immigration reform bill because it booked uninformed, partisan guests. They resolved never to do it again. Morgan, inspired by the show, booked a blockbuster interview with ... Alex Jones, the sandpaper-voiced radio host who sees the New World Order lurking behind every software update, and in Morgan's words ""a man who says I should be deported for my stand on guns."" The interview was doomed from the outset, as were so many of Morgan's check-this-out bookings. It didn't need to be that way. And it's a shame that Morgan was the U.K.'s ambassador of TV journalism. A really stellar TV interviewer like Jeremy Paxman handles a figure who wields power just the same as he handles a menace to the system. People still talk about the time Paxman asked Michael Howard, later the leader of the Conservative Party, the exact same question 12 times in a row. In 2010, after the anti-war leftist George Galloway won an upset election to Parliament, Paxman immediately asked him whether he was ""proud of having got rid of one of the few black women in Parliament."" Nothing amorphous about whether Galloway was ""judgmental"" or not. Just a haymaker, meant to throw him off his script, and succeeding. Not every interviewer wants to work like that, and not every interviewer should. CNN made a smart but strangely handled move (a late-Friday-night timeslot for a short summer run) last year when it hired Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos, exposing a warmer country to his well-researched, probing interviews. The network could promote him. Or, wounded by the criticism of Morgan's gun stories, it could hand the hour to an interviewer who fails for completely different reasons."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/south_carolina_democrats_are_ready_for_hillary_clinton_the_party_is_healing.html	"COLUMBIA, S.C.--Outside a hip converted textile mill in a leafy downtown neighborhood, Barack Obama's former Upstate political director Jon Metcalf is beaming as the place empties out. A largely black crowd of about 100 had shown up to hear about the Ready for Hillary shadow campaign. They didn't pack the house, and plenty of chicken fingers, sandwiches, and meatballs are still left on the buffet table inside, but Metcalf is thrilled with the turnout. ""There is no other candidate that can do this right now,"" he says. ""Nobody else in the field can get people excited about the possibility of them running."" This is Hillary Clinton 2.0 in the early-primary state where Obama crushed her in a bitter 2008 campaign. Wounds from that race were unsutured as recently as last week when media reported on advance copies of a new memoir by Rep. Jim Clyburn. In it he recounts a 2 a.m. phone call from a cursing Bill Clinton, who blamed the then-House majority whip for his wife's defeat in Dixie. Clyburn had remained neutral in the race, but in the lead-up to the election here, he'd said Bill Clinton should ""chill a little bit"" at a time when the former president was throwing wild haymakers at Obama in full attack mode. Bill Clinton would later compare Obama's first-in-the-South win to Jesse Jackson's 1984 and 1988 victories--a remark Clyburn and others interpreted as a racially tinged diss. But if the small event in Columbia six years later is any indication, things have smoothed over. The switch might be easy. Ready for Hillary? Sure, why not? ""We've spent a great deal of time healing those wounds and having conversations with people,"" Metcalf says of the South Carolina effort. He's organizing more of the events throughout the state, and he used the phrase ""building an army."" His pitch is familiar. ""I have three little girls and I want to be able to tell them that they can be president,"" he says. ""Just like as an African-American when I worked on Barack's campaign. Thirty-eight points down, but I wanted to be able to tell my little girls that you could be president."" A small smattering of Democratic Party officials and candidates had been milling around inside, sipping sweet tea and nibbling at the buffet, but the crowd was largely young college students, some who had heard about the event through a University of South Carolina Democratic club. ""Our president, who is here somewhere, she just kind of sent out a group message, she was like, 'Hey guys, I got invited to this, come out if you're interested,' "" a freshman tells me. ""So here I am."" One marquee host for the event is Bakari Sellers, a young and ambitious rising star in the party--and an early Obama backer in 2008--who is running for lieutenant governor. He says he can't endorse someone who's not running yet, and his involvement with Ready for Hillary came when the super PAC's people in D.C. reached out to him. ""For me it was an opportunity to build excitement,"" he says. ""I think the Republican Party has done a great job, especially in the South, of draining the hope from Democrats and moderates and taking away the excitement. This is just one step and one day and one night where the world is watching. ... Democrats are alive."" Moving through the gathering and making acquaintances is a young man named Quentin James. His title: Black Americans Director for Ready for Hillary PAC. He lives in Washington, D.C., but he's from Spartanburg, S.C. The first campaign he ever worked on was Obama's in 2007 as a student at Furman University. He's ready for Hillary because she has the experience. I ask whether he expects it'll be so easy for other early Obama supporters who remember that contentious primary to make the switch. He doesn't bite. ""I think the party was blessed to have two amazing candidates run in 2008,"" he says. ""We're seeing incredible enthusiasm across the state."" Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler, who teaches at a nearby university, has dropped in for a brief visit. He says that if Hillary should decide to run two years from now she won't have any problem in South Carolina. ""Of course, I said that in 2008, too,"" he says. But right now Hillary is the only 2016 game in town and a reason for Democrats to get together in rented halls throughout a state where it's never too early to talk presidential politics. For now they seem as ready for Hillary as anyone, even if sometimes a little awkward. As a speaker finishes and walks from the podium, a young group in the crowd lets out a loud chant: ""Fired up, ready to go!"" Heads jerk up and look around, and the kids drop it abruptly when it's clear the chant won't catch on. Sellers looks askance at the group from a distance. ""You can't steal that,"" he says quietly to no one in particular."	Is Even South Carolina Ready for Hillary?	['Black', 'Clinton', 'Clyburn', 'Obama']	[]

He looked a little dour. ""Chattanooga is the next Madison, Wisc.!"" said one of the 10 reporters who'd shown up to talk to Cohen. ""Nice line."" Cohen laughed. He'd deployed that tagline after workers in a Chattanooga, Tenn., Volkswagen plant voted 712-626 against forming a union and joining the United Auto Workers. It was a crushing defeat for the labor movement, one that much of the media didn't expect--one that labor absolutely didn't expect. Volkswagen had not opposed the union campaign. After the vote, the company continued to favor a ""works council"" in Chattanooga, of the sort that exists in Germany but not in the United States. Not much comfort there. This week's meeting of the AFL-CIO's executive council was supposed to follow a triumph. It was starting with recrimination. A right-to-work group founded by Grover Norquist had placed ads and bought billboards in Chattanooga. One billboard portrayed some urban ruin under the legend DETROIT: Brought to you by the UAW! The Koch brothers had opposed the union. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a former mayor of Chattanooga, had gone so far as to claim he'd ""had conversations"" that convinced him ""that should the workers vote against the UAW, Volkswagen will announce in the coming weeks that it will manufacture its new midsize SUV here in Chattanooga."" ""It's a turning point,"" said Cohen. ""It's not so much a turning point in terms of working people and how they behave, but to have a U.S. senator, who takes an oath of office to be part of the federal government, ignore the preamble to the National Labor Relations Act, which clearly states that it's the policy of this government to promote collective bargaining. Instead, he attacked it."" What would the labor movement do to Corker? He was re-elected in 2012--there's nothing to do but fulminate about finding ""accountability"" for what he and Tennessee Republicans did (this was the AFL-CIO's official statement), ""legally, politically and economically."" Their opponents had revealed, in the words of AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, some ""new forms of right-wing zealotry."" ""They came within an eyelash of winning against enormous odds,"" said Trumka, speaking of the organizers in Tennessee. ""Not that long ago, this kind of a union election in Chattanooga would have been unthinkable, but today it was very real and very alive."" Over a weekend and three work days in Houston, the labor movement attempted to prove that it had only begun to fight in the South and that the 2014 election could be salvaged for Democrats. Actually, that one was easy: Unions would campaign for the minimum wage. ""Rising wages and everything that means is right in front of us to seize and to expand upon,"" said Trumka. ""Leaders from the pope to the president are now talking about it, embracing it, heralding it."" The pope and the president, but especially the president. At the State of the Union, he'd Xeroxed and prettied up a plan by House Democrats to hike the minimum wage for federal contractors all the way up to the ideal $10.10. As the AFL-CIO met this week, he was still campaigning for it. Democrats in tough state races, too--Illinois's Gov. Pat Quinn, whose ability to win elections has endured despite deep unpopularity, is campaigning for it and blaming the Republican House of Representatives for blocking it nationally. ""It's raising wages, it's six days, it's benefits--it's people saying, 'I'm playing by the rules, and I'm losing,' "" explained Trumka. ""If the American public has its way, they will want to debate around raising wages."" Is this really up to the ""American public?"" Labor, as evidenced by the Chattanooga election and the 2012 loss against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, has image problems. The Affordable Care Act does, too. Both are being ripped apart by, yes, expensive campaigns funded by wealthy people with no-limit credit cards, but the Affordable Care Act's rollout problems and sticker shocks aren't helping it. In a state like Texas, it's easy to start a conversation and marvel as it careens into a diatribe about the costs of Obama-mandated health care plans. Between sessions at the Hilton Hotel where the AFL-CIO was meeting, I talked to John Manlove, a Republican businessman and former mayor of a Houston suburb who's currently locking up endorsements for a March 4 congressional primary. He was infinitely less ""volatile,"" as he put it, as the congressman who's leaving the district--Rep. Steve Stockman. He described the plight of one of his daughters, whose first baby was born for free at home, and who now has to shell out ""$5,000 for the second baby because she has to have an insurance policy."" The Affordable Care Act did not factor into the AFL-CIO's Houston pitch. A new poll, released at the conference, tested the popularity of sick leave and child care in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida. Not polled: anything else about health insurance. I asked Michael Podhorzer, the AFL-CIO's soft-spoken political director, if the ACA was going to aid or anchor union-backed candidates. ""In a separate poll, basically, for the two state governors who expanded Medicaid, it was seen as a positive by voters,"" he said. ""It made voters in the other three states less likely to vote for Republicans. So far what we've seen is that the Republicans are making the Affordable Care Act a central issue of the federal campaign, and you can see that in the ads that are already being run. I'm not sure how much that's going to be the frame for the governors' races. I think they'll be more localized."" If you go back to 2010, you can find labor leaders using some of the same words. In 2010, more than $50 million flowed from the AFL-CIO into campaigns to elect Democrats. The Democrats lost a generation of leaders and battles anyway. Labor will keep organizing in the South and keep trying to save the Democratic Senate. The president and the pope were on board for at least some of that. But the pope has only won one election. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Grover Norquist, and the Koch network put that to shame."	The AFL-CIO's Bad Year Is Going to Get Worse	['Cohen']	[]

That's the lesson of a map recently released by a press freedom advocacy group, highlighting the worst countries in the world for information freedom. The map, based on Reporters Without Borders' press freedom rankings for 180 countries, shows home of the current Winter Olympics Russia in bright red, indicating a ""difficult situation"" for journalists and bloggers there. Russia, ranked 148th, shuts down seditious websites, bans so-called homosexual propaganda, prohibits religiously offensive expression, and heavily controls national TV stations, Russians' main source of news. The U.S. shows a ""satisfactory situation,"" but it has dropped 14 ranks since last year's report and now sits at the 46th spot. This decline, according to the report, is due to the Obama administration's hostility toward whistleblowers and leakers and the conviction of Chelsea Manning for releasing a trove of classified documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. Most of Central and South America have ""noticeable problems"" or ""difficult"" situations. Those countries' low rankings are in part due to the murders of journalists by powerful criminal organizations. In Mexico alone, 88 journalists were killed between 2000 and 2013. Some countries also suffer from a lack of editorial independence from the political system. In Brazil, for example, rich regional politicians own local newspapers, and the national media are in the hands of a small number of families. The countries with the worst ranking include Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, and China. In these countries, government authorities or militant groups intimidate, incarcerate, or even kill journalists, and access to the Web is carefully restricted."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/house_of_cards_season_2_frank_underwood_has_no_worthy_enemies.html	"(The following article contains spoilers for Season 2 of House of Cards.) On Feb. 13, the snowbound and sleet-plagued Washington establishment spoke with a single voice: Netflix needed to release House of Cards a day early. ""Release House of Cards a day early and you will have millions of grateful snowed-in customers,"" wrote one Washington Post reporter. ""Netflix would be smart,"" agreed Sen. Marco Rubio spokesman Alex Conant. By the afternoon, CNN's media reporter Brian Stelter was analyzing the ""House of Cards backlash"" and its obvious high-stakes challenge to Netflix. Then came the backlash to the backlash. Sure, lots of the free-stuff tweeters were outside D.C., but there was a sort of entitlement--shock, horror--emanating from the Beltway set. ""They were doing Netflix a favor by watching the show,"" snarked the Washington Free Beacon critic Sonny Bunch. ""Think of the buzz they'd generate with all their tweets!"" It did sound insufferable, but was it wrong? No. House of Cards and official Washington have achieved symbiosis since before the first episodes started streaming last year. The show premiered last year at the Newseum, where showrunner Beau Willimon and co-stars Kate Mara and Kevin Spacey were introduced to important journalists. (I can confirm this because Spacey sidestepped my compliment about his old role on Wiseguy so a handler could match him with Howard Fineman. For the record, Space was terrific on Wiseguy.) Spacey became Washington's new BFF, appearing in a spoof video for the White House Correspondent's Dinner, which he attended. President Obama started winning rare, friendly headlines by talking about the show and asking Twitter not to spoil Season 2. And the real-life media are all over House of Cards' second season. There's Major Garrett, the big-thinking White House reporter for CBS News, describing the latest problems of President Garrett Walker (Michael Gill). There's Rachel Maddow giving exactly the sort of monologue she usually gives in her A-block, describing why Frank Underwood (Spacey) was an uninspiring pick for vice president. Hey, and there's CNN's Ashleigh Banfield conducting an interview with Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) that dramatically pivots the series. In Veep, an almost identical role goes to Alison Janney, who, yes, is still largely famous from her role on The West Wing, but who isn't about to interview Charlie Rangel. Now, if you happen to be a reporter in D.C., and you don't understand why people like House of Cards so much, this media blitz is awfully disorienting. My colleague Willa Paskin is right: The show is ridiculous, set in a Washington of deeply naive people who speak in tortured analogies, and of a few brilliant people who also speak in tortured analogies. Frank's always doing that, sometimes over plates of ribs, sometimes while sketching a bull during a meeting. ""There are two types of vice presidents,"" he says. ""Doormats and matadors."" One angry Democrat derides the idea behind a bill because ""you can't fix a wrecked car with new hubcaps!"" A computer hacker is humiliated by his boss, barks like a dog, and is told that ""if you try to bite my hand, I will put you to sleep."" The problem in House of Cards is that Frank's still the best at this. Do you, viewer, ever really fear that Frank Underwood's going to lose? That he'll be caught? No, the thrill is in guessing how he'll evade the noose. There's nothing wrong with that--not every show, sadly, can be set during a zombie apocalypse--but this noose isn't even tied right. In the first episode of the new 13-part series, Underwood dons a fedora, sunglasses, and a black coat to meet with Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) the inamorata/unethical reporter who knows enough to nail him. Guess what happens next. He pushes her into the path of a train, a twist that's no surprise for viewers of the original, British House of Cards (also available on Netflix, even when it's snowing), and a twist that works. Until ... Underwood easily gets away with it. There was no security following the incoming vice president of the United States. There's no interest by anyone in the law or media in the death of a rising star, whose rise we watched just a few streaming episodes ago. Underwood's next opponents are much easier to outsmart. One of them, realizing he might be beaten, gives maybe the ultimate House of Cards line reading: ""Your hubris has given you delusions of grandeur, Frank!"" (There are more clunkers than you'd expect in a series written by a playwright. Another favorite: ""Raymond's not a politician. He relies on our political expertise as much as we rely on his business acumen."") Should the show be truer to Washington? No, that's a dull ask. Nobody wants to hear Washingtonians or journalists complain that this-or-that metro station should have more stairs. The problem is Underwood's enemies don't seem to understand politics. The new vice president establishes his power by pushing an entitlement reform amendment through the Republican-controlled Senate--Social Security retirement age raised to 68. This will give the Democratic administration ""a win."" Republicans, chiefly one Tea Party senator, worry that it will deprive them of a ""win,"" and a key Republican, we're told, was re-elected after the Tea Party ""dumped $10 million"" into his super PAC. Democrats worry about getting beaten, too. ""If we raise the retirement age,"" says one of them, ""the AARP will raise hell."" So a fixer gives the AARP $45 million. The bill succeeds, thanks to Frank managing the Senate vote and an ally (Molly Parker, playing Underwood's whip successor in the House) convincing fellow Democrats they'll be blamed if the government shuts down. But they wouldn't. In our reality, one that also includes Rachel Maddow and Ashleigh Banfield, entitlement reform is popular only with people who take lunch with Pete Peterson, and if the GOP is threatening to shut down the government, the GOP will be blamed for it. Public pressure, which probably just isn't compelling enough to portray in a soap opera, ruins the strategies of the smartest, coldest operatives. So do the media. Willimon's House of Cards has now surpassed its British inspiration in length and critical obsession. The media have got to be the reason for that--the British simply don't have the same reverence for political power. Ian Richardson's Francis Urquhart is commonly called ""FU,"" an oh-I-get-it joke that's saved for a big reveal in the American series. Reporters show him no particular regard. He leaks to them and outsmarts them, but when the British series portrayed the press it was covering the whip-turned-prime minister with hostile snark. In that show's second season, Urquhart forces the King of England (a thinly disguised Prince Charles) to abdicate because the monarch allies himself with the Labor Party, the media love it, and Urquhart wins an election anyway. In the American series, the media are completely oblivious to how Underwood cheerfully manipulates them. They turn on the president only after Underwood's schemes have undermined him. The stars who keep showing up are inevitably spun. ""You always ask the hard questions,"" says Underwood to 60 Minutes lifer Morley Safer, as the journalist fails to lay a glove on him. I get why people root for this villain, but hubris and grandeur shouldn't come so easy."
