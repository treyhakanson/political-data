While no other industry enjoys this kind of special government protection, the National Rifle Association had pushed the law for years as its top priority. It hailed the act as ""the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in twenty years."" They were right. The bill wiped out a series of lawsuits brought by mayors across the country to hold the gun industry responsible for the carnage in America's cities. The NRA finally scored this legislative victory because of the help of an important and unexpected ally: the Pentagon. Under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the Department of Defense said that the NRA-backed bill was necessary to protecting America's gun industry. In turn, the NRA heavily promoted the Pentagon's assessment that the bill would help protect national security. Without any evidence, the Pentagon's top lawyer, Daniel Dell'Orto, said that the bill would ""help safeguard our national security"" by protecting ""an industry that plays a critical role in meeting the procurement needs of our men and women in uniform."" Of course, no immunity exists for other industries that supply our armed forces with advanced weaponry or battle gear, but the Bush administration was determined to help advance the NRA's agenda. The Republicans used the Pentagon's endorsement to paint Democrats and gun control advocates as weak on national security. Citing the Pentagon's ""extraordinary step"" in supporting the bill, Rep. Candice Miller said that gun victim lawsuits would ""force U.S. arms producers out of business"" and would threaten ""our national security."" Support for the bill was a matter of supporting ""all of our men and women who serve in harm's way in defense of our freedoms,"" Sen. Larry Craig said. The implication was clear: If you supported the right of gun victims to bring a lawsuit against the industry that equipped their attacker, you were against our troops. The NRA also attempted to play up the national security implications of the Pentagon's support for the bill, claiming that the bill meant that U.S. soldiers ""will not have to rely on France, China, or Germany to supply their firearms."" The claim was and remains absurd. Lawsuits never drove an American gun manufacturer bankrupt. The gun industry was certainly making enough money to bankroll the NRA. But the Pentagon's stamp of approval was powerful: The law passed with 65 votes in the Senate, including 15 Democrats. While the torture memos that the Bush administration lawyers wrote were overturned, the result of the Pentagon's unorthodox intervention in America's domestic gun debate is still on the books. That needs to change. If he is confirmed, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel can undo the damage of this unholy Pentagon-NRA alliance by instructing the Defense Department's general counsel to review its policy and issue a new statement. Just as the Department of Justice officially overturned the Bush-era torture memos, the Pentagon needs to reverse this unprecedented handout to the gun industry. Rep. Adam Schiff already is working to introduce legislation that would repeal immunity for the gun industry. The Pentagon need only add its own vocal support. The goal should be to draw the gun industry into realizing that reducing gun violence is in its financial interest. In 2000, a coalition of cities, in conjunction with the Clinton administration, leveraged these lawsuits to persuade Smith and Wesson to implement common-sense safety measures, such as gun locks. If immunity for the gun industry is repealed, mayors across the country will be able to persuade the gun industry to accept reforms that make our streets safer. If the gun manufacturers refuse to settle these lawsuits, they will be forced to pay for rather than profit from gun violence. The Pentagon isn't supposed to be embroiled in domestic politics, and we have already paid an awful price for its decision to lobby on behalf of NRA-designed legislation. While in the Senate, Chuck Hagel voted for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. As Secretary of Defense, he should rescind the Pentagon's blatant political posturing against gun control. At his confirmation hearing on Thursday, the senators who want to hold the gun industry accountable should ask Hagel how he would address this sad chapter in the Pentagon's history."

Josh Marshall calls it a big, big deal. Eric Kleefeld says if the blueprint were in place last November, the GOP would have ""stolen 2012 for Mitt Romney."" Steve Benen of the Maddow Blog calls it a ""democracy-crushing scheme"" showing that ""the will of the voters and the consent of the governed are now antiquated concepts that Republicans no longer value."" They're all talking about potential plans to change the method for electing the president in states like Virginia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania--states that have Republican legislatures and governors but voted for Obama in 2012. Instead of awarding all of the state's Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate getting the most votes in each of these states, under the proposed plans most of the Electoral College votes would be awarded to the winner in each congressional district--and thanks to Republican gerrymandering of those districts, such a scheme would be a windfall for Republicans. This plan would be deeply concerning if Republicans were really going to enact it. But the same self-interest that is leading Republicans to consider this move is also going to lead most of them to abandon it almost everywhere. The Great Democratic Freak-out is unjustified. But it is not without its usefulness, because it reminds wavering Republicans what they will face if they go down the road of unilateral Electoral College reform. Let's start with the basics. In just about every U.S. election, the candidate who gets the most votes in the general election wins. Presidential elections are, of course, different: Each state gets assigned a number of Electoral College votes equal to the number of representatives and senators from that state. Besides two senators, the number of representatives depends on population, with more populous states getting more members of Congress. The U.S. Constitution's Article II gives each state's legislature the power to set the rules for choosing electors. In most states, the legislature has put in place a rule to give all of the state's Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate getting the most votes statewide. In Maine and Nebraska, they assign two of their votes to the statewide winner, and the rest by district--the same kind of arrangement under consideration by this new wave of Republican-dominated states. Article II gives the legislature very broad power to pick the rules for choosing presidential electors. These bodies could even take the right away from the voters and allocate the state's Electoral College votes itself--something the Supreme Court reaffirmed in its controversial Bush v. Gore decision in 2000. So despite all the talk of Republicans ""rigging"" the system by possibly changing these rules, there's nothing unconstitutional about switching to this method of choosing presidential electors. (In fact, a number of Democratic state legislatures, including California, have adopted the National Popular Vote plan, which would pledge all the participating states' electors to the presidential candidate getting the most votes nationwide once enough other states adopt it.) What's going to stop these changes to the electoral system is not law, but politics. Republicans have a lot to lose by going down this road, which is why Florida's legislative leaders have already balked at it. It's also why you don't see Republican legislatures simply reallocating Electoral College votes to themselves. First, it is wrong to assume, as the right's National Review and the left's Think Progress have, that Mitt Romney would have won had this rule been in place. As Donald Rumsfeld might say, you go into a campaign with the Electoral College rules you have, not the rules you wish them to be. The Obama and Romney campaigns would have campaigned very differently in these states if they were under a district system, targeting not voters across the state, but voters in the key districts needed to win the election. Yes, Republican gerrymandering of districts would have given the GOP some advantage, but it is far from clear it would have been enough to defeat the Obama campaign machine. Think about it: The last thing Republican legislators want is national Democratic campaigns scrounging for every vote in conservative-leaning districts. Fewer Republicans will win legislative and Congressional seats because Republican districts will become more competitive by design. Why would Republican legislators vote for a plan that will make it harder for them to keep their jobs? Further, adopting such a system immediately turns a battleground state into a less important state. If all that's up for grabs in Ohio are the three or four marginal Electoral College votes, then the presidential campaigns pay less attention to Ohio, and Ohio gets fewer promises and benefits from presidential candidates coming through. Such a plan is not good for those states that cherish being crucial to presidential election outcomes--states like Virginia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. In addition, the districting plan adopted in most of the swing states is a kind of unilateral disarmament. It is a sign of defeatism, an admission that the Republican Party no longer expects to win presidential elections in the state. Giving up on capturing a state's full complement of Electoral College votes will make it harder in close elections for Republican presidential candidates to put together the number of votes they need to win the election. Do Republicans really want to give up on Virginia and Wisconsin? It might make sense on these grounds for Republicans to adopt this plan in Pennsylvania, but all of the other states are just too competitive to take this risk. And finally, there is the risk of backlash, and this is where the Democratic freak-out comes into play. Republicans seem to have overplayed their hands in the 2012 election, adopting controversial voter identification, voter registration, and early voting rules intended to make it harder for Democrats to vote. To some extent these efforts in the voting wars backfired, subjecting Republicans to public criticism and some judicial reversals, and inspiring increased Democratic turnout to the polls. If Republicans proceed with these plans, any ""rigging"" or ""gaming"" of the Electoral College rules will be played up the same way by Democrats: Republicans can't win fair and square, so they have to manipulate the rules. We will soon learn whether rational Republicans will put the brakes on Electoral College reform. The Washington Post says the Virginia Legislature is considering changing the rules as early as next week. The Department of Justice could move to block the plan under the Voting Rights Act, but that path is uncertain. Regardless, the Great Democratic Freak-out makes the attempt to rejigger the rules much more costly, and if it does occur, the so-called reform could be self-defeating. Indeed, years from now Virginia's Republican legislators may remember that day as the day they first began to return the state house back to the Democrats. And a Democratic state Legislature would probably reverse the rules anyway."	Why Democrats Shouldn't Freak Out Over the GOP's Electoral College Ideas	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/leon_panetta_lifts_combat_ban_on_women_the_pentagon_s_announcement_finally.html	"Ten years ago, as I prepared to take part in the invasion of Iraq, I never thought women would be allowed to serve in combat jobs in the U.S. military, at least not in my lifetime. To be honest, I wasn't even sure it was a good idea. Some of my male comrades in the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) had even clearer thoughts on the question. They told me, sometimes to my face, that I didn't belong in the military at all, much less in a combat zone. Women serving in the infantry was simply anathema to them. Then we crossed the berm into Iraq and drove into Baghdad. Suddenly, my skills as an Arabic linguist were more important than my gender: On combat foot patrols with infantry troops, my ability to help successfully accomplish the mission was the only thing that mattered. During major combat operations, the fact that I was a woman was only meaningful if my presence made it easier for the guys to interact with local women. Some Iraqi women were prevented by custom or religion from talking to men; others were simply terrified of huge soldiers strapped in military gear suddenly appearing at their door. The presence of another woman sometimes calmed them and give them the comfort level to tell us about threats in their neighborhood. After I returned home, I started to question my earlier doubts. In time, I became convinced that although the older generation of military leaders may not have been prepared to see women attain full equality in uniform, the troops I served alongside would be ready once they moved into leadership positions. They would have seen women medics, helicopter pilots, and food specialists serve in combat. Women like Monica Lin Brown, an Army medic who was awarded the Silver Star for her combat valor in Afghanistan; Tammy Duckworth, a helicopter pilot who lost both her legs due to injuries sustained in combat in Iraq; and Shoshana Johnson, a food service specialist who became the first African American female POW when her unit was ambushed in Iraq. The men and women I served with saw that Americans did not rise up in protest when more than 150 female U.S. servicemembers gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather, the public accepted that women who chose to volunteer for military service did so knowing the risks, and grieved for them just as they did for the men who made the ultimate sacrifice. Those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan came to understand that in complex counterinsurgency operations, especially in Muslim nations, the presence of women troops is a vital way to interact with the civilian population--so important, in fact, that military leaders have long been skirting the old regulations by placing women in combat units. Today, when Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announces the repeal of the combat ban on women soldiers, the policy will finally catch up to the reality that many of us who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan already know. It will be now be up to the services to demonstrate that women should be banned from specific jobs, rather than there being a blanket ban on women in all ground combat roles and smaller units whose primary mission is direct ground combat. It is a tremendous step forward. The fact that the final push has come from within the military speaks volumes for how vital women have become to operational success. Much work remains to be done to implement this landmark reform. It is likely that the military will follow a multiyear process for phasing in changes, similar to that planned by the Australian military. Australia began allowing women to transfer between services into combat roles this month and will allow female recruits to enter those jobs directly in January 2016. The Aussies believe these changes will be fully implemented later that same year. The U.S. military services (particularly the Army and Marines) may argue that some jobs, particularly in the Special Forces, should remain closed to women. But as women continue to prove their abilities in a growing number of positions, those exclusions will become harder to justify. It is true that not all women can handle the physical demands of military service. However, neither can all men. In fact, only 25 percent of today's young people qualify for military service at all--the rest are too obese, too poorly educated, or have criminal backgrounds that bar them. Today Panetta is acknowledging that to maintain the high standards of the military, assignments should be based on ability, not gender. There will be challenges, just as there are with any policy change across the military. However, the dire predictions of catastrophe in the wake of the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" were gratifyingly overwrought. The pundits who claimed the military would not be able to handle gays serving openly are typically the same ones who argue against women serving equally; I am convinced they will be just as wrong this time as they were then. Today women in the military will revel at the news. Tomorrow they will go back to work."	Ten years ago my fellow soldiers would have balked at having women serve in combat.

At the start of this year, the Senate opened for business, but did not adjourn, a gimmick that allows its ""first day"" to extend indefinitely. Senate Democrats opted for this procedural sleight of hand because only on this so-called first day could a simple, 51-seat majority of the Senate pass a rules package. There were probably 51 Democrats ready to pass filibuster reform. ""Reform of the rules will be front and center when we return,"" said New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall back on Jan. 3. Writing at the same time, Ezra Klein said, ""Reformers tell me that the expected deadline is Jan. 22, or thereabouts."" Key word: thereabouts. Democrats now say that the reform vote will happen ""soon""--probably Jan. 23, but let's not get carried away. The sticking point is a possible compromise, the brainchild of a ""Group of Eight"" led by Sen. Carl Levin and Sen. John McCain that could attract Republican votes. It wouldn't give the Democrats everything they want--it wouldn't force senators to filibuster by actually standing up and talking until their voices or bladders give out. But it would keep Democrats from using the ""nuclear option"" of a majority vote, and Republicans have sworn holy, unending warfare if the Democrats go there. (Hence the ""nuclear"" branding. Reformers call this the ""constitutional"" option, which is not wrong, but opponents say it'll bring on mutually assured destruction.) It's the World's Greatest Deliberative Body engaging in pretty simple game theory. If Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell can't agree on a reform package, Reid would ""move forward"" and go nuclear. The diehards, led by Udall and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, keep claiming they have the 51 votes for reform. The most compromise-friendly members of the conference are with them. ""I am deeply frustrated with our inability to legislate,"" said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons. ""Deeply. And I'm willing to take unprecedented action because of that."" ""That's all I want to do, just talk,"" said Montana Sen. Jon Tester. ""We do that, and I'm happy as a clam."" But the anti-nuclear holdouts can't say they have the votes for a compromise. They're hoping that a Reid-McConnell deal can emerge, and that everyone will buy it and the Senate will become a less horrible place to work. ""I think they're making progress,"" said McCain. ""I'm very hopeful. The model that they're using is our recommendations, and I hope it works."" And they're hopeful because of the overlap between Merkley-Udall and Levin-McCain. Both plans limit the time needed to debate nominees after a filibuster is broken, from 30 hours to two hours. (The Levin-McCain plan keeps the marathon time for important nominees.) Both plans would end the filibuster on the motion to proceed. Reid, reportedly, has taken those ideas and added one that basically flips the responsibility for filibustering. Right now, to reach cloture, the majority needs to put together 60 votes. The new idea (credited to Sen. Al Franken) would put the onus on the minority to find 41 ""no"" votes. That, swear reformers, would prevent the current practice of delaying bills or nominees for months, holding the vote, and finding that there were only a dozen or so senators who actually cared enough to block it. There are only four or five Democratic senators still seen as holdouts, believers in either the old filibuster system or skeptics of the nuclear option. They don't hate this 41-vote idea. ""I like that,"" said Levin on Tuesday, as he walked into the meeting where Democrats would talk over their options. ""I'd love to be able to do that."" As he left the room, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor wondered ""how much traction"" the 41-vote idea has, but said he'd ""look at it""--an open-ended musing he hasn't made about any other reform idea. The problem, ironically enough, is the vote count. The McCain-Levin ""Group of Eight"" is now a Group of Seven. The eighth member, Arizona's Jon Kyl, retired in 2012. His successor, Sen. Jeff Flake, has told me he's skeptical of most filibuster reform ideas. When I asked Levin whether the compromise-ready Republicans could bring along enough votes to pass this reform, he demurred. ""I assume that they're making the same arguments we are,"" he said. ""The question is: What do the leaders do? It's really in their hands. Our recommendation was really to the leaders. We haven't been on the floor, you'll notice, making our arguments. We circulated them, they're public, we had a press conference, and we're telling them we hope you can take this, we think there's value in it, and you can use this as a basis for a bipartisan compromise."" But the only reason Republicans are talking compromise is that they fear a Democratic ""nuclear option."" Merkley and his allies have counted votes, hard votes, and the compromisers haven't. ""I think switching from 60 to 41 would be very valuable,"" said Merkley after the Democrats' strategy luncheon. But there remained ""two paths"" forward, and one of them was his plan. ""That's kind of the gold standard. Sometimes you have to settle for the silver standard or the bronze standard, but I still advocate for the gold standard."" Merkley had used the Democrats' lunch meeting to advocate it. ""I started with what the president said yesterday,"" he said. ""If we're going to do our part, as the government, with the issues lying before us, we cannot start with that kind of paralysis."""	Are the Democrats Going Nuclear on Filibuster Reform?

Byron York, one of the city's best-respected conservative reporters, told readers that the ""low-interest Obama inauguration"" was leaving hotel rooms empty. ""Amid lessened hope and enthusiasm for his presidency,"" wrote York, ""it's easy to find a room."" Twitchy, a conservative site that collates tweets into stories, highlighted twitpics of empty streets and light human traffic, ""just a fraction"" of 2009's rolling madhouse. Crowd size is a powerful stimulant. When you enter the D.C. office of FreedomWorks, you see a photo of the Sept. 12, 2009 ""taxpayer march on Washington,"" blown up to fit the better part of a wall. After that march ended, activists shared photo analyses and time-release data to argue that at least a million people had shown up. Fox News took out an ad in the Washington Post, page A9, with a picture of the crowd surging up the mall and a taunt at its rival networks for ""missing the story."" In 2010, Glenn Beck commandeered the National Mall for his Restoring Honor Rally, and his fans were sure he'd drawn more congregants than Martin Luther King Jr. did. The crowdsmanship flowed straight into the 2012 campaign. When Barack Obama made a campaign stop, Mitt Romney's campaign (or supportive bloggers) fired up Google to confirm that he was drawing fewer people than he did in 2008. A last-minute Obama rally in Wisconsin was smaller than a last-minute 2004 rally for John Kerry. A Cleveland stop was ""twenty times"" smaller than a 2008 Obama rally there. Obama had downsized from a monster outdoor victory rally in Chicago to a party at the blocky convention center. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney would gawk at his own crowds and tell them that they'd ""become a movement."" They would take him to Washington. That didn't work out. At 7:27 a.m. (or so) today, I left my house in a pleasantly gentrified neighborhood about two miles north of the Capitol. The only people on the streets were headed for the metro stations. The white twentysomethings wore those white-twentysomething uniforms of slim jeans, Uggs, pea coats, and beards. The middle-aged black folks wore Obama gear, and with zero irony--sweatshirts with odd-colored photos of the first family, unofficial knit hats with the ""O"" in Obama turned into a peace symbol. One woman sported a red satin jacket with smiling pictures of the president sewn on like Girl Scout badges, and ""THE ONE"" written where an athlete's name would be. This was a smaller group than 2009, but it managed to overload every relevant Metro stop and every checkpoint. The press, eventually, was diverted through one of the House office buildings, where their gear could be scanned. By 9 a.m., anyone arriving at the press and VIP rows below the inaugural stand could look back and see the Mall filled, choked up back to the Washington Monument. Who were these people? At the edge of the VIP section, stage right, some room had been cleared for Tuskegee Airmen. Any member of the media who ambled around would walk right into them, and so at any given time, four or five reporters were leaning into the wheelchairs, filing a tear-jerk story. None of the pioneering black airmen were younger than 80; the youngest, Ezra Hill, was aged 82, and spry enough to direct airmen from the perimeter into the prime spots.* When an instrumental version of ""Amazing Grace"" plays, he and another airman sing the lyrics. The two of them, said Hill, had sung together for years, and even won a competition in 1948. ""They locked up the trophy, like we'd never did nothing,"" he said. ""It was segregation, you know how it was. It's like President Obama said: You were 20 years ahead of Martin Luther King. The Tuskegee Airmen opened the door. Everyone else was pulled along."" The Tuskegee Airmen had gotten similar treatment at the 2009 inauguration, and Obama had invited them to the White House since then. I wasn't surprised to hear them quoting the president from memory. Any glance into the crowd, at any point, revealed a preponderance of African-American faces. Near the ticketed seats, with a view partially obscured by the towering media stands, a group of activists who'd shared rides here compared how much they'd done for Obama. ""Cleveland got it done!"" said Greg Parks, a reverend from the city. ""Go back and check the margin from Cuyahoga County--300,000 votes. That was the margin. We won the state."" ""I was in Denver,"" said Brenda Innis, a retired teacher who'd come to D.C. early in the week to see her son get a Navy promotion. ""We turned it from red to blue!"" Parks had the better argument, actually. Both of those states voted for Bush, then for Obama. Both of them, I noticed, were already clued-in and worried about future elections being taken away. ""They're trying to change the way they give the, what are they called, the Electoral College districts,"" said Parks. ""The Republicans are already saying they're going to change that, so if we won again, the Republicans would get a few votes. They're doing that today! While we're here!"" You didn't hear angst like that in the 2009. The Obama win had been overwhelming, and the people that booked every hotel in the beltway adored him before he'd really done anything. This was the point of all that conservative mockery and talking-down of 2013. It was a theme of the campaign, too--the Republican National Committee's closing ad, in some suburban markets, portrayed the Obama vote as a knee-injuring dance craze that everyone had learned to regret. ""He tried,"" sighed the narrator. ""You tried. It's OK to make a change."" Actually, the Obama voter had learned never to trust Republicans. During his speech, the loudest cheer rose when the president settled scores from 2012. ""Our journey is not complete,"" he said, ""until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote."" This was a problem that excited the pundit class every four years, and no president had mentioned it in a speech like this--the crowd erupted. The president denounced ""name-calling as reasoned debate,"" and the cheers were almost as loud. Of course they were. Four years ago, everybody except Sarah Palin seemed to love Barack Obama. And now he'd defeated people who challenged his citizenship and called him an agent of long-dead Communists. The people who'd come back for this inauguration hadn't beaten the crowds from 2009. But they'd sure enough beaten the Tea Party. The president had fallen short on civil liberties, on climate bills, on a lot of what these people wanted. But they blamed his enemies, not the One. He'd been underestimated, and so had they, and that was exactly how they were going to win again. Correction, Jan. 22, 2013: This article originally identified Ezra Hill, one of the Tuskegee Airmen, as a former pilot. In fact, he was an engineer. (Return.)"

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/barack_obama_s_inauguration_the_president_offered_a_surprisingly_partisan.html	"In 2009, Barack Obama's inauguration was a civil rights turning point. In his 2013 inaugural address, he sang the song of America's civil rights progress. He talked about how the growing support for the rights of women, African-Americans, and gays affirmed the essential promise in the Declaration of Independence. At a time when Washington seems so tiny you could fit it into your pocket, he asked everyone to look up from their Twitter feed to see how much had changed around them. The president was nodding to the coalition that elected him and that he represented, sewing it more fully into the American story. (He's not the only sign of change. The new Congress has 20 women senators, a record.) In his first inaugural address, the president cited familiar turning points in American history: ""Concord, Gettysburg, Normandy and Khe Sahn."" This time, the historical heroes were straight from his electoral coalition. He named the crucible moments in women's rights, gay rights, and African-American rights: ""We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths--that all of us are created equal--is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth."" The president framed these advancements as a natural extension of the American experiment. Then he pivoted--grafting his agenda onto that progress. He committed himself to climate change, immigration, gun control, and a budget where the middle class was protected. He framed each policy challenge though, not as some abstract issue, but in the framework of advancing rights for those who do not yet have a full chance at the American dream: It is now our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began.  For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country. Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. Before the speech, an Obama adviser said to me, ""He won't say, ""I won, but ...,""his voice trailing off. In other words, the president would all but say that. If you were listening during the campaign, the themes in the president's second inaugural address sounded familiar. What Republicans heard was a tone poem from the president to growing government. If a Republican president had been speaking, there would have been paragraph after paragraph about tackling the deficit, the sapping evil of the federal government, and the danger the country's mounting debt poses to personal liberty. Obama barely mentioned the deficit. When he did, it was to warn against excessive spending reductions.  The president passed by the deficit on his way to making a larger point about government spending. Obama said, ""We reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future."" This is familiar language he uses when dealing with Republicans--and they rightly hear it that way. Obama took a swipe at the usual GOP suspects. Conjuring House Republicans--perhaps his most obvious target--he said, ""We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate."" On the issue of climate change, first-term President Obama might have called on lawmakers to reason together. Not this time. He framed the issue--which faltered in his first term in part because of Democratic opposition--by essentially calling his opponents flat-earthers: ""Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms,"" he said. And there was this code, straight from the bitterest of the campaign fights. ""They do not make us a nation of takers,"" said the president referring to the entitlement programs of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. ""They free us to take the risks that make this country great."" It was Paul Ryan, whose talk about ""takers who feed off the government and don't pay taxes"" became an issue during the presidential campaign. Ryan was also the author of the premium support plan for Medicare that the president campaigned against. Afterward during his lunch with congressional leaders, the president sounded a note of humility, saying, """"The longer you are [in the office of the presidency], the more humble you become."" But there was none of this personal humility in his remarks on the Mall. If the president was in a mood to reach out to Republicans, he had no interest in making it part of the day's big event. If the president's message wasn't aimed at making common cause with Republicans, he was reaching out to the country. He hinted at a new kind of citizen activism--not votes but voices. ""You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time, not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift."" This was a speech for ""we the people""--a phrase he returned to repeatedly--not ""we the lawmakers."" This partisan edge is in keeping with the new freedom the president is feeling. He had coffee with Republican leaders before the inauguration and talked about collective action and unity, but he doesn't seem to be in a schmoozing mood. According to various White House aides--and the president himself--striving for comity just isn't going to do him much good when it comes to getting things done. It's not going to change minds in the House Republican caucus. Given that, the president has a low opinion of how much he can accomplish by making deals with John Boehner. As one White House adviser put it, speaking of the House speaker, ""He's a nice guy, but he can't lead anyone to a deal."" Thus, today was a preview of coming attractions. Expect the president to use his State of the Union, other big speeches, and campaign organization to create outside pressure that will inspire Republicans to act. After Monday's speech was over, the president sent a note to members of his political committee, now called Organizing for Action, thanking them and asking for their support in the months to come: ""Now it's time to finish what we started--let's get going."" The president's second inaugural is what passes for unity these days; tomorrow the battles begin again."	Why Obama Was Partisan in His Second Inaugural Address 	['Paul', 'Obama']	['gay']
6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/barack_obama_s_second_inaugural_address_the_president_should_declare_war.html	"On Monday, President Obama will preside over the grand reopening of his administration. It would be altogether fitting if he stepped to the microphone, looked down the mall, and let out a sigh: so many people expecting so much from a government that appears capable of so little. A second inaugural suggests new beginnings, but this one is being bookended by dead-end debates. Gridlock over the fiscal cliff preceded it and gridlock over the debt limit, sequester, and budget will follow. After the election, the same people are in power in all the branches of government and they don't get along. There's no indication that the president's clashes with House Republicans will end soon. Inaugural speeches are supposed to be huge and stirring. Presidents haul our heroes onstage, from George Washington to Martin Luther King Jr. George W. Bush brought the Liberty Bell. They use history to make greatness and achievements seem like something you can just take down from the shelf. Americans are not stuck in the rut of the day. But this might be too much for Obama's second inaugural address: After the last four years, how do you call the nation and its elected representatives to common action while standing on the steps of a building where collective action goes to die? That bipartisan bag of tricks has been tried and it didn't work. People don't believe it. Congress' approval rating is 14 percent, the lowest in history. In a December Gallup poll, 77 percent of those asked said the way Washington works is doing ""serious harm"" to the country. The challenge for President Obama's speech is the challenge of his second term: how to be great when the environment stinks. Enhancing the president's legacy requires something more than simply the clever application of predictable stratagems. Washington's partisan rancor, the size of the problems facing government, and the limited amount of time before Obama is a lame duck all point to a single conclusion: The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat. President Obama could, of course, resign himself to tending to the achievements of his first term. He'd make sure health care reform is implemented, nurse the economy back to health, and put the military on a new footing after two wars. But he's more ambitious than that. He ran for president as a one-term senator with no executive experience. In his first term, he pushed for the biggest overhaul of health care possible because, as he told his aides, he wanted to make history. He may already have made it. There's no question that he is already a president of consequence. But there's no sign he's content to ride out the second half of the game in the Barcalounger. He is approaching gun control, climate change, and immigration with wide and excited eyes. He's not going for caretaker. How should the president proceed then, if he wants to be bold? The Barack Obama of the first administration might have approached the task by finding some Republicans to deal with and then start agreeing to some of their demands in hope that he would win some of their votes. It's the traditional approach. Perhaps he could add a good deal more schmoozing with lawmakers, too. That's the old way. He has abandoned that. He doesn't think it will work and he doesn't have the time. As Obama explained in his last press conference, he thinks the Republicans are dead set on opposing him. They cannot be unchained by schmoozing. Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence, other constraints will limit the chance for cooperation. Republican lawmakers worried about primary challenges in 2014 are not going to be willing partners. He probably has at most 18 months before people start dropping the lame-duck label in close proximity to his name. Obama's only remaining option is to pulverize. Whether he succeeds in passing legislation or not, given his ambitions, his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition's most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it, at least temporarily, in disarray. This theory of political transformation rests on the weaponization (and slight bastardization) of the work by Yale political scientist Stephen Skowronek. Skowronek has written extensively about what distinguishes transformational presidents from caretaker presidents. In order for a president to be transformational, the old order has to fall as the orthodoxies that kept it in power exhaust themselves. Obama's gambit in 2009 was to build a new post-partisan consensus. That didn't work, but by exploiting the weaknesses of today's Republican Party, Obama has an opportunity to hasten the demise of the old order by increasing the political cost of having the GOP coalition defined by Second Amendment absolutists, climate science deniers, supporters of ""self-deportation"" and the pure no-tax wing. The president has the ambition and has picked a second-term agenda that can lead to clarifying fights. The next necessary condition for this theory to work rests on the Republican response. Obama needs two things from the GOP: overreaction and charismatic dissenters. They're not going to give this to him willingly, of course, but mounting pressures in the party and the personal ambitions of individual players may offer it to him anyway. Indeed, Republicans are serving him some of this recipe already on gun control, immigration, and the broader issue of fiscal policy. On gun control, the National Rifle Association has overreached. Its Web video mentioning the president's children crossed a line.* The group's dissembling about the point of the video and its message compounds the error. (The video was also wrong). The NRA is whipping up its members, closing ranks, and lashing out. This solidifies its base, but is not a strategy for wooing those who are not already engaged in the gun rights debate. It only appeals to those who already think the worst of the president. Republicans who want to oppose the president on policy grounds now have to make a decision: Do they want to be associated with a group that opposes, in such impolitic ways, measures like universal background checks that 70 to 80 percent of the public supports? Polling also suggests that women are more open to gun control measures than men. The NRA, by close association, risks further defining the Republican Party as the party of angry, white Southern men. The president is also getting help from Republicans who are calling out the most extreme members of the coalition. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the NRA video ""reprehensible."" Others who have national ambitions are going to have to follow suit. The president can rail about and call the GOP bad names, but that doesn't mean people are going to listen. He needs members inside the Republican tent to ratify his positions--or at least to stop marching in lockstep with the most controversial members of the GOP club. When Republicans with national ambitions make public splits with their party, this helps the president. (There is a corollary: The president can't lose the support of Democratic senators facing tough races in 2014. Opposition from within his own ranks undermines his attempt to paint the GOP as beyond the pale.) If the Republican Party finds itself destabilized right now, it is in part because the president has already implemented a version of this strategy. In the 2012 campaign, the president successfully transformed the most intense conservative positions into liabilities on immigration and the role of government. Mitt Romney won the GOP nomination on a platform of ""self-deportation"" for illegal immigrants--and the Obama team never let Hispanics forget it. The Obama campaign also branded Republicans with Romney's ill-chosen words about 47 percent of Americans as the party of uncaring millionaires. Now Republican presidential hopefuls like Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, and Bobby Jindal are trying to fix the party's image. There is a general scramble going on as the GOP looks for a formula to move from a party that relies on older white voters to one that can attract minorities and younger voters. Out of fear for the long-term prospects of the GOP, some Republicans may be willing to partner with the president. That would actually mean progress on important issues facing the country, which would enhance Obama's legacy. If not, the president will stir up a fracas between those in the Republican Party who believe it must show evolution on issues like immigration, gun control, or climate change and those who accuse those people of betraying party principles. That fight will be loud and in the open--and in the short term unproductive. The president can stir up these fights by poking the fear among Republicans that the party is becoming defined by its most extreme elements, which will in turn provoke fear among the most faithful conservatives that weak-willed conservatives are bending to the popular mood. That will lead to more tin-eared, dooming declarations of absolutism like those made by conservatives who sought to define the difference between legitimate and illegitimate rape--and handed control of the Senate to Democrats along the way. For the public watching from the sidelines, these intramural fights will look confused and disconnected from their daily lives. (Lip-smacking Democrats don't get too excited: This internal battle is the necessary precondition for a GOP rebirth, and the Democratic Party has its own tensions.) This approach is not a path of gentle engagement. It requires confrontation and bright lines and tactics that are more aggressive than the president demonstrated in the first term. He can't turn into a snarling hack. The posture is probably one similar to his official second-term photograph: smiling, but with arms crossed. The president already appears to be headed down this path. He has admitted he's not going to spend much time improving his schmoozing skills; he's going to get outside of Washington to ratchet up public pressure on Republicans. He is transforming his successful political operation into a governing operation. It will have his legacy and agenda in mind--and it won't be affiliated with the Democratic National Committee, so it will be able to accept essentially unlimited donations. The president tried to use his political arm this way after the 2008 election, but he was constrained by re-election and his early promises of bipartisanship. No more. Those days are done. Presidents don't usually sow discord in their inaugural addresses, though the challenge of writing a speech in which the call for compromise doesn't evaporate faster than the air out of the president's mouth might inspire him to shake things up a bit. If it doesn't, and he tries to conjure our better angels or summon past American heroes, then it will be among the most forgettable speeches, because the next day he's going to return to pitched political battle. He has no time to waste. Correction, Jan. 18, 2013: This article originally identified a National Rifle Association online video as a television ad. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Why Obama Should Seek To Destroy the Republican Party	['Romney', 'Christie', 'Obama']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/sandy_hook_truthers_the_nra_has_actively_encouraged_the_paranoid_fears_of.html	"Read more in Slate about gun control. On Wednesday afternoon, shortly before Manti Te'o's girlfriend became the only story in sports, new Washington Nationals outfielder Denard Span brought his fans in on a conspiracy theory. ""I was watching some controversial stuff on YouTube about the sandy hooks thing today!"" he tweeted. ""It really makes u think and wonder."" Anybody paying attention to the dark corners of the Internet--i.e., most of the Internet--knew what Span was watching. In one week, a 30-minute YouTube video titled ""The Sandy Hook Shooting--Fully Exposed"" has been viewed 10,000,000 times. It uses text, narration, and mournful music to annotate found footage and websites, ""proving"" that the murder of 26 people in Newtown, Conn., may have been propagated then covered up by government operatives with an agenda. I don't know how to approach conspiracy theories anymore. Four-odd years ago, in my first piece for Slate, I profiled the ""birther"" activists who were petitioning to overturn Barack Obama's victory, because they thought he was born in Kenya. I naively expected the birthers to lose their cases and move on. Many lawsuits later, I watched the chairman of the Arizona Republican Party transform the state's Electoral College vote into a gripefest about Barack Obama's troubling birth certificate. But the Sandy Hook ""truther"" movement isn't quite like birtherism, or like vintage 9/11 trutherism. Both of those manias grew out of partisanship. As my colleague Jeremy Stahl proved, 9/11 trutherism flourished thanks to ""general unhappiness with the war in Iraq and a small but deep strain of Bush hatred."" Birtherism mushroomed when conservatives got desperate about ousting Obama. Gun massacre trutherism isn't tied to election results. It bubbles over after every massacre. Sandy Hook is moving public opinion like no massacre since Virginia Tech--and its truther movement, naturally, is growing faster. Every shooting that involves a mentally ill loner invites speculation that the loner was programmed by the government.  After the mass casualties at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater, Alex Jones' InfoWars, a conspiracy news hub that got a recent boost from CNN's Piers Morgan, asked readers to consider the shooter's ""work as a graduate student in a government-funded neuroscience program that specifically researched altered perception of time and reality."" The completely different circumstances of the Virginia Tech attack led to a theory that ""black ops"" were behind the shooting. Every post-shooting conspiracy theory follows a script. The viral Sandy Hook video is just an unusually good example. It begins with hasty interviews from the day of the massacre, men-on-the-street spreading rumors that led the news but were debunked and would have been forgotten without the magic of online video. (This happened at Virginia Tech, too--a confused caller told Fox News that more shots were being heard on the campus long after the massacre.) Later, it suggests that Gene Rosen, a senior citizen who comforted kids fleeing the school, is a member of the Screen Actors Guild, faking the whole thing. The evidence? He's awfully compelling, and someone named ""Gene Rosen"" is a member of the Screen Actors Guild. Other Sandy Hook truthers have ""proved"" that Emilie Parker, a 6-year old victim at the school, is still alive. She's not. It's her sister who's been photographed since the massacre. But what's the point of debunking any of this? The theories don't spread because they're credible. They spread in part because of the confirmation bias of worried gun owners. And that's actually been egged on, multiple times, by the National Rifle Association. The gun lobby might be the only credible group, with real clout, with the ability to bring presidential candidates to its conferences, to endorse the idea that the government would engage in a ""false flag"" operation. In 2011, as the Republican House of Representatives dug in on the ""Fast and Furious"" investigation, the NRA's professional flak magnet Wayne LaPierre speculated that the Feds planned the debacle, to build momentum for gun control. ""Over a period of two or three years they were running thousands and thousands of guns to the most evil people on earth,"" he said. ""At the same time they were yelling '90 per cent... of the guns the Mexican drug cartels are using come from the United States.' "" It wasn't a wild theory. ""It's the only thing that makes any sense."" The idea that the government is one short step away from a gun ban is actually integral to the lobby's pitch. It's implicit when the lobby brags about ammo sales at gun shows or AR-15s disappearing from the shelves. And give the NRA this: It's not entirely wrong about the momentum of politics. At the 2012 Conservative Political Action Conference, LaPierre warned that the first-term Obama administration's ""lip service to gun owners is just part of a massive Obama conspiracy to deceive voters and hide his true intentions to destroy the Second Amendment during his second term."" ""We see the president's strategy crystal clear,"" said LaPierre. ""Get re-elected and, with no more elections to worry about, get busy dismantling and destroying our firearms' freedom, erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights and excise it from the U.S. Constitution."" Only the first clause in that rant is true. There was no gun ban proposed this week. There is no posse of New Black Panthers burning copies of the Constitution. But the fact that Obama responded to Sandy Hook at all validates LaPierre's fears, and he's said so. Why would anyone be surprised when that paranoia grows into a full-on conspiracy theory?"

The unhappy truce between the White House and the National Rifle Association is over; the only surprise is that it lasted a month. Last week, after its representatives left a meeting with the vice president's gun-law task force, the group put out its first real public statement since Wayne LaPierre doused himself with gasoline and dropped a match on his coif. ""We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe,"" read the unsigned statement, ""and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment."" The NRA had only wanted to talk about putting armed guards in schools. On Monday, President Obama basically wrote them off. ""Those who oppose any common-sense gun control or gun safety measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government's about to take all your guns away,"" he said. ""It obviously is good for business."" To prove him right--to prove how flabby and predictable the gun lobby's media strategy is right now--the NRA responded by bragging that 250,000 new freedom-lovers had become members, as happens ""every time President Obama opens his mouth."" It had nothing to do with the price of membership dropping from $1,000 to $300. In public, Democrats are less afraid of the NRA than they've been in years. The LaPierre press conference contributed to a significant fall-off in favorable opinions of the gun lobby. That's one reason why the post-Sandy Hook push for gun control has actually kept momentum. New polls that get granular about possible laws--an ""assault weapons"" ban, restrictions on extended magazines, expanded background checks--are finding supermajority public support. On Tuesday, during votes on Hurricane Sandy relief, reporters were crowded around Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, the luckless New York Democrat who's constantly proposing gun laws that go nowhere. ""The public is with us,"" she said. ""On the assault weapons ban, I believe the numbers were up to 70 percent this morning!"" The polls help, but how much do they matter to a Republican-run House? On Wednesday, President Obama will announce the specific recommendations of the Biden group. Democrats, who largely support passage of some bill, expect to move it through the Senate, putting pressure on the House. (This is why it matters that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat whose best TV ad showed him putting a bullet through an environmental bill, is so chatty about a possible gun bill.) But members of the House are far more conservative on gun laws, and far more vulnerable if they're seen as straying on the Second Amendment. Rep. Raul Labrador, a Republican who represents western Idaho, said he wasn't ruling out any ideas that might emerge from the Biden group. ""I'm really open to listening to what they're saying,"" he said, ""and to seeing the evidence that it will actually work."" His constituents had made their minds up. ""They're saying, 'Don't take our guns away.' There's a lot of support for the Second Amendment and I will continue to be a supporter of the Second Amendment."" House Republicans are cautious. After all, they'll get to decide whether or not Congress passes the first gun control bill since 1994. So their statements and responses on gun control can be sliced into three categories: dodges, compromise, and chest-pounding. The dodging is hardest to pull off. On Tuesday, House Republicans generally held back questions about the known Biden proposals by saying they had to wait to see them in print. But they were very sympathetic. ""I use an acid test,"" said Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell. ""If this was my children, my beautiful grandchildren, would I have the same view I have now?"" He wrestled with it; he was cautious of ""passing a bill just to say"" that Congress had Done Something. ""I'm a data-driven person and I'm looking for as much good counsel on how we can responsibly reduce gun violence."" This is a common line--intentional or not, it creates a loophole. There's obviously little hard data on how, for example, the existence of extended magazines has affected gun violence. But there is extensive reporting on the circumstances of recent shootings. If a proposed gun law would not have prevented that specific shooting, a Republican can say that it wouldn't work at all. ""What massacre occurred smack in the middle of the assault weapons ban?"" asked South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. It was a rhetorical question, a reference to the Columbine shootings. That was his point. Gowdy won his seat, in 2010, by clobbering an incumbent Republican who'd been casting liberal votes. There's no incentive for him to back any new gun law. That's where the compromise comes in. Gowdy, like a lot of Republicans, wonders whether mental health laws, not gun laws, are the right response to Newtown. ""It's already against federal law to possess any kind of gun if you've been adjudicated mentally defective,"" he said. ""Those are not my words. Those are the words of the state. Are you satisfied with those being the only mechanisms by which someone can be barred from carrying a firearm due to mental illness? Would you define it as someone who is likely to harm himself or others? Here's my question: How many people were persecuted under that law? I've written the attorney general. I've asked him. How many times have local law enforcement gone to ATF, and they've declined?"" That's what a House Republican says when he's considering actual legislation. The ""chest-pounding"" response to the president is easier. It involves overheated panic at any ""executive orders"" that might be directed at guns. The single most quoted Republican congressman on gun rights this week was Texas Rep. Steve Stockman, a one-term veteran of the 1994 GOP wave who finally earned his comeback this year. He promised to stop executive orders ""by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even articles of impeachment."" Tennessee Rep. Scott DeJarlais, getting in on the fun, speculated about using ""any and all available legislative and legal options to protect and maintain our separation of powers,"" to make the president ""abandon this autocratic approach."" This slots right into the ""crazy Republicans act crazy"" narrative. It helps with the constituents, but it's a distraction. ""What I have read so far indicates that President Obama and Vice President Biden want to make sure that we have enforcement of our current laws,"" said Idaho's Labrador. ""I'm OK with that. If you talk to any law enforcement agent, that's what we say, that we're not enforcing the laws we have."" Wednesday's big announcement won't be about ""the laws we have."" It won't just be about mental health, either. It will contain executive orders that Republicans have pre-condemned and limitations on sales that they have pre-judged as pointless. Any bill will need to satisfy a majority of the House Republican caucus--there can be no grand coalition, with a minority GOP vote, as there was on the fiscal cliff or on Hurricane Sandy funding. Spending bills and tax bills are nothing like gun rights bills. ""We'll see how much of tomorrow is politics,"" said Gowdy, ""and how much is thoughtful legal analysis."""	Will Obama's Gun Control Measures Have Any Chance?	['Gowdy', 'Labrador', 'Rigell', 'Obama']	['guns']
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/barack_obama_and_newtown_shooting_the_president_wants_to_push_for_gun_control.html	"The battle for gun control is a battle against the clock. After a tragedy like the massacre in Newtown, Conn., gun control advocates say lawmakers have about 30 days to channel public outrage toward enacting laws that might prevent another mass killing. After that, people get distracted, new challenges crop up, memories dim, and nothing gets done. Those who would like to stop gun control legislation know how this clock ticks, too. It is a battle between emotion and organization. How long can the emotion be sustained and how long can the NRA organization wait it out? This Sunday will mark 30 days since the Newtown, Conn., shooting. Gun control advocates say that the Newtown killings slowed this march of time. Whether it was because the victims were helpless kids, because it was near Christmas, or because this horrible event, after so many other horrible events, caused a tipping point, the window for action will stay open longer than 30 days this time. But how much longer? There is only one person who can really keep the window open: President Obama. After the shooting, the president who didn't talk much about gun control for four years, set a high bar for himself. He promised to use all the powers of the presidency to combat the root causes of gun violence. We're starting to see what that means in real terms, and the task, as administration officials and gun control advocates talk about it, puts the president ever more on the hook. The president is the only one with the public stage to maintain and shape public concern after the massacre. After his successful re-election, he also has the ready-made grass-roots organization to rally public sentiment. Immediately after the shooting, the president tasked Vice President Biden with leading an investigation into all the possible measures that could be taken to avoid another gun massacre. He has held regular meetings with victims of gun violence, gun control advocates, faith leaders, video-game makers and Hollywood movie representatives, and the NRA and other gun rights groups. There are two avenues for change emerging out of the discussions held by Vice President Biden. One is a long list of potential legislative changes: laws to ban assault weapons, limit the size of high-capacity magazine clips, promote universal background checks, crack down on gun trafficking, improve mental health screening, and perhaps nudge Hollywood into tamping down some of the violence in video games and movies. That's the grinding, nose-counting process that will take place in Congress. The second, larger task, as administration officials describe it, is broader and more fuzzy. It requires changing the culture of guns in America and shifting the conversation from one of protecting gun rights enshrined in the Constitution to one of protecting children. It is this second task for which the president is qualified above all others. Every day we see examples of how difficult it is to get anything done in Washington. But when Vice President Biden talks about this kind of cultural change, he talks about seatbelts as much as the 1994 assault weapons ban he helped author. Changing public attitudes about seat belts took more than legislation to make it the norm. Listening to those involved in this effort there are echoes of the 2008 Obama campaign--they describe an energy and swell of sentiment that just needs a person to shape and guide it. Activists who have been fighting for gun control for years describe a new unexpected passion among progressive groups. After meeting with the vice president and his staffers, they express surprise (and delight) at how seriously the president and his team are pushing this effort. The reason the president is qualified for this larger task is that it doesn't require Congress. He can give speeches, use the bully pulpit, fire up his campaign organization, and generally engage all of his best tools. Of course he'll try to promote certain legislation once Congress comes up with an actual bill, but what administration officials are talking about goes beyond the immediate House and Senate wrangling of the coming months. The first real test for the president will be the State of the Union address. The State of the Union is a dreary speech but it has a useful symbolic value. The president's goal in this cause is not just to soften up the members of Congress or put them under mounting pressure to compromise. The president has a larger cultural message he can send through this year's speech. There are a few benchmarks to watch in order to gauge his seriousness. The first is how much he talks about the issue. Will he offer more than the 465 words that Bill Clinton delivered on gun violence in his final State of the Union address, given after the Columbine shootings? In 2005, George Bush devoted more than 1,000 words to Social Security reform, which he pushed in his first State of the Union address after winning re-election. Other things to look for are how many gun violence victims will Obama invite to sit in the balcony? Will he call on Congress to pass legislation by a certain date? Will he promise to embarrass those who don't step up? Once the president has kicked off his pitch in the State of the Union, the next test is whether he will travel the country speaking about gun control. White House officials say this is likely but it hasn't been decided. It's also not the only issue he's confronting. He's got confirmation battles, endless budget fights, and an immigration reform push he'd like to start. George Bush embarked on a 60-day road-show to sell his Social Security plan. How much travel will the president devote to this cause that is arguably far more serious than Social Security reform? One of the key messages, says a White House official, is to ""drain the drama and fear"" out of what the president is proposing. The message the president wants to send is that he's not trying to trample on hunters and sportsmen. That's a necessary precursor to any legislation because advocates for reform argue that the only way they will be able to build popular and political support is if they can split the NRA from its leadership. If the membership can be convinced that the president is not an ideologue trying to grab their guns, they will be less likely to believe the NRA leadership who paint him that way. Of course, the Bush tour was a failure. When Obama, or any president, embraces a piece of legislation, the battle immediately becomes partisan. That's one of the reasons the White House resisted embracing the recommendations of the Simpson-Bowles commission. Put Obama's name on it and it would sink. But the president has already wrapped himself up in several specific proposals for greater gun control and committed himself to the task. Plus, if aides are right, and this is a movement and not just about passing the lowest common denominator legislation next week, then that movement builds as the president winds his way across the country. During the campaign, when the president said that change doesn't come from Washington, he was criticized for sounding like he had given up. What he meant was that he can't change lawmakers who are stuck in their ways. The only useful change came when people were energized and mobilized. He has an organization that can do this--arguably one of the best in U.S. political history. Organizing for America, his campaign arm, will be enlisted in this new fight, but it's uncertain just how much it will be mobilized. Will a few emails go out or will volunteers walk the streets campaigning for changes in the law? If the president does make a full push to enact gun control laws or change public sentiment, it will be another test of the bully pulpit and its limitations. When President Obama pushed his health care reform it became less popular. His efforts to pressure Republicans during his first term in a variety of budget fights did not work. Neither of those causes had a galvanizing moment behind it though. The president has also shown signs that he's going to be a little more combative in his second term than he was in the first. Vice President Biden reports to the president Tuesday on the findings of his inquiries, and after that, the president will back a set of specific recommendations. He won't offer legislation. Congress will have to come up with the language themselves. Based on conversations with administration officials and gun control activists, few think that an assault weapons ban is possible, though the president will push for one.

His administration, like the movie The Hobbit, doesn't have enough women in key roles. The last three White House staff announcements have featured the following people: John Kerry, Chuck Hagel, John Brennan, and Jack Lew. All white dudes. The New York Times energized elite conversation on this topic with a photograph on the front page of Wednesday's paper. In it Obama addresses a semicircle of 10 male aides and Cabinet officials (the coalition of the besweatered). They are arrayed in precise formation, as if to block out senior adviser Valerie Jarrett who is barely visible in the picture. (She is so hard to find, CNN used a special shading to identify her leg.) The president's men are irritated by this criticism. The focus on this momentary snapshot, they argue, ignores the more complete picture. If that is so, they have only themselves to blame. During the campaign, the president and his allies took every opportunity to pander to women voters, and never let a moment pass--whatever the pretext--to draw broad conclusions about Mitt Romney's lack of concern for women. When a Romney aide didn't have an immediate answer about the candidate's position on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, it was portrayed as a dire sign. It wasn't just Romney's shortcomings that created the conditions now bruising Obama. The rapid twitch to all things related to women and the relentless courting created a supercharged political atmosphere. When Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist unrelated to the Obama campaign, made a clumsy remark about Ann Romney ""never working a day in her life,"" Obama's top strategist David Axelrod and campaign manager Jim Messina denounced her immediately so as not to offend women.* The most unintentionally hilarious moment came at a White House forum on women and the economy. The event was intended to show women voters, who are particularly sensitive to the weak economy, that the president cared about them. The forum was clearly treating women as an interest group. So, it was chuckle-worthy when the president declared, ""Women are not an interest group."" Since re-election, the Obama administration has not shrunk from playing the gender card. White House officials repeatedly asserted that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's critics were only beating up on her for the Benghazi controversy--and not the president or the CIA Director--because she was a woman. That is what the president appeared to be suggesting when he said Republicans were picking on Rice because she was an ""easy target."" If people are now drawing grand conclusions based on a few staff picks, it's because the Obama team helped train them to do so. The recent staff picks also link with a critique that has some validity. We've heard since the early days of the Obama administration that the inner circle has a male bias. Here's a picture from an earlier time in the administration where the men appear to have exchanged their sweaters for blue shirts. We know this: If Barack Obama were facing a third election at least one of his top players at State, Defense, or Treasury would be a woman. Needing suburban women voters, the president just couldn't afford to have a Cabinet where one of the faces most likely to be in the news cycle every day was not a woman. But let's not go overboard. The power of symbolism needs to be balanced against the practical effect of that symbolism. To put it into perspective, as my colleague David Weigel pointed out, let's imagine John McCain had won in 2008. We would have gotten to know Vice President Sarah Palin! And the policies she supported would have been far different for women than those supported by Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who drafted, for example, the Violence Against Women Act. President John McCain wouldn't have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act. It's a bit too neat to correlate women in power with policies good for the broad swath of women. It's also amusing that Valerie Jarrett is the one hiding in that New York Times photo because it was the New York Times Magazine that helped promote the valid notion that Jarrett--an African-American woman--is the president's most powerful adviser. Who are the two Cabinet officials you have heard the most about in the last few months? Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice. Clinton has been the biggest rock star of the Obama Cabinet. If the president were such a brute, you'd imagine there would have been lots of stories about gender bias as he tried to rein in his top diplomat. There haven't really been any. Obama elevated U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to Cabinet rank. When John Kerry recently got the nod for the State Department job, it was almost a diversity pick. He will be the first white male to hold that job in 16 years.* (Though let's not go overboard here either. The finance, national security, and defense establishment are still dominated more than other fields by white men.) When Susan Rice's name was being bandied about for State, the repeated assertion from administration sources was that the president was thinking about her because he trusted her. After all, he'd picked her to be his top foreign policy adviser in his first presidential campaign. When Rice withdrew her name, several administration aides strongly hinted that when the National Security Adviser post opens up, she'll top the list. Rice and Clinton are just a couple of the powerful women who have been in the Obama orbit. There's also Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Homeland Security Director Janet Napolitano, outgoing Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, and outgoing EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson. The president's top lawyer and top domestic policy advisers are also women. Obama named two women to the Supreme Court, one of whom was his former solicitor general in the Justice Department--a branch headed by an African-American man--and the other who was the first Hispanic woman named to the court. The Supreme Court arguably plays a more lasting role in determining gender and ethnic fairness in American society than any Cabinet post. The Obama staff directory is a binder full of women. The White House itself employs more women than men.* As the New York Times notes, about 43 percent of Obama's appointees have been women, about the same proportion as in the Clinton administration, but up from the roughly one-third appointed by George W. Bush. In the end, the only thing that has really changed so far from Obama's first term is that the president intends to replace Hillary Clinton with a man. There are more Cabinet picks to come, which conceivably could increase the percentage of women in the final tally. Then we'll see if the second Obama administration is as bad for women as Middle Earth. Corrections, Jan. 10, 2013: This article originally misspelled Hilary Rosen's first name. (Return to the corrected sentence.) This article also originally stated that John Kerry will be the first white male secretary of State in 15 years. (Return to the corrected sentence.) He'll be the first in 16 years. Lastly, this article stated that the White House employs almost even numbers of men and women. The White House employs more women than men."

The last deficit had come in at $159 billion--unimaginably low today, but a stumble from the recent era of surpluses. And the economists reached by the Times, veterans from the pre-Clinton era, applauded Bush for erasing those surpluses. ""It is wrong to allow surpluses because these surpluses invariably lead to higher spending,"" said John F. Cogan, a former OMB economist for Reagan and Bush I. ""Governments simply cannot hang onto money."" Well, we dodged that particular bullet. And this week and this weekend, spinning away the outcome of the Great Fiscal Cliff Showdown, we got the latest Republican catechism on how spending would finally be cut. The party will once again use the debt limit as leverage to demand entitlement cuts--the steepest anyone has discussed in 30 years. Republicans spent the Sunday shows describing this as reasonable, natural, the next step from the tax deal. ""We have resolved the revenue issue,"" said Sen. Mitch McConnell on Meet the Press, ""and the question is, 'what are we going to do about spending?' "" McConnell used that word, ""resolved,"" four times to describe the effects of a law that will raise maybe $620 billion while protecting loopholes for electric scooters and Puerto Rican rum. In a weekend Wall Street Journal interview so sympathetic it came with a complementary neck pillow, John Boehner called himself ""the guy who put revenues on the table the day after the election,"" ignoring how he quickly ruled out higher tax rates as part of any deal, and was only talking about a theoretical reform that nuked loopholes while lowering rates. McConnell and Boehner were packing a lot into those deep sighs. They argued that the tax deal did not, actually, represent a tax hike, because the rates were going up anyway; that the vote was nonetheless so painful that Republicans deserved points for not blocking it; and that the reward for these Republicans should be a final reckoning on spending. Their job, for now, is recasting the coming debt-limit vote as the best way to do that--not a fluke, not a ""hostage negotiation,"" but a new normal that the country needs. That sounds ridiculous, but it's not. Yes, Republicans have approached every fiscal crisis, real or imagined, as the opening act of an entitlement-cutting negotiation. That was the reason why they eventually broke on taxes. A fundamental rationale for Republicans' tax fundamentalism was the belief that higher taxes would always be applied to higher spending. ""The basic purpose of any tax cut program in today's environment,"" said future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in 1978, ""is to reduce the momentum of expenditure growth by restraining the amount of revenues available and trust that there is a political limit to deficit spending."" Lower taxes, in addition to being stimulative, might eventually ""starve the beast."" (Bruce Bartlett has thumbed through all the right history books for a definitive study of ""beast-starving"" theory.) You could look at the last 30 years of Republican tax policy as a long anticipation for the big starve. In previous crises, they simply couldn't convince voters that the possible threats were big enough to spur entitlement cuts. In 2005, the last time a Republican president and Congress campaigned for entitlement cuts, George W. Bush warned that Social Security was ""headed toward bankruptcy"" and that ""by the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt."" In a Florida speech, he'd clarify that ""all ideas are on the table except running up the payroll tax,"" which didn't make it sound like a mounting crisis. The debt limit needing to be hiked at the end of February--now, that's a crisis. Republicans believe that the public is currently on their side. On Friday, John Boehner showed House Republicans a poll from the Winston Group, testing their messaging and positioning on the debt limit. The pollster had asked voters whether ""any increase in the nation's debt limit must be accompanied by spending cuts and reforms of a greater amount,"" basically describing the ""Boehner rule"" that had governed 2011's debt talks. Seventy-two percent of voters agreed with the ""rule."" Now that it was decoupled from popular policies, like higher taxes on the rich and more funding for entitlements, it was winnable. If you dug into the poll, the results were much more ominous for Republicans. The Winston Group asked its subjects about a few programs that could theoretically be slashed. There were seven possibilities: Reducing government programs ""for people like you,"" cutting defense spending, means-testing Social Security, raising the Medicare retirement age, raising taxes, ending charitable tax deductions, and ending the mortgage deduction. Only one of these--means-testing Social Security--won more support (61 percent) than opposition (35 percent). The tax ideas were loathed by an overall 2-1 margin; the entitlement ideas were opposed by a narrower margin. When you talk to House Republicans, the people with the most leverage in the coming faux crisis, they're not sure what to do with this. They worry about the ""message."" In the ""fiscal cliff"" talks, they felt like they were made to look unreasonable. Whenever they propose a specific entitlement cut, they're pilloried. This was one reason why the Republican leaders' Dec. 3 response to ""cliff"" negotiations, a three-page open letter, suggested ""more than $900 billion in mandatory spending [cuts]"" without specifying what might be cut. On Sunday, Republicans made great strides in Operation Vagueness. They stressed that the debt limit was naturally going to be a moment to force spending cuts, but that it wasn't their fault, and that the cuts had to be suggested by the president. ""None of us like using situations like the sequester or the debt ceiling or the operation of government to try to engage the president to deal with this,"" said McConnell on Meet the Press. ""It's a shame that we have to use whatever leverage we have in Congress to get the president to deal with the biggest problem confronting our future."" On Fox News Sunday, new Sen. Ted Cruz--a champion college debater who's already being pushed to the front of press conferences--insisted that the debt limit would only turn into a crisis if Barack Obama made it so. ""I do not support default on the debt,"" he said, ""and we should never default on the debt and the only players who are threatening to default are President Obama and Harry Reid."" For 30 years, Republicans have struggled to find a crisis that could build support for real entitlement cuts. Now, the polls tell them that they've found it. That's why it took so little time to rebound from the ""cliff"" loss."	Why the GOP Thinks This May Be the Best Fiscal Crisis Yet	['Reid', 'McConnell', 'Obama']	[]

The big House Republican meet-up, the one that could end America's least favorite epic drama, would come at 1 p.m. Reporters welcomed 2013 with cheap champagne in the Capitol rotunda. Then, shortly after noon, while Vice President Joe Biden was telling House Democrats to back the bill, Republicans were telling reporters to check their optimism. This was not the come-to-Jesus meeting to whip votes. This would be a ""conversation,"" a Festivus-like airing of grievances. Some time later, the Republican conference would meet to talk about passing the bill. When would they vote on it? Ask again later. The worries were justified. Inside the conference, as Speaker of the House John Boehner stayed neutral, member after member got up to denounce the deal. Majority Leader Eric Cantor warned that he did not support the bill in its current form. ""When the leader speaks,"" said one Republican member, ""people listen more closely."" His defiance meant a lot more than some panicky Senate votes. ""We should not take a package put together by a bunch of octogenarians on New Year's Eve,"" said Ohio Rep. Steve LaTourette inside the meeting. After he left the room, Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston joked that the deal passed only because ""it was way past those senators' bedtimes and they had blurry eyes when they were reading"" it. House Republicans? Why, they were ""trying to fill in the gaps they might have missed."" Time and again, Washington is shocked by two incredibly well-known facts about House Republicans. One: They believe all of that stuff they tell their conservative audiences, from the town halls to the Sean Hannity remote feed. They ran in 2010 promising never to raise taxes and to take a samurai sword to the budget. Whatever Paul Ryan asked them to cut, they voted to cut. Two: Most of these members come from safe districts where the only threats to re-election are primary challenges or death by natural causes. And yet they're never, ever allowed to govern the way they want. Assume that they end up caving and passing a fiscal cliff compromise [Update, Jan. 2: They did!]. That compromise punts the mandatory sequestration cuts from defense and discretionary spending, and ends the payroll tax cut and restores a higher tax rate on income above $450,000. If that happens, then for the third time in two years they've punted on huge spending cuts and entitlement reform, told once again that they can get them later. [Which is what happened late last night.] Thus, the hours-long primal scream. When he left the afternoon meeting, Alabama Rep. Spencer Bachus said that the deal would have to be amended to include more spending cuts, which meant that it would go back to the Senate--he'd be ""shocked"" if it didn't--which in turn meant that it would be doomed by Democrats who refused to entertain more changes. Wouldn't that backfire on Republicans? ""Sooner or later,"" said Bachus, ""you have to think that out-of-control spending is going to doom the markets."" Bachus had to say that. In 2012, he held back a primary challenge from a Republican who'd run to his right, branding him a crooked compromiser. ""Never has the anger in this country been so great,"" said Bachus in his victory speech. ""I can certainly identify with those who voted for someone else."" You identify with it, or you lose. Consider the letdowns that conservatives had to put up with. In February 2011, they wanted to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government, with $100 billion in cuts. But the cuts, as presented to them by leadership, were based on old budget baselines. Some conservatives wanted to shut down the government. Their leaders convinced them to cave, because it would ruin their image. The savings earned after bitter negotiations were about half as big as promised. In the summer of 2011, they wanted to hike the debt limit only if it came with cuts as big as the spending hike, a Balanced Budget Amendment, and a new cap that would limit spending to 18 percent of GDP. They ended up settling for a debt limit hike tied to mandatory cuts that maybe, sort of, could be replaced by a grand bargain designed by a ""supercommittee."" If the committee failed, the mandatory cuts would arrive in January 2013. Republicans were hopeful, and occasionally confident, that a new president from their own party would take point on fixing them. But that didn't happen, and now Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham were telling their peers to ""save your powder"" by delaying those cuts until the next debt limit increase, in two months. Maybe they'd win a rematch. ""Sen. Graham was in favor of the debt deal that created the current situation,"" scoffed Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp, whose profile has risen since he was removed from the budget committee in what he considers to have been an anti-conservative coup. ""Here we are, 17 months after the debt limit, and the spending cut that's supposed to take place is the one opposed by Republicans."" ""It's a recurring poem, isn't it?"" said Arizona Rep. Trent Franks. ""In the final analysis, a true statesman will look to the next generation, not the next election."" That's a Manichean view of Congress, and it's popular, but it's done absolutely nothing for conservatives. Two weeks ago, the House tried and failed to avert the fiscal cliff by passing a big package of spending cuts and a tax increase on income above $1 million. The spending cuts barely passed; the tax increase was pulled for lack of support. Today, after the venting meeting, Republicans agreed to vote on an amendment that would add $328 billion of spending cuts to the deal, then--whether or not the amendment failed--vote on the deal itself. The Senate Republicans had already broken their pledge to never back net tax increases. Now House Republicans, by proving that they couldn't pass a deal with Republican votes, were breaking the ""Hastert Rule."" The informal dictum, named for the unmemorable four-term Speaker Denny Hastert, was that bills would be brought to the floor only if they got a ""majority of the majority."" Republicans wanted 217 votes, within their conference, but the membership kept being true to the conservative base, and denying them the numbers. Now, they'd have to settle for a bill they disliked, passing with minimal Republican support. ""If you want to have a spending fight, you don't have to wait very long,"" said Rep. Tom Cole on Tuesday. Cole, the media-friendly deputy whip, spent the entire fiscal cliff period suggesting ways for the party to save face, only to be undone by the party's stubbornness. Now, he said, Republicans were going to learn the beauty of caving. ""More members want this to pass than want to vote for it."" And the members who really opposed it would be totally marginalized. Huelskamp was shocked at the very idea that Boehner would allow a bill to pass without majority Republican support. ""I think most Republicans would be stunned if the speaker moved forward on something like that,"" he said. ""Denny Hastert wouldn't have done it. Newt Gingrich wouldn't have done it. Bob Livingston, who lasted all of 24 hours, wouldn't have done it, if he'd ever had a chance. The Hastert Rule is pretty important. If you walk into a new Congress Thursday at noon, and your speaker just did something like that, it would stun Republicans."" I reminded Huelskamp that something else was scheduled for Thursday at noon. The speaker would be officially voted in. ""Yeah, that vote would be that day!"" said Huelskamp, warily. ""Never thought of that."" Update, 11:17 p.m., Jan. 1, 2013: Eight hours after the Republicans wrapped up that first, sad conference, the House passed the compromise bill 257-167. Only 85 of 240 Republicans voted ""aye."""	Why House Republicans Threw a Tantrum Over the Fiscal-Cliff Deal	['Franks', 'Paul', 'Cole', 'Huelskamp']	[]
13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/david_weigel_looks_back_at_the_predictions_he_got_wrong_in_2012.html	"Every December, when the news cycles have spun themselves out, I actively try to humiliate myself. I page back through the articles and blog posts I wrote (196 pages of them this time) and record my worst blown predictions and lazy punditry. Never have I had to do this in a presidential election year, when the gut-checks and guesstimates grow like sweet corn in the field. The year started out harmless. On Jan. 2, I filed a story about Rick Santorum's likely win in the nonbinding precinct caucuses and wrote that he would likely win them, then lose ""New Hampshire, or Nevada, or South Carolina, [and] the nomination."" That was conventional wisdom, sure, but I stuck to it and predicted a Romney primary win even before Santorum, Newt Gingrich, and then Santorum again took turns humbling him. On Jan. 3, I noticed that turnout of Republicans in those caucuses was actually down from 2008, and argued that ""Republicans aren't so excited about 2012."" And they weren't. Not as much as the high-paid pollsters for the Romney campaign thought. (I hope they're spending those bonuses wisely.) I'm disinclined to believe whatever most people currently believe. That helps out in an election year. Every bend in this year's primary season or general election inaugurated a media panic--Gingrich can be the nominee! Romney will close the gender gap! The first presidential debate changed everything! I didn't fall for too much of this, and frequently enough I saw nontrends and nonstories through They Live glasses. Here's what I did fall for. Jan. 13: Romney can lock this up in South Carolina. Reagan. Bush. Dole. Bush. McCain. These men won the Palmetto primary then easily won the Republican Party's nomination. Before the polls captured Newt Gingrich's rise, I assumed that Mitt Romney would stagger to some kind of unimpressive Southern win, comparable to McCain's. After Gingrich bet everything on an attack against Romney's business experience, we lacked proof, I thought, that ""actual Republican voters are blanching at this more than they'd blanch at Bain Capital's investment moves."" Well, they blanched. They blanched all the way to the polls, where they gave Gingrich a landslide victory that presaged Romney's wan popularity with the GOP base. Months later, when Gingrich quit the race, he took a moment to apologize to South Carolina voters, as ""we will have broken their tradition of always picking the nominee."" Feb. 2: Maybe Ron Paul will surprise us! Much of my reporting life has been spent on the Ron Paul beat. I've seen him and his movement underrated many times--I remember how eyes rolled when Rand Paul decided to run for the Senate. This year, I slightly overrated Paul's ability to win popular votes, and refused to believe polls that had him running third in Nevada. ""Paul has an advantage that won't show up in polls."" He didn't, and never met the media's metric for popular support. But his movement managed to control the delegations of five states, and provided all manner of drama through the convention. Feb. 8: The Republican primary will drag on for months, because it's in all the fringe candidates' interest to make it drag. Not quite enough, not really. See also my optimistic take on Santorum's blather about dragging this thing out with proportional delegate selection. March 7: Gingrich can come back, again. Having underrated the loveable former speaker once before, I endeavored never to make the same mistake. I was impressed by his vote totals in counties in the Deep South, especially in his adopted home of Georgia, and surmised that ""Gingrich is in a good position to win Alabama and Mississippi next week, further muddling the 'Santorum, conservative champion!' story."" April 12: The ""war on women"" is over. If I were composing this article in the proper holiday manner, as a list or slideshow, this would be No. 1. The Obama campaign responded to the GOP's inevitable anti-abortion and anti-birth control politics by labeling it part of a ""war on women."" The Romney campaign, staffed by generally moderate-minded Republicans (Stu Stevens, Eric Fehrnstrom), did not know how to respond. Not until Hilary Rosen, who wasn't even affiliated with the Obama campaign, went on a low-rated CNN show and said Ann Romney ""hadn't worked a day in her life."" The Romney campaign blew this up into a news-cycle-chewing ""outrage,"" and I sort of fell for it. The lesson: Voters pay attention to policy, even when the pundits don't. July 19: Obama's policy giveaways weren't helping him with nonwhites. Luckily, I didn't invest too much in this storyline, but the occasional summer poll suggested that the White House was losing support to Romney despite the president's aggressive moves to satisfy Hispanic voters and gay donors. Future lesson: Pay less attention to polls! (I need the rest of the Internet to take the lead on this.) Sept. 26: Republicans will elect a black, female, Mormon congresswoman. The myth of Mia Love had always looked outsized and untested. A daughter of Haitian immigrants, with a fantastic story, Love hit that candidate sweet spot where reporters preferred to profile her potential history-making power than to investigate her actual views. I was thrown by polls that gave Love a huge lead, spotted her some points because she was running on Mitt Romney's ticket, and scoffed at the ads her Democratic incumbent opponent was running. ""In an age of stronger partisan loyalty,"" I wrote, ""it's increasingly hard for the 'I hate my party, really!' message to overcome the 'there's an R behind my name' message."" Hard, but not impossible. Love lost. Oct. 2: Todd Akin could pull this off. Before the presidential debates I flew to Missouri to find out what the state was going to do with its instantly famous gaffe-o-matic Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. ""Akin's team,"" I found, ""sees a clear separation between the national media's focus and the worries of Missouri."" They would, wouldn't they? Even the polls found the race deadlocked, with Claire McCaskill running only a few points behind Barack Obama, who was sure to lose the state. But the polls (except for Survey USA--take a bow, guys!) were wrong. Nov. 5: It'll be close, and Romney has a shot. When New York magazine asked me who would win, I chose Romney, narrowly, with 276 electoral votes--all of the Bush 2000 states minus New Hampshire and Nevada, plus one electoral vote from Maine. If we leave out Twitter, that Octopus's Garden of overconfidence and B.S., then this is really all I got wrong in 2012. A few times, I was even bailed out by reality--it seemed that the state would lose the Pennsylvania voter ID trials, and then the state won, and then a higher court reversed the decision. But I'm at peace with what I got wrong. In most cases, I could have saved myself if I'd done more reporting or gone to more hot zones. In a few cases, I fell too easily for spin and access. There is much more to this business than prediction, which is why the pundit who did it best--Nate Silver--eschewed gut feelings and Advisers Speaking on the Condition of Anonymity for data. Next year, with its promise of constant fiscal showdowns, will require a combination of hard math and careful reporting. And I've already gone on record saying that Democrats might reform the filibuster, so we'll see how I manage."	What Did David Weigel Get Wrong in 2012?

We won't be taking questions today."" That was the essential thrust of the organization's combative political response: Shoot first; ask questions later. The NRA's top lobbyist, Wayne LaPierre, who delivered the bulk of the remarks, was characteristically defiant, calling for security officers to be stationed at every school. He spoke with an edge, his voice straining as if he were being shouted down by hippies. (Presumably, that's what they expected would happen if they let the reporters in the audience ask questions; in the end, Code Pink provided the shouting.) It was the second defiant act by conservatives in 12 hours. The night before, a committed band of Republicans defeated House Speaker John Boehner. The Republican leader had offered legislation designed to give his party political cover in the fiscal cliff negotiations and increase his leverage in talks with the president. The gambit failed because enough Republicans refused to bend on their anti-tax principles. Boehner wound up looking foolish, and the House Republicans looked unable to perform the most basic functions. The Republican Party is in a rebuilding mode after its 2012 election loss. These two events--a defiant NRA and an incompetent leadership--cannot be the face of confrontation the GOP wants to show the public on high-profile issues. Tea Party activists and gun owners are a key part of the party base. But these public acts are out of sync with the moment and completely at odds with party's need to widen its membership. The NRA and Tea Party conservatives would simply say that they are sticking to their principles. That  presents two questions: whether their principles are wrong at this time in history and whether the way in which they stick to their principles damages the party. Let's focus on the second question. The message of both of these acts is more than ""we're sticking to our principles."" The message is: We don't care about the wider audience. That cannot be the message that the Republican Party wants. It particularly can't be the message after Mitt Romney's losing presidential campaign, which was defined by his secretly taped conversation with donors in which he said he didn't care about 47 percent of the population. We know it's not the message that its putative leaders want to send. Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio, and Paul Ryan are all trying to send various messages of inclusion. In the case of House Republicans, they are clearly defying broad public sentiment, which is that Congress should work out a deal with the president. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll shows the public in favor of compromise and supporting the president's view. (Seventy-six percent say the Republicans have not been willing to compromise enough.) The members who blocked Boehner have a different political calculus, however. Their voters reward them for their opposition to policies that don't cut spending enough. Plus, ideological groups like Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth, and FreedomWorks can penalize them if they vote the wrong way because their districts hold read-to-run conservatives who will stay pure--just add money. But consider how this hurts the party. Let's say you're a principled conservative who disagrees with John Boehner. You'd like more people in the country to sign on to your way of thinking. To do this, you must persuade those people. You want to persuade them so they'll vote for more Republicans who will give you a majority to enact conservative policies. But these persuadable people are sensitive. You can't persuade them when they think you're incompetent. The House Republicans' performance on Thursday night qualifies for that description. The NRA response is a different matter. The NRA has been far more successful at working the system than House Republicans. So, as Dave Weigel points out, Wayne LaPierre was backing a position on Friday that at least has the popularity of the assault weapons ban the president is pushing. This Gallup poll asked Americans how to prevent the next massacre. Sixty-four percent wanted ""at least one person"" at every school to be armed, and 87 percent were open to more ""police presence"" at schools. But the question at hand is whether the defiant tone of the NRA event will be as popular as those policies. For most people, the post-Newtown public conversation has had some element of self-reflection. The president, NRA-supporting politicians, and Hollywood have all taken a step back and examined their views. Most have recognizing that they need to at least modify their positions in some ways. Even if no one changes their tune ultimately, the participants have at least nodded to the possibility that a decent respect for the opinions of others requires sensitivity to opposing positions. The NRA did not go this route. It was calling for a conversation but it was starting an argument. LaPierre blamed culture--movies, video games, and music--for a mass shooting but wasn't willing to even brush up against considering what role guns might play. That is where the interests of the NRA and the GOP separate. A full-throated argument with President Obama helps the NRA by riling up its members who write big checks. This, in turn, provides money to keep lawmakers in line. For a national party so closely aligned with the NRA, this poses a challenge. Right now its leaders are trying to send the message of inclusiveness in all forms. The Republican Party has lost the popular vote in five of the last six elections. Something has to change. The precise road back to the majority is not clear. But as a matter of basic math, it's pretty clear that the party must show that it is open: open to ideas, new people (i.e., minorities who are growing as a larger share of the voting population), and the new challenges of our daily lives. Holding more firmly to your views despite new circumstances can offer stability, but it also opens you up to looking remote, unconcerned, and out of touch. To those who might think you hail from another planet, it helps to speak to them in their language. That language requires a conversation, not an argument. It is a virtue to stay true to your principles. But the great patron saint of conservatism, Ronald Reagan, knew that you had to do it in a way that didn't offend people. Reagan had plenty of critics, to be sure. Clark Clifford famously called him an amiable dunce, but even that cheap shot allowed for the fact that he was amiable. There is nothing amiable in these recent public stands by conservatives. It can't be true that a party returns to national greatness on an anti-amiable platform."

The reception room at the National Review Institute's post-election summit has four of 'em, loaded high with rum, whiskey, vodka, and triple sec, and O'Doul's for those who want to fake it. When there's an evening lull in the Omni Shoreham's main ballroom, there's a party waiting in the mini-ballroom across the beige hallway. Early on Friday evening hundreds of conservatives pack the room, stepping in and out of line depending on whether they're thirsty or whether they'd rather talk to one of the available icons--Mark Steyn! Jonah Goldberg! Rich Lowry! I get stuck between Steyn, a ring of his fans, and a bar, where I meet an Orlando dermatologist named Darrin. He'd volunteered for Mitt Romney's campaign, ""making calls from my office"" when he wasn't working or raising his kids, and he wasn't surprised when Romney lost, because he doesn't put any graft past Barack Obama. ""I'm worried about a dictatorship,"" he says--really, we have been talking for maybe three minutes before he lays this on me. ""I mean, it happened in history. History repeats. Why couldn't it? How about all the Muslim Brotherhood czars? He's got like eight different guys in the administration who are members of the Muslim Brotherhood."" When I start to sound skeptical, Darrin pulls out his iPhone and forwards me an infographic. It's titled ""Muslim Brotherhood Infiltrates Obama Administration,"" and it shows six Muslims who work in the administration and ""enjoy strong influence."" Another way of putting it: Six mid- and low-level staffers in the administration have, in the past, appeared on panels staged by frightening-sounding organizations. But the evidence worries Darrin. ""If I have to go to a freakin' island to save my kids,"" he says. ""I'll do it. I'll leave the country."" Any hack can roll into a political conference, find the most outre attendees, and pretend that the room was packed with nothing but. National Review is a standard target of this sort of journalism. At least three times, liberals have embedded on the magazine's biennial post-election cruises, and come out with feature-length contributions to the Those Crazy Conservatives genre. In most respects, Darrin was like the other NRI summit ticket-holders I talked to--a middle-aged guy with a successful business, worried about his lost country, worry deepened by a steady diet of conservative media. But toward the end of the conference on Sunday, I sit in on a panel titled ""What is a conservative foreign policy?"" And in it, National Review's Andrew McCarthy asks why Huma Abedin had been allowed, for so long, to work alongside Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, holding a security clearance. ""We have people throughout our government who have connections to the Muslim Brotherhood,"" says McCarthy. ""Not, like, tenuous connections. Strong connections. We have a situation where, in our intelligence community, they have made a policy of purging information in the training materials of our law enforcement agents, our intelligence agents, and our military people, if the information casts Islam in a bad light--which, back in the 1990s, when I was a prosecutor, we used to call evidence."" That gets applause, something that was scarce and hard-earned at the weekend conference. National Review has only held two other post-election summits--they save 'em for real debacles. In 1993, William F. Buckley gathered 1,000 conservatives in the nearby Mayflower Hotel, to vent and strategize about the threat of Bill Clinton. In 2007, after Democrats took back Congress, NRI met at the J.W. Marriott up the street to hear from potential 2008 saviors. ""Mark [Steyn] gave an incredible speech at that conference,"" recalls Jonah Goldberg, joining Steyn onstage Saturday night for a ""Night Owl"" banter session--cash bar this time. ""He closed his speech with one of the funniest lines that's ever been said on the public stage. Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Mitt Romney!"" Laughter and groans. Conservative donors and thinkers respect Mitt Romney more than they did the defeated George H.W. Bush or the ousted, forgotten Speaker Dennis Hastert. In 1993, then-NR editor in chief John O'Sullivan told conservatives that they were in the midpoint of the ""Bush-Clinton"" era--that Bush had betrayed the Reagan revolution, and could not be considered part of it. In 2013, Romney is seen as a fundamentally decent man who simply did not know how to ""message"" conservatives' beliefs or explain what Obama was doing wrong. ""He spoke conservatism,"" says Charles Krauthammer in a Friday night Q&A, ""as a second language."" Speak it as a first language, and you can win. Every elected Republican at the conference attempts to prove that. On Friday, NR's Jay Nordlinger asks freshman Rep. Tom Cotton to swat away some of the liberals' myths. Why did Republicans lose Hispanics? ""We're quasi-racist, or maybe racist without the quasi,"" says Nordlinger. ""It's supposed to be killing us."" Cotton doesn't know how to fix it. ""I think Romney only got 27 percent [of Hispanic votes], but John McCain four years ago got 31 percent when he'd been the sponsor of an immigration bill,"" he says. ""It's presumptuous and condescending to think that Hispanics, as a class, are only focused on immigration."" Will conservatives have to accept the ""momentum"" for gay marriage? ""It's only this last year that people in any state have decided to accept gay marriage,"" says Cotton. ""In California, four years ago, [they] voted for traditional marriage."" It's a curious answer. If people come out for something they opposed four years earlier, doesn't that something have some oomph? Cotton is a compelling politician with a Harvard/Marine Corps resume, but he won 59 percent of the vote in a district that gave Mitt Romney 62 percent. How do you win back the Obama voter? He doesn't know, and you wouldn't expect him to know. On Saturday, Rep. Paul Ryan tells conservatives that they'll have to find leverage where they can, because ""the president will bait us.  He'll portray us as cruel and unyielding."" Ryan would know--his campaign was supposed to educate voters, in real time, about what Republicans believed. ""I looked at the GOP ticket,"" says conservative columnist Amity Shlaes at a Saturday panel, ""and I asked: Why don't we flip it? Honestly?""* (Her new book is a fine biography of Calvin Coolidge, blurbed by Paul Ryan.) But Democrats demonized Ryan, and conservatives didn't allow themselves to understand it. Former congressman and current 15-hours-a-week MSNBC host Joe Scarborough admits that he thought Romney was beating Obama, because Romney was drawing massive crowds. ""Mark Halperin called me and said, 'I've never seen anything like it!'"" If you stayed in the media feedback loop, you thought the polls were skewed and that the Benghazi or Muslim Brotherhood stories were metastasizing into scandals and that middle-class voters were rallying around Ryan. You were fooled. ""We do very well with people who are steeped in the Constitution,"" says former Rep. Artur Davis, a Democrat turned Republican who has quickly started using ""we"" to describe conservatives. ""We're better at talking to each other than we are at talking to people who aren't like us."" To stop that happening again, conservatives need better messaging. Nearly everybody at the summit agrees. ""One of the best slogans that came out of this campaign was, 'You built that!' "" says Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. ""I wish we could take a different tack. That was a slogan that was aimed at the 53 percent. It was aimed at business owners. It was aimed at people who already got there. I think their message should have been: You can build that."" It wasn't that Romney's ""47 percent"" tape was even so bad, says Cruz. It was that it fit into a ""narrative"" that Republicans are cold-blooded and the poor can never achieve anything without handouts. Fixing a ""narrative"" sounds deceptively easy, and fair. Democrats didn't respond to their narrow 2004 loss by nominating an Erskine Bowles-Joe Lieberman ticket. They found a once-in-a-generation political talent, a liberal, black community organizer seen by most voters (until mid-2009) as thoughtfully moderate. No matter what he does, a preponderance of voters let him skate away. No, conservatives need to talk smarter about what they already believe. On Sunday, I listen to CNBC host Larry Kudlow politely interrogate Arthur Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute. Brooks' top contribution to the movement, so far, was his 2010 book The Battle. In it, he posits that a ""30 percent coalition"" of takers, who are essentially anti-capitalist, have snowed the rest of us. They look at the welfare state like a hungry virus looks at a healthy cell. Paul Ryan borrowed this idea, word for word, during the 2012 campaign, but Brooks sees much more sweat and toil to come on the ""narrative"" beat. He tells a joke about a priest, a psychologist, and a free market economist, whose golf game is delayed by two players up ahead, blind men who lost their sight saving children from a burning building. The first two men react like humans. ""The free market economist,"" says Brooks,"" says: 'You know, it would be more economically efficient if they played at night.' "" After the Q&A, I make a coffee run. On the way back, I see Kudlow and Brooks chatting politely with some of the conservatives who'd seen the panel, biding time as the TV host gets his shoes shined. ""I only wish that Romney had talked to you after the 47 percent comment,"" says one of the NRI summit attendees. ""You could have coached him on how to turn it around."" Brooks doesn't really disagree. ""He's of the old business school of never having to say you're sorry.""

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/filibuster_reform_senate_democrats_compromise_instead_of_forcing_the_nuclear.html	"Angus King was the reason Democrats thought they could kill the filibuster. Last year, the liberal-minded former governor of Maine ran for the U.S. Senate. He was an independent when he'd run the state, a character who requested Rolling Stones songs at his inaugurals, banging the cowbell when the band played ""Honky Tonk Women."" He'd be an independent in Washington. On the trail, though, he sounded ready to join Sen. Harry Reid's caucus. If Washington was broken, it wasn't Reid's fault. It was because Republicans were mangling legislative procedures like the filibuster. ""As I understand it,"" he told the Washington Post's Ed O'Keefe last summer, ""all you have to do is have Mitch McConnell call Harry Reid and say, 'I'll filibuster,' and there you go, it needs 60 votes. That's ridiculous. The Constitution doesn't say that ... my view of the filibuster is either you've got to lower the vote edge or make people really filibuster."" King won easily, replacing a Republican moderate and boosting the Democrats' majority to 55 seats. Filibuster reformers, led by Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall, suddenly had the numbers to outvote a shrunken group of ""old bulls"" and moderates who weren't ready to force a majority-rules reform through the Senate. Whenever reporters asked, Merkley would say he had 51 votes for reforms that would force the minority party to actually stay on the floor and filibuster bills and nominees. Until today. Democrats woke up to a deal crafted by Reid and McConnell based largely on the work of veteran senators who did not want to change the 60-vote threshold for breaking filibusters. At an early afternoon meeting, Reid sold the caucus on the deal and on the hope that a bipartisan compromise was de facto better than a more aggressive package passed with only Democratic votes. When it ended, reporters asked King if the deal was good enough. ""I think it's real progress,"" he said. ""My quote would be [from] Mick Jagger. You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find you get what you need."" Let's go with it: Did the Democrats get what they need? Ever since 2009, when the majority party started struggling to confirm judicial nominees and pass immigration or climate change bills, its newer senators have wanted to turn the filibuster into what voters probably think it is--sweaty, tired hold-outs reading from the phone book, burning with passion to stop bills. In 2011, before the start of the 112th Congress, Merkley and Udall pushed for reform and were shut down by Reid. One year later, on the floor of the Senate, the majority leader apologized to them. ""The rest of us were wrong,"" he said. ""If there were anything that ever needed changing in this body, it's the filibuster rule, because it's been abused, abused, and abused."" Liberal pressure groups banded together to help Merkley and Udall. The ""Fix the Senate Now"" coalition, composed of labor unions and groups like Common Cause, held daily 10 a.m. phone calls to strategize. As recently as this weekend, the coalition's legislative whips were pestering senators at preinaugural events and reminding them that they had 51 votes if they were willing to break the Republicans. The only reason they were even talking about this was that the Republicans knew Democrats had those votes. It was during this final push that one activist reached Chuck Schumer. The New York senator broke the news: Reid didn't actually want to ""go nuclear."" He was reluctant. He preferred to push McConnell into a smaller deal. The next few days of wrangling (with a pause for inaugural revelry) were all about the leaders reaching consensus and the membership learning to accept it. The final deal is the most sweeping reform to Senate rules in more than a decade. That isn't saying much. Instead of three votes on the motion to proceed on legislation, all of them filibusterable, there will be just one. If each party is allowed to offer amendments to the legislation--a sort of senatorial trust fall--then the legislation can proceed with no filibuster. Before, a cloture vote on a nominee set up 30 hours of debate. That shrinks to eight hours for executive branch nominees and most judges and only two hours for district judges. Democrats still turn shades of red when they think of how Obama's first appeals court nominee, endorsed by local Republicans, was held up for months because he'd struck the Indiana state legislature's daily invocation on First Amendment grounds. But it does not change the filibuster. ""We have to understand the Senate isn't and shouldn't be like the House,"" Reid told Ezra Klein before the meeting. ""The only way we'll get rid of the filibuster is if it continues to be abused."" He proceeded to describe a possible solution, in the future, that also would preserve the filibuster. The implication was that a minor unclogging of the Senate would satisfy most people. ""You can have a lot of nominees move through in succession,"" said Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the party's whip, after the caucus meeting. ""If you want to filibuster, you'd better show up and sit there, because if you don't, eventually they're going to move to a vote."" ""I think there was 51 votes to do more,"" said Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, ""but this was a good faith, negotiated change. We'll see how often the Republicans use the 60-vote threshold. We hope that they'll show some restraint. We believe that the president's nominees deserve up-or-down votes, and hopefully some Republicans will agree with us."" Hopefully. The hold-outs who warned against the ""nuclear option"" all hoped that Republicans would accept their new peace offering. ""It'll give great momentum to working on a bipartisan basis here in the Senate,"" said Michigan Sen. Carl Levin. Democrats, by caving, had prevented a ""meltdown."" To do otherwise would have been hypocritical. ""One of the major newspapers in our country, and I won't point out which one, the editorial this time was, 'Hey, go use the so-called constitutional option.' "" (Levin was referring to the New York Times.) ""Read their editorial when the Republicans threatened to use the nuclear option! Strongly in opposition to the nuclear option. We've got to be consistent."" Democrats like Levin were happy to talk to reporters after the meeting. The crushed-hopes caucus of Merkley and Udall were not. Merkley left the meeting through an exit inaccessible to reporters, with a spokesman saying he'd talk again when the vote came. The vote did not come quickly. Hours after the meeting, Sen. Tom Harkin held the Senate floor to describe what the Democrats had lost. He'd been trying to reform the filibuster for a decade and a half before Merkley and Udall, and he'd supported their campaign, because surely supermajority votes and fear of ""meltdowns"" from the opposition weren't what the founders intended. ""We know the Articles of Confederation were a miserable failure, crippled the government,"" said Harkin. ""It is the abuse of the filibuster, not the reforms being advocated, that has fundamentally changed the character of this body."" Harkin was one of only two senators in the chamber. Sitting two rows behind him, arms folded and nodding, was Angus King."	Why the Democrats Blinked on Filibuster Reform	['Merkley', 'Levin', 'McConnell', 'Reid', 'Schumer', 'Udall']	[]
17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/hillary_clinton_s_benghazi_hearings_republicans_missed_their_best_chance.html	"Republicans wanted answers about Benghazi. They wanted them yesterday. They wanted them now. ""Why was security at the consulate so inadequate?"" asked four Republican senators in an October op-ed. ""Did anyone order U.S. military and intelligence personnel in Benghazi or nearby in the region who offered help to stand down?"" One week ago, three of those senators published 14 more questions about the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed four Americans. Why was the FBI investigating an ""act of terrorism?"" Why wasn't a military response ready in a hurry, when the consulate came under attack? And ""what were the secretary of State's activities during this time?"" They were supposed to find out today. Hillary Clinton, who's leaving the State Department as soon as she can toss the baton to Sen. John Kerry, spent the morning with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the afternoon with the House. She would have come in December, but events got away from her: an unexplained illness, a pack of Republicans speculating that she had ""Benghazi flu,"" the revelation that she'd had a blood clot, followed by some furtive Republican apologies. Still, Republicans would get their hearing. It wasn't the Joint Committee on Benghazi that Sen. John McCain wanted, but it would be a chance to break into cable programming, all day, and to put the magnifying glass on Barack Obama's foreign policy until it caught fire. And they'd have an extra month to come up with questions! They blew it. All congressional hearings are invitations for preening, showboating, and not-a-question-but-a-comment speeches. The grilling of Hillary Clinton was worse: a repetitive series of losing rematches, of Republicans asking questions that had been asked and answered and asked and answered. They coaxed one new piece of information from her, but they didn't seem to notice, as their press offices once again tried to shame her for ever suggesting that the Benghazi attack grew out of protests against an anti-Islam video. What was the one good question? Rep. Tom Cotton, one of the most-hyped members of the GOP's freshman class, reminded Clinton that a Benghazi suspect had been let go by Tunisia. The United States provided intelligence that helped lead to Ali Harzi; the new regime in Tunisia let him go. Cotton asked Clinton whether that concerned her; she said it didn't. He'd touched on something primal about the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy in the post-Arab Spring Middle East. Vanishingly few Republicans decided to pick up that thread. In the Senate and the House, most Republicans asked Clinton to explain--one more time, please--why the administration didn't respond quickly to the attacks, why it hadn't fired the State officials who screwed up, and why Susan Rice had gone on five Sunday shows and ""blamed a video"" for the attacks. If you were a cynic, you wondered whether the inquisitors were basing this on the internal investigation or on the juiciest media reports from last year. Rice ""went on TV talking about a demonstration that never happened,"" according to Texas Rep. Michael McCaul. ""Susan Rice said,"" according to Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, ""and I quote, 'What happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video.' "" But that wasn't the full quote. Brooks excised Rice's caveat that this was the ""best information that we have available to us today,"" and her conclusion that ""what we think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as this was unfolding."" Every time Clinton got the question, she could repeat herself: There was an ongoing investigation, the attack occurred while protests were building outside other embassies, and she was not a fan of Sunday shows. Idaho Sen. Jim Risch complimented her, oddly, for saying that the attack was the work of ""armed militants""--hadn't Republicans been complaining that this wasn't enough and that she needed to call them terrorists? Only Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson got anywhere with the but-seriously-what-about-Susan-Rice query, and this was because Clinton found him so irritating. ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" she said. ""Was it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?"" Johnson left the hearing crowing that he'd ""got under"" Clinton's skin and that she probably hadn't ""rehearsed for that type of question."" Obviously she had--she got it dozens of times. But both she and Rice were saying that the situation outside the consulate--the State Department's report refers to ""dozens of individuals, many armed"" breaching the gates--was followed by a coordinated attack from extremists. There were many equally pointless exchanges. Rep. Adam Kinzinger asked why F-16s hadn't been scrambled to fly over Benghazi, as ""there are nonviolent things that F-16s can do to disperse crowds."" House Republicans asked Clinton, repeatedly, why three State Department officials who took the fall for Benghazi had merely been reassigned. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who'd been banging the table about this for a month, asked Clinton for an answer. ""No significant action has occurred!"" she said. ""There's just been a shuffling of the deck chairs!"" Clinton's answer: ""Under federal statute and regulations, unsatisfactory leadership is not grounds for finding breach of duty. The ARB did not find that these four individuals breached their duty."" No arguing with that. California Rep. Ed Royce, the committee chairman, grabbed his microphone and promised that ""we'll be working on legislation to fix that problem."" Why not point that out before shaming her? Democrats had an easy time of it, moaning at Republicans for cutting funding for the State Department and its embassies, offering Clinton louder and louder high-fives. Freshman Rep. Joe Kennedy looked ""forward to what the future holds for you."" Freshman Rep. Ami Bera awkwardly hoped he'd work with Clinton ""in the future"" when she was president. Nonvoting, bolo-tie-wearing American Samoa Delegate Eni Faleomavaega, who had actually tried to become the committee's ranking member, wished her ""success in 2016."" But the hearing wasn't supposed to be about her. It was the Republicans' chance to get answers. Even McCain mostly muffed the chance, using his time with Clinton to recite a litany of questions, giving her time for one evasive response. ""When were you made aware of the attack on the British ambassador?"" he asked. ""What was the president's activities during that seven-hour period?"" He repeated that ""the answers that were given to the American people on Sept. 16 by the U.N. ambassador were false""; reminded Clinton that he, too, had appeared on the Sunday shows; and reminded her how well he knew murdered Ambassador Chris Stevens. ""On July 7, he expressed to me his deep and grave concerns, especially about Benghazi. He continued to communicate with the State Department--and I don't know who was privy to those cables--his concerns."" ""Senator,"" said Clinton, ""I understand your very strong feelings."" Lucky for her, he had more feelings than questions."

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/conservatives_hate_john_dickerson_s_analysis_of_barack_obama_s_second_term.html	"When you are on the Fox News' ticker for the wrong reasons, it's time to put things into context. On the eve of the president's inauguration, I wrote a piece about what President Obama needs to do to be a transformational rather than caretaker president. I was using a very specific definition of transformational presidencies based on my reading of a theory of political science and the president's own words about transformational presidencies from the 2008 campaign. It was also based on these givens: The president is ambitious, has picked politically controversial goals, has little time to operate before he is dubbed a lame-duck president, and has written off working with Republicans. ""Bloodier-minded when it comes to beating Republicans,"" is how Jodi Kantor put it in the New York Times. Given these facts, there is only one logical conclusion for a president who wants to transform American politics: He must take on Republicans--aggressively. For me, this was a math problem with an unmistakable conclusion. Some people thought I was giving the president my personal advice. No. My goal was to make a compelling argument based on the facts. I used words like ""war"" and ""pulverize,"" and some have responded with threats to me and my family. (""Go for his throat!"" some have counseled, echoing the headline.) These words have also liberated some correspondents (USUALLY THE ONES THAT TYPE IN ALL CAPS!!!!) from reading the piece or reading it in the spirit in which it was written. But there were also almost 2,000 other words in the piece, which should put that provocative language in context. What's been lost in the news ticker and Twitter threats is the argument of the piece: This is the only plausible path for a bold, game-changing second term for a president who has positioned himself the way President Obama has. Indeed, the piece accurately anticipated the forceful line the president ultimately took in his inaugural address with his call for collective action and failure to reach out to Republicans. Brit Hume said Obama's speech confirms for all time the president's essential liberalism. The New Republic's Noam Scheiber precisely identified the speech not merely as liberal but an argument for liberalism. Some correspondents have asked why I didn't advocate that Obama embrace House GOP spending plans or some other immediate compromise, a more pleasant outcome than the prospect of even more conflict in Washington. There's no evidence, however, that the president is in a compromising mood. (Again, see second inaugural.) This piece was written from the viewpoint of the reality as it stands, not a more pleasing future we would all prefer to inhabit. That reality (and the initial piece) includes an unpleasant fact to some Republicans: The GOP is in a state of disequilibrium. For evidence of that disarray, I rely on Rep. Tom Cole, Sen. Rand Paul, participants at the House GOP retreat, and Ramesh Ponnuru at the National Review. (As I mentioned in the piece, Democrats have their own tensions, too.) People see my article as an argument for one-party power, which is impossible since I posit that Obama's second-term conflict with the GOP will be the first step leading to its rebirth as a majority party. Some assume I hate Republicans. This latter charge will confuse my close relations, who are not only proud conservatives but among Fox News' most ardent fans (the two groups not necessarily overlapping). Indeed, one of the many reactions I received on my reporting on the tensions within the Republican Party came from a family member who wrote: ""Barack Obama is the best thing ever for those who believe in conservative principles because it would show that with hard work, regardless of race, anyone can achieve, and it would give Republicans a few years in the wilderness to get back to a coherent philosophy. Now I believe that Obama will help conservatives because he will make them better. He has totally figured out how to use technology to deliver mass customized messages to individual voters and now citizens. Ultimately, this is a great boon to democracy. He is smart and articulate. He is tough and ruthless. All of this will make conservatives and Republicans raise their game. Ultimately, that is good. ... I look forward to a Republican Party that is a worthy adversary and a worthy advocate. Barack Obama should inspire us conservatives to be better, not to be whinier."" You can disagree with that analysis, but it is in keeping with the theory of political transformation that I was articulating as I considered the central question on the eve of Obama's second term: What is the pathway for transforming American politics given the president's current posture? There may be another way to solve this math problem, but I still don't see it."	Why Some Conservatives Now Hate John Dickerson	['Obama']	[]

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/house_republican_williamsburg_retreat_gop_leaders_decided_that_they_had.html	"WILLIAMSBURG, Va.--Late Friday morning, in a well-guarded room of a popular golf resort, the leadership of the Republican House of Representatives decided to delay the fiscal apocalypse. They didn't walk over to the room of reporters covering the annual retreat; an important-looking, flag-flanked podium went sadly unused. Rep. Eric Cantor, the majority leader who represents a district just up the highway, issued a statement that buried the news in the fifth of six paragraphs. ""Next week,"" said Cantor. ""We will authorize a three month temporary debt limit increase to give the Senate and House time to pass a budget."" Without action, the United States is scheduled to hit the debt limit in late February, maybe early March. Republicans were proposing something equally bland and radical. They would raise the debt limit without demanding spending cuts equal to the new borrowing authority. They would not demand a vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment, as they did in 2011, the last time we stumbled into this faux crisis. No, all they wanted was a commitment from the Democratic Senate. The upper house had to pass a budget by the end of the grace period. If it didn't, said Cantor, ""members of Congress will not be paid by the American people for failing to do their job."" The 27th Amendment doesn't let Congress cut its own pay hastily, so the money would be held in escrow, until the Senate passed something. Republicans wouldn't demand anything in particular for that ""something""--no equal cuts, no defunding of Planned Parenthood. They would just shame the Democrats, something that began quickly on Twitter with a #NoBudgetNoPay hashtag. How did Republicans end up here? According to participants in the three-day retreat, the party's first real all-hands meeting since the election had a resigned, realistic tone. Members were assigned to read articles like Ramesh Ponnuru's post-election wrap, ""The Party's Problem."" Ponnuru had debunked a warm-blanket Republican theory that Mitt Romney's cartoonish elitism had cost them the election. ""Romney was not a drag on the Republican party,"" wrote Ponnuru. ""The Republican party was a drag on him."" The message to the conference was that the debt limit wasn't actually all that great of a lever for change. Thursday, the longest day of the retreat, began with Boehner trying to sell the conference on a short-term debt limit increase. He was aided quickly by Rep. Paul Ryan, who walked members through the math of the debt limit, and talked up the short-term punt. ""They showed us a slide of five or six times in the last 30 years where we've come to some really good agreements,"" said Rep. John Fleming, a conservative from Louisiana who'd sponsored legislation that would prevent the debt limit from being abolished in a budget deal. ""Leading up to every one of those was several short-term increases. It keeps the pressure up until finally both sides decide, 'You know what? We've got to get this off the table until we get a solution everyone can live with that fixes America's problems.' "" As the discussion veered into ""messaging,"" guests and nonessential staffers were asked to leave the room. Ryan strolled over to the media room, where he said members were being educated on ""the consequences of all the deadlines that are coming."" ""We have to recognize the realities of divided government that we have,"" he said. ""We're discussing the possible virtue of a short-term debt limit extension so we have a better chance of getting the Senate and the White House involved in discussions in March."" Republicans convinced themselves that hiking the debt limit for a few months would dramatically change the narrative. In February, the president would give a State of the Union speech, where he could lambaste Republicans for causing a crisis. By April 15, the White House would have to propose a budget. But if Republicans pushed back the debt limit, they'd get to vote first on the continuing resolution, the spending package that funds the government. Next they'd vote on what might replace sequestration, the mandatory $1.2 trillion of cuts inherited from the 2011 debt limit deal. They'd have ""credibility,"" as Rep. Mick Mulvaney put it, when the next debt limit deadline came up. ""Take the small one first, take the middle one next, and take the debt ceiling last,"" said Mulvaney, a Boehner critic who'd lost a vote this week on paying for Hurricane Sandy relief with across-the-board budget cuts. ""None of us are talking about default. We understand the risk of default to the country."" On Thursday and Friday, conservative members discussed what might be added to sweeten a debt limit deal. They could change statutory language so that, in the event the debt limit was breached, the government would prioritize debt payments and Social Security checks, while stiffing everything else. ""Whether or not we keep the national parks open is not what people think of when they hear default,"" said Mulvaney. ""It's certainly not what the markets think."" But the leadership's preferred debt limit hike will be relatively clean. As the meeting ended, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel joined a couple of reporters in the parking lot and walked them through accelerating Lewis Carroll-esque questions about the meaning of reform. Hadn't the speaker ruled out any debt limit hike that didn't include spending cuts? ""The Boehner rule is cuts or reform for any increase in the debt limit,"" said Steel. Forcing the Senate to vote on a budget, with the threat of withholding pay, was reform. Several times, Republican House leaders have asked the conference to back a compromise bill, then pulled it when the votes weren't there. And Republicans haven't given more clues as to what they want from the next inevitable debt limit fight. But they've realized how bad they've been made to look. When one reporter asked Ryan if he was willing to ""shoot the hostage"" and hit the debt limit, he rolled his eyes. ""I don't want to use any metaphors such as that, at all."""

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/the_republican_party_s_tough_immigration_policies_are_encouraging_immigrants.html	"For years now, Republicans have successfully fought for legislation making life hard for immigrants. Laws on the books bar immigrants from receiving public benefits and obtaining government jobs, threaten them with deportation for minor offenses, and in some instances encourage police harassment. But the GOP should tread more carefully when it comes to immigration--and not only because some of the party's positions might offend Latinos. Ironically, the Republican push for laws designed to encourage ""self-deportation"" have accomplished something entirely different; they have created a politically significant bloc of naturalized citizens who are deeply motivated to vote out those politicians who enacted these laws in the first place. Much has been written about the record turnout of Latinos in the 2012 election, which has put immigration reform back on the political agenda. Mostly overlooked is the newfound electoral strength of naturalized citizens, who also care deeply about immigration reform, but who cannot simply be lumped together with the Latino vote. Naturalized citizens comprise more than 8 percent of eligible voters, two-thirds of whom are not Latino They constitute a discrete, and increasingly powerful, voice in favor of immigration reform. Of particular interest are the newly naturalized citizens--those who became Americans in the last decade--because surveys show that both their choice to pursue American citizenship and their subsequent voting behavior are influenced by the politically charged atmosphere surrounding immigration. Immigrants can be denied many of the public benefits available to citizens, such as access to Medicaid, food stamps, and welfare. Newly naturalized citizens report that one of the main reasons they chose to become American citizens is to acquire the civil and legal rights of citizens. Foreign-born Americans are also at special risk for harassment under the new ""show-me-your-papers"" laws in Alabama and Arizona, which allow the police to ask for proof of citizenship from anyone who they have ""reasonable suspicion"" to think is in the United States illegally. Most seriously, even legal immigrants who have lived in this country for nearly their entire lives are at risk of deportation for minor crimes. (Exhibit No. 1 is Adrian Moncrieffe, whose case is before the Supreme Court. Moncrieffe has been a legal resident of the United States since he arrived with his family at age 3 in 1984 and yet is now threatened with deportation for possessing three cigarettes' worth of marijuana.). The recent spate of state immigration laws were intended to scare immigrants into returning to their countries of origin. But they have backfired on their supporters--pushing immigrants to naturalize and then seek their revenge at the ballot box. Once they earn the benefits and protections of citizenship, these new Americans put their rights to work. A recent report from the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the University of Southern California found that voting rates among the newly naturalized increased during periods ""charged by political tensions around immigration."" Data from the 2008 presidential election show that newly naturalized immigrants are registering to vote at higher rates than in the past. The report's authors suggest that the politics of immigration reform inspire these new citizens to participate in the political process. In other words, the louder the anti-immigration rhetoric, the more likely these new citizens are to register and vote. As has been widely recognized, Latino voters strongly supported Democrats in 2012, but the naturalized vote shouldn't be confused with the Latino vote. Only a third of naturalized voters are Latino, another third is Asian, and the rest are non-Hispanic whites and blacks. This racially and ethnically diverse group of foreign-born citizens supports Democrats over Republicans. Indeed, 73 percent of Asians voted for Obama in the 2012 elections, a higher percentage than the 71 percent of Latinos who did, and in much higher numbers than Asians supported Democrats in the past. Two-thirds of Asians are naturalized citizens, and thus it appears that the GOP's hostility to immigrants alienated these voters just as it did other naturalized citizens. Of course, even in their increased numbers, naturalized citizens make up a small fraction of the current electorate. But we live in an era in which state and federal elections are decided by razor-thin margins in battleground states--states where many of these new Americans reside. In the November 2012 election, for example, newly naturalized citizens constituted 6 percent of the voting-age population in Florida--a state that Barack Obama won with just a .88 percent margin of victory. Likewise, the newly naturalized make up 5.1 percent of the eligible voters in Nevada and 3.5 percent in Virginia--both states that narrowly favored Obama over Mitt Romney. These voters may also have made the difference in the close Senate races in Virginia, in which Democrat Tim Kaine beat Republican George Allen by only 5 percent, and in Massachusetts, where Elizabeth Warren defeated Scott Brown by a similarly narrow margin in a state in which 5 percent of the voting-age population was naturalized since 2000. The trend is sure to continue with the help of immigrant rights groups seeking to harness the power of the naturalized vote. On Nov. 26, 2012, the New Americans Campaign kicked off its effort to push the nation's 8 million eligible immigrants to naturalize. Headed by Doris Meissner and James Ziglar--both former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioners who served under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively--the New Americans Campaign will donate $20 million to promote naturalization in major metropolitan areas. Existing groups, such as the Oregon Voice New American Voters Project, provide voter registration at naturalization ceremonies, and the New Americans Democracy Project promotes voter turnout among the immigrant community. As these organizations well know, naturalized citizens are a powerful voting bloc in favor of immigration reform. After the 2012 elections, Republicans appear willing to consider legislation allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States. So far, however, they have been reluctant to provide undocumented immigrants with a path to citizenship, in part because they fear that these new citizens will vote against them in upcoming elections. Left out of this calculus is the voting power of naturalized citizens, who don't have to wait for immigration reform to seek retribution at the polls."	Forget Latinos.

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/barack_obama_s_last_first_term_press_conference_the_president_spoke_of_republicans.html	"At the tail end of Monday's press conference, the last one of Barack Obama's first term, a reporter figured out how to trip up the president. Jackie Calmes of the New York Times followed up a string of questions about the debt limit by asking whether the president needed to do more socializing. This theme has weighed heavily on the minds of Washington reporters who study Robert Caro's LBJ bios and notice when back-slap-happy Joe Biden swoops in and conjures a fiscal deal. The president struggled to answer. He would pause whenever he wanted to mention, without naming, one of his enemies. ""I think there are a lot of Republicans at this point [most of the Class of 2010] that feel that given how much energy has been devoted in some of the media that's preferred by Republican constituencies to demonize me [Fox News, talk radio], that it doesn't look real good, socializing with me."" He was ready with evidence. ""Charlie Crist, down in Florida, I think, testifies to that,"" said the president. ""And a lot of folks think, 'Well, if we look like we're being too cooperative or too chummy, that might cause problems. That might be an excuse to get a challenge from someone in a primary.' "" Obama couldn't have earned less sympathy from Republicans if he'd snuffed out cigarettes in their lattes. To them, Crist is a callow greasy-pole climber who enabled Barack Obama's $873 billion stimulus spending. None of them regret giving Florida's U.S. Senate seat to Marco Rubio instead of Crist. This idea that Republicans opposed Crist because he hugged Obama was offensive, trite, and wrong. ""They were upset with him because he hugged the President's failed [stimulus],"" says Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller. He knows. Obama wrapped up his first term by portraying Republicans as unreliable and craven hostage-takers. He referred to their demands, for spending cuts in proportion to any debt limit increase, as ""ransom."" To talk in those terms, he said, would be a ""negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people."" If Congress wanted to ""give me the authority so that they don't have to take these tough votes,"" it would spare itself some war wounds. Over the weekend, the Treasury Department finally ruled out the possibility of averting the debt limit fight by minting a platinum coin and counting it as payment on the debt. Some progressives, who've been warning that the president lacked leverage, wondered why he kept giving away possible tools. (Paul Krugman said there was a choice between ""two alternatives""--the coin or default.) We have our answer. Obama doesn't think the Republicans have any leverage at all. Their base wants them to cut spending and default, but their donors will kick the bridle off once things get dicey. ""If John Boehner and Mitch McConnell think that they can come up with a plan that somehow meets [the] criteria that they've set,"" said Obama, ""they're free to go ahead and try. But the proposals that they've put forward in order to accomplish that only by cutting spending means cuts to things like Medicare and education that the American people profoundly reject."" This wasn't entirely fair. In the debt limit negotiations of 2011, and in the excruciating ""fiscal cliff"" sequel last month, the White House floated a number of entitlement cuts that would have wrought real political pain on Democrats. The sun probably hasn't set on ideas like chained CPI and adjustments to the Medicare or Social Security eligibility ages. At the time, Obama--gun at his temple--had embraced the idea that a debt limit crisis was a way to coax reform out of Washington. ""All of us agree that we should use this opportunity to do something meaningful on debt and deficits,"" he said in a July 2011 press conference. ""If not now, when?"" The new answer is sometime later, maybe. Can the president get away with more delay? That depends on whether he can separate the popularity of the GOP's debt ceiling stance from the widespread public loathing of its House majority. (Obama referred repeatedly to ""this Congress,"" lumping together Boehner's House with the minority filibuster-ers of the Senate.) After the ""cliff"" deal was reached, Boehner revealed a Republican poll on the concept of pairing the debt ceiling vote with ""spending cuts and reforms."" Seventy-two percent of respondents said that they wanted the debt vote tied to something. Obama's task: Tell the public that it's been misinformed, and that it can't trust the GOP. The repetitive press conference questions about the debt ceiling teed up Obama to explain that ""the debt ceiling is not a question of authorizing more spending,"" and ""raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending,"" and so on. House Republicans were spending money and blaming him for it. The nerve! ""Some of the same folks who say, we got to cut spending or complain that, you know, government jobs don't do anything, when it comes to that defense contractor in their district, they think, wow, this is--this is a pretty important part of the economy in my district and we shouldn't stop spending on that; let's just make sure we're not spending on those other folks."" His term began with Republicans warning that stimulus spending would never grow the economy; he was ending it by calling them hypocrites. Years ago, an Obama-watcher might have asked about the downside of this harsh tone. At an early 2009 meeting on the stimulus, Republicans complained that Obama was going to give a tax credit to people who didn't pay net taxes. ""I won,"" said the new president. The comment zipped out of the room and into Republican lore. But since then, Democrats have become increasingly convinced that nothing mollifies Republicans. A trove of political science research (highlighted by Ezra Klein last year) suggests that the party out of power is inclined to oppose anything that the president prioritizes. Democrats had no particular stance on Mars exploration funding, until George W. Bush called for it. That turned them into hard ""no"" votes. Obama has faced hotter opposition than that, and on higher-stakes issues. As he told Univision in a September 2012 interview, he learned that ""you can't change Washington from the inside,"" and that he'd start ""a much more constant conversation with the American people"" to push past congressional opposition. Republicans, who by that point were calling every Obama quote a gaffe, claimed that the president had undermined the meaning of his presidency. But they probably understand him now."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/filibuster_reform_republican_attacks_on_barack_obama_s_nominees_is_making.html	"On Wednesday morning, most business reporters confirmed Barack Obama's next choice to lead the Treasury Department: White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew. Within hours, the same reporters got a statement from Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, ranking member of the Budget Committee and a man who'll have some say over whether Lew gets the job. ""Jack Lew must never be secretary of the Treasury,"" Sessions said. During Lew's short time as White House budget director (a role he held in Bill Clinton's administration, too), he'd testified that the president's numbers would start reducing the deficit. That was a ""false assertion,"" Sessions said, and ""we need a secretary of the Treasury that the American people, the Congress, and the world will know is up to the task of getting America on the path to prosperity."" He would oppose Barack Obama's nominee because the nominee had a dangerous amount in common with Barack Obama. Sessions' outrage was manna to an unexpected group of people: Democrats. For months, a group of freshman Democratic senators have been trying to nail down 51 votes to reform the filibuster. On Jan. 22, when the Senate votes on this congressional session's rulebook, they'll need to keep that group together. Every time a Republican threatens an Obama nominee, their job gets easier. ""It really does highlight how the intentional paralysis of the Senate, through the use of a filibuster as a party tool, has gotten out of hand,"" says Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, one of the authors of the reform plan. ""Here are qualified people, the president has just won re-election, and [Republicans] are making it as difficult as possible to get them confirmed."" Behold, the New Democratic Chutzpah. It shows no signs of slowing. Reporters ask the White House about a once-crazy-sounding idea--minting a $1 trillion platinum coin to avert a debt ceiling showdown--and don't hear a ""no."" Joe Biden hints that the president might take ""executive action"" to enhance gun laws, gets accused of enabling a ""dictatorship,"" and doesn't walk it back. They wave the red cape, see how the bull reacts, and then wave the cape a little harder. Filibuster reform, that perennial Lucy-and-the-football cause, might be the best example of this new tactic. Last week, Merkley joined New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin to officially roll out the possible filibuster changes. They would, if successful, eliminate the filibuster on the motions to proceed to votes, reduce debate on nominees from 30 hours to two hours (after the filibuster was broken), make it easier to establish a conference committee, and--most importantly to them--require anyone who filibusters to actually stand up and talk for as long as he or she wants to block the vote. At the time, the senators said they had 51 votes to pass the new rules. (Only on the ""first day"" of Senate business, which will extend through Jan. 22, can the rules be reformed by a simple majority.) Three of those votes, perhaps, were dicey. And their biggest impediment was a rival plan, which included none of the filibuster-shortening reforms, from Sen. John McCain and Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin. To succeed, they needed to hold their votes and convince the wafflers to bail on McCain-Levin. The obstruction threats against Lew--and to a much greater extent, against Defense Secretary-designate Chuck Hagel--are making their lives simpler. Reformist senators like Merkley are being helped from the outside by a constellation of liberal groups. The Democracy Initiative, 30-odd organs of the left, has been lobbying Democrats for Senate reform. Fix the Senate Now, a slightly older labor-environmental posse, has spent two years lobbying on nothing but this. ""We've been saying since the beginning that that this isn't your father's Republican caucus,"" says Shane Larson, legislative director for Communication Workers of America, describing this week's Fix the Senate pitch. ""When they immediately oppose Chuck Hagel or Jack Lew, it helps cure people of the notion that maybe you could get to 67 votes for Levin-McCain. No. These guys have come in with a stated goal, and it's all about stopping the government, period."" As they make that argument, the opposition to Hagel is even more useful than the attack on Lew. Hagel might not have kept many friends in his own caucus, but he's been reintroduced to the American public as a former Republican senator. His loudest opponents in the Senate, so far, have been Texas Sen. John Cornyn (""Hagel wants us to be softer on the Iranians"") and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (""an in your face nomination of the president to all of us who are supportive of Israel""). Both of them are up for re-election in 2014. Democrats have watched other senators, like Utah's Orrin Hatch, tack right to appease the party's base. ""It's only really now dawning on folks what the strategy is,"" Merkley said. ""If we can turn back the clock to the Susan Rice nomination, a lot people said: 'Oh, that's just maneuvering by Republicans to get John Kerry instead and give Scott Brown a chance to come back here.' With Jack Lew and Chuck Hagel, it becomes so much more apparent that this wasn't a strategy aimed at one Senate seat."" The reformers want their fellow Democrats to game that out. Who replaces Hilda Solis at Labor? Do they want a fight over that? What happens if the president gets to pick a new Supreme Court justice? Do Republicans threaten to filibuster her, too? And what about the endless backlog of lower-court judges? Sure, Democrats relied on the filibuster to block plenty of George W. Bush's nominees. They'd still be able to do that to some future Republican president. They'd just need to stand around and talk, and their willingness to consider that rises every time a Jeff Sessions talks about putting another no-effort hold on a top nominee. ""If they want more debate on Chuck Hagel at Defense or Jack Lew at Treasury, then let them talk through the weekend,"" Merkley said. ""If this former, conservative colleague is so outrageous ... they can expend the energy and really filibuster him. Hopefully, then, we'd be able to at least have transparency."""

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/kristol_vs_hagel_why_the_neoconservative_campaign_against_obama_s_defense.html	"Chuck Hagel's opponents mostly agree on this: Jan. 7 was the first and only decent day in his campaign to become Secretary of Defense. For one full month, ever since the former Republican senator's name was floated for the job, the unofficial anti-Hagel movement had controlled the headlines as deftly as J. Jonah Jameson. Everyone covering Hagel, or merely Googling him, knew that he called a 1998 ambassadorial nominee ""aggressively gay"" and that he'd boasted of besting the ""Jewish lobby."" But Monday went well for Hagel. Former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, who wants to return to Congress via the Senate, reversed his noisy opposition to the nominee. Republican objections came off as little off-key, as when Sen. John Cornyn claimed Hagel had left the GOP when he ""endorsed"" Barack Obama. (Hagel never endorsed Obama, in 2008 or in 2012.) In the new nomination narrative, an aggressive White House was defending a war hero from Republicans who only opposed him out of spite. ""The official nomination was a chance for [the White House] to finally push back a little bit,"" shrugs Michael Goldfarb, chairman of the Center for American Freedom, a neoconservative think tank founded one year ago as a counterweight to the progressive Center for American Progress. The CAF ""war room"" of half a dozen twentysomethings had rolled back the administration, but only for a few weeks. ""They finally get to dominate the headlines for a day."" Despite yesterday's comeback, the campaign against Hagel is a powerful-looking thing, reducing the likes of Mark Halperin to awe for its ""appreciation for the dynamics of press, policy, votes and quotes, and vote counting."" While it's a remarkably effective machine, it's also true that closer you get, the smaller it looks. Allied against Hagel are a relatively small group of D.C. conservatives and hawks, people who've been successful in some intra-D.C. fights but got wiped out in the 2012 election. Their strongest weapons against Hagel might have already been deployed, in an effort to spike the nomination while it was still in the embryonic, cocktail-party-chatter stage. But they're in the thick of it now, framing the Hagel confirmation vote as a test of whether one is for or against Israel, open-minded or anti-Semitic, anti-Iran or genocidal. Who are we talking about? The nodes of the anti-Hagelverse are connected to Bill Kristol. He co-edits the Weekly Standard, founded in 1995, which runs three to six anti-Hagel items every day. He's on the board of the Emergency Committee for Israel, as is Goldfarb; the nonprofit was founded three years ago and immediately started hitting Democrats with TV ads about their softness on Israel. Kristol is on the board of the Center for American Freedom, which publishes the Washington Free Beacon, edited by his son-in-law, Matt Continetti. The outposts of ""Kristol world,"" as Politico calls it, have a combined budget of around $4.8 million. None of this is secretive. Quite the opposite: In December, the same night that ""Plan B"" went down in the House, the Free Beacon rented two rooms in a downtown D.C. bar for journalists to mingle with staff and get photobombed by the publication's mascot, the CAF Truth Monkey. Stories and quotes from Jewish leaders, from Abe Foxman to Alan Dershowitz to Ed Koch, percolate throughout these media, into Jennifer Rubin's Washington Post blog, into Commentary. The pace is intense. In the eight days of 2013, the Weekly Standard has published 30 articles or blog posts about Hagel. Some of them already read silly (""[Chuck] Todd: 'My Guess Is that They Yank Chuck Hagel at the End of the Day' ""), but the best of them have been immortalized and shared on the Drudge Report. Many of the hits against Hagel have been around for years, laundered from the time when it was in the Democrats' interest to portray the senator as an Israel foe. In 2007, when he was talking about a presidential bid, the National Jewish Democratic Coalition issued a seven-point denunciation of Hagel. The key points--that Hagel had waved off letters criticizing the Palestinian Authority's leaders--were recycled in a Republican memo, which was then posted in full at the Weekly Standard's website, an item passed around by Kristol's Foreign Policy Initiative. The anti-Hagel campaign will ramp up now. The Emergency Committee for Israel is looking at more TV ads buys. Ralph Reed, who now runs the Faith & Freedom Coalition, has pre-condemned Hagel; Concerned Women for America is also expected to pile on soon. Any old Hagel quotes that can be characterized as ""soft"" on Iran or murky toward Israel will be made infamous. Any Democrats who waffle on Hagel, as Maryland's Ben Cardin and New York's Chuck Schumer did yesterday, will be made famous. Still, Monday's nomination revealed the limits of the anti-Hagel campaign. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose annual budget is about 12 times as large as all the Kristol organizations combined, announced that it would stay neutral on Hagel. The Human Rights Campaign, the most politically powerful gay rights group, maintained that Hagel had settled the 1998 ""aggressively gay"" problem with an apology. The whole split-the-left strategy of focusing on that comment appears to have stalled out, with only the Log Cabin Republicans (aided by some new mystery donors) and the obscure GetEqual beating the drums. GetEqual's Heather Cronk says she'd ""love to hear Chuck Hagel say he's evolved"" in coming hearings, but the White House has already courted and won over groups with a lot more clout. Having done that, and having nominated Hagel, the White House is already working to marginalize the critics. The opposition's best shot at taking out the nominee was making him so toxic that the administration gave up on him, as it had on Van Jones and Shirley Sherrod. Peter Beinart, in a column backing the Hagel pick, wrote about sitting in a meeting of Democratic foreign policy hands and being shocked at ""the degree to which Fox News had gotten inside people's heads."" That's still true, but with the Hagel pick, the White House bet that hearings would overwhelm the ""freak show""--the attacks on Hagel for declining to sign open letters of support for Israel, or for opposing sanctions on Iran and Syria. The Democrats bet that the anti-Hagel campaign has spent its best ammo already. An anonymous Republican staffer had told the Weekly Standard that Hagel would be proven an ""anti-Semite."" Unless some Anita Hill figure emerges, someone who can challenge Hagel's character with direct quotes, Democrats think that the ""anti-Semitism"" story will look scurrilous and the hearings will center on Hagel's actual policies--that his approach to negotiations with Hamas, for example, will stop being portrayed as anti-Israel and start being recognized as a credible stance. The Kristol-led campaign has outsize influence in Congress. The best thing about Monday, to them, was the fact that no Republican senator, not even the ones who served with Hagel, immediately endorsed him. Every issue, as Mitch McConnell knows, looks ""bipartisan"" and uncontroversial as long as someone from the other side buys in. Not since 1925 has a Senate controlled by the president's party rejected the president's nominee. That means Republicans and anti-Hagelites need the nomination to stay controversial, to legitimize a possible filibuster against him. Says Goldfarb,  ""If you've got even one Republican who wants to be a hero to pro-Israel folks that day, you'd get a filibuster."""

Members of the 113th House of Representatives were supposed to gather in the chamber by noon then cast their votes for speaker of the House. Two hundred thirty-three Republicans were voting, and only 217 were needed to give John Boehner the job, so it didn't seem to matter when the chair called Bachmann's name and the Tea Party star--slightly dimmer since her botched presidential campaign--wasn't there. It didn't matter, until it did. Twelve Republicans voted for someone besides John Boehner, spreading most of the wealth between defeated Rep. Allen West and scowling Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Six other Republicans either missed the vote or sat on their hands to protest Boehner. For a minute or so, it looked like Boehner might need to win the gavel on a second ballot, which hadn't happened to any speaker in 90 years. And then Bachmann and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a fellow camera-friendly female conservative, materialized on the floor, motioning to the chair, asking to cast their votes. ""John Boehner,"" said an unsmiling Bachmann. Safe. No one could remember a sloppier election of an incumbent speaker. But there is good, nonschadenfreude-related news: This Congress is a little more mellow than the last one. Early reporting on the 113th has focused on the People Most Likely To Be Like Allen West, because they make good copy, and that's fair. The Washington Post's ""members to watch"" list includes four Republicans, two of whom opposed Boehner. But 31 of the 35 new Republicans did vote for Boehner after a slapdash ""coup"" attempt that counted lots of ""aye"" votes as resisters. This assemblage of Republicans is a little smaller, a little more experienced, and even a little more bland. They can be broken into a few distinct groups. The Tea Party slayers. Last year's primaries didn't break like 2010's. As strong and experienced as the conservative movement was, it lost a few races to more establishment-friendly candidates. Georgia's Doug Collins, a legislator who'd tried to raise taxes to fund road construction, defeated a radio host who'd been endorsed by Herman Cain and somebody named Sarah Palin. California's Paul Cook, a relatively conservative assemblyman, was challenged by a Tea Partier who refused to ever raise the debt limit. Cook won, in part, with nearly $1 million from a PAC connected to Mike Bloomberg. North Carolina's Richard Hudson, a former staffer for a posse of other congressmen, was attacked by the Club for Growth and Red State because his old bosses had, occasionally, compromised. None of these members softened their views during the primaries. They ran to the right, as one does. Their biggest re-election threats come from Republicans who can run even further, outflanking them on errant votes. But they beat these purists before. Dogma rating: Very low. The maybe-government-can-work caucus. Oklahoma Rep. Markwayne Mullin is one of very few new Republicans who took a Democratic seat that hadn't been particularly gerrymandered. (Democrat Dan Boren, probably the most conservative member of his party, had retired.) But he didn't back the original Ryan plan and preferred one that would have let people over 55 choose Medicare as-is or opt into ""premium support."" Ohio's David Joyce, a prosecutor who replaced retiring moderate Rep. Steve LaTourette, carbon-copied LaTourette's positions on tax revenue (fine) and infrastructure spending (more please). Illinois's Rodney Davis, whose last political job involved securing government grants, took over a district left by an unpredictable conservative. (That would be Tim Johnson, who tried to personally call every constituent during each term.) Dogma rating: Low. The movement lifers. Pennsylvania's Keith Rothfus went from Pat Robertson's Regent University to the Bush administration office of faith-based initiatives. North Carolina's George Holding trained under Jesse Helms, then became a U.S. attorney, then became famous for prosecuting John Edwards but quit (to run for Congress) before the case was lost. Missouri's Ann Wagner served her party faithfully and was rewarded when she became George W. Bush's ambassador to Luxembourg. Dogma rating: Average. The pundit-politicians. The most reliably bombastic member of the last Congress was Allen West, who started his political career by writing blog posts for the woman who now puts up posters in New York City subways to scare people about terrorism. Utah's Chris Stewart writes novels in which the coming of Christ is preceded by electromagnetic pulse attacks. Florida's Trey Radel built a following by hosting a conservative talk show; Ron DeSantis wrote a book of American homilies with a title that needled Barack Obama, Dreams From Our Founding Fathers. ""Obama gravitated toward radical politics more in line with his father's socialism than with the principles underlying the Constitution,"" wrote DeSantis, while wondering which religion the president had inherited: ""Muslim, or other."" (It's ""other."") Dogma rating: High, mighty. The upsetters. Three of today's anti-Boehner votes came from members who'd taken out their party's favored candidates. Sitting next to some newfound friends, fellow insurgents, was Tom Massie, who owes his seat to a wealthy young Ron Paul fan's super PAC. There was Ted Yoho, a veterinarian who tells his frequent profile-writers stuff like, ""Intimidating is going up to a growling rottweiler and having to squeeze his anal gland."" And then there was Steve Stockman, a member of the 1994 wave who was turfed out after speculating that the government's assault on the Branch Davidian compound was staged ""to prove the need for a ban on so-called assault weapons."" Republicans dreaded these guys, and they know it, and they can act accordingly. Dogma rating: Unchartable. The rest of the new class fit comfortably in the middle of this pack. They all voted for Boehner today; they have all passed the key ideological tests set up by the GOP's new gatekeepers. In eight-odd weeks, they will make the demands for President Obama to meet or ignore when he wants to pass the debt limit. They'll decide how well they can sell Paul Ryan's budgets back home. Congress's less conservative Republicans sounded optimistic on Thursday. ""We all have strongly held views,"" said Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, whose district in the Philadelphia suburbs voted for Barack Obama and John Kerry. ""We bring them here, but then we hold that voting card, and we keep in mind that we're speaking for 700,000 people."" Not far from Fitzpatrick, picking up the button that would identify her as a member of Congress, was newly elected Jackie Walorski. She was a perfect median member of the conference: a conservative legislator--ideological, but experienced--who narrowly won a seat that had been gerrymandered to go Republican. I asked her what it was like to watch the old, larger Republican majority stagger toward the ""fiscal cliff deal,"" wrapping up a crisis it had basically started in order to reduce the federal debt. ""It was frustrating to watch,"" she said, ""but we'll probably have a lot of nights like that."""	How Crazy Are the New House Republicans?

The next House of Representatives will contain 233 Republicans, 200 Democrats, and 80 freshmen. Redistricting, primaries, and retirements have culled a few centuries' worth of political experience. So in November and December, I talked to a few representative soon-to-be-former congressmen about what it's been like to serve in an institution 85 percent of Americans can't stand. Excerpts of their thoughts follow. Rep. Steven LaTourette was elected in the 1994 Republican wave, taking over a seat in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland. On paper, Democrats occasionally sketched theories of how he could be beat. But they never got close. LaTourette established himself as a pragmatic conservative and ally of John Boehner, there when the party needed him, and there to shame extremists when they blew up a compromise. Last week, after Boehner's conference refused to pass a fiscal cliff ""Plan B,"" LaTourette told reporters that the ""continued dumbing-down of the Republican Party"" had done them in. He'd decided to retire months ago."	Why the House of Representatives Is Even Worse Than You Think	[]	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/georgia_s_war_against_the_poor_the_southern_state_is_emptying_its_welfare.html	"When the economy crashed in 2008, millions of Americans lost their jobs. Applications for food stamps soared. So did attendance at emergency food providers--soup kitchens and food pantries--that help the estimated 50 million people, working and non-working, who can't afford enough groceries to get through the month. Unlike in past economic downturns, though, the welfare rolls barely budged. Where 15 years ago 68 percent of poor Americans received cash via Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (as welfare was officially renamed in 1996), today only 27 percent of Americans with incomes low enough to qualify for cash benefits receive them. As the New York Times' Jason DeParle discussed in a front-page article earlier this year, the resulting welfare gap has left at least 4 million families with neither jobs nor cash aid. The size of the welfare gap, however, varies widely from state to state. In states like California and Maine, which have focused on getting their poor citizens into jobs programs, about two-thirds of those eligible still receive welfare. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Georgia, which over the past decade has set itself up as the poster child for the ongoing war on welfare. Even as unemployment has soared to 9 percent and 300,000 Georgia families now live below the poverty line--50 percent higher than in 2000, for a poverty rate that now ranks sixth in the nation--the number receiving cash benefits has all but evaporated: Only a little over 19,000 families receiving TANF remain, all but 3,400 of which were cases involving children only. That's less than 7 percent, making Georgia one of the toughest places in the nation to get welfare assistance. What's Georgia's secret? According to government documents, interviews with poor Georgians, and those who work with them, it's a simple one: Combine an all-Republican state government out to make a name for itself as tough on freeloaders; a state welfare commissioner so zealous about slashing the rolls that workers say she handed out Zero candy bars to emphasize her goal of zero welfare; and federal rules that, regardless of who's in the White House, give states the leeway to use the 1996 law's requirement for ""work activities""--the same provision that Republicans have charged President Obama wants to unfairly water down--to slam the door in the face of the state's neediest. What this has created is a land that welfare forgot, where a collection of private charities struggle to fill the resulting holes. For the Atlanta Community Food Bank, that means sending out more than 3 million pounds of canned goods, bread, and other groceries each month to churches in and around Atlanta to help feed the state's growing number of poor and near-poor. The food bank's staff also helps arrange for free tax prep services, and helps the city's poor apply for food stamps and Medicaid. One thing they don't discuss, though, is welfare. ""We don't talk about TANF anymore,"" says food bank advocacy and education director Laura Lester. ""We don't even send anybody in to apply, because there's just no point."" It's a state of affairs that's left an increasing number of Georgians with nowhere to turn. Teresa, a single mom of a 2-year-old living in a domestic violence shelter, tells of how she broke down and applied for cash benefits after fleeing an abusive relationship--only to be chastised by state welfare officers who asked, ""Wouldn't you rather work?"" Eventually, Teresa says, ""I was sitting there crying--I just didn't know what else to do. I said, you've gone from letting people sit on their butt and collect money to the very opposite of that."" Ultimately, it didn't matter. In the end, she was rejected for failing to fill out her paperwork correctly. *    *    * One of the common misconceptions about welfare reform is that once Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton had settled their grand bargain back in 1996, a new regime was put in place: If you won't work (or at least look for work), you'll no longer get a government check. In fact, though, welfare reform is less a single law than 50 separate experiments, as Washington provided states with a broad framework under which they are free to set their own rules on time limits, grant levels, and work requirements for those seeking help. Immediately after the new law was put in place, the welfare rolls plunged by two-thirds--though no one could say for certain whether this was because people were leaving the rolls for jobs or merely sinking deeper into poverty. And though the slide eased a bit nationally after the economy cooled around 2001, the welfare gap--the number of people poor enough to receive benefits who weren't actually getting them--still amounted to nearly two-thirds of those below the poverty line. In Georgia, the number of Georgians receiving welfare had leveled off at about 54,000 families--roughly 30 percent of poor Georgians--by 2004. It was in that year that Gov. Sonny Perdue, the state's first Republican governor since Reconstruction, hired a new commissioner to head Georgia's Department of Human Services. Beverly ""B.J."" Walker, a 54-year-old black woman from Chicago, had been an obscure school curriculum consultant best known as the wife of Chicago's airport commissioner when Republicans chose her to run a pilot project in 1995 to streamline state government services. Soon she rose to run Chicago's welfare programs as well. Walker quickly gained a reputation for a get-tough attitude toward welfare recipients that rivaled other states. ""What B.J. emphasized was that everybody who can work, should work,"" says Joseph Antolin, who was an Illinois state welfare official when Walker arrived on the scene. What that meant was that those who wouldn't work--or preferred, say, to go back to school to increase their chances of landing a good job--would be quickly pushed off the rolls. One of her first steps, Antolin recalls, was to shoot down plans to expand GED classes and vocational college courses for the poor. Her philosophy, he says, was ""you essentially have to throw them in the pool and let them learn how to swim."" Thanks in part to Walker's influence, Illinois' welfare rolls plunged from more than 200,000 in 1996 to 95,000 when she departed for a similar job in Chicago city government three years later. Once Walker arrived in Georgia, poverty experts there say she set out to overhaul the state's TANF program with a single goal: not just getting people into jobs, but keeping them from getting benefits by any means necessary. New applicants soon found themselves being handed flyers emblazoned with slogans like ""TANF is not good enough for any family,"" ""TANF = work now,"" and ""We believe welfare is not the best option for your family."" ""Local offices were really taking a lot of steps to dissuade people from applying--or once they had applied, they were doing things to make the process really cumbersome and difficult,"" recalls Allison Smith of the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence, whose office began documenting troubling reports of welfare applicants being discouraged from applying for benefits by any and all means necessary: ""Making them go through 60 job searches a week, or come to 8 orientations."" One woman in her seventh month of pregnancy was ordered to take a waitressing job that would require her to be on her feet all day. Another was told that if she applied for TANF while living in a shelter her children would be taken away. Smith recalls, ""Some of the stuff that was said to individuals was pretty awful--'If you can't find a job, we'll have you shoveling shit at the dog pound.' "" ""They were trying to make me feel bad that I was trying to get money,"" says Teresa of her experience applying for benefits. ""They told me that taxpayers are paying for it--I used to pay my taxes, you know?"" Kelda O'Neal, a young grandmother currently caring for an extended family of 15 in her DeKalb County home, had a similar experience. ""They treat you like you're in a jail facility,"" she complains of her multiple trips to the DeKalb County welfare center to try to apply for benefits. ""You really, really catch it trying to get TANF. I've heard women saying they can go and finally get a job, and before they can get that first pay, they cut 'em off."" O'Neal herself previously received TANF, she says, until her husband--a former truck driver who'd suffered a mental breakdown after his father died and one of his daughters was murdered--applied for disability benefits and was told that according to Georgia state law, he'd need to attend 60 to 90 days of a state work program while waiting for those benefits to arrive. She says that when he missed one of his appointments--among his many mental health issues, he suffers from agoraphobia--the state ended her $133 in monthly benefits. Missed appointments are one common reason for rejected TANF applications in Georgia. Failure to meet state job search rules--which require 30 days of job search before a first check will be cut--is another. Teresa says she was told she'd have to file a record of 24 job applications a week in order to have her welfare application processed. ""That was really hard, because I couldn't find any places that were hiring,"" she says. She was approved for benefits, but only so long as she performed 24 hours a week of community service, plus 12 hours of job search, which she struggled to do during the limited computer time available at the domestic violence shelter. Eventually, she had her benefits cut off for failing to properly record the phone numbers of her job contacts. Teresa later landed a job at a Bi-Lo grocery store, and gave up on applying for government aid altogether. But many domestic violence survivors aren't so lucky, says Smith: ""A lot of folks we know are staying in their abusive relationships longer, or returning. We know from research that financial concerns are probably the No. 1 reason why victims don't leave, or go back. Usually TANF will be a stepping stone, and now that it's going, people are having to make hard choices."" *    *    * The Georgia Department of Human Services has long insisted that it's not making a concerted effort to deny benefits. (Walker departed in 2011, but the policies she instituted still largely remain in place.) Indeed, there's nothing in written state guidelines telling workers to turn applicants away. But many local and national welfare experts say that's not unexpected. ""I could never find anything from the state office--and you won't,"" says Liz Schott, a senior fellow with the D.C.-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who has investigated welfare policies in several states. ""I think they got the message, and they did anything, whatever they needed to do to make sure nobody got on."" One of these unwritten measures, says Smith, involved Zero candy bars. Senior state DHS officials handed out the candy bars to staff as a not-so-subtle reminder that the goal was to have no one receiving welfare. ""That was the goal, workers were telling us. The message was 'zero TANF.' "" (A DHS spokesperson says the state ""has no information"" on the distribution of candy bars by the department.) Georgia's welfare rolls plunged again after Walker's arrival, with more than 60 percent of those remaining dropping off welfare. Much of the drop was the result of people not being able to get through the front door: A study by Schott found that the share of welfare applications that were approved fell from 40 to 20 percent under Walker's tenure, and two-thirds of all denials were due to either withdrawal of applications or failure to complete application procedures. As for getting Georgia's poor back to work--the ostensible goal of welfare reform--the numbers are similarly unpromising. Georgia has bragged about its rising ""work participation"" rate--a key metric set down by Congress to ensure that states followed federal work rules by insisting that at least half of welfare recipients were engaged in ""work activities,"" which can include anything from actual employment to an active search for a job. Yet the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that far fewer Georgians living in poverty were engaged in ""work activities"" under Walker; rather, the percentage was only up because the denominator--the number of people getting cash aid--had plummeted. Asked if having barely one in 100 of the state's poor receiving cash is an acceptable result, state TANF policy director Anne Carter replies, ""I don't know that that's a yes-or-no question."" The state always evaluates whether applicants are eligible under federal guidelines, she says, and ""our withdrawal rate dictates whether they want to comply with the program, or they don't."" She adds that the state offers job seekers help getting to job interviews, such as a new car battery or transit passes, and now lets them conduct job searches at home--provided, of course, that they have a computer with Internet access. As for what's happened to the hundreds of thousands who've left welfare or never made it on, no one is quite sure: The state conducted its last ""leaver study"" of those departing the rolls in 2006--after that, explains Carter, the contractor retired and was never replaced. DHS figures indicate that 17.5 percent of applicants withdraw after a case is opened, but the agency doesn't compile statewide reports on how many find jobs--or on how many give up during the one-month waiting period before a case is opened. And even then, the findings were decidedly mixed: While about 70 percent of those who left welfare were employed during their first year after leaving TANF, more than 80 percent remained below the federal poverty level. The one thing that was helping Georgia's poor, noted the study, was increased child care assistance that was approved by the state in 2005 to encourage people to leave TANF for employment--a program now imperiled by a lack of state funds. Cassie, a single mom in the western Atlanta suburb of Austell, is one of those who have been turned away for child care assistance because the state ran out of money. After her partner skipped town when he learned their son had a chronic blood disorder--""He said, 'You're going to have to eventually send me to child support court, and when you do that I never want to see y'all again' ""--Cassie found herself juggling shifts as a nursing aide while managing her son's frequent hospital visits. She applied for TANF, only to be forced to drop out of school for her degree as an ultrasound sonographer, she says, in order to have time for the grueling job search process.* As her 2-year-old son scampers about a vacant office at the Sweetwater Valley Community Action Mission Program where she's come to seek some help, Cassie explains that--like nearly 2 million other Georgians, almost 20 percent of the state--she receives federal food stamp benefits, which help put groceries on the table. But they won't pay for non-food items, which is why she's turned up at this private charity in suburban Cobb County in search of diapers. Household supplies are a constant struggle for the poor in the absence of cash benefits, notes the charity's program director Carla Pierce, pointing to the stockpiles of detergent and other items lining the mission's storeroom shelves. (No diapers today, though; Cassie and her son go home empty-handed.) ""Formula and diapers change a family budget in a second."" Even for those lucky few who do manage to receive TANF, the increasingly meager grant levels--which haven't been raised in Georgia since 1996, leading to a 30 percent drop in spending power relative to inflation--are hardly meeting people's most basic needs.""Two hundred and thirty-five dollars, what the hell is that supposed to pay?"" wonders Renea Buck, a Savannah grandmother caring for her daughter's two children. Buck recently fought her way onto TANF with the help of a local antipoverty group, Step Up Savannah. ""I see these people on TV, and they say people are just living off the welfare system. There might be a lot of people on food stamps because they need help. And they might have Medicaid so their kids can have medical. But they're crazy if anybody's milking the damn system for that $235 a month."" Private aid groups like the Community Action Mission Program have tried to fill the gap with ""emergency aid""--basically a private welfare grant for those below 125 percent of the poverty line--but in a county that features 16 percent unemployment and where 1,600 schoolkids are homeless, they now turn away half of all applicants, says Pierce. The number of people coming to her organization for help has tripled in the last five years, she notes. ""These days, it seems like almost everyone needs financial aid for either rent or other expenses,"" Pierce sighs. ""Everyone who walks through that door has a legitimate emergency."" *    *    * Despite its dwindling welfare rolls, the state of Georgia is still allotted $330 million a year in federal money via the TANF block grant program. But there are signs that less and less of it actually makes it to the state's poor. Instead, according to a September 2012 study by the nonprofit Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, the state has found ways to use TANF money to paper over other program budgets, with more than half of Georgia's welfare funds being siphoned off to pay for the state's unrelated child welfare program. This maneuver, which is allowed under federal law, has effectively saved the state hundreds of millions of dollars that it would otherwise have to cover with tax revenues. ""There was all this extra federal money sitting around,"" explains Clare Richie, a policy analyst at the institute, ""so it was easy to use that to fill other holes."" (A state DHS spokesperson responded that because TANF is a federal block grant, ""this allows state policymakers to use TANF funds in ways that fit both Georgia's program needs and the different needs of other states."") To ensure that states didn't just cash their federal TANF checks without spending anything on the poor, Congress added another requirement, the so-called ""maintenance of effort"" requirements that would cut funds to states that didn't devote enough money to anti-poverty programs. Earlier this year, a study by the federal General Accountability Office revealed that Georgia was counting private spending by nonprofit food banks and similar private charities to account for nearly half of the state's own required welfare spending targets--more than double the percentage of almost any other state. According to poverty experts, the way that the 1996 law changed the mechanics of federal welfare spending is a big reason why many states have been generous with food stamps--Georgia recently began allowing residents to apply for food aid online, with only a telephone verification interview--while cracking down on cash assistance. Food stamps remain a federal entitlement, meaning if more people in your state get food stamps, Washington foots the bill. But if more people get TANF, that comes out of a flat amount of federal cash that your state gets to help those in need--creating a huge incentive to slash the rolls and siphon off the money for other uses. It's a form of creative bookkeeping, says Democratic state representative and minority leader Stacey Abrams, that's especially alluring to a state like Georgia, which features not just a Republican-controlled state house and governor's office but an exceptionally high number of state leaders who belong to the American Legislative Exchange Council, the conservative policy group that has recently attracted attention for drafting hundreds of bills on behalf of corporate lobbyists. Georgia, she says, was a perfect match for those looking to eliminate the welfare rolls, along with a Republican-controlled legislature that takes its cues from an interest group like ALEC--""We have become a laboratory for their policies."" More than that, though, she says that conservatives in Georgia have ""a genuine mistrust of the social welfare system, and a misunderstanding of how it operates,"" where it's assumed that anyone requesting government aid must be a drug user or otherwise shiftless. This allows state ideologues, she says, to pit the needy against one another in what she calls a ""sort of Hunger Games of the poor,"" where the working poor are encouraged to look upon welfare spending as a drain on their own finances. "" 'I'm poor because you took my money'--that's the dynamic that they set up."" Georgia is hardly alone in its attempts to slash the already meager welfare rolls: Wyoming, Texas, and Idaho all boast welfare-to-poverty ratios below Georgia's 7 percent. And the two states that exceed Georgia's 19 percent poverty rate, Louisiana and Mississippi, are barely ahead of it in welfare rates, at 9 and 10 percent of families below the poverty line, respectively. Meanwhile, notes Schott, the national welfare expert, the past year has seen Ohio push people off welfare by imposing strict sanctions for violating any rules, while Washington booted off 6,000 people in one month by removing a time-limits exemption for those in good standing. There are a handful of states that have bucked the trend. California and Maine both provide welfare benefits to more than 65 percent of their poor residents. Illinois, which saw a similar drop in welfare caseloads to Georgia's during Walker's tenure, recently eased waiting limits and other rules, seeing welfare applications climb as a result. And other states may apply for the Obama administration's offer of waivers to get out of strict work rules. Yet there's little hope of any of these measures taking root in states like Georgia. In fact, the state recently added a new hurdle: Pending a court challenge, welfare applicants will soon be forced to take a drug test within 48 hours of applying--for a $17, non-refundable fee. It shouldn't be this way, says O'Neal, the young grandmother, as she prepares to file TANF paperwork yet again for her daughter, hopefully this time with a better result. ""All of these people coming down here are not people just looking for handouts,"" she says. ""You got a lot of people who have worked hard pretty much all their lives and have paid taxes. And now they're in need, and they can't get what they need. And it's so sad.""

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/barack_obama_s_eulogy_to_daniel_inouye_told_us_more_about_the_president.html	"Someone needs to tell Barack Obama--it must get particularly confusing this time of year--that his own birth is not Year One, the date around which all other events are understood. His much-noted, self-referential tic was on cringe-worthy display Friday when the president gave his eulogy for the late Sen. Daniel Inouye, who served in Congress for half a century representing Obama's birth state of Hawaii. Inouye was a Japanese-American war hero (he lost an arm in World War II, destroying his dream of becoming a surgeon), and as a senator he served on the Watergate committee, helped rewrite our intelligence charter after scandals, and was chairman of the Senate committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. It's the kind of material any eulogist could use to give a moving sense of the man and his accomplishment. But President Barack Obama's remarks at Inouye's funeral service were a bizarre twirl around his own personal Kodak carousel. Obama likes to see events through the lens of his own life's chronology. Thus we learn that Inouye was elected to the Senate when Obama was 2 years old. Now you could make this relevant by describing how Inouye worked to send federal dollars (you don't have to call it ""pork"" at a funeral) to transform Hawaii's roads and schools, for example, so that the Hawaii Obama grew up in had the kind of facilities people on the mainland had long taken for granted. But no, we simply learn that Inouye was Obama's senator until he left the state to go to college--something apparently more momentous than anything Inouye did during his decades in office. Obama acknowledges that as a young person he was unaware of politics, and thus Inouye. But then something important happened that made young Obama pay attention to the first man to be elected to Congress from Hawaii after it joined the union. When Obama was 11 years old he went on vacation with his family, and those paying their respects to Inouye got to hear a long description of this amazing trip, from Seattle to Kansas, from Disneyland to Yellowstone. They heard of the young Obama's happiness whenever the motel had a pool or an ice machine. And finally, as the people must have been twitching in the pews wondering where this was all going, we get back to the late senator. It turns out the Watergate hearings were taking place at that time, too, and Obama's mother watched them in their various hotel rooms. It surprised young Obama to see that a man of Japanese descent was a senator. Little did most people know that the most important thing to come out of the Watergate hearings was that Obama, with his mixed-race background, saw in Inouye a hint of ""what might be possible in my own life."" That Obama in some way may have been inspired to a political career by a man who overcame prejudice and later became Obama's colleague is a fine point to make. But it is an incidental one to the life being celebrated. Obama never really gives us a sense of the life being celebrated. (He keeps referring to Inouye as ""Danny,"" which somehow seems inappropriate given the occasion and their great difference in age.) From Obama's telling, the next significant event in Inouye's life was greeting his new Senate colleague, Barack Obama. The president says that he got good advice from Inouye on the workings of the Senate. But these insights must not have been too memorable, because Obama doesn't cite any. He then wraps up with some generic praise, none of which has the specificity, the detail, the sense of life lived as his description of that summer trip that was so meaningful to the man standing before us."
