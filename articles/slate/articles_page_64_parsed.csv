The press conference where this same group will voice unanimous support for a continuing resolution to fund government is scheduled for the same time. Also the gang of Republicans willing to vote for these measures has mailed House Speaker John Boehner a letter expressing its support--if he would just schedule a vote!--that he will never receive. There are many ways for lawmakers planning to act in concert to demonstrate their desire to do something. So far, the group of GOP lawmakers willing to band together to save the country from the shutdown and budget crisis in the fastest way possible hasn't materialized. That's not to say that such a group couldn't exist. There are some potential members. CNN, ABC, and CBS have been trailing lawmakers who at one time or another have expressed a desire to see a ""clean"" continuing resolution or other mechanism designed to keep the money flowing without asking for anything in return. The fact that news organizations must hunt these lawmakers down is the first sign that this is not a brave breed. Whatever people may say about the ""Hell No"" caucus that has forced Republican leaders to scramble, at least everyone is clear on who they are.
The members of the Clean Caucus are not so bold. Some, such as Rep. Peter King, have been consistent and vocal. Others, such as Rep. Mike Coffman, have written op-eds calling for a clean short-term CR. So has a group of seven other representatives. But several members--such as Reps. Devin Nunes, Mike Simpson, and Leonard Lance--have already revised and extended their previous positions, which had seemed to support a clean approach. But these positions were so weak in their initial coinage that it was obvious the members would head for the cupboard if really pressed. There's a big difference between telling a reporter in your home district that you would vote for these measures and actually voting for them. To cast such a vote would expose these House Republicans to withering heat from their colleagues, the grass roots, conservative bloggers, and high-net-worth individuals willing to fund primary opponents. They would be responsible for a stunning defeat for Boehner and a victory for the president their constituents dislike. Right now, these members of the Clean Caucus have the best of all worlds. They can proclaim that they want to do the reasonable thing--which pleases their moderate voters--but never cast the vote that provokes the wrath of the party's most active and punitive wing. This is how Boehner reads their maneuvers, and they can thank him for allowing them to have it both ways."	Are Moderate Republicans the Shutdown's Biggest Hypocrites?	[]	[]

Have we reached peak bleak in Washington? It feels like it when just about the only thing you hear is Republicans and Democrats making bigger claims about how they won't blink. But let's engage for a moment in some tiny bit of optimism. What if we close our eyes and listen to that thin slice of the reporting that points a way out of this mess? We know what a bad debt limit negotiation looks like between these two sides--that was the 2011 mess. But there's actually a closer example of what a more pleasant debt limit negotiation looks like--that's the debt limit increase that passed in January 2013. In that deal, House Republicans voted to increase the debt limit with a side agreement that bound the Senate to passing a budget or lose their paychecks. Because everything these days must have a hashtag, GOP leaders appeared before a large sign reading #nobudgetnopay. The deal met the president's requirement that the debt limit be increased without conditions. It also allowed House Republicans to get what they wanted--something they could point to that showed their constituents that they had held the line and made the Senate get tough on government spending. House Speaker John Boehner only lost 33 of his House Republicans in that debt limit vote. It passed with the help of Democrats but also a majority of the Republican conference. In retrospect, this deal shows a quaint faith in the budget process that has since gone kaput and landed us in this current fix. The Senate came up with a budget, but Republicans did not want to name conferees to hash out the differences. (They said doing so would be pointless because both sides were too far apart.)The Senate did not consider any appropriations bills on the floor and the House only some of them. The failure of #nobudgetnopay to do much of anything to improve the underlying budget process is just one of the hurdles to duplicating that deal now. But we're trying to be optimistic, so keep your eyes closed and let's continue our story. Building on the January 2013 deal, the solution to the current impasse would be a supercharged #nobudgetnopay. The House would pass a ""clean"" debt limit increase and clean continuing resolution to keep government funded, which is what the president wants. Then there would be a side agreement cooked up by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Boehner that would include something that Republicans want. That agreement would name budget conferees to debate the big issues of spending, taxes, entitlements, and economic growth, and it would include some guarantee--probably in the form of a stick--to make sure the conferees did their work. Update, Oct. 8, 2013 5:15 p.m.: The president in his Tuesday afternoon press conference said he would support such a two-part agreement to ""reopen the government [and] extend the debt ceiling. If they can't do it for a long time, do it for the period of time in which these negotiations are taking place ...They can attach some process to that that gives them some certainty that in fact the things they're concerned about will be topics of negotiation, if my word's not good enough... If they want to specify all the items that they think need to be a topic of conversation, happy to do it. If they want to say, 'You know, part of that process is we're going to go through line by line all the aspects of the president's healthcare plan that we don't like, and we want the president to answer for those things,' I'm happy to sit down with them for as many hours as they want. I won't let them gut a law that is going to make sure tens of millions of people actually get health care, but I'm happy to talk about it."" The stick would have to be more than just holding members' paychecks because the stakes are higher now. Such pain mechanisms used to be considered a joke, but the no budget/no pay gimmick worked--the Senate did pass a budget after all. Sen. Rob Portman has a bill intended to end dysfunction in the budget process by steadily decreasing funding if there is no budget--a version of that scheme might be adapted to help members focus or face cuts to popular programs. Perhaps a version of that could be bolted on to this side agreement. Or, the debt limit increase could be of short duration to help focus the discussions. This may sound familiar. It sounds like a supercommittee. That's right. There are only so many ways to construct these can-kicking, exit-ramp exercises. Perhaps the group named to follow up on this side agreement could be called the This-Time-We-Mean-it Committee. Both sides need an escape hatch. When Boehner has told members he won't allow a breach of the debt limit, this is the kind of jerry-rigged deal he's envisioning. Such an agreement would also allow President Obama to stand firm on his position that he won't negotiate, but it also rescues him from the potential downside of looking like he's refusing to act during a crisis that could cripple the economy. In return, House Republicans could tell their supporters that they earned a real chance at future reductions in government spending. Would this work for Boehner? There would be a revolt from his ""Hell No"" caucus. But they get that name because we can anticipate their defiance to any possible deal the president would actually sign. Boehner lost 33 of these Republicans in January after the last deal. He'll probably lose well more than that with this gambit. He just doesn't want to lose the majority of his conference. To lose that many more would mean chaos and that he'd given away too much to Democrats. To keep Republican defections in the House in check, Boehner will remind them what they have already won. Topping the list is the fact that lower spending levels--the cuts mandated by sequestration--are already guaranteed. These cuts are far below what Democrats have requested in the past. The newly fashioned side agreement will also have to include something Boehner can sell as an inroad against the growth of entitlement spending. The House Republicans will suggest something that's already in the president's budget: Medicare-means testing and changing the inflation formula for cost of living adjustments in Medicare, often referred to as chained CPI. Democrats won't like this, and there will be a big dustup. The White House has said repeatedly that those offers in the president's budget were contingent on Republicans agreeing to higher taxes. But if this fantasy ever gets this far, it might take on a certain kind of weight of progress. It'll be hard to imagine defaulting on the debt over the details of an agreement about whether to discuss entitlement reforms. (If this fantasy gets this far, you're also going to be buying your son that unicorn.) The fight over a side agreement will look a lot like negotiating, so every once and a while the White House and Democrats will have to remind everyone that they're not negotiating over the debt limit. (That's important because the president has drawn his line in the sand so far as to even bar syllables about the debt ceiling.) Talking about a side agreement to a bigger deal should not be mistaken for a solution to any fundamental problems, but rather a de-escalation of the mutually assured destruction that comes with a debt limit breach. With some remedies, it's possible to say that the pain was bad but at least the disease was eradicated. Not so in this case. The underlying condition will still persist, which means if there is an agreement, it will contain the seeds of grievance for the next showdown. Will this happen? Sen. Reid has said that he would name budget conferees once the debt limit issue is solved. That's a tiny start, but there are lots of reasons this could fail, including that agreeing to sit down at a table is probably all Reid is likely to accept. And the politics of the shutdown so far offer no reason for Democrats to deal. In a recent Washington Post poll, 70 percent disapprove of the way Republicans are handling the budget impasse. But absent anything more, Boehner may be helpless to move his members toward a deal. Another problem with this scenario is that both sides will have to let the other side have its fiction. Each side must be able to pretend they got a win, and let the other side do the same. That may be asking too much in Washington these days. There was a time when you could assume that it was always darkest before dawn. But now Sen. John McCain's joke seems more apt: Sometimes it's darkest before it's totally black."

He would do a barrel role on the White House lawn, pull his gun from his holster, and shoot it right between the eyes. That would be only slightly less dramatic than New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's solution: ""My approach would be, as the executive, is to call in the leaders of the Congress, the legislature, whatever you're dealing with and say that we're not leaving this room until we fix this problem. Because I'm the boss, I'm in charge."" The action-hero image of the presidency is alive and well. That may cause President Obama a headache as voters look to him for bold leadership to avoid the economic collapse created by the debt ceiling crisis, even if they hold him blameless for causing the problem in the first place. If Congress doesn't get its act together in time, several presidential action-hero moves have been suggested to avoid the economic calamity. ""The president has inherent emergency powers,"" University Chicago law professor and Slate contributor Eric Posner told the New York Times on Friday. ""It has long been understood that the president should act to protect the country."" Posner has made this argument several times. Garrett Epps has been arguing since the near default in 2011 that the president has authority under Section 4 of the 14th Amendment, which says, ""The validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned."" Asks Epps: ""Wouldn't it be better to save the nation from default by invoking the Fourteenth Amendment, than to stand by and do nothing?"" Those promoting this theory have gotten very specific about how the president will pull this off. (Epps has even taken the time to prewrite the speech Obama could give.) The president would just direct the Treasury Department to keep selling bonds. Obama would explain that the Republicans have left him no choice. The Constitution requires him to see that the laws are faithfully executed, but if he executes the debt ceiling law, he will be failing to execute the scores of laws that Congress has passed and that create the need for new borrowing. Put in this position, Henry Aaron argued this week, the president should follow the least bad option and break the ceiling. One possible impediment to this plan would be that the White House legal counsel has said the president doesn't have this authority under the Constitution. Sure, but the president can just get another opinion or claim the situation demanded it. He's done that kind of back bend on matters of national security. He granted a waiver to businesses for the Affordable Care Act. A president can always find a workaround. But the White House says finding a narrow legal rationale for this break-glass emergency measure would do no good because it would offer no certainty to financial markets--and staving off global economic chaos is what this whole exercise is about. ""We'd break the glass, but it would only keep the house on fire,"" says a senior White House aide. The gambit would be up for dispute in the courts and invite chaos in Congress. While the president may be willing to take a political hit for doing something edgy to save the economy, his treasury secretary and economic advisers worry most about the disruption the ensuing legal fights would cause. At the very least people buying U.S. treasuries would want a serious risk premium for buying securities whose value was being debated in court. As a White House official put it, ""We're talking about full faith and credit of the United States, and that faith is undermined if there is a dispute."" Maybe, but wouldn't they do this in the end if chaos were near? ""No, because it wouldn't avoid the chaos."" Let's assume for a moment that this whole theory about the market is a bluff. As a negotiating matter, the president and his aides don't want to admit there's anything the president can do because they're framing this political deadlock as a congressional problem. To even entertain the idea that he could perform some 11th-hour heroics would let Congress off the hook. So the president would be crazy to ever look like he is embracing the idea in the slightest. But given the way the discussion over the debt limit is going, the president should still probably have the speech ready in his back pocket. Read more of Slate's coverage on the debt ceiling."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/bobby_jindal_and_gop_governors_in_washington_pragmatic_state_leaders_are.html	"Right now, roughly 30 House Republicans are driving the bus in Washington. Along with Sen. Ted Cruz, they have been the ""titanium backbone,"" as Rep. Marsha Blackburn likes to call it, in the effort to defund Obamacare. They have stood their ground and helped bring the government to a halt. This is either an act of lunacy or a shining example of standing for conservative principle. As it happens, there are just about the same number of Republican governors across the United States, and their representative was in Washington on the third day of the government shutdown with a very different conservative message: We get things done. ""Thirty Republican governors are applying conservative principles,"" says Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association. ""Here in D.C. they talk about it, but outside the nation's capital we're actually doing it. For too long for the Republican governors, we feel like we've outsourced our brand management to the Republicans in D.C. It's time for us to stop doing that. It's time for us to take control of our own destiny. We want folks to know that when we're talking about Republicans, it's not just the dysfunction that's happening in Washington, D.C., it's the results that are happening in our state capitals."" In the roiling debate among Republicans between principle and pragmatism, the governors are weighing in. Jindal was in town to start the launch of a new ad campaign touting the success of the GOP brand in the states. ""Republican governors are driving America's comeback"" is the tagline. Their intent is to highlight their solutions-oriented records and get themselves re-elected. In this cause, they are clearly using Sen. Cruz and House Republicans as a foil. When Jindal says, ""We are not the party of no,"" the first thing that comes to mind is the group that has become associated with that phrase: Republicans in Congress. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie was selling the same message. After leaving a meeting with Jindal, I received a press release from Christie's office touting his cooperation with the Democratic Senate leader Steve Sweeney. ""A tale of two cities,"" it read. ""On day three of the government shutdown, folks in Washington are reading headlines like 'W.H. Meeting With Lawmakers Goes Nowhere.' ... Meanwhile here in New Jersey, it's a much different story."" Jindal and the Republican governors are not alone in bashing Washington Republicans. That's what Sen. Cruz is doing, too. But the GOP governors are making a different case. Their argument is based on results, conservative policies that are sometimes the result of hard-won compromise. Or, in some cases, they are boasting about lawmakers who have pushed for conservative legislation dealing with unions or removing regulatory barriers, but who have also decided to accept federal Medicaid money as a part of Obamacare. That kind of apostasy would not be tolerated by conservative purists in Washington, but it's also the kind of purity that governors don't have the luxury for. In 2014 the four biggest governor's races for Republicans will take place in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan. Those Republican governors all sought federal Medicaid funds.* Jindal isn't the only one selling the governors. When the Republican Party commissioned its famous autopsy shortly after the 2012 presidential election loss, the bias toward the governors was clear. ""At the federal level, much of what Republicans are doing is not working beyond the core constituencies that make up the Party. On the state level, however, it is a different story. ... Republican governors are America's reformers in chief. ... It is time for Republicans on the federal level to learn from successful Republicans on the state level. It is time to smartly change course, modernize the Party, and learn once again how to appeal to more people, including those who share some but not all of our conservative principles."" That was Jindal's explicit message on Thursday. Though he had plenty of criticism for the president--who he said liked to play the ""victim in chief""--his message for his own party was not about the incumbent he disapproves of. In the states, he said, ""You see a party that is fighting for every single vote, that is fighting to help the American people join and thrive in the middle class ... a party that is not just the party of no, and those are the things that we need to do as a party if we want to earn the right to govern and we want to be a majority party. It's not happening in D.C. right now, but it is happening in our state capitals."" There are several ways for the Republican Party to evolve. The new firebrands who have captured the attention of the nation may be at the start of a conservative constitutional revolution in the party. Or they may be taking a party that is shrinking and driving it to an ever-narrower base of Tea Party loyalists that represent about a fifth of the country. Or, Washington is a sideshow and the Republicans in the states who actually have to accomplish something are where the real long-term energy in the party is. That was the message Jindal came to town to sell. It remains to be seen whether he or another pragmatic Republican governor can get back behind the steering wheel. *Correction, Oct. 4, 2013: This article originally stated that these gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan were scheduled for 2016; they will take place in 2014. Also, Florida Gov. Rick Scott sought federal Medicaid funding, but the state legislature blocked him. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

When we get in one of these budget fixes, Washington veterans, community fathers, Boy Scout troop leaders, and sensible people across the land wonder why a few adults can't just get into a room and hash out their differences. Everyone knows what the solutions are. There are a series of hotels in Washington that stay in business by hosting think-tank events where the same set of solutions are traded year after year. If only the politicians could get out of the daily political grinder, both sides could hammer out an agreement. That is a comforting thought. It holds out the hope that good will, logic, and the national interest can still flower in the right circumstances. No matter how bleak things look, if conditions in the room are right, sweet reason will flow so that some progress might be made. To give up on this dream is to succumb to despair. There is no sign that the conditions for this kind of meeting are going to appear anytime soon. On Wednesday, President Obama called congressional leaders to the Oval Office for a meeting on the government shutdown and the looming breach of the debt ceiling.* Nothing was accomplished but a shortening of the physical distance from which each side reiterated their immovable positions. Perhaps it's hard to work anything out in a crisis atmosphere, but an experiment from this summer proves that the vision of an adults-only bipartisan meeting is no solution either. It can fail, too--and for all the same reasons previous budget negotiations have failed. The myth of the wise men in a room is grounded in history. In 1990, Bush administration officials and congressional leaders traveled to Andrews Air Force Base, sat at a table, and worked out a budget agreement. Later, at a White House ceremony, President George H.W. Bush, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, and House Speaker Tom Foley stood together and announced the deal. To watch the C-SPAN footage of the event, where members of the two parties praise one another, feels so distant from today's politics they might as well be wearing buckles on their shoes. Part of today's impasse results from that meeting. Among conservatives, it was seen as a great moment of apostasy, the moment President Bush gave up on his ""no new taxes"" pledge. House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich refused to go along with the deal, and generations of Tea Party conservatives have used this as a teaching moment. Sacrificing your principles to get a deal in divided government is a sin. When they come to Washington, they intone, they will not make the same mistake. That viewpoint is the dominant one controlling the Republican Party at the moment. But it was not the viewpoint of those Republicans who made up the Diners Club, which met at the White House this summer. The group was a whittling down of the two dozen Republicans President Obama had met with in two dinners after his re-election. He was back on the schmooze, reaching out to members of Congress in the hopes that a few hours spent shuffling the fork around perfectly prepared baby carrots might form the basis of a new set of budget negotiations. The White House wasn't just banking on the power of food. In March, Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein had written about a Republican lawmaker who seemed completely unaware of what the White House had been offering as changes to entitlements as a part of their budget negotiations with GOP leaders. Several White House officials reacted in wonder at the revelation in the article. How could any Republican be so misinformed about what the president was offering? If the White House had better relations with Congress, maybe the lines of communication would be better. So the president decided to reach out. But this wasn't just to schmooze. By having the dinners and participating in outreach, Obama hoped to create direct inroads to these Republicans to make his policy case. In the Klein article, the GOP senator seemed to be open to a budget deal based on the idea that the president would agree to entitlement changes in exchange for Republican agreement on revenue generated by tax increases. It was in this spirit that the Diners Club was formed. Republican Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Kelly Ayotte, Bob Corker, Johnny Isakson, Dan Coats, Ron Johnson, and John Hoeven participated. All had either publicly or privately said they were open to raising revenue if the president would back entitlement reforms. Over the summer, and intensifying in August, the group of eight met several times at the White House with the president's chief of staff Denis McDonough, the director of the Office of Management and Budget Sylvia Mathews Burwell, and presidential congressional liaison Rob Nabors. Their goal was to revive the hunt for a grand bargain--Washington's Bigfoot--where significant deficit reduction is reached through a combination of restructuring of entitlements and revenue through increased taxes. It did represent a new era in Obama's outreach to Congress. The man who gets most of the credit is McDonough. ""He is the best chief of staff the president has had,"" says Isakson, a 13-year veteran of Congress. ""I've had more interaction with Denis McDonough than any other in my years in Congress."" He's not the only one. Many Republican senators say the same thing. But despite the goodwill, the summer conversations broke down over thoroughly predictable differences. Though the president had offered some entitlement changes in his budget, they weren't enough to win serious concessions on revenue from GOP senators. The party had just agreed to a tax increase as a part of the fiscal cliff negotiations at the beginning of the new year. If they were going to cave again on taxes--even one where the concession was hidden in the guise of fundamental tax reform--the president would have to agree to more changes to entitlements. He would have to go big; Republican senators suggested he should embrace Medicare changes of the kind offered in the old bipartisan Domenici-Rivlin plan, which sought to drive down costs by creating greater competition. The president joined one of the meetings, and one senator in attendance said he seemed genuinely open to finding a way to offer more on entitlements, though he talked about how hard that would be for his Democratic base. He also mused about ways in which they could find enough revenue that it would justify doing something big on entitlements. He was essentially colluding with Republicans on how their party could say yes to revenue in ways that would make it an easier sell to the GOP base. But then the script becomes familiar again. Republican senators say the president's aides got stingy in talks. There was no more room on entitlements other than what the president had offered in his budget. They wouldn't entertain the broader Medicare cuts based on the Domenici-Rivlin compromise. They also demanded that all revenues come from tax increases. For their part, White House aides say Republicans wouldn't offer any specific proposals on tax revenue that represented a true offering from their side. Nonsense, say Republicans--openness to revenues through tax increases is what defined membership in the Diners Club in the first place. Plus, they had discussed specific kinds of revenue ideas with the president when he visited. For a time the group tried to shrink the deal into something more manageable. If the president agreed to the entitlement cuts he'd already outlined in his budget, they could wipe out about $500 billion of the cuts in discretionary spending scheduled to take place in the next several years as a part of sequestration. White House aides said that wasn't a real offer because Republicans weren't really giving anything. Their side wanted to do away with sequestration, too. The president could only drive his party toward those entitlement cuts if he had something to show for it from Republicans on raising revenue. The members of the Diners Club had carefully avoided being called a ""gang,"" because they didn't want the headaches that would come if they were seen as negotiating for the party. They certainly weren't a ""supercommittee,"" and they didn't have the star power of the Simpson-Bowles commission. But the quiet summer effort failed for essentially the same reasons that those budget agreements failed: a dispute over whether one side had gone far enough to justify the concessions by the other. The problem with deals worked out in closed-door rooms is that they have to live outside the room when participants try to sell them to their parties. At the end of August, the Diners Club disbanded. The final meeting included talk about the coming crisis in Syria. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin offered one final deal to McDonough. He'd agree to an increase in the debt limit and a continuing budget resolution if the president would delay implementation of Obamacare for a year. The meetings that had once started out on a grand scale and which had for a time discussed 30-year budget projections wound up where things have stalled today. Correction, Oct. 7, 2013: This article originally misstated that the meeting President Obama called for congressional leaders on Wednesday was in the Roosevelt Room. It was in the Oval Office.

Why Even a Bipartisan Group of Reasonable Adults Couldn't Solve Our Political Deadlock	['Hoeven', 'Obama']	[]
5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/obamacare_if_only_the_affordable_care_act_had_been_around_when_a_cyst_ruptured.html	Two jobs ago, I had the best health insurance I've ever had, or probably ever will have. It helped that I worked at UAB, which meant there was a world-class academic health center literally right down the street from my office, but regardless, I could walk into UAB Hospital and have just about any procedure performed for next to nothing. And this came in handy a lot more than I would've liked. Around 2007, I started growing cysts on the CD instrumentation that had been installed to treat my moderate-to-severe scoliosis when I was 16; as doctors discovered years later, the cysts would begin growing on the surface of the apparatus itself, then gradually make their way to the surface until they ruptured, at which point I'd have a nice little open wound over my spine. Five times from 2007 to 2009, I went in for surgery and one of the plastic surgeons cut out the cyst material, cleaned up the wound and sewed it up, but the cysts kept coming back. It wasn't until the sixth surgery that the doctors were able to deduce it was probably the CD instrumentation itself that was providing the cysts a place to start growing. Unfortunately, by then I'd been laid off as a result of Great Recession-induced budget cuts, and there went that wonderful health insurance. I did manage to sneak in one last surgery under the wire, though, literally days before my insurance was due to officially run out. An orthopedic surgeon went in and removed a piece of the CD instrumentation that looked like it might be loose and carving out a little spot in my back for the cysts to grow; thinking I'd finally put this behind me once and for all, I moved back in with my parents and started looking for work. In the interim, of course, my wonderful health insurance expired and I was left completely uncovered. COBRA was available, but too expensive for someone who was surviving on unemployment checks and effectively zero savings. Stupidly, I let my pride prevent me from going to my parents for help, thinking they were already doing more than enough by letting their 31-year-old son move back in rent-free. The following spring, I still had no job and no health insurance--and I felt a lump growing on my back. The cyst had indeed grown back. The doctors in Columbus, Ga., later determined that the proper course of action was to just remove the CD apparatus entirely, since my bones had grown as much as they were going to and I didn't need it anymore. Unfortunately, I had no major-medical coverage with which to make this happen. And even when I did finally get a job at Aflac in June 2010 with pretty good benefits, my 10-month lapse in coverage meant my back cysts were a pre-existing condition and I'd have to wait another 12 months to actually get treated. All told, I'd say I spent about a year and a half walking around with an open wound directly over my spine. My fiancee Holly, God bless her, had the privilege of placing literally hundreds of Band-Aid Large Adhesive Pads over said wound, though--particularly for someone who's never been particularly flexible--I got pretty good at reaching around and putting them on there myself when I needed to. I didn't just need the Band-Aids to keep the pink goo in my wound from seeping out and staining my clothes; there was a small, though very real, chance that if the wound got infected it could work its way down to my spinal cord and do some truly catastrophic damage. Had Obamacare been in effect during all this time, almost all of these worries would've been taken care of. Thanks to the provision preventing insurance companies from disallowing or instituting waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, I could've walked into a hospital and had that surgery within weeks of starting my job at Aflac; instead of having that open wound over my spine for 18 months, I probably would've only had it for three, tops. And if I'd been 26 or younger, my medical coverage never would've lapsed to begin with because I could've just had it all taken care of on my parents' insurance. This is what the Republicans in Washington are fighting against. This is what they're calling a threat to the future of our republic. They're willing to bring the legislative process to a grinding halt and shut down the federal government entirely just to make it known that they don't want the poor, the unemployed, the just plain down-on-their-luck to have health care. Obamacare didn't arrive soon enough to keep me from walking around for a year and a half with a hole in my back. But maybe it's arrived in time to keep someone else from having to go through that. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let that poor person get knocked back to where I was in the spring of 2010 just so Ted Cruz can score brownie points with the Tea Party. Go ahead and shut the government down, Ted--that sure worked like gangbusters for y'all the first time. But we are not going back. A version of this piece originally ran on Doug Gillett's blog.

Luckily for us, though, while government leaders have been mired in calamitous gridlock and hostage-taking, a parallel army of the brave and selfless has been at work--patriots who look adversity in the face and say ""Bring it on."" On Tuesday, millions of these intrepid Americans volunteered to be first unto the breach when the Affordable Care Act's online insurance marketplaces opened for business--despite the near-certainty of bugs and crashes, and despite having until Dec. 15 to sign on and shop for coverage at healthcare.gov and state-run exchanges. Slate asked these online pioneers to tell us about the user experience on Day 1 of Obamacare via email, Facebook, and Twitter. These are their stories. They saw past mechanics for aesthetics. Olivia Mungal: ""While the design is clean and easy to use, it took me 4 hours to create an account."" They acknowledged beauty and wonder when they saw it, and put that beauty and wonder into historical context. Ricky Tenderkiss: ""Very pretty to look at, but like trying to download iOS 7 on release day, today is likely to be hit by server overloads."" They pondered the ontological essence of the System. Daniel Stoddart: ""Your account could not be created at this time. The system is unavailable."" They pondered the semantics of the word important. Len Testa: ""Tried registering starting at 6 a.m. EST. It hasn't worked yet. The first time, the screen was filled with programming gibberish. The second time, none of the mandatory security questions loaded. Now every time I get through the process, I get an error saying 'Important: Your account couldn't be created at this time.'"" They suffered flashbacks to Comic-Con. Sarah Swartz: ""I probably should be irritated because getting Comic-Con badges was easier than this. Alas, I'm happy to wait. [The site overloading] simply means the program is popular."" They did math. Painful math. Randal Ford: ""The cheapest plan they offer is $80 MORE per month than what I am paying now for a similar high deductible plan. The same plan I have now is around $200 more if purchased through the exchange."" They struggled with a Zen conundrum of providing answers to nonexistent questions. Moira Bohannon: ""I'm supposed to select 3 security questions to answer in case I lose my password, but there are no questions to choose from."" Shannon Kennedy: ""Keeps asking for security answers but doesn't give any options for questions. When I try to just put words in for the answers, it says it wasn't able to create the account and starts over."" Amber Karnes: ""Got to step 3 and the security-question dropdowns are blank."" They made reasonable but incorrect inferences about the availability of Live Chat. Carol Haydens: ""Would love to sign up but the site is not working correctly. The Federal shutdown means that Live Chat is unavailable for help."" (Not true, Carol! The workers assigned to the program are deemed ""essential."") They gave of themselves, not for themselves but for others--and for Slate. Amber Karnes: ""I wasn't even going to try to do it today because I knew things would be kinda crazy, but when I saw your tweet asking for input, I figured I'd try!"" They made bold declarations, even at the risk of enraging their peers. Melissa Byrne: ""It was up at 8 a.m.! And it worked perfectly."""	Slate Readers Talk About Day 1 of Obamacare	[]	['healthcare']

""We've had this planned for a long time, almost a year,"" explained John Howerton, who served with the 3rd Marine Division in Okinawa, Japan. But when his group arrived on the National Mall, they were met by ""black barricades and police tape."" Howerton, brought to Washington as part of an Honor Flight program, has traveled across the country to visit the capital and pay his respects. Before long, the vets--from Korea and Vietnam in addition to World War II--moved the barricades aside and streamed down to the monument below. ""They weren't going to keep the veterans out of here,"" said Jamie Miller, part of the planning committee for the trip. Tourists and onlookers followed, and, apart from the fountains being turned off, it looked like a normal day at the monument. Well, except for Rep. Michele Bachmann, on hand to show support, tweet, and lend her opinions on the matter. ""They had smiles from ear to ear, they were so happy,"" she said of the veterans. ""President Obama and Harry Reid wanted the government to shut down, so they could say 'Look at those evil Republicans, they want this to happen.' "" But don't worry, assured Bachmann: ""We aren't going to let these World War II veterans be used as political pawns."" Similar visits are scheduled every day this week, according to Carol Johnson, a spokesperson for the National Mall and Memorial Parks, who herself was ""excepted"" from furlough just to deal with the situation at the monument. (She was supposed to go home at noon.) It remained unclear if future visiting veterans will be allowed in. ""It's just really unfortunate that it comes to this,"" said Miller.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/slate_labs/2013/10/federal_government_shutdown_agencies_with_the_most_furloughs.html	Congress' failure to pass a budget has led to a federal government shutdown, but some offices are emptier than others on Tuesday because some federal workers are deemed too essential to stop working and certain agencies have independent sources of funding. Hardest hit by the shutdown are NASA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Education, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These agencies and others have basically gone on life support, with nine out of 10 employees furloughed, according to the Washington Post. The effect of the shutdown on the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Defense is comparatively slight, with less than 20 percent of employees furloughed in each. The Federal Reserve and the Postal Service will continue operating because they are self-funded agencies, and the State Department has the funding to operate normally and issue passports for a limited time. For a full rundown of how the shutdown is impacting the services of each of these agencies, head to the Washington Post. Correction, Oct. 1, 2013: This article originally understated the proportion of employees of the Department of Defense who have been furloughed. About 18 percent of the department's total employees have been furloughed, not 5 percent. This article also originally misstated that 91 percent of SEC employees have been furloughed. The SEC has the funds to continue running normally for a few more weeks. Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the government shutdown.	Which Agency Is Hardest Hit by the Government Shutdown?	[]	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/republicans_government_shutdown_and_debt_limit_which_fight_does_the_gop.html	"If the government shuts down, it may be because House Republicans were contemplating the next fight over the debt limit more than the current one over keeping the government running. (Update, Oct. 1: The government has shut down.) Though closing the federal government will affect the economy, a breach of the debt limit could cause economic collapse. Within the GOP, there are two major strains of thought: those who would like to fight now over funding the government and those who would like to fight later over a debt limit increase when the Treasury Department hits its borrowing limit Oct. 17. Each camp's view is shaped by how seriously its individual members take the warnings of debt limit cataclysm, and how he or she interprets the president's declaration that he will not negotiate on any matters tied to increasing the debt limit. The ""fight later"" group argues for settling the question of funding the government in order to close ranks and focus the public on the bigger fight over the debt limit. Effectively that means voting for the so-called ""clean"" continuing resolution--the measure passed by Senate Democrats on Friday. Their thinking is based on the idea that Republicans will have more leverage on the debt limit--and the president will have less. In the current fight, Republicans, who have tried to use the government funding crisis to kill or delay Obamacare, have been bucking public opinion. Though people may not like the law, polls have shown that they don't think it is worth risking a government shutdown to attack it. In a recent CBS poll, for example, 56 percent said they wanted Congress to make the health care law work and only 38 percent said the law should be stopped by defunding it. When it comes to the debt ceiling, however, the country supports the Republican position. Fifty-five percent in the CBS/New York Times poll said the debt ceiling should only be raised if spending cuts are also enacted. Another 24 percent didn't want it raised at all. That means 79 percent of Americans disagree with the president who wants the debt ceiling raised without conditions. Here the president's interests and the interests of Senate Democrats could split in a way that might offer an opening to Republicans. The president is not up for re-election. It doesn't matter to him that only about 20 percent of the country thinks it's a good idea to lift the debt limit without cutting spending, but to some senators up for re-election it matters quite a lot. Could Majority Leader Harry Reid get a ""clean"" debt limit bill through the Senate? Red state Democratic senators up for re-election in 2014 have already had to reaffirm their support for the unpopular Obamacare. They might not want to take another unpopular vote. The president has said he won't negotiate on the debt limit. In this game of chicken, he says he has thrown the steering wheel out of the window. But can he do that? One senator pointed me to a passage from Bob Woodward's The Price of Politics in which Obama's former Treasury secretary explains the catastrophe that would ensue if the president didn't sign a debt limit bill--even one he didn't like. ""It would have massive effects,"" Geithner said. ""Every financial asset in the United States, every financial asset in the world, rests on that basic foundation [of a stable U.S. Treasury securities] ... you put that in question, everything comes crashing down and you cannot rebuild it. It's something that will be lasting for generations."" If part of this high-stakes gamble is interpreting the mindset of your opponent, House Republicans imagine that President Obama is driving a bus full of children. No matter how much he talks tough, he'll swerve at the last minute because too much is at stake. The other GOP group, known as the ""fight now"" camp, buys into the overwhelming economic consensus that breaching the debt limit is insane. Even walking up to it is dangerous. The General Accounting Office found that in 2011 simply approaching the deadline cost $1.4 billion in extra borrowing costs. These Republicans think that in a showdown over the debt limit they will have to buckle, which would be their second capitulation in less than a month if they cave now on the government shutdown. Their supporters would riot. So, given the cave that they see coming on the debt ceiling, they must hold firm on not funding the government and endure a limited shutdown, which their constituents will only praise them for. On Monday afternoon, it appeared as if House Speaker John Boehner was going with option two--a fight now rather than a certain buckle over the debt limit later. The House sent a funding bill back to the Senate with yet another round of amendments. This time they were asking to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate and asked for an amendment to remove the congressional subsidy for insurance coverage, known as the Vitter amendment. Boehner said there would be no vote on a clean continuing resolution, which suggested we were headed to Shutdownsville. But a careful reading of what Boehner actually said suggests he was talking just about that moment in time. When the Senate rejects the latest House GOP effort Monday night, Boehner could still bring up the clean Senate funding bill and pass it with Democratic votes before midnight or after only a brief shutdown. That would cause him heartburn in his conference, but it might tell us that he has decided to make peace now so that he can fight later."	The GOP Is Itching for a Fight: Will It Be Now or Later?

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/john_boehner_and_a_government_shutdown_what_will_the_house_speaker_do_by.html	"With less than two days until the government runs out of money, the clock is ticking and no one is negotiating. House Republicans voted Saturday on a new set of amendments it would like to tie to continued funding of the government, and Senate Democrats promptly said, ""Nuts to you!"" They're going to vote to table the amendments on Monday, which will kick the issue back to the House. Depending on when the bill returns, Republicans may try one more gambit to chip away at Obamacare, but time is growing short--the deadline is Monday at midnight. (Update, Sept. 30: There was talk among some in the House about attaching the so-called ""Vitter amendment"" to another funding bill and sending it back to the Senate. That measure, named after the Louisiana senator who sponsored it, would eliminate government subsidies for health care of members of Congress and their staff. According to one GOP aide the measure is losing some support because members have staffers and family who have pre-existing conditions and special needs and would benefit from keeping the subsidy which was an attempt by the Office of Personnel Management to fix the negative treatment of congressional employees under the ACA.) After the House Monday gambit fails to win Democratic support, the decision whether to keep the government open will fall squarely on Speaker John Boehner. He has two options: He can allow a vote on the Senate bill that passed (with Democratic votes) on Friday to fund the government until Nov. 15 or permit the shutdown to go forward, as a way to pressure the White House and satisfy his most conservative members. All reporting indicates that Boehner does not want a shutdown. The Chamber of Commerce, business leaders, and Republicans worried about the party's national reputation are putting pressure on him not to allow it. But if he permits the Senate funding measure to make it to the floor, he would need Democratic votes to pass it. That would lead to a sharp reaction from those conservatives who have been making his life so exciting lately. Some Republican aides, White House officials, and even a couple of Senate Republicans I've talked to recently have floated the idea that Boehner might pursue a ""hot-stove"" gambit: He would allow the shutdown to take place to teach conservatives a lesson. They'd see how unpopular it was and they'd come back in line, allowing Republicans to close ranks in advance of the debt limit debate, where some Republicans think they'll have more leverage over the president. (They'd have more leverage, they think, because the president in the end couldn't possibly allow the economic calamity that would follow from a default.) There are other versions of this theory, too: That Boehner has to allow a shutdown because as much as he doesn't want one, he really doesn't want to risk not raising the debt limit. A shutdown would allow conservatives to stick to their guns now--showing their constituents that they were capable of it--because they won't want to engage in such brinksmanship on the debt ceiling. If Boehner didn't already enjoy a good cigarette, this is the kind of on-the-job tension that could lead a man to start a nasty habit."	Will House Speaker John Boehner Shut Down the Government?

The Republican effort to block funds for the Affordable Care Act died, as expected, with only 18 members of Sen. Ted Cruz's party willing to join him on a filibuster. The Democrats' effort to fund Obamacare united every member of their party in the Senate, even those up for re-election in red states next year. Cruz's failure had been preordained; not even a pack of House Republicans who watched the vote from the sidelines were shocked. After his victory, President Obama walked in front of TV cameras to shame the defeated GOP. ""The House Republicans are so concerned with appeasing the Tea Party that they've threatened a government shutdown or worse unless I gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act,"" he said. ""That's not going to happen."" He went on a roll, decrying Republicans who wanted to raise the debt limit only if Obama agreed, basically, to Mitt Romney's economic plan. ""Imagine if you had a Republican president and a Democratic speaker,"" said the president, ""and the Democratic speaker said, well, we're not going to pass the debt ceiling unless we raise corporate taxes by 40 percent or unless we pass background checks on guns or whatever other list of agenda items Democrats were interested in!"" This was Obama at his punchiest, and if you didn't listen closely, you didn't notice a missing word. Sequestration. The president called on Congress to fund the government and move on to raising the debt limit, but he didn't mention that the now Obamacare-approved continuing resolution only funded the government for two months at a $986 billion spending level. That's less than House Democrats were comfortable with, as they saw a chance to replace sequestration's mandatory, random cuts. Republicans were able to add $19 billion in defense funds; Democrats got nothing. The story of sequestration gives a couple of hints about the ways the GOP might still hack away at Obamacare. House Republicans, most of whom now hail from safe districts, have road-tested a number of Obamacare cuts or tweaks that Democrats once mocked then forgot about. Start with the ""41 votes to repeal Obamacare."" It's a Democratic laugh line that lumps together every vote, procedural, unsuccessful, or successful, to change or kill the 2010 law. But it's a bit too pat. Some of those votes, to end the late-life care CLASS Act, have made it through the Senate and into law. Some, like the repeal of Obamacare's tax on medical devices, have been popular with Democrats. A nonbinding vote to kill that tax got 34 Democratic votes during the budget debate. ""That's something the Senate should obviously do,"" said Sen. John McCain before he voted on cloture for the continuing resolution. ""I don't know what Harry Reid will accept ... but we've seen this movie before. In a shutdown, after a few days, people will be looking for the exit sign."" What else could Republicans demand that Democrats might have trouble opposing? Some of them point to Louisiana Sen. David Vitter's amendment to block health care subsidies for congressional staffers in the health care exchanges. The fact that those subsidies exist is an accident of the 2009-2010 legislative process, and of Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley introducing an amendment that would look bad for Democrats politically. Also a fact: The administration has tried to work around the subsidies by making up the difference in cost between the old staffers' care and the new exchanges rubric. That's led to a widespread theory that ""Hill staffers are being exempted from Obamacare,"" something Republicans want to hang on the Democrats. ""It's hard not to accept the Vitter Amendment. The American people don't think Congress and their staff should have different treatment than they have."" Reid's already shot down this proposal, and he's called the return of the medical-device tax cut a ""stupid"" idea. That's sort of the problem of making your schemes known to the other side before you get leverage. But Republicans keep trying. Last week, as they approved the ""defund"" continuing resolution, Republicans openly admitted that their Plan B was a one-year delay of Obamacare implementation, yoked to the debt limit. This week, as ""defund"" collapsed, Cruz talked to House Republicans who hoped that some one-year delay might be part of the post-""defund"" continuing resolution negotiation. By Friday, Georgia Rep. Tom Graves--who had written the ""defund"" legislation that the House GOP adopted--was circulating a one-year delay plan. ""A one-year delay is a pretty reasonable position,"" said Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a reliable ""no"" vote on nearly everything who'd watched the ""defund"" vote go down in the Senate. ""I'd consider it a victory, even though it's a setback from what I'd like to see."" But how can they sneak this in, and make it the new negotiating position? Democrats are too well aware that delaying any part of Obamacare will delay the benefits they've been promising to voters since 2010. They know that kicking away the individual mandate would collapse the law. Republicans put their faith in Sen. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who has said since 2011 that he wants to delay the mandate. ""When Joe Manchin talks about an individual mandate, that's a crack in the wall,"" said Rep. Huelskamp. ""Apparently Chuck Schumer fixed up the wall as quick as he could."" It's not that simple. Other Democrats see no advantage in delaying the mandate; Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, one of the GOP's top 2014 targets, voted to restore Obamacare funds to the continuing resolution then talked to reporters about how Republicans needed to move on. They won't, or can't. They did win an unexpected victory on sequestration, because Democrats couldn't quite imagine that the Party of Reagan would swallow a plan with such heavy defense cuts. Democrats are more cynical now. Republicans may have to attempt multiple backup plans--B, C, D, and E--before they realize that Democrats won't lend them any more leverage for any more surprises."

Despite all the efforts to sell Obamacare, a majority of Americans are still fearing the day. According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, 51 percent of Americans disapprove of the health care law and only 39 percent approve of it. Seventy-nine percent believe implementation will either not affect them or leave them worse off. On the eve of this long-fought-over moment--the day Obamacare takes affect--President Obama's best sales tool may come down to a website: healthcare.gov. That's because that website will be able to give people real numbers about how the plan will affect them specifically--the abstraction will become a reality. ""You may have heard a lot of things, but check it out for yourself,"" says David Simas, a White House deputy senior adviser working on the rollout, imagining a conversation with a skeptical consumer. ""That young man will go online, fill out an application that will probably take him eight minutes, and the first thing he is going to see, depending on his income, is that he is getting money. You get a subsidy of $1,000 or $1,500, and we have seen with young people--and older people--when they see right away [that they get a subsidy], that changes immediately the perceptions of affordability."" Simas, the much-praised director of polling and research for the Obama 2012 campaign, is meticulous about data, so he was careful to manage expectations in a Wednesday morning session at the think tank Third Way. He doesn't expect a wide swing of people rushing headlong into the program. He expects enrollment to be slow in the first two months with an uptick before Jan. 1, 2014, when coverage starts. Simas expects between 4 million and 9 million of the 40 million uninsured Americans to sign up in the first year. (The Congressional Budget Office has predicted 7 million will sign up.) Bill Schneider, the CNN political analyst and host of the event, asked Simas about the most important and hard-to-reach customer he's hoping to sign up: the under-30 apathetic slacker. (Schneider said he'd been asked about the Affordable Care Act by just one such specimen at a Walgreens; the fellow referred to Schneider as a ""news dude."") If millions in this age group don't sign up, the health care premiums will rise as insurance plans are stuck with only older or sicker customers. These younger Americans are irritated that they have to sign up, and remain skeptical that they will need the coverage. Some may decide to just pay the fine and not bother with the homework assignment. The website optout.org, funded by the Koch brothers, is encouraging them to do just that. ""[The Koch brothers] have a profound misunderstanding of the people they are trying to approach,"" says Simas, who spent much of the last few years getting these young people to vote for Barack Obama. His argument is that three out of four young adults are open to buying insurance because they think it is valuable. What gives them pause is the cost. If Obamacare can come in under $100 a month, says Simas, they are likely to sign up. That's where the healthcare.gov website comes in. When users sign in, they will be asked to plug in their income, age, and state. Most will be surprised to learn that they qualify for federal subsidies if their income is low enough. Some will find that they qualify for Medicaid if they live in one of the 26 states that have accepted the federal funds. Simas points to the example set by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts. Twenty-six percent of the state's young people were uninsured. After Romney's plan was introduced, it shrunk to 6 percent. Simas' argument must overcome two headaches. First, is it true that young people value insurance?  The administration's own social media campaign lists one of the core problems in reaching young, healthy Americans is that they don't see the ""value"" of insurance, not that it is too expensive. Second, as effective as the website may be, will uninsured Americans even visit it? A Commonwealth Fund study found only 27 percent of 19-to-29-year-olds are aware of the health insurance marketplaces. The biggest problem associated with the healthcare.gov website is the ""gov"" part of it. The Affordable Care Act was the product of a long, corrosive battle and it is being administered by the government, which people don't trust. So when Simas makes the pitch, you can hear how carefully he tries to sell signing up as detached from the politics that surround it. ""This isn't about Democrats or Republicans, the blue team or the red team. Check it out and you decide if this works for you."" Signing up is set up as an act of personal and individual empowerment. Simas is not inviting people to recline into the massive government maw, he's leading them to the place where they can make their own choice. If people come to the conclusion on their own, they're more likely to evangelize about it, post it on Facebook, or share it on Twitter. That's where the Obama administration wants this conversation to take place. It learned from the presidential campaign that when it comes to an issue with competing claims, people have to come to knowledge on their own or they don't believe it. Simas recounted the story of a woman at a focus group during the campaign who was frustrated by hearing conflicting spin from both sides. "" 'I don't know where to go and find the truth. If I go to one website it tells me one thing, and if I go to another website it tells me another thing.' Well, ma'am, what do you believe? 'When my neighbor or my co-worker or someone else I trust tells me so, because they're not going to spin me like everybody else.' "" Of course, the White House can't risk this conversation rising up organically. The president and his advisers have been pushing the merits of the Affordable Care Act in every possible way, and people are still confused. That's why the administration has enlisted celebrities and other sideways approaches to reach Americans impervious to official propaganda. ""There's that 27-year-old guy in Walgreens who is maybe following Marc Anthony on Twitter, maybe his friend is a Baltimore Ravens fan,"" says Simas, ""and he will get, week after week, subtle messages, 'Go to healthcare.gov and check it out.' At some point that man or that woman will."" This week, as Congress flirted with a shutdown linked to a Republican-led effort to defund Obamacare, there was never any chance that the rollout was in danger of being derailed. Administration officials say even a government shutdown wouldn't delay the Oct. 1 plan. But House Republican leaders may have a Plan B: to ask for a one-year delay of implementation. After all, the president delayed the regulations on businesses with more than 50 employees, and they've just added a new small-business delay. Why not let regular folks have a break, too? No chance. It's not just that a delay would allow opponents another year to pick at the law (perhaps with a Republican Senate after the 2014 elections) or that a delay would crumple the ramp-up set to launch in just a few days. A delay, Simas believes, would postpone necessary economic relief for those who have already waited long enough. To make this point, Simas holds up a chart that he carries with him everywhere. It tracks productivity growth, GDP per capita, and average household income. From 1992 to 2002, all signs follow the same upward trajectory. Then in 2002, household income plateaus. ""What you hear all over, all the time, is this expression: 'I'm working harder and harder and falling farther behind.' When you probe people about what this means to them, one out of two will bring up health care. This goes to the heart about how people feel about the economy. ... That's why this isn't just about health care. This goes to the core of middle-class security."" It's that thinking that has guaranteed there is no way the president would give in to Republican demands. If Obamacare is delayed, it would deprive middle-class Americans of the one economic benefit President Obama has been able to deliver for which people are likely to give him credit. Now the president just has to hope that on launch day, healthcare.gov can handle the traffic."	Why Obamacare's Success May Hinge on a Website	['Romney', 'Obama']	['healthcare']

Two years ago, Republicans refused to raise the debt limit unless they got concessions like spending cuts, spending caps, and a strict balanced budget amendment. Two years ago, Democrats negotiated, then walked away. An impasse that made everyone look like idiots ended with a compromise that made them look like ... well, idiots. A select committee--nicknamed ""the supercommittee""--was  empowered to stop the next crisis. That plan did not work. Washington is now careening into another fight over the debt limit, with Republicans and Democrats basically at their old battle stations. The deficit's shrinking, so Republicans talk less about debt than about delaying or defunding Obamacare. President Obama was re-elected, so Democrats are less fearful than they were in 2011. Otherwise, this showdown is playing out precisely the way it did last time. So let's make a game of it. The bingo card below will let you check off 24 (of 32) of the various cliches, events, threats, and failures that inevitably will define Debt Limit II.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/house_republicans_debt_default_and_government_shutdown_the_gop_thinks_the.html	"For a couple of days last week, Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer was the Republican face of the government shutdown. Neugebauer showed up to the Wednesday ""storming"" of the World War II Memorial, and got irritated when a park ranger closed a gate behind a group of veterans. The congressman was furious. ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself!"" snapped Neugebauer, as cameras rolled. Suddenly, an obscure and bespectacled member of the Committee on Financial Services was Internet Famous for not understanding irony. When he got back to Lubbock this weekend, Neugebauer cleaned up the mess. ""There was an article in the Washington Times, I think the day before yesterday,"" he told a local radio host. ""A park ranger was quoted, saying, we were told to make this as painful as we possibly can. And that's just the Obama administration playing games with our heroes."" Not for the first time, an anonymous quote has been used to prove a theory that works for House Republicans. Wes Pruden, a columnist at the Times, cited an ""angry Park service ranger in Washington"" who'd been told to ""make life as difficult for people as we can."" The quote has been treated like an accidental papal bull from Obama himself. ""Several congressional committees have said they would look into the Park Service's decisions,"" reported the Times in another story, ""accusing the Obama administration of trying to make the shutdown as painful as possible for Americans.""* That's how plenty of House Republicans, who remain the prime movers in the shutdown crisis, are looking at the terrain. They were told for years that a shutdown would be a disaster for the economy and their party. They were told the same thing about sequestration. Neither crisis has really lived up to the end-of-times hype, especially not in their districts. The worst effects, the ones constituents ask about, appear to them to be engineered by a vindictive Obama administration. And they expect the same if they fail to raise the debt limit--a crisis manufactured by Obama, not by them. In the conservative media, this is the biggest story that the lamestream press won't cover. And it is a story: It doesn't make sense that some government sites are tagged with ""shutdown"" closed signs when most of their content is readable. Over the weekend, conservatives puzzled at how the Amber Alert website went offline. The administration explained it as a minor outage; conservatives saw it as an application of the ""firemen first"" strategy. ""During the fight over the sequester, Obama ordered the government to make the 2 percent budget cut as painful and scary as possible,"" wrote Jonah Goldberg in National Review last week. On Fox News, the shutdown has been portrayed as a meager ""slimdown"" that's allowing the government to function pretty much the way it always has. The only notable exceptions: Park closures, where ""barrycades"" have gone up to block Americans from their god-given green spaces and memorials. ""[Obama] can increase the pain on the American public or he can decrease the pain,"" said Andrew Napolitano on Fox News. ""He wants the market to go down and he wanted this shutdown."" Again, this isn't completely crazy. The White House really did expect the shutdown to sober up Republicans, and to scare them out of more brinkmanship when the debt limit comes up. It's not happening. Plenty of Republicans look at a potential debt default as another over-hyped crisis. The theory goes like this. Several times, Republicans have passed (or endorsed) the Full Faith and Credit Act to assure investors that the country won't default. Just like Obama should be moving around money to keep the parks open, he should be telling investors that he can use incoming revenue to avert a default by paying debt service, entitlements, and the military. Anything less, according to frequent Full Faith and Credit Act sponsor Sen. Pat Toomey, is a ""scare tactic."" House Republicans who voted for that act insist that the president's going to be able to finance the debt and keep old people alive--unless he's so vindictive that he doesn't want to. ""Social Security benefits are funded by mandatory spending,"" explained Texas Rep. Bill Flores to a reporter in his district. ""They go out come heck or high water. The only way Social Security payments could be withheld is if two things happen. One is the president decides to withhold them, or two, he takes the staff away that generates those payments or checks that go out the door."" Republicans talk about this with the confidence of people who can't lose. ""We've got more than enough cash flow, more than enough cash flow to pay interest on the public debt when it comes due and the House Republicans have passed a prioritization bill,"" said Texas Rep. Joe Barton on CNBC this week. ""This talk about default by the U.S. Treasury is nonsense. The president can be smart or the president can be stupid. And I would assume as smart as President Obama is, when push comes to shove, he'll be smart. So we are not going to default on the public debt. But that doesn't mean that we have to pay every bill the day it comes in."" We heard the same debt limit fan fiction in 2011. That was before an actual shutdown. That was before sequestration. Republicans have a new, cold confidence that the president, and the press, are lying to them about the downsides of these crises. Democrats are just comforting themselves with polls--Washington Post, Fox News, Pew--that show the public turning on the GOP's shutdown strategy. They keep forgetting that House Republicans aren't accountable to ""the public."" They have to answer to conservative voters. And according to Pew, 54 percent of Republican voters think America could breach the debt limit ""without major problems."" The base sees the real crisis as some future, Greece-style collapse. That feels more real to them than these spending and shutdown crises that can be easily blamed on President Obama, parlor tricks meant to make Republicans surrender. ""We're not French,"" Texas Rep. Pete Sessions told a heckler when they met at the World War II Memorial. ""We don't surrender."" Correction, Oct. 7, 2013: Due to an editing error, an incorrect version of this paragraph was published. The original article misstated that no park ranger had been quoted. The Washington Times article cited by Neugebauer quoted an anonymous park ranger. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

At the 11th hour, with Washington's supply of cliches nearly depleted, the House and Senate approved a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. The Bush tax cuts were extended for households making less than $400,000, a minor disappointment for both parties. The payroll tax holiday ended, also pleasing no one. But the system worked, sort of, in its doddering way. It worked when 172 House Democrats voted with 85 Republicans, bailing out House Speaker John Boehner, whose ""Plan B"" Republicans-only plan had been torn apart by House conservatives. It had worked in 2011, when Democrats helped put the Budget Control Act over the top. It worked a few more times this year--for example, when every Democrat joined with a rump of 89 House Republicans to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Democrats would bend when the GOP refused to. Not anymore. House Democrats, powerless as they are, provided the GOP almost no cover in the early stages of the shutdown fight. Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy declared a ""bipartisan vote"" for the defunding of Obamacare and asked reporters to ""write that down."" Reporters judiciously decided not to pretend that two Democratic votes from deep-red districts meant that the GOP had bipartisan support. Few Democrats backed the next round of Republican-proposed continuing resolutions. Only at the end of this week, when the GOP retreated to a plan of poll-tested ""mini-CRs"" to fund veterans' pensions and treatment for kids with cancer, did dozens of Democrats start to vote with them. Right after they did so, they endorsed their leadership's demand for a ""clean CR"" to be brought to the floor by force. The intransigence of Democrats, from Obama on down to red-state senators, has surprised the GOP. They honestly expected a few of the Democrats to crack--after all, four of them are running for re-election in states that voted for Mitt Romney. ""If you're a Mark Pryor,"" said Ted Cruz last week, ""if you're a Mary Landrieu, running for re-election in Arkansas and Louisiana, and you start to get 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, calls from your constituents, suddenly, it changes the calculus entirely."" Landrieu and Pryor never buckled. They voted with the rest of the party to amend or table every House bill. So did Alaska Sen. Mark Begich and North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan. So did West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate who's not on the ballot again until 2018 but who's on the record willing to delay the health insurance mandate. ""This is about funding the government,"" Manchin told me after one of his votes this week. ""This isn't about social issues."" Why do they stick with Majority Leader Harry Reid--why, when three of them could cast ""safe"" no votes and Reid could still beat the House bills? Democratic aides say that the red-staters are ""scared straight"" by the House GOP. They're not getting the calls from home to defund Obamacare. Their home-state papers aren't dogging them, either. They're in no fear of losing an ""optics"" battle to John Boehner and company. Neither are the House Democrats. Neither are progressive organizations--not even labor unions like the Teamsters and AFL-CIO, which loudly demanded changes in the law, got cited by Republicans as proof that the Democratic coalition was imploding, then started showing up on the Hill for solidarity marches with furloughed workers. Sure, dozens of Democrats in competitive seats have now voted for ""mini-CRs"" that didn't touch Obamacare. Fewer than 10 have voted for any CR that did. Gerrymandering and the 2010 election have hollowed out the old, media-savvy Blue Dogs who used to make public breaks from Rep. Nancy Pelosi. There's a new, near-total refusal to compromise. ""It's based on history,"" said Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, a former chair of the House Progressive Caucus. ""Every time that we get into these situations, whether it was the grand bargain or the last CR or the debt ceiling, at the end of the day it is all the give on the side of Democrats. I think that pattern is well-documented, and all of us know it. People vote for the greater good, to keep government working. Then you come back around, and there's nothing left to give. I think we've reached the tipping point, with Democrats saying, 'If you want to bear the responsibility for the crisis you've created, then you bear it, and we're gonna stand firm.' "" Some Republicans think they turned the tide, or started to, with the mini-CRs. Democrats think that's short sighted. It's easy for the GOP to pass a small bill that ""funds our veterans."" What happens if the shutdown drags, and voters start hearing about poor families missing out on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families payments or Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency inspectors going off the clock? Is the GOP going to pass a mini-CR for the EPA? For food stamps? ""We've gone from 'defund Obamacare or else' to 'oh, you know, we've got some favorite agencies we want to fund,' "" said Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents Washington suburbs and exurbs that used to be competitive for Republicans. ""I don't think they're going to be able to frame that with voters. How do they do it? So--for a cheap political ad a year from now, they held the government hostage?"" Democrats don't worry about that. They worry about a ""grand bargain"" that would ask them to bail out the GOP again and vote for Social Security cuts. But in 2011, conservatives blew up a deal and spared the Democrats that vote. In 2013, conservatives turned the focus to Obamacare, which the party's never going to undo. ""Dealing with terrorists has taught us some things,"" said Washington Rep. Jim McDermott after voting no on one of Thursday's GOP bills. ""You can't deal with 'em. This mess was created by the Republicans for one purpose, and they lost. People in my district are calling in for Obamacare--affordable health care--in large numbers. These guys have lost, and they can't figure out how to admit it."" Why would House Democrats give away what the Supreme Court and the 2012 electorate didn't? ""You can't say, OK, you get half of Obamacare--this isn't a Solomonic decision,"" McDermott said. ""So we sit here until they figure out they fuckin' lost."" Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the government shutdown."

This is the first in a series of dispatches from Slate readers telling us about their experience using the new health care exchanges. Eric Powell
 Small-business owner, 32
 Colorado I grew up a staunch Republican, voted for Bush twice, but the combination of Sarah Palin and the baffling Republican response to Obamacare has caused me to have a major identity crisis in my political beliefs. I grew up in House Speaker John Boehner's district, and we're longtime family friends. My grandpa held the same congressional seat, my dad was a township trustee with him when they both were starting out, and I went to school with his kids. I've honestly never disagreed with any significant Republican positions until this one, but I voted for Obama in 2012--the only Democratic vote I've ever made. I spent an hour or so Tuesday morning browsing plans at the Colorado insurance exchange. My goal was to find coverage for myself and my two children for less cost than we'd incur through my wife's employer. My children are currently on my wife's employer-based plan, and my coverage is through the state's soon-ending high-risk pool. While my wife's employer coverage is inexpensive for herself, covering our entire family would cost us an additional $1,000 per month out-of-pocket (for a less-than-ideal $3,500 deductible plan). Browsing and filtering plans is fairly straightforward, and I was impressed by the number of options. For myself and my two children, I was shown a total of 78 plan options from about 10 different carriers. The plans ranged from $357 to $1,024 per month (some including dental coverage), and it was pretty clear that we'd find substantial savings compared to insuring our entire family through my wife's employer. Out of curiosity, I also looked up plans just for myself to compare rates. Plans with similar coverage levels were a little more expensive on the exchange than what I'm paying now through the high-risk pool but still would be significantly cheaper than what I'd pay on the open market pre-ACA. One thing that struck me as I browsed the plans was that I knew the price was THE PRICE. In the past, when I'd browse individual plans, I knew whatever price I was shown would not be the price I'd pay due to my pre-existing condition. It was comforting knowing that I wouldn't have to endure some complicated application process with much uncertainty about my final rate or approval. I did hit a few snags though. I attempted to create an account on the site. After completing the required information and hitting ""submit,"" the request seemed to hang and eventually timed out. After speaking with a few friendly but overwhelmed customer service reps, it would seem that my account is in some sort of partially created limbo where I'm unable to either login or register again. They explained that systems were overwhelmed and suggested I try again in a few days, which I'm looking forward to. Owen Taylor
 Finance consultant, 34
 Charlotte, N.C. I have a 4-year-old son who was born with a serious defect of his GI tract. Oliver spent his first two months in intensive care racking up more than $400,000 in medical expenses. We order medical supplies online, are very familiar with Levine's Children's Hospital, juggle three doctors, and hope to complete Oliver's final surgery before he starts kindergarten. We are also very fortunate to have a normal, thriving boy with the potential for a long, happy life. I have political opinions regarding Obamacare (against), but I don't have the luxury of putting ideology ahead of what is best for my family. Currently, our high-deductible plan from Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina limits our annual medical spending to $13,700, including premiums. I also made sure that we kept the grandfathered status of our plan so we had options when Obamacare took effect. After spending much of Tuesday on the Internet, I was able to create an account but could not access the North Carolina exchange to learn if we qualified for a subsidy. Blue Cross Blue Shield will be the main insurer in North Carolina, and their website is providing quotes for their new plans. After seeing the plans, I was shocked. The bronze plan that most closely matches our grandfathered plan has a premium of $676 versus $294 for our current plan. The bronze plan also has higher out-of-pocket spending--$11,000 vs. $10,000--and does not provide a health savings account. Higher expenses for more than twice the price is not progress for my family. We would need a subsidy of at least $5,000 to make the bronze plan competitive with our grandfathered, unsubsidized plan. It appears that families and individuals with low incomes should benefit, but at great cost. Kevin Mims
 Part-time jobs, 55
 Sacramento, Calif. My name is Kevin Mims. I am 55. My wife is 62. We've been married for 33 years, and for most of that time we had excellent health insurance coverage through my wife's work. (She was an escrow officer for 30 years.) She got laid off in 2010, and since then we have both been working at multiple part-time jobs, none of which provide health insurance. We are both freelance notaries public. My wife also works part-time for my stepdaughter's home business (which has only three employees). What's more, she works several days a month at a local antiques co-op. In addition to my notary work, I am a freelance writer, a fill-in clerk at a local bookstore, an antiques seller, and do a lot of other odd jobs such as house-sitting, pet-sitting, even baby-sitting. Life without insurance has been scary. In June I went out jogging one day without checking the temperature. I thought the temperature was in the 80s, but a mile or two into my run, I began feeling really sick, as if I were coming down with heat stroke or something. On the way back home, I passed a building whose time-and-temperature display informed me that it was 104 degrees outside. I felt sicker and sicker as the day went on. By 11:30 p.m., I had the dry heaves and was retching uncontrollably. At midnight my wife took me to the emergency room of the U.C. Davis Medical Center. They did a quick EKG on me, determined I wasn't having a heart attack, and then assigned me a very low triage priority. Next they sent me to the finance department to try to figure out how I was going to pay for any treatment I received. I was asked about the value of my home, the value of my cars, and other personal property. I was asked about the value of my bank accounts, about my annual income. All of this increased the stress I was under. After signing some papers agreeing to reimburse the hospital for any treatment I received, I was sent to the emergency waiting area. After sitting in the waiting area for three hours without being seen by a doctor or nurse, I began to feel better, so I left the hospital. Later I got a bill from the medical center for $850. I visited the Covered California's website Tuesday morning at 9:15. I clicked the button that said ""Start Here."" I got a message that said, ""Problem Loading Page."" Repeated attempts yielded the same result. At 9:30 I dialed Covered California's 1-800 number. I got an automated message saying that the call center was handling a higher than expected volume of calls and that my approximate wait time would be 292 minutes. I left my name and phone number and requested a callback. I'm not worried. I still have three months in which to enroll in a health plan. Considering that the federal government has shut down and millions of people are in need of the health coverage Obamacare offers, it isn't surprising to me that I wasn't able to get assistance on Day One. I'll try again tomorrow. On the bright side, I was amazed by the affordability of the plans on offer at Covered California. My wife and I are leaning toward Kaiser Permanente's Bronze 60 plan, the premiums for which are only $2 a month. Toby Dillon
 IT manager, 36
 Tooele, Utah Ours is the quintessential traditional nuclear family, married for 13 years with four children and one on the way. I am a salaried IT manager for a small company, making a little more than $50,000 annually and am the sole breadwinner for the family. For years, my wife and I have gone without health insurance (save CHIP for the kids) because the plan offered to us by my employer was ridiculously overpriced: $5,000 premium, with another $2,000 deductible before anything really kicked in, then 30 to 50 percent coinsurance with a lifetime maximum of $1,000,000. Individual plans availed us nothing: My wife is uninsurable due to asthma. When the ACA was signed into law, we actually did shed some tears of joy. It's not the single-payer plan we had hoped for, but it is better than nothing. We've waited four long years for this day. Living in the West, I took advantage of the time-zone difference and tried to sign up at 11:00 p.m., thereby hopefully beating the rush. My plan failed; it now occurs to me that I am part of a large network of people perpetrating a denial-of-service attack on government computers. (We're all going to jail for a very long time.) Thankfully, the companies participating in the exchange here in Utah have their own websites, with explanations of benefits and cost calculators. So while I can't sign up yet, I can get a sense for what I'm signing up for and make comparisons. The interesting thing I've noticed is that, regardless of whether I sign up just myself, my spouse, or my children, we'll pay the same 5 percent of gross income in premiums, because the subsidy gets larger as we add people on. I also noticed that the Silver plans are far better values than the Gold or Bronze. Steven
 Freelancer, 39
 Carmel, Ind. Our story isn't terribly exotic, but it's ours. My wife and I (42 and 39) are both freelancers working at home, which means--among other things--we've been blessed with being able to raise our 7-year-old child without outside child care. Although solidly middle class by dollars, we don't earn health care through our employment, which means a large chunk of our money ($600 per month) goes toward health insurance, despite being mostly healthy nonsmokers. We're most interested in the provision of the ACA that requires insurers to cover maternity. It's nearly impossible for single buyers to purchase in our home state of Indiana: one-year waiting period, an extra $10,000 in annual premiums. Basically, you're prepaying for a standard delivery. Because of the lack of coverage--and earnings that have kept us from being certain of Medicaid benefits--we've limited ourselves to one child (which has been tricky, since we're practicing Catholics). We hope for coverage that's either better or cheaper than what we have now--and preferably both! I tried to register starting at 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday. I got almost all the way through, but it timed out after I entered my answer to security questions with a red-boxed error message: ""Important: Your account couldnt be created at this time. The system is unavailable."" (The lack of proper punctuation on ""couldnt"" irked me as a writer.) Throughout the rest of the day, I got a variety of error messages as I tried to register: security questions failing to display, ""The system is down at the moment,"" locked Web pages, and even ""Please note that two or more answers to the security questions cannot be the same. You must provide distinct answers to the chosen security questions"" (despite my certainty that there WERE different answers). I appreciated the website's eagerness to give me a variety of error messages, no matter how nonsensical. Finally, at 6:03 a.m. Wednesday, on my 19th attempt in 23 hours, I successfully registered. I then tried to log in. Unfortunately, I got stuck on the first page. It wanted my legal name (is my middle name used on legal documentation?), so I logged out. I waited for my wife to wake up, since she has a better accounting of my life than I do. With access to my personal info at hand, I tried logging in again, only to receive a NEW red-boxed error message: ""Unexpected error. Error ID:"" (No error ID listed.) If there's a silver lining so far, it seems so many people are itching to sign up as soon as possible that they're crashing the system. Bigger pools are good for insurance, and this gives me cautious hope for its long-term prospects--presuming, of course, that I can ever log in again. Steven Harris Scott
 Ph.D. student, 35
 George Mason University My wife and I got married four years ago, at slightly above-average ages--I'm 35 and she's 32--so we have wanted to start the baby-making process for a couple years. A lack of money and health insurance has prevented us. She's worked part-time since earning her M.A. five years ago, mostly as an adjunct professor. I'm finishing my Ph.D. (we met in class!) and am still making grad student money. I've got health insurance through school but to add her would cost $6,000 per year--20 percent of our annual earnings! We need Obamacare so she can get affordable health insurance. We will literally start trying to have a baby the next day! In light of this, I may have gotten my hopes up too high. I visited healthcare.gov at 12:36 a.m. on the morning of Oct. 1--minutes after turning 35! I was unsuccessful. The sign-up process got stuck on the security questions page. No problem, I'd try again later that day. I remained unsuccessful the rest of the day--I tried at 10:30 a.m., and this time, I tried Live Chat but couldn't get through after waiting 20 minutes. I tried again at 4:45 p.m. because, well, I like to beat my head against walls sometimes! I tried a third time at 9:25 p.m., again seeing if Live Chat would work. It did! I explained my problem to ""Kimberly"" and got the following response:"	Slate Readers Tell Their Obamacare Stories	['Harris', 'Obama']	['healthcare']
19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/world_war_ii_veterans_visit_their_memorial_house_members_turn_up_for_the.html	"Eugene Morgan is a veteran of World War II, a Marine, age 96--and for 20-odd minutes, he's the most photographed man in downtown Washington. Morgan's misfortune was to arrive in the city on the second day of the 2013 government shutdown. His trip, organized by his 50-year-old son Jeff, couldn't really be rescheduled. So father and son showed up around 10 a.m. to visit the World War II Memorial. They ran smack into a delegation from Congress. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Rep. John Carter were at the monument site, talking to Honor Flight's Jeff Miller about a minor act of civil disobedience. Since 2007, Honor Flight has organized free Washington trips for veterans who want to see the memorial before passing into the great unknown. Thanks to the shutdown, that memorial is blocked by 4-foot-high portable railings, just like the rest of the open-air tourist magnets on the National Mall. The railings are incredibly easy to move, but the Park Service--the part of it not currently being furloughed--is technically supposed to arrest any scofflaws. ""Honestly, I think this is going to be over soon,"" Bachmann says to Miller, referring to the shutdown. ""It's not going to be a problem."" Until it is, Republican members of Congress are arriving at the memorial, just ahead of the Honor Flight buses. They open the railings and cheer the veterans, in full view of a media that can't resist a good human-interest yarn. When a staffer points out Morgan to Bachmann and Carter, the members of Congress walk over to him, trailed by photographers. ""I'm Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, from Minnesota,"" says Bachmann. ""We'd like to know: Would you like to go in and visit the memorial? There's going to be a lot of World War II vets here today--would you like to join them?"" ""Yes, I would,"" says Morgan. ""Well, we'll open it up, and we'll let you in with us,"" says Carter. The cameras descend and notepads circle as Bachmann explains the situation. ""Because of the government shutdown, these barriers are up, so we just want to make sure they get out of the way,"" she says. ""Why do they have the barriers set up today?"" asks Morgan. ""Well, the government shut down the night before last,"" Bachmann says. ""Ohhhh!"" says Morgan, politely. His eyes well up as he talks about how he and his brothers wouldn't have won the war and come home safely ""if people back here hadn't prayed for us."" This Norman Rockwell scene is suddenly interrupted by a shout from the street. ""He's not an idiot!"" yells Shemaya Klar, a realtor who happened to be biking by. ""The government is shut down because of people like you, Michele Bachmann! You should be ashamed of yourself. Don't pander to a vet!"" Bachmann ignores the noise. Carter chivalrously steps in for her. ""You don't think there's two parties in this country?"" he snaps. He turns back to Bachmann. ""We got a noisy guy over here who wants to get politics involved. Don't pay attention."" In just a few seconds we've been reminded of why Republicans have sprained ankles running to the World War II Memorial since the portable railings went up. The angry-guy-on-bike is already a co-star of the shutdown drama; just the other day, one of them shouted down a drab House Republican press conference, calling members ""pathetic."" There can be no heckling at the memorial. It's a sanctuary, a place that Republicans can turn into a sort of theme park--Veteranland. When anyone heckles them, they can ask for some respect and point out that they reacted to the horrible ""optics"" of a closed World War II Memorial by trying to pass a small funding bill that would open the parks. Democrats blocked it, because they want to open the parks with a full continuing resolution. There go the Democrats' plans of making Republicans look like shutdown ghouls. As polite people tell Klar to go away, Colorado Rep. Doug Lamborn arrives, and a staffer nudges him to get in a shot behind Morgan. ""These people, they may not live long enough to see it again,"" says Carter of the Honor Flight veterans. ""This is a life-or-death situation for them. And if somebody was here to do foul things to this memorial, there's 435 volunteers called Congress that'll be happy to come down here and provide security. I don't even have to poll them."" A reporter asks him if he's really making the best use of his time by working here instead of inside the dome. ""This is the most efficient use of my time. Yessir. Any time I can honor somebody who risked his life for my country, that's the best use of my time."" Bachmann and Carter mill around; they're joined eventually by Michigan Reps. Kerry Bentivolio and Bill Huizenga. A Huizenga staffer hands out a letter that the congressman has just sent to the Park Service, urging National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis ""to call on the United States Senate"" and ask them to pass the House's park-funds bill. But soon enough the congressman spots a real-life park bureaucrat, the gray-and-green clad spokeswoman Carol Johnson, and absorbs her into a shame circle, asking who ""gave the order"" to put up the gates. ""The memorial is legally closed,"" she says. ""Who would be in charge of enforcement?"" asks Lamborn. ""The park police, not us,"" says Johnson. ""You have no plan if they break down the barriers?"" asks Lamborn. ""I personally don't!"" says Johnson. The frenzy around Morgan dissipates when the Honor Flight buses come into view. The organizers have already positioned themselves at the memorial entrance that's closest to the buses--most of the veterans will enter slowly, many in wheelchairs. A few members of Congress gather by the barrier, too, ready to push it aside. As soon as the veterans get close, a crew that includes Lamborn and Missouri Rep. Vicky Hartzler rolls away the barricade to great cheers and many camera angles. Bachmann positions herself at the front of the impromptu greeting line. ""I'm Congresswoman Michele Bachmann from Minnesota,"" she says, gripping a scrap of yellow police tape. ""Welcome to your memorial!"" Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, who like Bachmann voted against the rule on the penultimate continuing resolution, appears out of nowhere, dressed down to shirtsleeves, shaking hands and telling people about ""what I just said on Fox News--what are they gonna do next, put drapes on Mount Rushmore?"" The veterans slowly make their way into the memorial. The crush of politicians and reporters makes it slower. Missouri's two senators, Republican Roy Blunt and Democrat Claire McCaskill, accompany them in. They brush past congressmen from Florida, Kansas, Colorado, Minnesota, and Michigan, whose states are not actually represented in the Honor Flight today. ""Is this your first Honor Flight?"" asks a reporter. ""Oh, gosh no!"" says McCaskill. ""The thing that's a little confusing is the number of people here who don't have honor flights from their states to play politics on the backs of veterans, which I think is bad news."" ""Do you think the Park Service will arrest these veterans?"" ""Of course not!"" says McCaskill. ""People who work in the Park Service have a lot more common sense than people in the Tea Party."" The drama-cum-circus spreads around the memorial. Huizenga finds himself in a short shouting match with a tourist who's standing outside the memorial, looking down at him. ""Do your job!"" yells the tourist. ""We tried to fund the veterans and the parks, and the Democrats blocked it,"" Huizenga says. ""You didn't try! Why don't you vote for a gun ban and maybe the Democrats will stop Obamacare,"" the tourist says. There is, fortunately, enough space left over for the veterans to enjoy their memorial. Gaza Bodnar, a Navy veteran from Missouri who helped with the landing on Okinawa, Japan, regales me with the story of the occupation and the party that broke out when the troops learned that a nuked Japan had surrendered, preventing a bloody land invasion. ""I think we shot every bullet we had into the air,"" Bodnar says. What does he want Congress to do, to end the shutdown? ""It's terrible. Somebody wants something, they knock him down. Why can't they make a deal? Obamacare is not going to affect me whatsoever, because I go through the veterans' hospital. I don't know ... it's nice if they can take care of people,"" he says. But it's not like the nonagenarians walking the memorial are willing to become health care pundits. They, like the parks, were supposed to be victims of the House GOP's intransigence. The House GOP wants to prove that they're really victims of a reckless President Obama. Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer spots the bureaucrats sliding back the barrier and starts to confront Johnson again. Beyond the barrier, another heckler tries to rattle him. ""Why don't you go back to Congress and do your jobs?"" the heckler yells. ""Why don't you get a job?"" snaps Neugebauer. The heckler, a Harvard Ph.D. student named Matthew Kustenbauder, calmly moves away as Honor Flight workers tell him to keep it civil. ""The nerve of him to say 'get a job,' "" says Kustenbauder. ""For all he knows, I've been furloughed."" Neugebauer goes back to work--i.e., back to berating Johnson--but is surprised by another heckler, a 62-year-old furloughed worker named Jim O'Keefe. ""This woman is doing her job!"" he says. ""The government won't do its job and pass its budget."" ""The House did its job,"" yells a Republican staffer. O'Keefe makes his way out of the memorial. Carter, who heard the exchanges, asks O'Keefe where he works. The Department of Homeland Security, says O'Keefe. ""I'm the chairman of that subcommittee,"" says Carter. ""We'll have you back to work."" ""OK, and you can go back to work!"" O'Keefe says. ""I am working. I'm here on the request of my veterans,"" Carter says. ""You're not doing your job. You're grandstanding,"" O'Keefe says. ""OK,"" sighs Carter. ""Have a nice day."" ""I'm having a bad day!"" says O'Keefe as Carter walks past. ""And so are the people who work for me and don't know how they'll pay their rent!"" There's a small smattering of applause, but O'Keefe doesn't smile. Why, he asks, is there so much coverage of this--CNN over there, Fox over here--and nothing about the average government employee. ""They're focusing on National Parks and monuments,"" he says. ""I gotta put a lot of that on journalists. They should dig a little deeper and get the real story."" Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the government shutdown."

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/house_republicans_and_government_shutdown_why_the_gop_offered_to_take_the.html	"Two hours before the 2013 government shutdown began, House Republicans leaked word of their final compromise. They would pass their final continuing resolution again, but with an important new feature. Now, they'd instruct the Senate to help them form a conference committee, a bicameral body that could hash out a deal. Democrats hardly knew what to say. ""You have lost it,"" said Rep. Alcee Hastings at the House's Rules Committee hearing. Senate Republicans had opposed ""regular order,"" as the normal way of operating is called, 18 times. Now Democrats were supposed to dragoon a half-dozen or so senators into a negotiation that would prevent a shutdown? Really? When the time between the hearing and the shutdown was shorter than an episode of Sherlock? We wouldn't find out. The new continuing resolution passed, and after midnight, House Republicans announced their conferees. Majority Leader Eric Cantor was on board, as was the (little-seen recently) Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and the chairmen of the Appropriations and Ways and Means committees. And there, at the end of the list, was Georgia Rep. Tom Graves. That just added to the confusion. Wasn't Graves the congressman who circulated legislation to fund the entire government but block Obamacare funding? Wasn't he also the congressman who led on the backup plan to fund the government but delay Obamacare implementation by one year? He was. Less memorably, he was the author of a letter, way back in April, asking Congress to get back to regular budgeting. ""Continually governing by CR wastes money, creates massive inefficiencies, and can weaken our national security,"" Graves wrote then. ""This is exactly opposite of the good government initiatives and reforms each of us promised our constituents. Rather than negotiating yet another Continuing Resolution at the last minute, the Appropriations process should work as it was originally designed, with Appropriations bills passing the House and the Senate and being signed into law by the President, after robust debate, with a process for amendments."" Whatever happened to this plan? The answer reveals plenty about the priorities of Republicans, the fears of Democrats, and the way Congress can no longer make a decision unless it's in a room booby-trapped to explode in five minutes. The problem with ""regular order,"" as pleasant as it sounded, was that any product it produced would disappoint conservatives. Budget reconciliation, where only 51 votes are required for approval, might be able to produce entitlement reforms, but it might produce additional taxes. Republicans just didn't know what they might be asked to vote for at the end of the process, apart from, surely, the continuance of Obamacare. And that uncertainty gummed up the works. The same problem crippled the immigration reform push--after the Senate passed its comprehensive bill, Republicans worried that any immigration bill, when it got to conference, could be turned into ""amnesty."" The worry was compounded by unfamiliarity. Nearly one-half of the current Congress arrived after George W. Bush's presidency ended. Just a fraction of the Congress remembers 1997, the last (pre-Lewinsky) year when the budget process finished up before the end of the fiscal year. ""In this body, it's been so long since we had regular order, there's a huge percentage of this membership that doesn't remember, doesn't understand, doesn't have a clue how it's supposed to work,"" said Oklahoma Rep. Frank Lucas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, elected in 1994. ""Ultimately, if you believe in regular order, just like any legislative procedure, you have to make sure that the minority is heard and the majority governs."" On Monday, before the new House strategy was unveiled (and thus before he became a conferee), Graves was still keen on returning to a normal, noncrisis budgeting process. ""I have no worries about regular order,"" he said. ""I think you're seeing some regular order in play here. This has got to be the first time in a while that you're seeing something go, House-Senate, House-Senate--it reminds me of that cartoon when I was a kid, Schoolhouse Rock. You remember that?"" But what would give the GOP a better shot at unraveling Obamacare? Surely that would be easier in a crisis than in regular order? ""Clearly we need every moment, every opportunity we can get,"" said Graves. Accidentally or not, he presaged the party's next move. On Monday night, when she rejected the GOP's offer, Senate Budget Chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray said that her party opposed going to conference ""with a gun to our head that says we're shutting government down."" Republicans, true to form, would like the right to carry that gun into the meetings. On Tuesday, their lonely conferees gathered for a six-minute press conference that was largely about optics. They sat at one side of the table--the absent Democrats were to be felt in the empty chairs at the opposite side. When a reporter asked why the conference process had been reborn, Paul Ryan explained that the GOP had more leverage now. ""We have a debt limit coming,"" he said. ""That debt limit is coming in about two weeks. Most budget agreements in the past have always involved debt limit increase. We think that's the forcing mechanism, just like the Budget Control Act that President Obama signed before, or like Bowles-Simpson, or like Gramm-Rudman, or like the 1997 budget agreement. All those budget agreements came together because of debt limit increases."" In other words, the regular budgeting process could continue. Republicans preferred that it continue--if we're not dangerously overloaded with metaphors yet--on top of a ticking bomb. The old idea that was supposed to bring the budgeting process back to compromise had become another cudgel against the Democrats. And as Graves proved, it made for a great hashtag."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/government_shutdown_is_bad_for_republicans_the_gop_s_divisions_and_fissures.html	"Listen to John Dickerson and David Plotz discuss the Day 2 shutdown developments. During the Great Polling Disconnect of 2012, the Obama campaign, the press, and a number of pollsters thought that Barack Obama would win his second presidential election. Republicans and the Romney campaign were equally convinced the polls were flawed: The electorate would behave differently on Election Day. There was a clear loser in that experiment. We're facing a similar test now with the government shutdown. Public opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to the GOP strategy. Republican Sen. John McCain tweeted a Quinnipiac poll Tuesday morning that shows 72 percent of Americans oppose Congress ""shutting down major activities of the federal government"" as a way to stop the Affordable Care Act from going into effect. For the conservatives pushing the showdown over the president's health care plan, those numbers are either wrong or changeable. We're about to find out which side is right. In the first hours of the shutdown, the terrain looks very bad for Republicans. It's amazing how consistent the polls have been about linking a confrontation over the Affordable Care Act to funding of the government. While polls show the public disapproves of the law, it has consistently told pollsters it is not in favor of tying government operations to defunding the health care plan. In addition to the Quinnipiac poll, the polls from CBS, CNN, CNBC, National Journal, and Kaiser show this. As GOP Sen. Jeff Flake said, Republicans have found the one gambit less popular than Obamacare. Conservatives would interrupt the conversation here. They didn't shut the government down over Obamacare--Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid shut the government down because he refused to negotiate. This is true; Reid refused to negotiate. But the American public would have to view this confrontation differently for that fact to give the Republicans any leverage. Right now, the public agrees with Democrats: Funding the government and taking apart Obamacare should not be part of the same conversation. How do Republicans change that dynamic? Asserting that Obamacare is not popular hasn't made a whit of difference. One way Republicans might improve their hand would be to seize on the first-day glitches that have bedeviled healthcare.gov, the website that launched Tuesday morning to sign up people eligible for the new health care exchanges. What better way to make your case that the law should at least be postponed than pointing to hiccups that show it's not ready for prime time? Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius has pleaded for time, saying ""give us the same slack you give Apple."" It's a good point--except when you think about Apple Maps, a product that seems to be congenitally flawed (but a great way to learn about the geography of places you weren't trying to go.) Also, there's no Apple Mandate that forces you to buy an Apple. But analogies are never perfect, and everyone has to get back to fixing the crashing websites. Now that the much-threatened shutdown has become reality, Democratic and Republican party unity is critical. Democrats are united. Even Democratic senators up for re-election in predominantly Republican states have not bolted. (Remember how conservative Democrats abandoned the president repeatedly during the passage of the Affordable Care Act.) If Republicans want to stand fast against overwhelming public opinion, unity during the shutdown is critical. They should be singing from the same song sheet, something that goes a little like this: ""We acted to keep government open while trying to protect Americans from being forced into a system they don't trust and which has had such problems the president has exempted big business but not regular people."" But there is no unity in the Republican chorus. That was clear even before the shutdown began, as Republican senators spoke openly about the folly of the GOP's approach. That's why John McCain, who was one such senator, was tweeting out polling figures that undermine the House Republican cause. So many Republican members have spoken out against the strategy that the Tea Party Express sent out a fundraising appeal asking, ""With Republicans Like These, Who Needs Democrats?"" In most epic battles with a Democratic president, Republicans would swallow their own internal differences and close ranks against their common foe. But that's not the case in this showdown: Many Republicans are personally invested in their previous argument that the party was headed toward ruin if it shut down the government over Obamacare. Put it this way: If Republicans emerge victorious from this struggle, McCain will have to admit Sen. Ted Cruz was right. House Republicans have asked Senate Democrats to name conferees to a committee that would work out this impasse. They have characterized this as a matter of fairness and proper procedure. They've said they are following ""regular order"" by doing this. There is some tactical appeal to this approach because it puts pressure on Democrats to simply participate in the normal process, designed over generations to adjudicate disputes in a system of divided powers. Sounds entirely unobjectionable--why wouldn't Democrats want to play fair? First, Cruz and his compatriots in the House are not operating under the standard protocols. That's why they get the glory and the praise: because they are willing to go to extraordinary lengths. They don't care whom they cause heartburn. They don't care how many doors they have to open with a crowbar. To simply claim that this process is the normal way of doing things is absurd. When you have decided to take extraordinary measures, you just have to hope people cut you some slack because the extraordinary measures were worth it. But after you've pulled the tablecloth out and scattered the cutlery, it's hard to then say, ""OK, let's continue with our nice meal."" (And it's worth noting that the table House Republicans are inviting their Democratic counterparts to sit down to is still one where the underlying dispute is live: whether the president's health care plan should be delayed as the price of funding the government for two months or so.) It's also hard to argue for ""regular order"" when Democrats have been asking Republicans for that very thing on the budget since spring.  One of the reasons Republican leaders have said they didn't want to appoint budget conferees is that the two sides were too far apart. There's no point in doing it, they argued, unless Republicans and Democrats had at least narrowed the nature of their dispute. Some people said that was a dodge, but leaving that aside, if you apply that logic to the current moment, it doesn't fit: The sides couldn't be further apart, so it's hard to put much faith in a conference process. The other reason Republicans didn't want to appoint conferees is that conservatives were highly suspicious of the process. Cruz was first among them. They thought the closed-door conference committee process would lead to capitulation. If that's their view, calling for a conference committee seems to be a pretty sizeable contradiction to their current strategy. House Speaker John Boehner is following a strategy at the behest of conservatives that calls for a next step that conservatives have actively fought. Furthermore, conference committees exist to create compromise. It's very hard to imagine a compromise that the conservatives who pushed Boehner to this moment are likely to embrace. During the shutdown, clinical trials and research and development at government laboratories will be slowed. However, a huge political experiment about public opinion, divided government, and the power of a small band of true believers has just been launched."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/government_shutdown_and_house_republicans_a_diary_of_the_final_12_hours.html	"Monday, Sept. 30, 2:08 p.m. If the House GOP's Saturday night vote-a-rama had a point, it was pure PR. House Republicans were at work while Americans were watching baseball; Senate Democrats were AWOL. On Sunday, led by Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a gaggle of House Republicans had stood between the Capitol and C-SPAN cameras and hectored Majority Leader Harry Reid's Democrats for not moving the newest continuing resolution--the one with the one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act. ""Come back and do what is required in a democracy!"" said Arkansas Rep. Tim Griffin. ""O Senate, where art thou?"" asked Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn. The Senate was biding time until Reid brought it back to kill the resolution. Senators filed in to table it, all 54 Democrats versus all 46 Republicans. Arizona Sen. John McCain stuck around after his vote to tell reporters, who have rekindled their affection for him, why the House GOP was careening toward death and destruction. ""Eighty percent of the American people don't want the government shut down,"" said McCain. ""They don't like government--they don't want it shut down! We're really making this much more complicated than it needs to be. Therefore, ergo, we're not going to repeal Obamacare! OK? That's it. We may do this for a week. We may do this for a month. It'll end up the same way."" Howard Fineman, the longtime Washington reporter who now works for the Huffington Post, attempted to bait McCain. ""Some people say this is your fault because you picked Sarah Palin as a running mate,"" says Fineman. ""Everything's my fault,"" snarks McCain. ""In fact, you're one of the ones that blamed me for everything, Howard."" Another reporter asked if there was ""a scenario"" where the House strategy would work, and change Democrats' minds. ""I see a scenario where pigs fly, but it's not likely."" 2:58 p.m. While Senate Democrats were feeding the GOP's continuing resolution through the shredder, House Republicans were meeting in their usual basement conference room, talking over next moves. The details of the new continuing resolution, ""Plan C,"" leaked immediately. Republicans would compromise by giving up on a full delay of Obamacare but asking for a one-year delay of the individual mandate and a rider that nixed health care subsidies for members of Congress and their staffers. This was popularly referred to as the ""Vitter Amendment,"" because Louisiana Sen. David Vitter (who, relatedly, might run for governor of his state next year) had written it, and because up to now it had been seen as an act of political gamesmanship that was not intended to become a law. At the same time, they'd pass a micro-continuing resolution that paid the military and saved everyone from the most torturous of shutdown talking points. House Republicans trickled out of the meeting, running head-first into dozens of reporters, many armed with cameras and pleading for them to ""stop and talk for a minute."" Most of them pushed on wordlessly, only to be chased down by reporters unencumbered by cameras. ""The government's been shut down 17 times in the past,"" said South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan, who left the room early for another meeting. ""The majority of those were controlled by a Democrat Congress."" His very next words: ""This isn't about shutting the government down. Republicans have a plan to keep government funded but also be responsible to American voters that spoke very loudly to us that they don't like Obamacare. Obamacare is actually shutting down America."" In 20 seconds, Duncan had insisted that a government shutdown wasn't a huge deal, and that of course Republicans would never be holding the smoking gun for such a devastating act. One reporter followed up with Duncan, asking why Barack Obama's election didn't prove that ""voters"" had also spoken loudly in favor of the law. ""I was re-elected in 2012, too,"" says Duncan. 3:50 p.m. The Plan C meeting ended after nearly two hours, 200-odd Republicans spilling out into the halls leading back to offices or the Capitol to be harangued by reporters. New York Rep. Peter King was glad to see them. He had spoken up in the meeting, telling fellow Republicans that he could not be a ""facilitator for a disastrous process and plan."" As King walked to his office, reporters were spun a fantastic tale of Republican insurrection. King had 20--maybe 25--like-minded moderates ready to join him and vote down the rule on the continuing resolution--the vote that sets up the final vote, something that almost never fails. If King could bring down this continuing resolution, it would end the ""pingpong"" between the House and Senate and convince House Speaker John Boehner to break the glass case marked ""clean CR."" Democrats would provide the ballast for a vote that funded the government and Obamacare--and nothing extraneous--while keeping the sequestration-level spending caps for the rest of the year. 6:31 p.m. The King story seemed credible--credible enough for Democrats, anyway. Reporters waited for the vote in the Speaker's Lobby, the hall outside the House floor where members come out to chat with them. New Jersey Rep. Rob Andrews strolled by and did his damnedest to spread the story. ""I think they're gonna lose on the rule,"" he said. ""They're bleeding from both sides."" But wasn't Andrews worried that the Vitter Amendment, with its headline-ready promise of punishing Congress in the name of ""fairness,"" would win Democratic votes? That was the theory, wasn't it? ""Another Republican theory is that there's no global warming and the Earth is flat,"" he said. ""I don't know what they're thinking, but it's unconscionable to take the young men and women around here who work as hard as they do and to take away their health benefits to make some political point."" Andrews kept talking, slowly seeming to realize that trolling the GOP before the vote might not help his cause. ""I'm whipping votes for their side!"" 7:15 p.m. Maybe Andrews was whipping for the other side. The rule passed, with only six Republicans voting against it. Four of them were conservatives. King and Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent were the only holdouts who could be reasonably referred to as moderates. Erica Elliot, a spokeswoman for Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, announced the vote totals and the names to a low chorus of reporter chuckling. New York Rep. Michael Grimm, another moderate who'd been whacking his party's strategy, voted for the rule. ""Peter King never talked to me about voting no,"" he says. 8:54 p.m. In the time lag between the rule and the final vote, members of the House milled around and plotted their next moves. ""Plotted"" may be a strong word. Oklahoma Rep. James Lankford, a red-haired and deep-voiced member of the 2010 class, held court in a corner, showing reporters what he called his ""serious face"" as he discussed how the GOP got here. ""Once we cross over pass midnight, it might not make a difference if we do it at 1 a.m. or if we do it at 8 a.m. tomorrow,"" said Lankford. ""Once we cross over into the dead zone."" He pauses. ""Y'all know if the president signed the military pay bill? We had some civilian folks who called our office and asked that, and we haven't heard yet."" Did Lankford think the GOP had gained anything, so far, by pingponging with the Senate when the White House won't negotiate at all? ""There's the big issue. Can the White House continue to say over and over again, 'We won't negotiate with anyone? Everyone has to do it my way or no way?' How long can you say we don't have a constitutional government?"" Kentucky Rep. Tom Massie, a libertarian who often votes against the leadership, stood just outside the Speaker's Lobby and predicted defeat. ""We're rushing toward a clean CR,"" he said. Was he surprised that the White House had refused to negotiate as the GOP had made smaller and smaller demands? ""I'm not surprised,"" he said. ""This is Pawn Stars 101. You don't come off your offer until he comes off his price! Are you gonna pay his price? If you pay once without him budging, you end up at his price."" New York Rep. Steve Israel left the floor with a grin visible from several yards away. He ran the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2012, making modest gains even on a gerrymandered map, and he's been insisting that the Obamacare wars would help his party win the House in 2014. When a reporter mentioned the Peter King charge, Israel rolled his eyes. ""When the best you can muster is two out of six, it tells you what's happened to the moderates in the Republican Party,"" he said. ""They live in fear of a Tea Party primary. That explains what you see every day in this place."" Israel started rattling off the names of Republicans from districts where sequestration and a negative party brand could help elect Democrats. Israel is told that Republicans think the stink of a shutdown will wear off by 2014. ""Can you quote me as laughing?"" he asked. Why wouldn't voters also blame Barack Obama for a shutdown? ""If I were a House Republican, I would die for President Obama's approval rating right now. If I'm at 16 percent, 48 percent looks pretty good."" 9:47 p.m. The Senate moved to table the new continuing resolution. Once again, every Democrat voted with Harry Reid. Once again, Republicans left ready to trash the House's strategy. ""From my standpoint, I think the House has gotten enough advice from senators,"" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. ""Obamacare is not popular, but we've managed to find the one thing that's less popular than Obamacare,"" said Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. ""That's shutting down the government. Quite an achievement!"" Flake sounded baffled by the lack of strategy. ""This is my first shutdown,"" he said. ""Every 17 years, now? It's like the cicada. It takes about that long for people to find out how bad it was, and then there's that screeching sound again. A shutdown doesn't even save any money."" One of the last senators to leave the floor was Ted Cruz. The media horde had mostly decamped to the House, to see what Boehner would try next. The only people close to Cruz were photographers, who snapped countless shots of him waiting, alone, next to a tardy elevator. ""You stand so well for photos, now!"" said one photographer. ""I guess I do,"" said Cruz. 10:54 p.m. Politico's Jake Sherman broke the news on Twitter: House Republicans would try to pass another continuing resolution, one that contained basically everything from Plan C but went to the Senate with instructions for a conference committee. Democrats were legitimately baffled by this. Way back in the spring, the House Republicans had tied the hike in the debt limit to the Senate's passage of a budget. This, they said, would restore ""regular order,"" and allow the parties to meet in conference to hash out a spending plan. It never happened, largely because Senate Republicans objected--18 times--to setting up conference. And now Republicans wanted to try to do this, or argue that they tried, less than two hours before the end of the fiscal quarter. The new-new-new-new continuing resolution went to the House Rules Committee, where Democrats, if they so chose, could eat up time asking what Republicans were even thinking. They chose to do so. Florida Rep. Alcee Hastings, a once-impeached judge who is now the best Democratic filibusterer on the committee, asked Rules Chairman Pete Sessions if he'd cleared this plan with Senate Democrats. ""In fact, that's a good question and I cannot answer it honestly,"" he said. ""Answer it dishonestly, then!"" said Hastings. He lectured Sessions on how, up to this point, he'd been unsure if the GOP had lost its collective mind or not. He was no longer unsure. ""You have lost it."" While the House committee met, Senate Democrats led by Reid and by Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski take the floor and denounce the plan. ""We will not go to conference with a gun to our head,"" said Reid. He wanted the House to pass the ""clean"" continuing resolution, not the one Democrats would have to perform surgery on. 11:36 p.m. The House Democrats hastily scheduled a press conference to denounce the GOP for belatedly asking to go to conference, when they--the Democrats--had wanted such a conference for months. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, produced paper evidence of the Democratic claim, not that anyone doubted it. A reporter from National Review asked the assembled leaders what they thought of the Vitter Amendment, which after all was still duct-taped onto the continuing resolution. ""That's not a real issue,"" said Minority Whip Steny Hoyer. ""The issue is whether we keep the government, on behalf of the American people, open. In my view, the people who offered that don't believe in it."" ""You know what else?"" interjected Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""They're fakers! They want that to not prevail, but they want us to vote for it!"" The press conference broke up shortly before midnight. Vermont Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, who'd been standing off to the side, stared blankly at the departing crowd. ""Welp,"" he said. ""We've got ourselves a situation."" Tuesday Oct. 1, 1:10 a.m. The House passed Plan D, with a smattering of Republican ""no"" votes and Democratic ""aye"" votes. TV networks were already running their Special Reports on the shutdown. The leadership's press aides told reporters to head over to the press conference, where Boehner would explain the next moves. The press conference lasted for a little more than a minute. Boehner took two questions. ""Eight hundred thousand federal employees are receiving notices that they're no longer needed on their jobs,"" asked NBC reporter Luke Russert. ""What's your message to them, and do you have a plan to restore back pay to them?"" ""The House has voted to keep the government open, but we also want basic fairness for all Americans,"" said Boehner. The speaker turned and walked away. Peter Welch, who was ""on the way home,"" had stuck around to watch Boehner's remarks. He walked out through Statuary Hall and the rotunda, a dozen or so steps behind the GOP team. ""Shut it down!"" said Welch in a mock-tough voice. The Republicans headed outside to their idling black SUVs. Welch raised his finger to the ceiling, as if making a grand speech. ""Shut this sucker down!"""

The Senate had given them a short-term continuing resolution that would fund the government until Nov. 15--funding everything, including the implementation of Obamacare. House Republicans responded with what several insisted was a ""compromise."" The government would be funded through Dec. 15, but Obamacare would be delayed for another a year. What made this a ""compromise,"" anyway? It hadn't been negotiated with Democrats; it had actually been pre-denounced, even by Democratic senators in conservative states. ""Sometimes I go back to basic civics,"" said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. ""We're the House of Representatives. We're the body that's supposed to be closer to the people. That's why the Founders gave a chance for the people to throw us out every two years. That's why when you go home for five weeks and you hear from people that this law is not ready, that has an impact."" Burrow past the blandness of that quote and you'll learn why the House GOP is so resolute in its repeal-Obamacare drive--and so unafraid of any negative consequences. Jordan's central Ohio district is a slice of what pundits know as Real America, suburban and well-churched. But it's roughly 9 points more Republican than the rest of the country, with a population that's 90 percent white and wealthier (median income $45,326) than average. Mitt Romney, who lost Ohio in 2012, won 56 percent of the vote in Jordan's district. Jordan ran ahead of Romney, easily dispatching a union organizer who raised $34,167 to Jordan's $1,078,119. So the people Jordan hears from are inclined to be Republicans--especially when he holds a Tea Party town hall with the Firelands Patriots of Erie County, as he did at the end of the last congressional recess. When optimists try to predict the end of the government shutdown/debt limit wars, they suggest that Republicans will, eventually, have to buckle. Polls show that most voters blame them, not the president, for the quagmire--hey, who can argue with polls? History shows that Republicans were blamed for the winter shutdown of 1995-1996--who can argue with history? Republicans can, and they do. The gerrymanders of 2011 added to their natural geographic advantage over urban/suburban Democrats and gave them a House they simply don't think they can lose. In 2012 they proved it, winning 1.36 million fewer votes than Democratic candidates but keeping a 33-seat majority. According to the Cook Political Report, 205 of 435 House districts are solidly Republican, basically impossible to lose without an unexpected bribery or sexting scandal. Only 163 districts are solidly Democratic. If Democrats swept the table and won all the districts currently rated as tossups or ""leaning"" Republican, they'd win 213 seats, five short of a majority. That was always the long-term Republican plan. In 2010, when voter anger was already guaranteeing a fantastic party comeback, groups like the Redistricting Majority Project (nicknamed REDMAP) told donors that ""the party controlling that effort controls the drawing of the maps--shaping the political landscape for the next 10 years."" Ah, but the plan was supposed to complement a Republican win. The actual 2012 scenario--voters voting for Democrats at every level and getting Speaker Boehner--was an undemocratic fluke. That matters, because Democrats from Barack Obama on down are refusing to negotiate with Republicans over the government shutdown. Democrats won the election; Republicans, they say (and believe), lack the consent of the governed. The conservative response is a resounding nuh-uh. Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, who led the ""defund Obamacare"" distraction in the Senate, cited the 1.6 million signatures in support of their plan gathered by the Senate Conservatives Fund. Former Sen. Jim DeMint, who now runs the Heritage Foundation as think tank-cum-war room, argues that voters did not endorse Obamacare by electing Obama: ""Because of Romney and Romneycare, we did not litigate the Obamacare issue."" (DeMint endorsed Romney for president in 2007, after Romneycare became law.) Over the weekend, conservative intellectuals jumped into the breach. Both National Review and the Weekly Standard had been cool toward the ""defund"" effort, but both published columns defending the GOP's ransom campaign. ""Petitioning Congress to repeal a bad law through formal procedures is not the kind of behavior educated people normally associate with anarchism,"" wrote Jonah Goldberg in National Review. ""The Fugitive Slave Act was once the law of the land. So was the Defense of Marriage Act."" Jay Cost, author of the Weekly Standard's pre-election page-turner ""Why Romney is Likely to Win,"" attempted to debunk the Democrats with data. ""The notion that Obama's reelection in 2012 was a plebiscite on the relative merits of Obamacare is wishful thinking,"" wrote Cost. ""Barack Obama hardly uttered a word about Obamacare, and ditto Mitt Romney, who presumably was afraid of Obama's rejoinder that the law was based on what Romney did as governor of Massachusetts."" Really? Anyone who endured a few Romney or Obama stump speeches heard plenty of references to Obamacare. The day before the election, at his final campaign stop in Ohio, the president said, ""I said we'd pass health care reform--we passed it,"" and promised that he'd reject any legislation that might ""let insurance companies discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, or eliminate health care for millions on Medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled."" The president, presumably, was aware that swing voters might hear this. Most of them voted for him anyway. Those who didn't might have been convinced by Mitt Romney, elsewhere in Ohio, saying that ""the status quo path says that we're going to have Obamacare, that we're going to have bureaucrats telling you what kind of health care you can have,"" then promising ""we're going to get government out of it and restore the freedom that you've always had in choosing your health care choice."" A bored person with access to Google can find hundreds more quotes like that, but why bother? Cost and DeMint argued that the election wasn't just about Obamacare, and it wasn't. What's more important, according to Cost, is that ""the exit polls showed a plurality of voters opposing the president's health care law."" True: According to the exit poll, 49 percent of voters wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and 44 percent wanted to keep it. When the pollsters dug further, 26 percent wanted the law ""expanded"" and 25 percent wanted it completely repealed. It's a divisive law. Just not as divisive as it used to be. The 2010 exit poll found that 48 percent of voters wanted Obamacare repealed, and 31 percent wanted it expanded. The electorate that re-elected Obama, less white and more liberal, was readier to keep the law. That's why the GOP is talking so much about 2014. When the House passed the doomed continuing resolution that defunded Obamacare, Majority Leader Eric Cantor made an extraordinary speech naming Senate Democrats from red states who'd have to take a tough vote. Those Democrats, from Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina, ended up voting to restore Obamacare funding. Republicans have responded by repeating their names again. ""You go to Louisiana, you got to Alaska, you got to these states that are overly opposing it, where these senators have some very difficult races,"" said Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy on Sunday. ""I think they're going to have to be pressuring their leaders to say, let us have that vote."" They're not. ""The Affordable Care has been passed by Congress, upheld by the Supreme Court,"" said Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu last week, after voting to restore the funds. ""We need to get working, implementing it, so that every mother, every father, every small business, every small child can have access to quality health care."" But the point isn't really that Landrieu or another Democrat will buckle now. The point is that 2014 gives Republicans a more favorable map, with Senate races in states that went more heavily for Romney than the rest of the country. Finally, by ejecting some Democrats in lower-turnout elections, the Senate might get ""closer to the people."""

Ted Cruz and Sen. Bob Corker this week, the Senate's presiding officer, Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, had to remind these two Republican colleagues that ""senators are to refer to each other in the third person and not by name."" This quaint rule is to keep the disagreements from getting personal. As the late Sen. Robert Byrd once put it: ""It is difficult to project the image of a statesmanlike, intelligent, public servant, attempting to inform the public and examine issues, if one is behaving and speaking in a manner more appropriate to a pool room brawl than to United States Senate debate."" In keeping with that sense of civility--in which members refer to each other as ""my good friend"" when they mean ""that craven charlatan""--I will characterize my reporting on the views of many of Cruz's Republican colleagues in a similarly circuitous manner: Their affection for him this week became so qualified as to be indistinguishable from hatred. They don't keep Senate records about this kind of thing, but it's likely that no senator has created as many enemies in his party in as short a time as the junior senator from Texas.  Sen. Cruz hasn't been content to stop there. After angering his fellow GOP senators for days, he capped the week off by making fewer friends in the House. As Robert Costa of the National Review first reported, just as House Speaker John Boehner was cobbling together support for a measure to fund the government, Cruz advised Tea Party conservatives not to support him and they took his advice. Why do Cruz's colleagues hate him? Based on interviews with several Republican senators and the staffs of several more, let me count the ways (in no particular order): He weakened the GOP's position in the coming budget debates: Right now Republicans should be unified in their opposition to President Obama's budget policies. The president's approval rating is at the low end of his tenure, and the country supports the GOP's position on reducing spending. Why did Sen. Cruz drive this enormous wedge in the Republican Party on the eve of big and important fights with the White House? He's fooled the grassroots: By suggesting that Obamacare could actually be defunded through his Senate action, he confused voters by setting expectations that could never be met. Furthermore, he was an enabler to interest groups who sold that ""bill of goods,"" as Sen. Tom Coburn put it, so that they might raise more money from the grassroots. Pressure: Members of Congress are getting lots of heat from their constituents to support Cruz in his effort. He will be able to cause headaches in the future based on the permanent false distrust he has created between members and their constituents. Jealousy: In a matter of months, Cruz has built a base of support that allowed him to act as the de facto Republican leader of the Senate. Breaking Reagan's Commandment: Cruz says he has not attacked Republicans specifically, but in his alliance with Jim DeMint, the former South Carolina senator and now president of the Heritage Foundation, he has done something more powerful. He has helped raise money to run advertisements against incumbent Republican senators. He wasted precious time: Republicans don't want to get the blame for a government shutdown. By soaking up valuable Senate time with no-win maneuvers, Cruz has left House leaders with less time to follow their legislative strategy--one that might have won limited concessions from the White House. Or, with significantly more time, House Speaker Boehner might have been able to produce a funding bill that would have at least included a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act. That would have put Democrats up for re-election in vulnerable states in a tough spot; at the very least, red state Democrats would have had to take an unpopular vote. Now the GOP looks fractured, time is short, and Boehner may only be able to pass the funding bill passed by the Senate Democrats--which he'll almost certainly have to do with Democratic votes, offering even more leverage to the enemy. Ego: He has used his colleagues to elevate himself in the furtherance of his 2016 presidential ambitions. He made Obama's critique look accurate: For years, President Obama has said a minority faction of zealots controls the Republican Party. By hijacking the system for a cause that had no chance of success, Cruz confirmed Obama's cartoonish vision of a party controlled by a wing unconcerned about practical results. He turned a tactical fight into a purity test: The majority of Republican senators agreed with Cruz on the importance of defunding Obamacare, but they disagreed with him on tactics. He characterized those with whom he had a tactical disagreement as ideological turncoats. He blunted the GOP's best plan of attack on Obamacare: The Affordable Care Act was falling under its own weight as stories of rickety implementation, layoffs, and companies dropping coverage of their employees continued to be published. By linking the ""defunding effort"" to continued funding of the government, Cruz distracted the public from Obamacare's inherent problems. That distraction undermined Republican efforts to chip away at the legislation through smaller attacks, like a one-year delay that might have led to a full repeal if the GOP took back control of the Senate in 2014. This is a pretty long list, and may not include everything I've heard this week. But there may be one more: The very fact that Sen. Cruz is despised by his Republican colleagues has only made him more popular among his fans."	Why Senate Republicans Hate Ted Cruz	['Corker', 'Costa', 'Cruz', 'Baldwin', 'Obama']	[]

McAuliffe's face and Cuccinelli's face appeared on-screen, in mid-sentence gawks. ""Can't vote for these guys?"" asked a calming, disembodied female voice. ""Neither can I,"" said a man standing nearby. That man was Robert Sarvis, the 37-year-old software developer running for governor as a Libertarian. He was actually in the auditorium with McAuliffe and Cuccinelli, looking on, because--well, you know, he's the Libertarian candidate. It didn't matter that he was polling at 10 percent or that Republicans are starting to wonder if he's the reason that Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general since 2010, remains stubbornly behind a Democrat they can't take seriously. He's not the problem. The race for Virginia's governor is the only remaining 2013 race that looks at all competitive between the parties. Ending Spending PAC and Citizens United, which spent heavily and in vain last year, are back on the air in Virginia to warn voters of McAuliffe's Cayman Islands money and his so-far-failed electric car company. Fast Terry (""the movie Terry McAuliffe doesn't want you to see"") runs like a rough sequel to 2012's anti-Romney ads, complete with hard-luck workers rueing the day they ever trusted this guy. Ah, but McAuliffe has his own band of white Virginians in baseball caps who can stand in front of debris and talk about how disappointed they are. McAuliffe's campaign has found them and put them on the air to decry how Cuccinelli's office isn't helping landowners being fleeced by fracking companies. Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who's been burying Republicans or pro-Keystone XL Democrats with piles of cash, has spent $900,000 on anti-Cuccinelli ads. It's all part of an air war meant to increase the negative favorable ratings of two candidates who had always borne high negatives. On the stage, Cuccinelli tried to remind viewers of his little-covered humanitarian side, like his work freeing an innocent man from prison--and then he and McAuliffe warred to portray each other as almost unbelievably crooked. ""The issue about the attorney general and Star Scientific, let's be clear,"" said McAuliffe, dodging a question about his tax returns to talk about Cuccinelli's taking gifts from a struggling Republican donor. ""Star Scientific owed the state $1.7 million. This suit languished for two years, for nearly two years. Now instead of the attorney general, as I say, going after that, bringing that money back to Virginia taxpayers, he was being taken to New York City. He was being taken to a Smith Mountain home, a lake resort. He spent time and his staff stayed at his house in Richmond. He took $18,000 worth of gifts. He bought stock in the company."" ""It's pretty rich to have the guy who rented out the Lincoln Bedroom, sold seats on Air Force One, was an un-indicted co-conspirator in a Teamsters election law money laundering, talk about ethics now,"" said Cuccinelli. The negativity opened a door for Sarvis. As he walks around the Capital One Conference Center, a typical northern Virginia corporate castle of glass surrounded by asphalt, reporters ask him sympathetic questions about what he'd add to the race. What if he'd been onstage? ""It would have been a much more positive debate,"" he said. Sarvis doesn't really get into the specifics of McAuliffe or Cuccinelli's scandals. He prefers to call McAuliffe a ""crony capitalist,"" and to shake his head at how right-wing Cuccinelli is. I wonder what Sarvis thought of Cuccinelli's lawsuits to pry emails from climate scientists. (Cuccinelli started this lawsuit a few months after taking office.) Climate change--that's an issue a lot of wealthy libertarians have time and coin to discredit. ""I thought that lawsuit was politicizing the attorney general's office,"" said Sarvis. ""You can disagree with him, and be a climate skeptic, but don't use the attorney general's office to carry it out. I respect climate skeptics, if they're based on science, but I generally accept the science. I just ask: What is the policy response?"" That's not the ""conservative"" position anymore. And that's Cuccinelli's problem: He might actually be too conservative to win even a negative-ad standoff against McAuliffe. There were warning signs. The last time the Virginia GOP really blew a winnable statewide election, it nominated Oliver North for U.S. Senate in 1994. Chuck Robb, the incumbent, survived the Republican wave and a minor cocaine party scandal because J. Marshall Coleman left the GOP to run as an independent. The last presidential primary in Virginia pitted Mitt Romney against Ron Paul--nobody else, because Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum bumbled their way off the ballot. The protest vote for Paul hit 41 percent, nearly twice as high as polls had predicted. There was always bound to be some amorphous, independent/libertarian vote that would oppose a Democrat like Terry McAuliffe but didn't want to back Ken Cuccinelli. Now that candidate exists, and Cuccinelli's negatives are actually much lower than McAuliffe's--by 20 points in one poll. Jennifer Rubin, the conservative Washington Post blogger, sat down with Sarvis and came away a fan. ""He didn't, to be frank, send out the 'crazy' vibe you get when talking to fringe third-party candidates,"" she wrote. ""He's offering an alternative to voters who can't abide either candidate and feel bad about not voting."" After Wednesday's debate, McAuliffe and Cuccinelli subjected themselves to short on-camera grillings with reporters. McAuliffe, who's more naturally comfortable in front of the camera, spun away questions about whether he knew how the state constitutional amendment worked (""Of course I do!"") and how much his education policies would cost (""That's why we need the Medicaid expansion""). Cuccinelli was asked whether Sarvis was cutting into his Republican vote. ""Look, I take everything going on in a race seriously,"" said Cuccinelli. ""You know, if you think in terms of libertarians, I've been one of the best defenders of liberty in the attorney general's office in a long, long time. Whether it was fighting Obamacare first, pushing back on federal regulations, or a lot of the civil libertarian positions I've had."" He asked reporters to look again at how he helped an innocent man find justice. ""If you go back 10 years, I was breaking with Republicans, working with a Democrat, getting something called the writ of actual innocence. For liberty-minded voters, I have an awful lot to offer. Frankly, more than other candidates have for a long, long time."" In the final six weeks of a governor's race, one that Republicans expected to come down to competence, a Republican was begging libertarians not to desert him as his party thumbed the anti-Mitt Romney playbook."

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/ted_cruz_strategy_for_defunding_obamacare_the_republican_party_has_no_idea.html	"The rolling, tumbling sack of failure that is the ""defund Obamacare"" campaign is moving too quickly for its planners to keep their mitts on it. On Tuesday, at 2:07 p.m., the Club for Growth issued a ""key vote alert"" to the U.S. Senate, warning senators not to allow a debate on the House-passed continuing resolution. The reason? Letting the resolution on the floor would mean Democrats got to amend it and add back the Obamacare money--doing so only required 51 votes. ""To keep the House defund language secure, and to continue using the leverage of the continuing resolution, opponents of ObamaCare should vote 'NO' on the cloture vote to end debate,"" wrote the Club. ""In the event that an agreement is made that requires 60 votes to strip defund language from the resolution, we will withdraw this key vote alert."" Inside the Senate, most Republicans had no idea what the hell Club for Growth was talking about. Sen. Harry Reid had already smacked down Sen. Ted Cruz when Cruz asked for amendments to meet a 60-vote threshold. ""A vote for cloture is a vote for cloture,"" said a puzzled-looking South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. ""As far as I can see, the vote on Wednesday is pretty much a set vote, and it's going to pass,"" said Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson. ""Foxholes have been dug, and I'm in mine."" To a Washingtonian, or to someone who knows anything about how Congress works, these were logical responses. Cruz was asking the Senate to prevent a debate on a resolution that defunded Obamacare. ""I think we'd all be hard-pressed to explain why we're opposed to a bill we're in favor of,"" said Sen. Mitch McConnell, whose novice (but wealthy) primary opponent has asked him to filibuster the continuing resolution. ""I have no trouble explaining voting for things that I'm for."" Ah, but to Americans--specifically, the right-thinking heartland folk that Cruz refers to when he uses that word--this is so much political doubletalk. Most Americans have no idea how the Senate works, and they never will. In 2011, the last time the Annenberg Public Policy Center released its always-depressing survey of Americans' civic knowledge, only 51 percent knew that Congress needed two-thirds majority votes to override presidential vetoes. Only 38 percent realized there were three branches of government. We can extrapolate that less than 38 percent know the different between cloture on the motion to proceed to debate (that's what was being discussed Tuesday) and cloture on the motion to proceed to a final vote (that's this weekend). What's happening in the Senate now is the simple, Cruz version of reality crashing up against the Senate lifers' more fact-based version of reality. All of the usual scolds spent Tuesday pointing out that Cruz's plan made no sense. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, which had coined the term ""wacko birds"" when Sen. Rand Paul (and Cruz) briefly filibustered the CIA director's nomination, painstakingly explained why Cruz was asking Republicans to bear the onus of a government shutdown. ""The president of the United States says he would veto anything that came to his desk,"" said Sen. John McCain, who popularized--mostly to Cruz's benefit--the wacko birds line. ""Nothing is viable until we have 67 votes. To think otherwise is defiance of the facts."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, who also planned to vote for cloture, went even further and suggested he'd vote for a ""clean"" continuing resolution at the end of the week. ""There's a belief that getting the majority in 2014 is possible,"" he said, ""and we don't want to go down roads that make it harder. If you're a senator from a purple state, if you're Sen. Kelly Ayotte or Sen. Susan Collins, this is not a good dynamic for you."" In Cruz's world, these senators merely lack imagination. If the party fights inside its own tent, then the media will cover the fight. If it unifies behind one argument--even if the argument makes no sense--then the media covers the argument. When the weekly Senate lunches ended, Cruz left saying almost nothing to reporters. When he returned to the floor, carrying notes and facing a mostly empty room, he pledged to speak ""until I am no longer able to stand."" It took less than an hour for one Internet artist to turn this quote into a meme. Cruz's speech was meant to be misunderstood. Some Internet explainers called it a ""filibuster,"" which it wasn't, as Cruz was merely using some of the 30 hours of debate time scheduled before Wednesday's cloture vote. ""Senator Cruz pre-negotiated the terms of his #fakefilibuster with Senator Reid yesterday,"" tweeted Adam Jentleson, a Reid spokesman. ""Not exactly a Mr. Smith moment."" The idea that Cruz could slow down debate in a way that aided Republicans was bogus, too. If he did filibuster, now or later, it would either trap the continuing resolution in the Senate or send it to the House with hardly any time for House Speaker John Boehner's Republicans to tweak and pass it before the Sept. 30 deadline. ""If the House doesn't get what we send over there by Monday, they're in a pretty tough spot,"" said McConnell. ""I'd hate to put them in a tough spot."" Yes, but what if you pretend that the tough spot was created by the other party? This is Cruz's mission, and it's not exactly outre. In the first hour of his floor speech, Cruz repeatedly redefined acts of Congress to make them sound like abuses of statist power. For example: If the continuing resolution gets amended by mere majorities of elected senators, it will have happened on ""a rigged playing field."" Back in 2009 and 2010, Republicans were quite adept at defining any legislative maneuver to pass the Affordable Care Act as chicanery. All Cruz wanted Republicans to do was update the blame-shifting rhetoric. And the party couldn't see what a winner this was. In hour two, after he'd compared those who didn't oppose Obamacare to Tories who wouldn't fight the British or cowards who appeased Hitler, Cruz warned his viewers that the Republicans who voted for cloture, then against the amendment to fund Obamacare, were secretly aiding the Obamacare enslavement. ""Every Republican will get to tell his or her constituents that they voted no,"" he said. ""And yet miraculously it will pass."" Having successfully predicted the future, Cruz kept talking."	Sen.

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/hillary_clinton_2016_presidential_speculation_the_former_secretary_of_state.html	"Hillary Clinton, in her first interview after leaving the State Department, offered a wise metaphor about the current state of presidential election madness. ""This election is more than three years away, and I just don't think it's good for the country,"" she told New York magazine, referring to the fevered speculation about her possible candidacy. ""It's like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there, and you want to talk to them about something that's really important; in fact, maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person, and they just want to know what's next,"" she says. ""I feel like that's our political process right now. I just don't think it is good."" Clinton knows what it's like to be on both ends of that exchange. She was a political spouse; the shortsighted looked over her shoulder for many years, seeing her as merely an adjunct to her accomplished husband. Now, she is the person who draws every eye in the room--away from even her husband. (When someone says ""Clinton"", it may not be long before a majority of people think of the former secretary of state and not the former president). Most presidential candidates strain for attention. They rush to Iowa, write books, or take extreme positions on controversial issues. Clinton has to do the opposite, trying to flee from the circus ready to chase her down the grocery store aisle. But she's in a bind. If she makes too much news this far ahead of the 2016 presidential election, there's a chance people will tire of her candidacy. (Update, Sept. 24: Joan Walsh of Salon says she's feeling Clinton fatigue already.) If she steps back, though, the unstoppable flow of Clinton stories will come anyway (especially the highly unflattering ones that feature people loosely associated with Clinton world, like the New Republic profile of Doug Band, who once oversaw the Clinton Global Initiative). Not all of these people leave a good impression. Clinton is perhaps the first presidential candidate of the modern age who needs a Rip Van Winkle strategy--a disappearing act that removes her from the witless swirl of speculation and gossip that preserves her presidential options. But what is this strategy? Does she go on a kibbutz for a year? What about a prayer retreat? She is a woman of skill. Surely, she can find some way to escape from the clatter or at least turn it into a force for good. (Perhaps she should launch a website on mindless Clinton speculation and donate the ad revenue from the site to one of the worthy causes she's been promoting most of her adult life). It's frankly hard to imagine a place she could retreat (without the aid of rocket propulsion) that would quiet the appetite of editors, gossips, and TV producers. Retreating would give voters a pause and Clinton a chance to live a normal life, but there's also a governing benefit: We get sick of our presidents pretty quickly in the age of the hyper news cycle. Who pays attention to an Obama speech these days? With candidates starting to position themselves for the presidency earlier and earlier, it's almost certain that we'll be sick of the next president by the time he or she is in office. If Hillary Clinton is that president, it will be particularly acute in her case. Though Clinton worries about the country looking over the president's shoulder at the next candidate, she isn't exactly keeping her arms at her sides. The New York piece is full of little waves to the admirers, including an admission of the obvious: She's thinking about running for president. The former secretary of state explains how normal her life is now. She's just flopping about the house, laughing at the dogs. As America's jet-set chief diplomat, she only had time to speak to her husband by phone; now she's watching stupid movies with him. The piece has the feel of a reset, both natural and strategic: Of course she's the competent woman in that C-17 photograph, but she's also normal, real, and grounded. (At the start of the 2008 presidential race, the Clinton team tried to convey a similar feeling with a video to voters where she sat on what looked like a living room couch. If they're going that route again, maybe this time she could appear in the garden with some mulch or a Pinterest account of DIY house projects.) If you're into tea leaf reading, when you look into the bottom of the New York story, it spells out: Hillary 2016. Clinton positions herself as a secretary of state who was in the thick of it but independent enough to disagree with the president. ""I've had a unique, close, and personal front-row seat. And I think these last four years have certainly deepened and broadened my understanding of the challenges and opportunities that we face in the world today."" Most impressive is the way the others quoted in the story fall into perfect formation, shooting down each of her perceived vulnerabilities, one by one. They testify to her management skill at the State Department--the chaos of the 2008 campaign is gone. They testify that Bill Clinton is a figure in the distance--no meddling from the Big Dog. It's a masterful rendition of the form. It's the kind of story we once expected to read a year before a presidential race, not three years beforeNow she just has to figure out how to manage those two long years in between."

They feel compelled to take this highly risky step because Republican primary voters are so conservative that any hint of moderation could be politically fatal. Ironically, the problem now facing Republicans is similar to the one the architects of Obamacare faced several years ago. A central goal of Obamacare is to ensure that persons with pre-existing conditions are not denied access to affordable health insurance. But prohibiting the exclusion of persons with pre-existing conditions raises the specter of a health insurance death spiral. Here's the logic: If health insurance plans are required to enroll high-cost individuals, premiums will go up substantially. Healthier (and less costly) individuals will then leave the plans, while high-cost individuals, who may have no other option, remain. As a result, premiums will rise even higher and even more low-cost individuals will leave. Before long, the insurance plans will face bankruptcy. The Republican Party faces a similar phenomenon. In many regions, Republican primaries nominate far-right Senate and House candidates. These candidates, whether they win or lose, drive moderate voters to leave the Republican Party. Conservatives then dominate the party to an even greater extent and nominate even more extreme candidates, thus driving away more moderates. Bankruptcy follows in the form of lost elections. Of course, in many states and House districts, Republicans are so dominant that they cannot lose no matter what candidate they put forward. But in the last two election cycles, Republicans lost Senate seats in Colorado, Delaware, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada because of the ultraconservative candidates they nominated. They may have lost a seat in Maine because of the threat that a fringe conservative could successfully challenge Sen. Olympia Snowe. And they lost several House seats in 2012 because of the extreme candidates nominated and elected in 2010.  Furthermore, Mitt Romney's campaign was hurt by the positions he felt compelled to take, especially on immigration, in the presidential primaries, and the current antics of congressional Republicans may damage any future GOP nominee in 2016. How does the Republican Party counter its death-spiral problem? Earlier this year Karl Rove proposed using the financial clout of wealthy mainstream Republicans to prevent the nomination of extreme candidates. But this is unlikely to work, in part because the party's far-right wing has plenty of its own rich backers. The best solution for Republicans may be found in Obamacare. Obamacare abolishes pre-existing-condition exclusions and requires health plans to enroll high-cost  individuals. But it seeks to ensure that health plans have a broader subscriber base than just those who are expensive to insure. It imposes a mandate and provides generous income-based subsidies in order to induce healthier individuals to join the plans, too. The Republican Party could take an analogous approach. It could broaden its primary voter base by opening its primaries to independent voters or, at least, to those independent voters who have registered as Republicans at some point during the last two decades. By becoming more inclusive, it would become more competitive. The present Republican state party leaders aren't likely to embrace this approach. But if Republicans continue to lose key elections, some leaders will begin a campaign to get moderately conservative independent voters to register as Republicans to take back the party. It will be a long slog; change is hard. Why do you think it has taken so long to provide health insurance for all Americans?	What the GOP Could Learn from Obamacare	[]	[]
