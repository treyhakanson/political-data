Wait, what? Let's slow down a touch and look at the rapid succession of events over the weekend and into Monday that brought us to this sadly predictable moment. On Friday, terrorists who have since been linked to ISIS attacked Paris, killing 129 and injuring about 350 others. Saturday saw Democratic presidential candidates discuss, without much specificity, their desire to beef up an international coalition to fight ISIS, in which regional countries would take on the lion's share of fighting on the ground. Republican presidential candidates were exceptionally disappointed that none of the candidates would use ""Islamic"" to describe the religious nature of the terrorist threat. Republican presidential candidates and leaders spent their weekends explaining how they, in contrast to the sitting commander-in-chief, would kill every last radicalized Muslim in the known world through kinetic military action. Jeb Bush, speaking on Meet the Press, argued that the United States should ""declare war"" against the Islamic State and deploy ground troops to the region. Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been reluctant to call for any intervention that might represent a long-term nation-building effort, called for a hailstorm of missile strikes that pays no heed to potential civilian casualties. Others have stated that the Obama administration's policy of targeted airstrikes is nowhere near what's necessary, but have yet to offer much specificity in how their policies would be any different. What the candidates were in near unanimity about was the need to stop President Obama's plan to resettle an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year. Though Donald Trump earned some mockery in early October when he suggested that Syrian refugees could represent an ISIS ""Trojan horse,"" such a view has quickly come to dominate the Republican field. Cruz and Bush represent different factions of the party but agree that only Christians displaced by the conflict should be allowed to resettle in the United States. Ben Carson called the administration's decision to accept the refugees a ""suspension of intellect."" Sen. Rand Paul said that he wouldn't have ""invite[d] the refugees in the first place."" Sen. Marco Rubio: also not big on accepting refugees. By Monday, Republican governors were escalating the issue. As of this writing, 14 governors--13 of them Republican--had said that they would seek to prevent the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states. Which brings us to the United States Congress and new Speaker Paul Ryan, whose House needs to pass an omnibus appropriations bill by next month to keep the federal government funded. Carson says that he has sent Ryan a letter demanding he push a bill that ""terminates all ongoing funding for any federal programs that seek to resettle refugees and/or migrants from Syria into the United States, effective immediately."" He added at a press conference on Monday that ""Congress, I think, should defund all the programs that allow all these people to be here. Immediately. Today."" Mike Huckabee, who, like Trump, has been warning about the purported threat of accepting refugees for months, offered similarly pointed instructions for Ryan: At least one senator, border hawk Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has called for a measure that would ""require a vote on the administration's refugee plans and funding for resettled Syrian refugees in the spending bill that needs to pass Congress by Dec. 11 to keep the government open."" The chair of the House Freedom Caucus, the several dozen hardliners who effectively hold veto power over Republican legislation, tell a hysterical Breitbart that they're unsure if Ryan is committed to eliminating funding for Syrian refugee resettlement in the spending battle. This sucker's got a hot head of steam on it, and you can see where it's headed. Congressional conservatives in recent years have sought to use the funding process to ""defund"" the Affordable Care Act, Obama's executive actions on immigration, and--this one's still an open question--Planned Parenthood. Now it seems likely they will demand language in the omnibus spending bill that bars the administration from using federal moneys to resettle Syrian refugees. One significant variable here is how united Democrats would be against it. A late September survey from Pew showed that 69 percent of Democrats supported the decision to accept more refugees, and each of the three Democratic presidential candidates called for at least the number Obama has thus far offered to accept. We'll have to see if that position retains such strong support following the Paris attacks. There is, even on the Democratic side, a strain of paranoid NIMBY-ism among lawmakers on these issues. Just last week the Senate voted 91-3 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, which included ""a prohibition on using funds to transfer [Guantanamo] prisoners to the U.S. or to build facilities to house them in the future."" Congressional Democrats have approved such language throughout the Obama presidency. One Democratic governor, New Hampshire's Maggie Hassan, has already said that her state would not accept refugees for the time being. (Hassan is running for Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte.) For now, though, it doesn't seem like Democrats are in much of a rush to block the refugees. When asked whether a provision to ""defund"" the administration's acceptance and resettlement of additional Syrian refugees would muster any Democratic support, a senior Democratic House aide told Slate: ""Democrats have already drawn a firm line against poison pill riders."" Assuming that firm line doesn't soften and the Republican insistence on such language continues to gain momentum, Ryan's December just got trickier.

1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/why_the_paris_attacks_will_only_boost_donald_trump.html	"Donald Trump has an answer for Americans scared of a possible terrorist threat from ISIS and frightened by the attacks in Paris: shut down mosques. ""I would hate to do it, but it's something you're going to have to strongly consider,"" said the real estate mogul and Republican presidential candidate on MSNBC's Morning Joe. He continued: ""You're going to have to watch and study the mosques because a lot of talking is going on at the mosques."" It's the latest in a stream of heated rhetoric from Republican candidates and lawmakers on the events in Paris. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz warned that the attacks demand less openness to Syrian refugees. It ""makes no sense whatsoever"" to bring them to the United States because ""our intelligence cannot determine if they are terrorists here to kill us or not."" ""Our enemies are not tired of killing us,"" Cruz continued. ""ISIS plans to bring these acts of terror to America."" Jeb Bush called for new restrictions on accepting Syrian refugees; instead of taking Muslim and Christian refugees, we should ""make sure that Christians from Syria are being protected,"" even as the large bulk of ISIS's victims are Muslims. Following Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio announced opposition to taking new refugees and declared this conflict a ""clash of civilizations"" between the West and ""radical Islam."" This rhetoric was a far departure from George W. Bush, who refused that language in favor of narrower terms--""terrorists"" and ""jihadists""--meant to avoid alienating the overwhelming majority of peaceful Muslims. Trump goes further, though, than Cruz, Bush, or Rubio. It's one thing to call for new limits and constraints. It's very different to suggest and endorse action against American citizens. If Trump were irrelevant to the GOP primary--if he were George Pataki or Bobby Jindal, for instance--this wouldn't matter. But he isn't. A new Gravis Marketing poll in New Hampshire shows Trump ahead of the pack with 29 percent of the vote. His next closest competitor, Ted Cruz, has 12 percent. Likewise, the Real Clear Politics average of national polls shows Trump with a little more than 24 percent of the vote, followed by Ben Carson with a little more than 23 percent, and trailed by Rubio and Cruz, with 12 percent and nearly 11 percent respectively. Among likely Republican primary voters, says a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, Trump captures 42 percent support. That's all to say that what Trump says matters; it shapes expectations among voters and puts pressure on rivals to use even harsher rhetoric. That's especially true on issues around ethnic and religious pluralism. In the same way that Republican voters like Trump's position on immigration, there's also evidence they back him on the mosque question. Eighty-four percent of likely Republican primary voters, for example, say they are less likely to vote for a candidate who is Muslim. And in Iowa, 30 percent of GOP voters think Islam should be outlawed, full stop. Sober-minded Republicans want to believe that the Paris attacks will shift the GOP race for president. ""This reframes the candidate choice in the eyes of many voters,"" said Kevin Madden, a spokesman for and adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, in an interview with Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur. ""This race could potentially swing away from candidates who were offering the outsider argument and instead swing toward those candidates touting a more serious and substantive agenda with regard to national security and foreign policy."" ""Trump is a candidate for people who think reality TV is reality,"" says Danielle Pletka of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Perhaps when they see the faces of the dead, they will realize that in real life, slogans don't save people. Sound policy does."" This is wishful thinking. GOP voters are attracted to Trump for his bravado and belligerent rhetoric against real and perceived foreign threats. Far from undermining his campaign, the Paris attacks strengthen the atavistic nationalism that fuels his campaign. Little new comes under the sun, and our current period in American life is an echo of times past. ""An acrid odor of the 1920s is again in the air,"" wrote the late historian John Higham on renewed nativist sentiment in the 1988 epilogue to his classic study of American nativism, Strangers in the Land. His survey reflects our decade as well: ""It rises from vast fortunes accumulating around new technology; from a grasping individualism eroding traditional constraints on the market; from a reckless hedonism in popular culture and a resurgent religious conservatism mobilizing against it; from a profound distrust of the state, a reviving isolationism, a growing demand for immigration restriction, and a deadlock in race relations."" These forces produce anxiety and that anxiety produces fear. Donald Trump understands and feeds that fear, which will redound to his benefit in the Republican primary as he positions himself as the deal-maker par excellence who can stand tall against America's foreign enemies and their alleged internal agents. We can hope that the tragedy in Paris brings some  sanity to our political culture. But looking at where we are, and where we've been, I wouldn't count on it.

More useful is what did you learn? After all, that's the point of debates--to learn about candidates as they address moderators, answer questions, and interact with each other. In the GOP debates, for example, no one has cared what Jeb Bush has to say about taxes, as long as he's in the mainstream of the party. What actually matters is how he responds to pressure and provocation, and on both scores--in the debates, at least--he has failed. On Saturday, Democrats held their second presidential debate, this time at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Hosted by CBS News and led by John Dickerson (also a Slate colleague of mine), the topics ranged from ISIS and the attacks in Paris to immigration reform and gun control. And watching the three-way fight between Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley, what did we learn? Hillary Clinton is stuck when it comes to foreign policy. As a matter of strategy, Clinton won't critique or criticize the Obama administration. At every turn, she praises President Obama and his accomplishments. And it makes sense--she wants to endear herself to rank-and-file Democrats, including black Americans, who strongly support the president. But there are places where Obama could have done better, or had the wrong judgment. To many observers, that includes the Middle East. We know Clinton has a critique of Obama's policy toward the Middle East, especially with regards to ISIS--she says so in her book, Hard Choices. And so during the debate Clinton struggled to defend Obama's record on the Middle East, and his past stance toward ISIS in particular. ""Won't the legacy of this administration, which you were a part of, won't that legacy be that it underestimated the threat from ISIS?"" Dickerson asked. Clinton didn't have an answer. Instead, she offered the audience what she would do as president, without reckoning with the choices she made--with Obama--while secretary of state. This approach continued even as the debate turned to other subjects. When faced with problems in the Affordable Care Act, for instance, Clinton can't make a forthright critique. Instead, she has to praise the policy, praise Obama, and find some way to move forward. It's tough and it's tedious, and it's an unneeded drag on Clinton's candidacy; the kind of problem that could spawn new problems, if she can't deal with it. Put differently, the easiest way for Clinton to escape the trap of the status quo is to break with Obama and put real distance between his administration, and her prospective one. Bernie Sanders has a similar issue. With his economic ideas, Sanders is a steamroller--the most aggressive exchange of the night came when Sanders critiqued Clinton's ties to Wall Street, from policy to donations. (This prompted a strange and memorable counter from Clinton, who referenced female voters and Sept. 11 in an effort to show her quality as a political figure.) But on everything else, and especially firearms, Sanders is muddled. ""There were parts of that bill which agree with--I disagree,"" he said in reference to a law granting legal immunity to gun dealers and manufacturers. ""I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill."" This was a far cry from the quasi-revolutionary rhetoric Sanders has become known for, and it hurt him--he looked smaller on stage when he wouldn't give a simple answer on guns. Sanders' performance left the impression that the Vermont senator doesn't want to be president. He wants to pull Clinton to the left and reshape the national Democratic Party's approach to economics. Outside of those (vital) issues, Sanders has nothing to say. Martin O'Malley had a strong night. It's not surprising that O'Malley is fluent in policy across several dimensions. But this debate was the first time he showed real knowledge and skill. He kept himself in the game, responding to both Clinton and Sanders, while touting his record as governor of Maryland (while, later in the night, downplaying his challenges as mayor of Baltimore). It was the first time, for my part, that I saw any fire in O'Malley. If there was a winner in the debate, he takes the prize. Unfortunately for O'Malley, it's hard to imagine a world in which this does him much good. There just aren't many people watching a presidential debate on a Saturday night, and while the former governor had a great performance, it's unlikely that many beyond reporters and political junkies actually watched. Which gets to the big picture of this debate. Yes, Republicans may lift some rhetoric for attack ads, and the polls might move a little, but the basic shape of the race is intact. If there's a difference, it's that--thanks to sharp questioning from my colleague John Dickerson--we can see weaknesses that weren't apparent before. The discussions went at the heart of each candidacy. And Hillary Clinton, who is running for the general election as much as she is the primary, needs to improve her game.

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/twitter_commentary_about_the_cbs_democratic_debate.html	CBS has shifted the emphasis of Saturday night's Democratic debate to focus on issues related to Friday's terrorist attack in Paris. This means former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley will be asked important questions about terrorism, national security, foreign relations, and the situation in Syria that could raise the stakes for all participants. The change of topic might force Sanders to back off a rumored plan to get more aggressive in his criticism of Clinton, who holds a commanding lead in national polls. It also means that the candidates' responses will be parsed more closely than ever, especially by partisans on both sides on Twitter. Below are live tweets from top pundits and politicos. On the left, you'll see the liberal tweets. On the right, you'll see the conservative ones. Enjoy the instant spin! Read more of Slate's coverage of the Democratic primary.	Here's What Twitter's Smartest Liberals and Conservatives Are Saying About CBS's Democratic Debate
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/ted_cruz_is_being_trampled_on_immigration_reform.html	"In Tuesday's Republican presidential debate, Sen. Ted Cruz chastised liberals and the media for imputing bigotry to critics of illegal immigration. ""For those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally, and [that] we should enforce the law, we're tired of being told it's anti-immigrant,"" Cruz protested. ""I am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba to seek the American dream. And, we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law."" In the days since that statement, Cruz has been refuted in the cruelest way. He has been lambasted by his rivals not only for insufficient zeal against undocumented workers, but for supporting visas and green cards for people seeking legal entry to the United States. Republicans are no longer just running against amnesty. They're competing to see who can take the toughest line against immigration of any kind. Six months ago, Sen. Rick Santorum was the only presidential hopeful campaigning loudly against legal immigration. His argument was that immigrants increase the labor supply and drive down wages. Since then, other candidates have raised the same alarm. ""Every year, we voluntarily admit another 2 million new immigrants, guest workers, refugees, and dependents,"" Donald Trump's website complains. Trump advocates a crackdown on ""the admission of new low-earning workers,"" as well as an indefinite ""pause"" in the issuance of green cards. One favorite target of immigration critics is the H-1B visa program. It's designed to let U.S. employers bring in foreigners to do skilled jobs for which they can't find American workers. The program is run by lottery, and lately, it's been abused by outsourcing firms that crowd out honest applicants by submitting thousands of applications. One solution might be to change the rules. Another approach would be to increase the number of visas. But as fury against immigration builds on the right, the whole idea of work visas and green cards is becoming anathema. Initially, critics of the H-1B program targeted Sen. Marco Rubio. He's distrusted on the right because he helped write the Senate's immigration reform bill two years ago, though he has since renounced the bill and has implored conservatives to forgive him. Trump's website complains that Rubio ""has a bill to triple H-1Bs."" Two weeks ago, in a debate, Rubio was challenged to defend the program. But now the hardliners have turned on one of their own: Sen. Ted Cruz. On Nov. 2, Santorum called three of his fellow presidential candidates--Rubio, Cruz, and Jeb Bush--soft on immigration. ""Ted Cruz wants to take the H-1B program and increase it by 500 percent,"" Santorum told an Iowa audience. This week, after Cruz accused Rubio of supporting amnesty, Rubio fired back, using Santorum's argument. On Thursday, speaking in South Carolina, Rubio noted that two years ago, Cruz ""supported a massive expansion of the green cards. He's supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program, a 500 percent increase."" Santorum joined in the attack, accusing Cruz of courting Republican donors by ""bringing in a whole bunch of people legally"" to supply cheap labor. Another candidate, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, called H-1B visas ""worse than amnesty"" and demanded to know ""why any Republican would support a program that imports foreigners to replace American workers and drives wages lower than the Dead Sea."" On the charge of having advocated for legal immigration, Cruz is guilty. As Slate's Jamelle Bouie points out, Cruz worked for President George W. Bush in the quaint old days when Bush was promoting work visas. Two years ago, when Rubio and his colleagues offered their immigration bill, Cruz proposed amendments that would have doubled the number of green cards (from 675,000 to 1.35 million per year) and quintupled the number of H-1B visas (from 65,000 to 325,000 per year). To make his case, Cruz cited productivity data:"	Even Ted Cruz Isn't Considered Conservative Enough for the GOP Base on Immigration

I'm Ben Mathis-Lilley, Slate's news blogger, and before I perform my duties as the guest editor of this newsletter, I'd like to encourage you to also sign up for my newsletter, the Slatest newsletter, here. It's a daily news newsletter--a newsnewsletter, if you will. 2 News, 2 Letter. ANYWAY, wow, what a week at Slate, am I right? For one, we're running hot on our pop-up sleep blog, The Drift, from which I greatly enjoyed Gabriel Roth's article about the pre-electric-light practice of sleeping in two blocks of time separated by a midnightish period of meditative awakeness (the last two sentences of the piece are particularly excellent and true), and Joshua Keating's historical/etymological look at when humans started realizing that you would get time-zone-related ""jet lag"" if you flew far and fast enough. Synthesizing those two pieces, the best way to avoid jet lag on a transoceanic flight, it seems, is to sleep for a few hours after takeoff, wake up for a while, and then take another long rest pre-landing. But then again, despite what it says on my business cards and $19.99-a-month subscription website Mathis-LilleySleepZone.com, I'm not actually a sleep doctor. Meanwhile, in the Political Zone* (*not an actual name of a Slate section), the best piece of the week was my new colleague Jim Newell's very funny breakdown of why governors are having such a hard time in this election vis-a-vis senators. (Sample passage: ""In a political environment that demands more and more purity out of its candidates for president, opposition researchers can have field days with the compromises that governors have signed over the years. The Senate, meanwhile, only passes viable legislation one or two times per millennium; the rest of that time is devoted to speaking, fundraising, and greeting constituents at college football tailgates."") Mark Joseph Stern, meanwhile, wrote a dispatch from the Supreme Court that illuminated some interesting points about asset seizure and noted the magnificent fact that a lawyer from Florida (of course) had appeared in front of the high court with his hair styled into a spectacular mullet. And I myself had fun writing a flabbergasted response to Ted Cruz's debate-night suggestion that the U.S. should return to the economic policies of the 1920s. (Something very bad happened to our economy because of those policies, is the gist of my post.) Other great pieces, presented in lightning-round format: --Isaac Butler on what Othello being ""black"" meant to Shakespeare.
--Jacob Brogan and Christina Cauterucci on the dubious man-politics of the ""Movember"" prostate cancer awareness campaign.
--New Slate books and culture critic Laura Miller on the difficulty of writing responsible nonfiction about the Salem witch trials. (Essentially, it's hard to make evidence-based statements about something that was, in some sense, ultimately inexplicable--and took place in a time and place of very limited recordkeeping.)

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/governors_are_struggling_in_the_2016_presidential_race_why_americans_are.html	"For several decades, Americans chose former governors to become their presidents. Think Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. They ran as outsiders to the Washington, D.C. cesspool who could scale their ability to ""get things done"" up to the federal level, which is perennially dominated by a bunch of corrupt jibber-jabbering clowns. Governors, by their telling, have the precise sort of strong, Christian personal values that would scare the dickens out of all those cigar-chomping, God-killing lobbyists in the Beltway. But the 2016 cycle is the first in recent memory in which service as a governor seems to be more of a liability than an asset. As the Washington Post writes Thursday, the eight-person Republican debate field Tuesday night featured only one sitting governor: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a well-pedigreed executive representing a critical swing state who, for whatever reason, spent much of the debate successfully going out of his way to irritate the Republican voting base. The ""undercard"" debate featured two sitting governors, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal, and one ex-governor, Mike Huckabee. Another sitting governor, Scott Walker, has already exited the race, as has former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. You also may have noticed that ex-Gov. Jeb Bush is struggling in his bid for president and, as a technical matter, we are compelled to note that ex-Govs. Jim Gilmore and George Pataki remain in the presidential contest. On the Democratic side, ex-Gov. Lincoln Chafee has already filed out of the race, while accomplished and polished former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is mired in the low single-digits just about everywhere. Senators, meanwhile, are all the rage. Barack Obama broke the long reign of governors and vice presidents when he became the first sitting senator since John F. Kennedy to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is an ex-senator, and her chief rival, Bernie Sanders, is a sitting senator. The two Republicans whom pundits are now favoring are first-term Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, while Sen. Rand Paul put on an impressive display in Tuesday's debate. Voters hate Washington, voters hate Congress, voters hate elites, and voters hate backroom deals made by elites. For some reason, though, they sure do get excited about members of the one body in the country that represents all of this: the United States Senate, our do-nothing ersatz House of Lords. What's happened here? Why has the ""I am an outsider with a record of accomplishments"" argument gone from potent to meh? The Post calls out what's surely one of the major factors: Governors, by nature of their positions as executives, have to make compromises in order to keep their states functioning, whereas senators mostly give grandstanding speeches and introduce phony ""messaging"" amendments all day. In a political environment that demands more and more purity out if its candidates for president, opposition researchers can have field days with the compromises that governors have signed over the years. The Senate, meanwhile, only passes viable legislation one or two times per millennium; the rest of that time is devoted to speaking, fundraising, and greeting constituents at college football tailgates. The pressure to vote for anything is especially lessened among this crop of Republican senators because their party does not control the White House, so there's no president strong-arming them for support on compromise legislation. Indeed, there are real penalties for those naive silly-billies who do try to craft realistic legislation during their terms as legislators. Consider the utterly predictable and likely potent strategy that Cruz has begun to deploy against Rubio. Rubio, by nature of his sheer political skill, has managed to recoup much of the conservative capital he lost by trying to pass a balanced piece of legislation on comprehensive immigration reform. There's no question, though, that he would have been better served had he, like Cruz, never attempted to pass something of value. But that can't be the entire story. These vulnerabilities for governors and advantages for senators have existed for some time, even if disdain for compromise among partisans has reached soaring new vistas in contemporary politics. Besides, candidates like Walker, Bush, Jindal, and O'Malley haven't fared poorly because of their records as governors, which are widely understood to be ideologically in line. It may just be that governor no longer corresponds directly with outsider, while the outsider label itself remains potent; similarly, senator no longer corresponds directly with insider. For all the railing against Washington, D.C., it's now perfectly reasonable for a senator to portray him or herself as an outsider since congressional leaders have less ability to corral their members into staying in line. Candidates like Sanders and Cruz can credibly argue that they're consummate ""outsiders,"" since they draw their power from funding streams independent from the party structure and don't answer to any corrupt, pot-bellied establishment fat cats on the Hill. More obviously--on the Republican side, at least--is that certain candidates have upped the ante in terms of what constitutes an outsider. Donald Trump and Ben Carson are pure political outsiders, in that this is their first time running for office, and they seem to only get stronger by saying ludicrous things that they can spin as ""outside-the-box."" Next to Trump and Carson, Walker and Perry looked less like outsiders and more like standard politicians. Which isn't such a bad thing. The governor-as-outsider construct had a good, long run, but it was always pretty bogus. The Washington party establishments were frequently the ones propping up these candidates and thought that calling them ""outsiders"" would be a funny way to trick the voters into supporting them. And it's not like governors are precious snowflakes who've never engaged in political corruption, either. Add up all the corruption in Washington over the last decade and it's probably nothing compared to what goes on in your average state capital on any given day. Lastly, there's nothing quite like the spotlight of the national media, shredding you to pieces for fun and games, 24/7, before tens or hundreds of millions of readers and viewers. Federal officeholders are more accustomed the media's (our!) sadistic practices. Figures like Trump and Carly Fiorina have been managing life in the national spotlight for decades. Walker, Bush, and Perry have not. You probably noticed."	Why Are Governors Having Such a Hard Time in the 2016 Race?

John Kasich announced his presidential bid, I and various other commentators suggested that he might be the 2016 cycle's equivalent of Jon Huntsman: the relatively moderate GOP candidate whom media elites adore but who is despised by actual Republican voters, largely because the campaign strategy rests on telling actual Republican voters that they're wrong. Not unimportantly, too, is the presence on each campaign of John Weaver, who guided Sen. John McCain to a strong if ultimately unsuccessful showing in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries and has been banking on that showing ever since. At the time, Weaver did not take kindly to the comparisons between Huntsman and Kasich. ""Every campaign is different, every race is different--that's pack journalism at its most glib and lazy,"" he told Bloomberg Politics. He added that Kasich ""is a conservative's conservative."" The problem is that conservatives themselves don't seem to think that Kasich is their conservative, and Kasich probably doesn't either. Let's consider his performance in Tuesday night's debate. For the second straight time, Kasich, for whatever reason--perhaps bad advisers!--found it in his interest not just to deliver unorthodox positions on prominent issues but to do so in a stylistically irritating way. Kasich, standing at an end podium, interjected whenever he felt like it, frequently speaking over the moderators. He challenged Donald Trump on one of Trump's most popular policy positions among conservatives: his ""plan"" to construct a wall on the southern border and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. ""Think about the families; think about the children,"" he said. ""Come on, folks, we know you can't pick them up and ship them across the border. It's a silly argument. It's not an adult argument. It makes no sense."" He criticized other candidates for having ""$11 trillion, $12 trillion tax cuts that will put our kids way deeper in the hole than they have been at this point,"" as if Republican voters have ever cared about the budgetary harm of massive tax cuts. He described Wall Street as too greedy, saying that ""they need a good ethics lesson on Wall Street on a regular basis to keep them in check so we, the people, do not lose,"" while the other candidates went on about the heresies of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Community Reinvestment Act. He inexplicably landed himself in an argument with Sen. Ted Cruz, a far better debater, about whether he would bail out the banks again in the event of another financial crisis. He said that he would: ""I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down."" After eliciting some serious boos, he continued: ""As an executive, I would figure out how to separate those people who can afford it versus those people, or the hard-working folks who put those money in those institutions."" The theory must be that there's some untapped mass of Republican voters who are frustrated with the party's far-right turn and crave a candidate who will smack  them back to reality. This is the same unfounded theory that catapulted Huntsman to the top of centrist pundits' favored Republican candidates and simultaneously sent him to the basement of Republican voters' preference list. Would Kasich, who Weaver argues is totally different from his crappy 2012 client because he didn't work for President Obama and comes from a more working-class background, fare any better with the same strategy? Let's look at the real-time results from the focus group convened by GOP messaging guy Frank Luntz: The more voters are introduced to Kasich under this strategy, the worse his favorability ratings get. His strategy, like Huntsman's, is tailored around appealing to the theoretically more moderate voters of New Hampshire. But even there, he's losing ground. As Nate Silver writes, Kasich's favorability in the most recent WBUR poll of New Hampshire Republicans stood at 37 percent favorable to 32 percent unfavorable. In WBUR's September survey, he was at 45 percent favorable to 21 percent unfavorable. It is a mystery that any Republican presidential campaign employs Weaver and his losing bag of tricks. Only after Weaver left McCain's 2008 campaign did McCain begin the recovery process that would secure him the presidential nomination. In 2012, Weaver turned a well-qualified candidate into a total dud; in 2016, he's doing the same to the most qualified candidate in the field, by urging him to tell Republican primary voters, in the most irritating manner possible, that they're wrong about the things they care most about. At least in 2012, Huntsman's presence didn't do any harm to the establishment wing of the party. Huntsman threw all of his effort into New Hampshire and came in third there with 17 percent before dropping out. His chief establishment rival in that state, Mitt Romney, was so popular there--he governed a bordering state and maintained a summer home in New Hampshire--that Huntsman's chunk wasn't nearly enough to prevent a Romney win. It's a different story this time. Kasich is polling in fourth, winning 5 to 11 percent of the state's voters. Those are votes that could be going to Rubio or Bush, who could sure use them if the establishment hopes to stop Trump or Ben Carson in the state. So perhaps Weaver was right all along: Kasich isn't just another Huntsman. He's another Huntsman who is also capable of doing serious damage to the establishment wing's efforts to win the nomination.

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/marco_rubio_where_does_the_candidate_stand_on_immigration.html	"Let's talk about Marco Rubio. Back in the 1980s, Pat Schroeder, a liberal congresswoman from Colorado, dubbed Ronald Reagan ""the Teflon president"" for the way he managed to avoid any blame for the scandals that erupted around him in his second term. One wonders whether Rubio is emerging as the Teflon candidate. With the possible exception of the silver-tongued Carly Fiorina, no Republican presidential candidate has helped himself more over the course of the first four debates than Rubio. On Tuesday night, Rubio fared well again. He wasn't quite as strong as Ted Cruz, who, as Slate's Josh Voorhees argues, was the night's biggest winner. More than usual, Rubio seemed to be drawing on his stock references to his hardscrabble upbringing and his immigrant parents, and his optimistic homilies about the healing power of the American Dream. What was really striking about Rubio's performance, however, is the way he dodged, yet again, getting drawn into a debate over immigration policy. Donald Trump has made combating unauthorized immigration his signature issue, and he has not hesitated to attack Rubio for having supported a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. We'll never know whether Trump intended to go after Rubio by name on Tuesday, as John Kasich interrupted him to declare that the idea of mass deportation is unserious. Earlier on in the campaign, it briefly seemed as though Kasich might try to differentiate himself from Rubio and Jeb Bush by taking a more restrictionist approach to immigration. It's now clear that Kasich intends to run as an immigration dove, which puts him in a tough position, as only a small (7 percent) minority of Republican voters want to increase immigration levels while a large (67 percent) majority wants to see immigration levels decreased. Does it really make sense for Kasich to try to duke it out with fellow doves Bush and Rubio over this small sliver of the GOP electorate? It could be that Kasich is playing not to Republican voters but to Republicans donors, who tend to take a far more laissez-faire view when it comes to immigration. Or perhaps Kasich was so determined to be ornery that he was going to pick a fight about something--anything--with Donald Trump to demonstrate his fighting spirit. Who knows? What we do know is that it was Kasich who wrangled with Trump over what to do about unauthorized immigrants, not Marco Rubio. Perhaps sensing that he was being marginalized on one of his signature issues, Jeb Bush decided to take on immigration Tuesday night, arguing that Trump's anti-immigration zeal would drive Hispanic voters to Hillary Clinton in the general election. Though I don't doubt that Trump's rhetoric will alienate many if not most Hispanics, I'm of the view that immigration policy is less important to working- and middle-class Hispanic voters, particularly native-born Hispanic voters, than Bush and other pro-immigration Republicans like to think. Regardless, it was Bush, not Marco Rubio, who weighed in at this point to claim that a harsh anti-immigration stance would alienate Hispanics. It would be one thing if Rubio only avoided talking about comprehensive immigration reform on the debate stage, but the Florida senator has soft-pedaled the issue throughout his campaign, only occasionally explaining why he decided to abandon his comprehensive immigration reform bill, which offered a path to citizenship to unauthorized immigrants and substantially increased legal immigration, among other things. Instead of repudiating the months he spent crafting an immigration compromise, Rubio emphasizes that he couldn't trust President Obama as a partner, or that the timing wasn't right. He insists that he pushed the comprehensive immigration reform bill in as conservative a direction as he could. Yet we don't have a clear sense of where, in an ideal world, Rubio would like U.S. immigration policy to go. On his nattily designed website, Rubio excerpts a passage from American Dreams, his biography, in which he makes the case for securing the border first, a conservative-friendly stance. He calls for moving from an immigration policy that emphasizes family ties to current U.S. citizens to one that is instead based on skills, which is sensible and broadly acceptable to the Republican right. What we don't know is what this would mean in practice. Can we really say that we have a skills-based immigration policy if we also have a guest worker program for less-skilled workers, and if guest worker status can be renewed indefinitely? One assumes that guest workers will form families on U.S. soil and that many of them will be reluctant to leave the country once their guest worker visas run out. And though Rubio discusses immigration policy in broad strokes, he doesn't really tell us about numbers. Will we admit more immigrants under the approach he favors? Or fewer? Even after abandoning comprehensive immigration reform, Rubio has backed legislation that would dramatically expand the H-1B visa program. What does he think about the evidence that the H-1B program is being gamed by offshoring companies with less than sterling records? These are questions I'd like to see Rubio answer at a future debate. Other elements of Rubio's immigration approach are likely to prove even more controversial. For example, he makes it clear that he intends to offer some form of legal status to unauthorized immigrants who already live in the U.S., a position that puts him at odds with many Republicans.* If Rubio intends to stick with this position, as I think he does, he's going to have to actually make the case for it. If Bernie Sanders can give a speech about democratic socialism, surely Marco Rubio can give a speech about where he went wrong on immigration and what he intends to do about it. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary. *Correction, Nov. 11, 2015: This article originally misstated that Rubio's position put him at odds with ""most Republicans."" Recent surveys find that while most Republicans oppose a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants, a narrow majority favors offering them legal status in some form. (Return.)"	It's Time for Marco Rubio to Come Clean About His Immigration Views
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/republican_candidates_aren_t_prepared_to_argue_over_the_economy_in_a_general.html	"There are a few things we can get out of the way about Tuesday's Republican presidential debate. First, after months of decline, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul had his first great night, challenging Sen. Marco Rubio on tax expenditures and defense spending, pushing Donald Trump on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and stepping into his father's role as the libertarian gadfly in the race. ""If you're a profligate spender and you spend money in an unlimited fashion for the military, is that a conservative notion?"" Paul asked in his closing statement. ""We have to be conservative with all spending, domestic spending and welfare spending. I'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage."" Rubio, as usual, performed well. But his approach--shaping canned excerpts to questions and using replies to give condensed parts from his stump speech--has diminishing returns. For as much as it might impress new viewers, it's a reminder that Rubio has nothing new to say. Sen. Ted Cruz as well tailored his stump speech to the questions at hand, but there were times when he went off script to mediate a fight--trying to stake a middle ground between Rubio and Paul, for instance--or make a sharp point. On immigration, for example, Cruz sowed the ground for an eventual attack on Rubio and Jeb Bush, who back reform in one way or another. ""For those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally and we should enforce the law, we're tired of being told it is anti-immigrant,"" said Cruz. ""Every sovereign nation secures its borders, and it is not compassionate to say we're not going to enforce the laws and we're going to drive down the wages for millions of hard-working men and women."" No one on stage took a direct a swing at Rubio on immigration, but from that answer it's clear Cruz is practicing. As for the rest of the field, both Gov. John Kasich and Carly Fiorina gave decent performances that will keep them from sliding down in the pack, while Donald Trump and Ben Carson were just good enough to avoid damaging their brands and their standings. Jeb Bush still struggles with the format; at one point, he had a hard time telling a joke and eventually abandoned it to make another point. At the same time--and unlike the last debate--Bush didn't do or say anything to tank his candidacy, which counts as a victory. But this is all aesthetics. More significant for Americans were the actual views of the candidates. Tuesday's debate, hosted by Fox Business, was on the economy. The first question of the night was on the fight for a $15 minimum wage, and subsequent questions dealt with tax cuts, job growth, and the Federal Reserve. In several places, the candidates showed disturbing ignorance of basic facts of the American economy. Paul, for example, blamed low interest rates for problems faced by the poor, despite all evidence to the contrary. Likewise, Bush attacked Dodd-Frank financial legislation for reducing capital requirements for banks, when the law does the opposite. Even ignoring these flubs, misstatements, and half-truths, the GOP contenders were out of step with the actual economic needs of ordinary Americans. Each candidate talked about relief for workers and families, but outside of Rubio's child tax credit, few offered it. Instead, candidates came out against raising the minimum wage, called for a new gold standard for currency, and pushed plans for massive upper-income tax cuts. Unlike the first Democratic debate--when Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee tussled over college affordability and health care costs--there was little in the Republican debate that spoke to the challenges of ordinary people rather than businesses.* Moreover--and more importantly for the politics of economic growth--the Republican candidates were silent on one of the key questions of the 2016 election. ""The Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent presidents' jobs performance,"" said moderator Gerard Baker to Carly Fiorina. ""In seven years under President Obama, the U.S. has added an average of 107,000 jobs per month. Under Clinton, the economy added about 240,000 per month; under George W. Bush, it was only 13,000 a month. If you win the nomination, you will probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton. How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans?"" Fiorina dodged the question. She didn't have an answer. And neither did anyone else on the stage. Later, moderator Maria Bartiromo threw Rubio a softball on Hillary Clinton. ""Why should the American people trust you to lead this country even though she has been so much closer to the office?"" His answer was smooth--""[I]f I am our nominee, they'll be the party of the past""--but it ignored this basic question of economic performance. This is a problem. Barring disaster, President Obama will finish his term with a growing economy. Republicans need to show Americans that they can do better--that they can deliver growth and resources to the people who need them. Otherwise, little else matters. The Democratic nominee will inherit the Obama economy and prevail.

""I have always said that I expect to be vetted. But being vetted and what is going on with me--'You said this 30 years ago, you said this 20 years ago, this didn't exist, this didn't'--you know, I just, I have not seen that with anyone else,"" said Carson in an interview with NBC's Chris Jansing. It's easy to understand his frustration. In the past week, journalists have begun to make more and deeper inquiries about his background, which has led to a few uncomfortable questions for the former neurosurgeon. Did Carson actually try to stab a friend as a teenager, a key story for the redemption narrative in his book? Did he reject a scholarship to West Point, like he says in his book? Was he really rewarded for honesty as a student at Yale? For Carson, these questions are all clear evidence of liberal media bias. His evidence? President Obama. ""I do not remember this level of scrutiny for one President Barack Obama when he was running,"" he said during a press conference on Friday. ""In fact, I remember just the opposite."" Carson wasn't alone with this thought. ""The collective goal of the liberal media is now clear,"" wrote David French for National Review, ""to take one of America's most admired and brilliant men and somehow transform him into a dishonest, stupid extremist."" French continued his indictment: ""A 'high-tech lynching' is again underway,"" he said. Other conservatives were similarly empathetic. ""Media scrutinize GOP with passion,"" said columnist Jonah Goldberg on Twitter. ""Scrutinize Dems with grudging sense of duty, if at all. Big difference."" Likewise, said conservative commentator Michelle Malkin in reference to Carson and Obama, ""The double standards here are as glaring as a supernova."" For the most part, this is typical. Conservatives share a deep belief in liberal media bias, and specifically, the idea that the press is unfair to Republican candidates. Indeed, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's rant against this alleged bias at the previous Republican presidential debate earned him huge applause and praise from the crowd. Carson has used this rhetoric throughout his campaign, so it's no surprise he's deployed it after a week of questions and criticism. At the same time, he and other conservatives are also making a specific claim--that Obama wasn't ""vetted"" by the press, or at least that he had a gentler time. The nice thing is that we can check this; we can dig through the archives and see how Obama was treated in his campaign for the Democratic nomination. And what do you find when you check the record? That Carson, and his conservative defenders, are wrong. Let's take the most explosive stories of Obama's first campaign for president: his relationships with Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayers, and fundraiser Antoin Rezko. Historian Kevin Kruse searches the New York Times alone, from mid-2007 to the end of the election in November 2008, and finds 138 stories that refer to Obama and Wright, 78 that refer to Obama and Ayers, and 38 that refer to Obama and Rezko. NBC News did a similar search with similar results, finding a combined 206 Times and Washington Post stories that centered on--or referred to--either Obama and Wright or Obama and Ayers. And more recently, there's been a torrent of stories on Hillary Clinton's email practices, including major pieces at the Times and the Post. Likewise, throughout the campaign, there were stories on Obama's drug use as a student, on his time as a community organizer in Chicago, and on his birth certificate. By the time he won the Democratic nomination, Americans knew a lot about Obama's life and views. If there were serious questions, they came from the fever swamps of the online right, where Obama was an unqualified affirmative action student who was mentored by radicals and enlisted as a Manchurian candidate devoted to America's downfall. Which raises a question: What do conservatives mean when they say Obama wasn't scrutinized or vetted? It could be partisanship; they don't like Obama, so they can't imagine that there's nothing truly negative or damaging in his past. Or, it could just be that--despite the digging and the questions--Americans elected Obama anyway. The public saw Jeremah Wright and learned about Bill Ayers and decided--when it was time to vote--that Obama deserved a shot at the White House. Four years later, to the dismay of many conservatives, they made that choice again. The truth is that, compared with Obama, it's the press-averse Carson who needs to take more questions about his past and his policies. And in this upcoming presidential debate, hosted by Fox Business, he'll at least have to face them. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/marco_rubio_is_being_attacked_on_all_sides_the_florida_senator_is_considered.html	"Good news for Sen. Marco Rubio: The dastardly liberal mainstream media, which you so profess to despise when it asks pointed questions about your tax plan, has determined that you are the man to beat for the Republican presidential nomination. Since the media is always correct in its political prognostications, we might as well give you the nomination now to spare the Republican Party the costs associated with a lengthy primary process. Can we do that? No ... I'm hearing that no, we cannot do that. You're going to have to go through the motions after all. And that's going to be a decidedly not-fun process for Rubio. Prepare yourself, (relatively) young man, for the big squeeze: shots from both your rivals in the ""establishment"" lane and your down-the-road competitors in the conservative lane. On top of that, the worst smear a prospective Republican nominee can face: bear hugs from leading Democratic officials. Remember Jeb Bush? Dad was president, brother too, now he wants the gig, lots of money? He still thinks he can win the nomination, but first he has to win back his own lane from his fellow Floridian. The way that's achieved, theoretically, is not through Bush himself. (He's not good at that. He's really bad at it. Dear God, Jeb: If you try to clumsily attack Rubio face to face again in tonight's debate, you should drop out yesterday.) It's through his famous $100 million super PAC that famously doesn't spend anything to prop up its lousy candidate. That's going to change soon. Mike Murphy, head of Bush's Right to Rise super PAC, ""has privately said to several people that Right to Rise would be ready to devote up to $20 million to fighting Mr. Rubio,"" the New York Times reports, helpfully cluing in the official Bush campaign to its strategy. And what are the particulars of this killing? As something of an amuse-bouche, Right to Rise ""has filmed a provocative video casting his rival Marco Rubio as ultimately unelectable because of his hard-line stand against abortion."" Murphy is aware that this is a Republican primary, no? What else? ""That group, which has raised more than $100 million, has asked voters in New Hampshire how they feel about Mr. Rubio's skipping important votes in the Senate."" Not exactly a deathblow. In any case, expect Right to Rise to get its act together soon enough and air all sorts of whispery #content about how Rubio murdered half of Fort Lauderdale with steak knives while he was on a synthetic-pot bender. Speaking of this very same Rubio who doesn't allow any emergency exceptions to his pro-life stance and, according to Heritage Action's ""scorecard,"" is the fifth-most conservative senator with a 93 percent rating: He's actually ""moderate."" Did you know that? Perhaps he would be in comparison with the one who's launched that ""attack"": Sen. Ted Cruz, the conservative teacher's pet whom Heritage rates at 100 percent. Cruz is paired alongside Rubio in the conventional wisdom machine's latest project of which two candidates the race will come down to. Though Rubio will first have to dispatch Bush, Gov. Chris Christie, and Gov. John Kasich, and Cruz will have to gently persuade voters that Ben Carson and Donald Trump are obviously and ridiculously unqualified to be president, the CW here seems to be well-grounded. Cruz isn't going hard after Rubio just yet, though he is laying the groundwork. ""Cruz and his allies have begun zeroing in on Rubio,"" BloombergPolitics reports. Like Bush, Cruz will likely outsource to his super PACs the rumors about how Rubio hides his 97 illegitimate children under the stands of the Daytona International Speedway. What Cruz himself will do, though, is call Rubio the single worst word in the Republican primary lexicon. ""As I look at the race,"" Cruz, per BloombergPolitics, said on CNN last week, ""historically, there have been two major lanes in the Republican primary. There's been a moderate lane and a conservative lane. ... I think the Jeb campaign seems to view Marco as his biggest threat in the moderate lane."" This is an accurate summation of the race, though moderate is hardly the word Rubio wants to have thrown in his direction. Responsible or palatable or general election-ready lane is more like it. Not moderate. Anything but that. It's still amazing to witness what support for a center-right comprehensive immigration reform bill that would have doubled the number of patrol agents on the southern border does to one's conservative branding. Moderate or not, that's how Rubio's being defined, and that terrifies the Democratic Party. Exhibit A in that regard is the roughly 50 million ALERT and BACKGROUND and HE SAID WHAT? emails sent from Democratic communications groups to every political reporter over the last few weeks. It's all very ham-handed. At least figures like Sen. Chuck Schumer, Senate Democrats' leader-in-waiting, understand that the best way to damn Rubio's ability to capture the nomination is to say marvelous things about him and his masterful work in drafting the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. Schumer, appearing on CNN late last week, couldn't stop gushing about the value Rubio brought to the Gang of Eight. ""He was not only totally committed--he was in that room with us, four Democrats, four Republicans,"" Schumer said. ""His fingerprints are all over that bill. It has a lot of Rubio imprints."" My goodness, did he ever write a great amnesty bill, just loaded with one amnesty after another amnesty. ""He understood it, he molded it, he made it a tough path to citizenship,"" Schumer went on about Rubio's absolute love of amnesty. ""But we all agreed to it, and it would have to be a tough path to citizenship. But he was all for it."" For the amnesty, he means. Rubio was ""all for"" the amnesty. It is his favorite thing, amnesty. It's about to get real, Marco."	Marco Rubio Is Now Everyone's Favorite Target

Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton. I only learned of this a few days beforehand, and it is my job to keep abreast of events such as this. Even if you did know, you probably didn't watch, because it was on Friday night and you, the gregarious Slate reader-about-town, have all sorts of better things to do. You also may not be aware that the same three candidates will be debating this Saturday night. Nope, not some dopey forum or cattle call or ""day-dinner"" type thing: an actual real life pres-ee-dential debate, one of the six sanctioned by the DNC. On Saturday night, just as the college football season is coming down the stretch, and people who aren't watching college football are out doing things like enjoying themselves with friends and family. The third Democratic debate will take place on the evening of Dec. 19, also a Saturday. The fourth debate will be on a Sunday during the NFL playoffs, and it will be the final debate before nominating contests begin. It's not new information that the Democratic primary debate schedule is both thin and designed to keep the number of human viewers to a minimum. Non-Hillary Clinton candidates like O'Malley and Sanders have been complaining about this, reasonably enough, for months. It's sparked a public feud among leaders of the DNC--or, more likely, caused a long-existing rage with Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's mysteriously lengthy tenure atop the DNC to burst into the open. Let's play sucker and try to make a good-faith defense of Wasserman Schultz's stewardship of the 2016 primary process. Her job is to ensure both a fair primary process and the general election viability of the eventual Democratic nominee. Since Clinton will almost certainly become that nominee, then, Wasserman Schultz's job is to protect Clinton. That's why there are only six debates, and why three of the four debates are scheduled for time slots when few will be watching: It prevents Clinton from being nicked up too much by Sanders and O'Malley, or from saying something that may not play well to a more centrist general election audience. To Wasserman Schultz's credit, the Clinton campaign reportedly requested that there be only four debates, and she tossed in a couple more. While perhaps made with the party's best interests in mind, Wasserman Schultz's theory has not just led to some nasty fighting in the public eye. It's also made the task of winning the general election more difficult for Clinton. First of all: Did anyone come away from the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas with the impression that such a setting threatens Clinton? Her debate performance gave her campaign the sort of life that it hadn't seen since she made her run official in April. The debate allowed her to show off her strongest suit--her sharp comprehension of public policy--to the point that it made some reluctant Democrats excited about supporting this person for whom they were otherwise merely content to pull the lever when required. Assuming Democrats even bother showing up to vote next November. That's the bigger problem with the DNC strategy of limited debates and focusing instead on the heresies of the Republican candidates: Democrats aren't nearly as interested in the election as Republicans are. A new survey conducted by the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner demonstrates the enthusiasm gap. It polls likely voters across four Senate battleground states--Colorado, Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin--of which three are also critical presidential battlegrounds. (Wisconsin isn't a state that Democrats can take for granted, either.) Though GQR finds that demographic changes aid Democrats in these states, it does not find a whole lot of enthusiasm among the new national Democratic coalition of minorities, young people, and unmarried women. As the Washington Post's Greg Sargent points out, one question asks voters how interested they are in the November 2016 election on a 1 to 10 scale. Among those who answered 10, the leading demographic affiliations are: seniors, overall ""non-RAE"" (the Rising American Electorate, meaning unmarried women, young people, and minorities), conservatives, Republicans, and white non-college men. These are, as Sen. Ted Cruz would describe them, ""rock-ribbed conservative"" demographics. The demographic groups with the fewest ""extremely interested"" members are overall ""RAE,"" millennials, and at the very bottom, white millennials, offering further proof that white millennials are the worst people ever created. You need to have your own people be excited--and not just excited about defeating the opposition, which seems to be what Wasserman Schultz plows most of her resources into doing. Your party's voters have to be excited about your party's candidate. And if that candidate's worth getting excited about, there shouldn't be any hesitancy about exposing her to the public as much as possible, instead of hiding her few mass public appearances behind weekend football games. It's hard to overstate just how much is on the line for the Democratic Party in getting its ""Rising American Electorate"" numbers up. It was enthusiasm and turnout among these groups that pushed President Obama to two Electoral College victories--and, in turn, reoriented the Democratic Party to cater to these demographics, who then didn't show up in nearly as strong numbers when Obama wasn't on the ballot. The Big Question of 2016 Politics, ever since it became clear that Clinton would pursue a strategy tailored to retaining the Obama coalition, has been whether Clinton could turn out these groups in similar numbers. If she can't, then the 2016 election will look less like the 2008 and 2012 ones and more like the 2010 and 2014 ones. Meaning: the Democratic Party will be almost completely wiped out of American political leadership above the municipal level. No pressure."	Democrats Just Can't Muster That Much Enthusiasm for 2016

""As your governor, I will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of Alabama in harm's way."" He's not alone. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder reached the same decision Sunday. Other Republican governors in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Illinois, and Indiana have followed suit. I fully expect more governors will make similar announcements before this article is published. Republican presidential candidates are now stumbling over one another to take the toughest stance against the prospect of Syrian refugees resettling in the United States, which is just another way of saying that they are trying to echo what Donald Trump has already said. But let's stick with Bentley since he was one of the trailblazers of what is quickly becoming a consensus position for members of the Republican party. It isn't surprising that Bentley would quickly choose to take a Fortress Alabama approach to people who aren't actually from the Heart of Dixie. He did, after all, sign an anti-immigration law in 2011 that many considered even more stringent than the similar ""show me your papers"" law in Arizona, which required police offers to detain anyone they suspected of being an illegal immigrant if the person couldn't produce proper documentation. (Bentley's twist is that schools have to determine the citizenship status of students, too.) But if Bentley thinks his insight into combating the inflow of Hispanic workers can easily transfer to the world of terrorism, he is wrong. There is no evidence that ISIS is engaged in a massive effort to smuggle jihadis into Syria's refugee flows. (Yes, it appears one of the Paris killers embedded himself in the torrent of refugees flowing into Europe, but the continent has hundreds of thousands arriving on its shores, and French intelligence services are stretched thin.) ISIS is working around the clock to get young, nihilistic recruits to move to Syria, not fan out across the globe. As Daniel Byman has pointed out, ISIS has denounced those who choose to leave its territory as committing ""a dangerous major sin."" That's why Hoda Muthana, a 20-year-old Alabama native and University of Alabama at Birmingham student, fled to Syria to join ISIS last year. If the jihadi group wanted a sleeper cell in Birmingham, it wouldn't have needed Muthana to pack her bags. In his statement, Bentley admits that no Syrian refugees have settled in Alabama and that there are no current threats to his state. But suppose ISIS' tactics just changed. That in response to the military campaign launched against it, the terrorist group has decided to use the Syrian humanitarian tragedy as a means to funnel jihadis to Alabama or other U.S. states. It takes anywhere from 18-24 months for a Syrian refugee to be cleared to live in the United States. First he or she must be registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. This agency interviews refugees, conducts background checks, takes their biometric data, and establishes whether they belong to one of roughly 45 ""categories of concern"" given their past lives and work history in Syria. Typically, the applicants are women and children. If anything looks amiss, they are pulled from consideration. Then the U.S. government begins its own vetting. The applicants are interviewed again, and their names and particulars are run through terrorism databases. They receive additional screening when they arrive in the United States and then again after their first year in the country. This process has led to slightly more than 1,800 Syrians being admitted to the United States since 2011. None of them has landed in Alabama, but if that ever did happen, no one will ever have gone through a more painstaking and extensive vetting process where the reward was to live in Alabama. There is another way to look at this: There may be no more difficult way for a would-be terrorist to enter the United States than to pose as a Syrian refugee. And if that was true last week, it is exponentially more difficult after the Paris attacks. If ISIS is looking to smuggle its operatives into the United States, there are far more effective ways to do so. Then again, maybe everyone is missing the compassion hidden in Bentley's desire to refuse Syrians admission to his state. According to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Alabama has the second-worst quality of life in the United States. It has the ""fifth lowest employment rate, the eighth highest homicide rate, and the tenth lowest household disposable income rate in the nation."" The Institute for Women's Policy Research says Alabama is tied for the worst place for women to live. (More than 31 percent of women there work in low-wage jobs.) Alabama has high poverty and low life expectancy. Alabama poses a greater risk to Syrian refugees than those refugees pose to Alabama. Syrian refugees are fleeing murder, rape, torture, barrel bombs, and chemical weapon attacks. Maybe they deserve something better than a state that has failed across almost every measure of government competence. While Bentley and other governors simplistically contend to be acting in the best interests of their citizens, they have done nothing of the kind. Instead, they have handed ISIS an unexpected victory. ISIS wants Muslims to feel scorned, scared, and stigmatized. ISIS understands that alienated and aggrieved populations are the easiest to further radicalize. Bentley hasn't only failed to make his citizens safer; he has given ISIS recruiters their newest talking point. Syrians have risked everything to escape a murderous regime and the Islamic fanatics marauding across these lands. There may be no people who cling to life more than Syrian refugees, entire families who have boarded rafts and trekked thousands of miles to avoid certain death. Alabama would be lucky to have such people. But instead they are stuck with Bentley. Read more of Slate's coverage of the Paris attacks."

Clinton thought Gore should embrace the Clinton record. Gore disagreed. Gore banked on populist anger, ran on a platform of change, and lost to George W. Bush. In Saturday's Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Clinton made clear that she's not going to repeat Gore's mistake. She's going to hug Barack Obama all the way to the Democratic nomination and beyond. Here are six moments in which she telegraphed her loyalty. 1. The debate's moderator, Slate's John Dickerson, began by asking Clinton whether Obama and his administration underestimated ISIS. In light of Friday's terrorist attacks on Paris, Clinton could have pointed out that she, unlike Obama, favored a no-fly zone in Syria. Instead, she replied: ""What the president has consistently said, which I agree with, is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS. That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive."" 2. Dickerson asked Clinton whether, in her former role as a senator, she would have accepted the president launching military action against ISIS without specific congressional authorization. The question gave her an opportunity to part company with Obama, who, according to Republicans, has done just that. Instead, she replied as though she were a spokeswoman for the administration. To secure authorization, she said, ""I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress."" 3. When Clinton was asked why health insurance deductibles have risen under Obamacare, she leapt to the president's defense. ""We've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act,"" she said. ""And it was not only a great accomplishment to the Democratic Party, but of President Obama."" Later, after Bernie Sanders argued that the country should switch to a single-payer system, Clinton retorted: ""We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats. ... We ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be."" 4. Clinton was asked about Obama's executive orders that would extend work permits and partial legal status to undocumented immigrants. The orders, which have been blocked by courts, are a huge source of controversy about presidential overreach. Clinton responded by defending not just the policy, but Obama's circumvention of Congress. ""The president has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court,"" she noted. ""And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the president has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents."" 5. A questioner pointed out that the former chairman of Obama's council of economic advisers, Alan Krueger, had warned of possible job losses if the minimum wage were raised to $15 per hour, as many Democrats have proposed. Clinton could have embraced the popular $15 figure, as Sanders has. Instead, she defended Krueger. ""I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously. He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage,"" she argued. ""What Alan Krueger said ... is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons. That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage."" 6. Late in the debate, Sanders said the candidates should focus on ""why the middle class is disappearing ... why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave."" Clinton, in response, thanked Sanders for ""lighting a fire"" on the left, but she added: ""President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists."" Why is Clinton embracing Obama so unapologetically? She has several good reasons. One is that on economic policy, immigration, and the use of force, Obama has governed as a prudent centrist, and Clinton shares that sensibility. Another reason is that Democratic presidents have a better record of job growth than Republicans do, and Clinton intends to make that a major campaign theme. A third reason is that Gore's strategy failed, so she might as well try the opposite. But the biggest reason might be that Clinton is a woman. She doesn't need to manufacture or exaggerate differences with Obama, because she'd be the first female president, and that distinguishes her not just from her old boss, but also from her husband and every other president. And she's betting that anyone who belittles her as Obama's clone will look like a sexist. As she often puts it: ""I'm not running for my husband's third term. I'm not running for President Obama's third term. I'm running for my first term."" This is what Republicans wanted. All year, they've been trying to tie Clinton to Obama. It looks like she's going to give them what they wanted. They may regret it. Read more of Slate's coverage of the Democratic primary."	Why Clinton Is Hugging Obama So Hard

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/trump_insults_carson_fiorina_and_the_people_of_iowa.html	"Donald Trump isn't running for president to make friends, and on Thursday, he made that crystal clear. In a 95-minute speech--the Washington Post called it a ""rant""--the real estate mogul went on a tear against his opponents. He called rival Carly Fiorina ""Carly whatever-the-hell-her-name is"" and mocked Marco Rubio as ""weak like a baby."" He saved his harshest attacks for Ben Carson, who leads him in the Iowa Republican caucus. Carson, in Trump's telling, ""has a pathological disease,"" like a child molester. ""A child molester, there's no cure for that,"" Trump said. ""If you're a child molester, there's no cure. They can't stop you. Pathological? There's no cure,"" continued Trump, in reference to Carson's autobiography, where the former neurosurgeon wrote that as a young man he had a ""pathological temper,"" which led to violence, including trying to stab a friend. Even the audience wasn't safe. ""How stupid are the people of Iowa?"" he asked the crowd in Fort Dodge, Iowa. ""How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?"" Trump is incredulous at Carson's popularity with Republican voters and just can't believe that the former doctor is ahead of him, and he's lashing out in a way that almost works as performance art. It was an angry, bitter showing that, according to press accounts, left the crowd uncomfortable. ""As Trump attacked Carson using deeply personal language, the audience grew quiet, a few shaking their heads,"" wrote Jenna Johnson for the Post. ""A man sitting in the back of the auditorium loudly gasped."" For months, reporters and observers (like myself) have been waiting for the moment when Trump would collapse and wondering what it would take for him to recede from view. Some thought it would be his attacks on John McCain. (""I like people who weren't captured."") Others, his bad night at the second Republican presidential debate. But each time, Trump doesn't just endure, he excels. He still sits at the top of the Republican presidential race, with only a modest decline from where he was at the end of the summer. But this fight with Ben Carson is different. Carson isn't merely popular with Republican voters; he's beloved. And that's especially true in Iowa: 84 percent of Iowa Republicans have a favorable view of the retired neurosurgeon. Carson's response to Trump is instructive. Rather than condemn or attack him, Carson was compassionate. ""When I spoke with Dr. Carson about this yesterday how we should respond, you know he was so sad about it. He said: 'Pray for him,' "" explained Carson advisor Armstrong Williams. ""He feels sorry for him because he really likes Mr. Trump,"" he continued. Trump-friendly Republican voters might tolerate (or even delight in) attacks on figures like Rubio and Jeb Bush--mainstream politicians who in their eyes represent an untrustworthy establishment. But it's hard to think they'll feel the same about Trump's tirade against Carson. In which case, will Trump finally begin to suffer, pulled down by the weight of his disdain? The kind of candidate who rants against his opponents in long denunciations is, typically, not the kind of candidate who wins. Or will Trump give up, frustrated by the challenge of the presidential trail and the inexplicable (to him) popularity of a man with a sometimes unbelievable biography? ""If I did the stuff he said he did, I wouldn't be here right now. It would have been over. It would have been over. It would have been totally over,"" Trump said. ""And that's who's in second place. And I don't get it."" Then again, for as much as Trump has soared on celebrity, manufactured conflict, and the most frivolous aspects of American politics, he also speaks to real anxieties in the Republican Party. And more than anyone in the race, he speaks openly. He does not hide the fact that he wants to deport Latino immigrants and punish our foreign competitors. He lets people embrace their fear and their anger, and they support him in return. If that's a strong connection--if Trump has a real, durable constituency--then we haven't turned a corner and we aren't in a post-Trump world. We are where we were before the rant, where Trump is a dominant figure. Our models of politics say this shouldn't happen. But what the polls are telling us--what they've been telling us--is that the leaders in the Republican race aren't Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz; they're Donald Trump and Ben Carson. And given the degree to which this polling has been stable since the summer, I'm willing to say that they have a real chance in the primary. It's a bit crazy, yes, but here we are.

19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/republican_establishment_is_nervous_about_donald_trump_and_ben_carson_some.html	"The Republican establishment is getting quite antsy. For some reason, the rubes refuse to fall in line. The Washington Post reports on the ""growing anxiety bordering on panic among Republican elites about the dominance and durability of Donald Trump and Ben Carson."" These ""leaders and donors"" fear, quite reasonably, that the nomination of either outsider would not just secure Democrats a third consecutive presidential election victory, but also hamstring Republicans' ability to retain the Senate and possibly the House. And they no longer have the time of day for those smart-set types who insist that the laws of political gravity will take care of the Trump and Carson problem in the end. Former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean Sr., an establishmentarian's establishmentarian, openly frets about how the people who serve him refuse to get over this Trump funny business. ""[GOP power brokers] assure me that Trump and Carson will eventually fade,"" Kean tells the Post. ""Then we'll talk some more, and I give them a reality check. I'll say, 'The guy in the grocery store likes Trump. So does the guy who cuts my hair. They're probably going to stick with him. Who knows if this ends?' "" Ah, one longs for the good old days, when elites could resolve their problems with the working class by summoning the Pinkertons or exercising the cat o' nine tails. If Trump and Carson won't dispatch themselves, hard as they may try, then who will? Some GOP elites believe they've found the answer. Like most times GOP grandees believe they've found a silver bullet--e.g. Let's give Jeb Bush $100 million upfront!--it is delusional. ""According to other Republicans, some in the party establishment are so desperate to change the dynamic that they are talking anew about drafting [Mitt] Romney--despite his insistence that he will not run again,"" the Post reports. ""Friends have mapped out a strategy for a late entry to pick up delegates and vie for the nomination in a convention fight, according to the Republicans who were briefed on the talks, though Romney has shown no indication of reviving his interest."" Oh, sure, these Romney trial balloons keep popping up, but Romney himself must have absolutely no interest. What a coincidence that, just as the establishment begins to gravitate toward Sen. Marco Rubio, the Romney people step in to say that the field is in disarray and only Romney can save it. It's almost like, just as the establishment appears to be moving beyond Romney, Romney's ""loyalists"" step in to reassure them that only Mittens can save the party. The man still wants to be president, and he wants to be drafted. How, precisely, does Mitt Romney solve the establishment's Trump and Carson problem? Though Romney, like all politicians, looks better in retrospect now that he's exited politics, the same flaws he faced last time--his cultural disconnect with the base of the party, his stiffness, his patrician demeanor and background--would reassert themselves the second he entered. But sure, he seems like a nice guy otherwise. The problem is not with the candidates. Rubio, like Romney in 2012, is broadly acceptable policywise to enough of the party's key factions to win a majority of delegates. Romney was a talented debater; Rubio is an excellent debater. Rubio is not easily caricaturized as a plutocrat, and he does not have a business record that included firing thousands of workers to crank up shareholder value. Rubio is also Hispanic and hails from a critical swing state. It's not clear how far that would get him as the nominee for a party that has torched its relationship with Hispanics, but it would probably get him further than Romney. The antsy establishment won't like to hear this, but its best bet is just to keep faith that those laws of political gravity assert themselves and Trump and Carson collapse. Quick looks at Carson's biography have already produced plenty of questions about his relationship with the truth, and he cannot speak about major public policy issues with any coherence. Trump, meanwhile, appears to be in full The Producers mode right now, trying desperately to savage his own campaign and return to managing his real estate empire. He is asking why Iowans are so ""stupid""--in Iowa! Maybe that'll do him in? More likely, it will somehow shoot him up to 50 percent in the first caucus state. The poor guy looks exhausted. What does he have to do to lose this thing? He, too, has to rely on political gravity--that the nearer the calendar comes to actual voting, all those grocers and barbers who take care of Tom Kean Sr. will snap out of it. It's worth asking these elites why they're so surprised that they haven't been able to work their will this cycle. They've spent the past seven years funding and feeding off of whatever rage exists on the right in order to stop President Obama's legislative agenda and to win low-turnout midterm election cycles. What's funnier? How they're stunned that the rabble no longer responds to them, or that some of them believe Mitt Romney is the answer? See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/marco_rubio_and_ted_cruz_fight_over_immigration_the_two_senators_are_trying.html	"On Tuesday, at the Republican presidential debate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took his first steps toward hitting his chief ""establishment"" rival, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, on immigration. ""For those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally and we should enforce the law, we're tired of being told it is anti-immigrant,"" said Cruz. ""Every sovereign nation secures its borders, and it is not compassionate to say we're not going to enforce the laws and we're going to drive down the wages for millions of hard-working men and women."" The next day, campaigning in New Hampshire, Cruz went even further, finally taking a direct swing at Rubio and others who have supported immigration reform. ""Last night, you listened to one Republican after another who said, 'Gosh, it would be mean to enforce our immigration laws,' "" said Cruz at a Veterans Day town hall in Kingston. He continued: ""And I would point out, by the way, everyone talks about how compassionate it is to grant amnesty to 12 million people here illegally. ... They're very compassionate, but it's not very compassionate if I say, 'I'm going to give away your job.' That's the opposite of compassion."" Cruz is staking his attack on Rubio's role in crafting and shepharding the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill in 2013. That bill--crafted by Sens. Michael Bennet, Richard Durbin, Jeff Flake, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Bob Menendez, Chuck Schumer, and Rubio--was in line with President Obama's ""principles"" on comprehensive immigration reform, with calls for more border security, a pathway to citizenship, stronger employee verification measures, and fixes for the legal immigration system. There were differences--the Senate bill had a longer path to citizenship that was contingent on more and greater border security--but overall it had Obama's support. Grassroots conservatives, however, hated the bill, and by the end of the year, Rubio had abandoned the push for comprehensive immigration reform on procedural grounds. ""At this point, the most realistic way to make progress on immigration would be through a series of individual bills,"" said Rubio spokesperson Alex Conant that October. Cruz hopes that conservatives will remember Rubio's role in ""amnesty"" and punish him accordingly. ""He opposed every single one of them. Every single amendment,"" said Cruz in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham referring to amendments for border security in the Gang of Eight bill. ""It's not like people were quiet in sharing their concerns at the time."" But Rubio has an answer for this: We're not so different, you and I. ""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally,"" said Rubio on Thursday. ""In fact, when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed giving them work permits. He's also supported a massive expansion of the green cards. He's supported a massive expansion of the [H-1B] program, a 500 percent increase."" Rubio continued: ""If you look at it, I don't believe our positions are dramatically different."" There's more. As a domestic policy advisor to George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential campaign, Cruz helped the then-Texas governor craft an immigration policy in line with Bush's ""compassionate conservatism"" and his declaration that ""family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River."" To that point, the Bush plan called for a fast application process, more work visas, and new rules allowing relatives of permanent residents to visit the United States while their applications were pending. With that said, Cruz has wiggle room. During the campaign, Bush stated his opposition to ""blanket amnesty"" and citizenship wasn't a part of his policy package. More importantly, by the time President Bush embraced comprehensive reform, Cruz had left the administration. He had no part in Bush's plan. What's more--while Cruz was open to a form of legalization--it's also true that his amendment to the Gang of Eight bill precluded citizenship for anyone who received legal status after entering the country illegally. He's also begun to walk back his statements on expanding the H1-B visa program. Cruz may not be as anti-amnesty as he says, but he's still a hardliner with a broadly restrictionist approach for immigration policy. He opposes the president's deferred action and has pledged to end all of Obama's executive actions. By contrast, Rubio is still open to a path to legalization--albeit very long--and won't say when he'll end the president's program for ""DREAMers."" And there's still the problem of the Gang of Eight bill. Rubio wasn't just an architect and a supporter, he was an advocate. ""We just have to get this thing done for once and for all,"" he told the New York Times that January. Before it was clear he was on the wrong side of grassroots Republicans, he slammed the Heritage Foundation for its analysis of the bill and urged conservatives to embrace the Senate proposal. Rubio wants to muddy the waters to avoid Cruz's attack. But his record is too deep. That Cruz was in favor of legalization for some immigrants doesn't erase Rubio's history with comprehensive reform and what conservatives label ""amnesty."" Given grassroots hostility to immigration, this gives Cruz the advantage. And judging from his campaign so far, I expect the Texas senator to press it."

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/a_philosophy_professor_responds_to_marco_rubio_the_florida_senator_thinks.html	"Dear Sen. Marco Rubio, I'm writing to you instead of grading papers, because the only thing more tedious than grading, as any philosophy and religion professor will tell you, is finishing the dissertation that earned you the privilege. I'm also writing this instead of working on a ludicrously specialized article that examines Grimms' fairy tales--actually one fairy tale, Lucky Hans; indeed, importantly, Lucky Hans can be translated as Happy Hans because ... screw it, anyone interested can just read the article if it ever comes out--I'm writing this instead of working on an article that only 10 people will see, reviewers included. So yes, indeed, a lot of academia is useless bullshit. (Indeed, I've used indeed three times already. Academic writing is the best.) You made that clear in the fourth Republican presidential debate when you said that America needs ""more welders and less philosophers"" and complained that higher education is ""outdated"" and ""doesn't teach 21st-century skills."" I should just quit and live the good life, like my attorney, doctor, and investment banker classmates from college and graduate school (Stanford and the University of Chicago--what a colossal waste, right?) who defend innocents, save lives, and make tons of money and donate said money to all the causes I'd donate to if I weren't wasting my education on a low-paying joke of a job. Maybe I should even become a politician, Mr. Rubio--surely our nation needs more of those? But I won't quit. I'd never quit. This job is awesome. Investment bankers would be lucky to have it. In fact, after this comes out and goes viral, droves of them will retire, seek jobs as adjunct philosophy professors, and the economy will improve slightly. I won't quit because my colleagues and I are part of a sacred order, bound to seek out and profess truth, no matter how complicated or unappealing that truth might be. The truth about evolution, for example--and why people like you, Sen. Rubio, seem incapable of believing in it. I won't quit because there's no feeling like the one I get when a student says my class has changed his or her life. It's as if I've performed alchemy or magic: With nothing more than a powerful set of symbols (and a PowerPoint), I can, on occasion, alter the very fabric of people's reality. It's like church, but for everyone. Like any sacred order, academia suffers from the standard list of problems: corruption, superficiality, conservatism (of the generic, not political, kind), cumbersome bureaucracy, perpetual underfunding, self-doubt. But I'm pretty damn sure the self-doubt is unwarranted, even in the case of the ever-beleaguered humanities. Because any student who has had the pleasure of taking a philosophy class knows that debating the merits of the humanities--debating the merits of anything, really--is itself a humanistic endeavor, and we ignore the rigorous study of proper argumentation at our own peril. Maybe you just don't care. Having watched the presidential debates, I think it's safe to say that proper argumentation isn't the highest value for you and your colleagues. In fact, humanities professors like me work against many of your core values. Explaining the origin and persistence of creationist pseudoscience? Religion and philosophy. Shutting down racists and sexists who explain discrimination with ""natural differences""? Anthropology and history. We can't take all the credit, of course, but the fact that the arc of history seems to bend toward justice is due, at least in part, to the efforts of humanities scholars. Sen. Rubio, rants like yours about the uselessness of academe can be disheartening. (Same goes for you, President Obama, when you ignore the humanities and call only for more STEM education.) But if there's anything we academics are able to do, it's to recognize that these rants are poorly argued and lacking in evidence. Often they are the self-congratulatory blather of those whose success is predicated--in more and less obvious ways--on the existence of higher education, but who in hindsight credit that success solely to innate ability. In short, the rants are stupid, and a key part of my job is identifying and fighting the stupid wherever it is found. So I won't quit, even in the face of your derogatory comments. I won't quit because without the institution for which I stand, history would be twisted and forgotten, arguments would devolve into shouting, and truth would lose its professional evangelists. Since I am certain of all this, I cherish my place in the ivory tower--which, contrary to popular belief, is located smack in the middle of the real world, where it continues its ancient mission of making that world a better, wiser place. Can you say the same of your own mission, Sen. Rubio? Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	A Philosophy Professor's Response to Sen. Marco Rubio
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/military_spending_the_case_for_spending_more_not_less.html	"At Tuesday's GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee, Rand Paul railed against Marco Rubio for calling for increases to the military budget: ""How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures? You can not be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting programs that you're not paying for."" Rubio replied by arguing that ""we can't even have an economy if we're not safe,"" and that ""the world is a safer place when America is the strongest military power in the world."" This brief exchange captures a debate that's been dividing America's political class for years. Paul is standing in for those, on the left and the right, who believe that the time has come for the U.S. to stop pretending it can be the world's policeman, and to start shifting money from our military to needs closer to home. Rubio speaks for those in both parties who see U.S. global leadership as more important than ever, and who worry about the erosion of U.S. military power. Both sides make compelling arguments. But in the end, Rubio is right. The United States does not spend enough on its military, and the longer we go without increasing military expenditures, the more dangerous the world is likely to become. Granted, Rand Paul makes a fair point about at least one thing. The U.S. defense budget is already quite large. In 2015, the U.S. spent $610 billion on the military, making its defense budget the largest in the world by a wide margin. The U.S. spent more on defense than the $601 billion that China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Britain, and India--the countries with the next seven largest military budgets--spent combined. If we limit our comparison to America's NATO allies, the numbers still look quite stark. The U.S. alone accounts for a whopping 75 percent of the military spending by all of NATO's 28 current members. Under the two-year budget agreement that the Obama administration hammered out with the Republican leadership in Congress, baseline defense spending will be $548 billion while spending on Overseas Contingency Operations will be $59 billion, for a grand total of $607 billion. That's hardly chump change. But it's not enough. Keep in mind that backing a larger, more formidable military is not the same thing as backing a more hyperactive military. Because our military has been so formidable for so long, there are instances in which U.S. policymakers have resorted to using force when other tools of statecraft might have been just as effective, and at lower cost. Over-relying on military force can have terrible consequences, especially when we don't have a clear understanding of what we're using military force to achieve. The point of investing in a more capable military is not to topple foreign governments at the drop of a hat, or to recklessly enmesh U.S. forces in conflicts that will have no meaningful impact on U.S. national interests. To understand how much we ought to spend on the military, we first need to get a handle on what exactly we want our military to be capable of doing. There is a large and growing gap between what we expect of our military and what it can realistically accomplish, given the resource constraints it faces. Many Americans believe that what we really ought to do is lower our expectations for what our military should be able to accomplish, which in turn would allow the U.S. to spend less. Yet many of the expensive things that the U.S. military does are necessary if we are to live in a more peaceful world--and that is why the U.S. must spend more. What do we expect of our military? First and foremost, it is the job of the U.S. military to protect the homeland from foreign invasion. That's a fairly straightforward job, as the U.S. is shielded from powerful rivals by the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. In addition to protecting the homeland, the U.S. has long sought to possess what the MIT political scientist has called ""command of the global commons."" By the ""commons,"" Posen means the sea-lanes and the airspace that are so central to global commerce, as well as low Earth orbit, a nearby region of space that is thick with satellites. As Posen explains, command does not mean that the U.S. has exclusive use of the commons, or even that others can't make use of the commons for military purposes. Rather, it means that if the U.S. felt that it needed to deny the use of the global commons to some rival state, it could so. Moreover, command means that if some rival state were foolish enough to prevent the U.S. from making use of the commons, the U.S. could make them regret they ever tried. The reason command of the commons is so important is that the U.S. is and has long been a trading nation, and if rival states could deny the U.S. access to the commons, the U.S. would always be at the mercy of these rival states. The U.S. managed to get by when the British Empire had command of the commons in an earlier era, but we have little experience of a world in which access to the commons was controlled by an unfriendly power. One of the chief arguments for the U.S. involvement in the First and Second World Wars was that if some other power grew dominant on the Eurasian landmass, it might then achieve command of the global commons and tie an economic noose around America's neck. Command of the commons is extremely valuable, yet America has had it for so long that we tend to take it for granted. That is a mistake. And command of the commons is getting more expensive to maintain. The other thing we expect of our military is that it be able to protect not just the U.S. homeland, but also our allies around the world. The United States is pledged to defend every other NATO member state if they're ever under attack. To be sure, every other NATO member state has also pledged to defend the U.S. But let's just say that in practice, the U.S. is not banking on the Estonians to ride to the rescue in case of an invasion while the Estonians are certainly banking on the U.S. having their back if the Russians come knocking. And NATO is just the tip of the iceberg. Michael Beckley, a political scientist at Tufts, has observed that since World War II, the United States has signed defense pacts with more than 60 countries. This U.S.-led global alliance contains 25 percent of the world's population and generates 75 percent of global GDP. America's allies have primary responsibility for their own defense, to be sure. Yet they really do count on the U.S. to step up when the going gets tough. Why does the U.S. extend security guarantees to so many different countries, including rich ones? One way to think about it is that U.S. allies are by definition countries that the U.S. will never have to fight against. Instead of building up their militaries in ways that might threaten the U.S. or their neighbors, former rivals like Germany and Japan have militaries that are almost exclusively devoted to territorial defense. Whereas both Germany and Japan once had imperial designs, neither country could conquer a faraway land if they tried. What they can do is meaningfully contribute to U.S.-led efforts to defend not only their own homelands but also other democracies in their respective regions. The U.S.-led global alliance has created a vast zone in which interstate conflict is largely unknown, and commerce can flow freely. American leadership allows and encourages our allies to cooperate, and it makes it effectively impossible for them to wage war on each other. This is a far cry from the years before 1945, when the world's richest and most powerful countries were at each other's throats. Could it be that the remilitarization of Germany and Japan outside of the American security umbrella would be welcomed by their neighbors? Might the Middle East be safer if Saudi Arabia had to fend for itself, and it devoted its oil wealth to, say, building its own nuclear arsenal? I'm skeptical, and frankly I think it would be unwise for us to roll the dice to find out. For decades, mainstream Democrats and Republicans have agreed that bearing the costs of U.S. global leadership is preferable to the uncertainty that would arise if the U.S. were to pull back, and so the U.S.-led global alliance has persisted. From Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, every president since the end of the Cold War has actually favored expanding this alliance. The problem we face now is that both Democrats and Republicans don't seem to appreciate that the costs of U.S. global leadership are rising, whether they like it or not. Consider the case of China. In recent years, China has devoted a growing share of its military resources to so-called anti-access and area denial weapon systems. First, they want to ensure that they can prevent the United States from having free rein throughout the Western Pacific, their backyard, and so they are pouring money into things like cheap missiles that can overwhelm America's big, slow-moving naval vessels and overseas bases. If China fires off hundreds or thousands of missiles, they only need a handful to reach their targets to deal a devastating psychological blow to the U.S. and its allies. This is very smart strategy, and U.S. defense planners are thinking hard about how to counter it. But the Chinese benefit enormously from the fact that they really just want to dominate their backyard and to ensure that they're eventually strong enough to keep the U.S. out of it. If the Chinese could do that, they could then dominate their neighbors, including U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea. The U.S. would lose command of the commons in the world's most economically dynamic region. Chinese domination of the Western Pacific is far from inevitable. To successfully contest it, however, the U.S. will have to spend money. Why can't Japan, or other affluent allies, pick up the slack? To be sure, our allies have a role to play. The U.S. military and its partners are involved in a big, complex, cooperative enterprise, in which the U.S. takes on some roles while partner countries take on others. During the Cold War, the U.S. expected its NATO allies to be prepared for ground combat in Europe and its Asian allies to focus on anti-submarine warfare. The U.S. was concerned primarily with maintaining its large nuclear weapons arsenal and maintaining command of the commons. Since the Cold War, Tufts' Beckley has identified a broadly similar division of labor. As before, the U.S. focuses on commanding the commons and maintaining high-end offensive capabilities. Now, however, America's European allies are more likely to engage in peacekeeping and post-conflict stabilization while our Asian allies are devoting resources to countering China's new anti-access and area denial weapons. With the notable exception of Iraq, a war that many U.S. allies wanted no part of, it is not at all uncommon for U.S. allies to take more casualties as a share of their ground forces than the U.S. in post-conflict missions. To put it crudely, the U.S. military is built to focus on the high-intensity phase of a conflict in which the goal is to overwhelm the enemy with superior firepower. U.S. allies are more suited to doing the often equally important work of post-conflict stabilization. None of this is to suggest that America's European allies shouldn't spend more on their militaries. They should. NATO has set a 2 percent target for defense spending, and only five NATO members clear that very modest threshold. But even if Britain, France, and Japan doubled or tripled their military budgets, they still couldn't afford to command the global commons or successfully defeat enemy forces in serious ground combat. Like it or not, the U.S. really is the indispensable nation. Over the past decade and a half, the U.S. has been embroiled in counter-insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it has played a supporting role in counter-insurgencies in a number of other countries as well. Counter-insurgencies are a textbook example of the kind of mission the U.S. ought to avoid if possible. Unfortunately, the U.S. needs to be prepared for counter-insurgencies, as countries can't always pick and choose the wars they fight. As the global population grows more urban, and as the threat of state collapse continues to grow more pressing than the threat that one state will openly invade another, it is all but certain that the U.S. and its allies will be called upon to restore order. And restoring order is extremely expensive, because restoring order can't be done by drones. High-tech weapons can work wonders when your goal is to wipe out your enemy. But if your goal is to win over a population, and to carefully distinguish between friends and enemies who can be hard to tell apart, you can't just rely on high-tech weapons--you need intelligent people, including intelligent people who speak the local language, who are capable of making friends and influencing people. In an ideal world, it would be our allies who could take on these tasks. The trouble is that counter-insurgency and peacekeeping aren't the same thing. Counter-insurgency requires that you have a full complement of capabilities, from the heavy firepower you need to decisively win a conflict to the soft skills you need to avoid a conflict in the first place. Peacekeeping is what you do when peace has already been established. Part of the reason the U.S. needs to spend more on its military is that the U.S. needs well-trained women and men with the skills and the talent to handle chaotic situations, and they need the best tools money can buy. The world is a dangerous place, but it is far less dangerous than it would be in the absence of a uniquely powerful United States. The technologies that have propelled America's military dominance over the past few decades have grown cheaper and more widespread, and they've increasingly fallen into the hands of America's enemies. If history is any guide, the U.S. will allow its military edge to deteriorate until some rival power delivers its military a humiliating blow, at which point Americans will be forced to scramble to reverse course, under highly unfavorable circumstances. We have it in our power to do things differently--to deter threats before they arise, and to help ensure that the world won't descend into the great power rivalry that gave us World War I and II. Those who say that we can't afford to spend more on our military have it backward: We can't afford not to invest in the peace and security that are the product of U.S. global leadership, and on which billions of people around the world depend. If the only way we can afford higher military expenditures is by raising taxes, so be it."	The United States Doesn't Spend Enough on Its Military
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/marco_rubio_s_debate_win_should_make_him_the_gop_nominee_in_waiting.html	"It's good to be Marco Rubio. You're young, smart, and good-looking. In a party that needs credibility with Hispanic voters, you're Cuban American. You're a great talker. You're a rising star in a party that's eating its elders. Insurgents admire you, yet the GOP establishment trusts you. Republicans are looking for a new leader, and you seem to be it. Tuesday night's GOP debate showed how everything is opening up for Rubio. He's good, and he's lucky. He didn't dominate the conversation, but the dynamics worked in his favor. To begin with, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie got bumped off the stage. Christie isn't a threat to Rubio, but he's a terrific debater. With Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee banished to the undercard event, the visible field of candidates narrowed to eight. Jeb Bush, who once again needed to stand out, didn't. On stage after stage, it has become obvious that Rubio is a much better talker. Bush, sensing the threat, staged a head-on collision with Rubio in their previous debate. And Bush lost it. Bush was better on Tuesday. But if you're a Republican donor or undecided voter, you saw the same liabilities you've seen before. When Bush tries to look strong, he sounds weak. He repeatedly summarized his foreign-policy vision with the passive phrase, ""Voids are filled."" He said carbon emissions were down thanks to ""the explosion of natural gas."" At one point, he babbled, ""I was in Washington--Iowa--about three months ago talking about how bad Washington, D.C., is. It was--get the--kind of the--anyway."" Bush pleaded for air time, telling Donald Trump, ""Thank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate."" Later, in a succinct display of their alpha and beta personalities, Trump silenced Bush during an exchange by extending an arm and barking, ""Hold it."" In his closing statement, Bush promised not to be an ""agitator in chief."" Any viewer looking for a pragmatist was probably more impressed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who seized that role from Bush. Kasich presented himself as the candidate of fiscal responsibility and sensible compassion, particularly with regard to immigration and government assistance. By taking market share from Bush, Kasich can help clear the way for Rubio. If Rubio stays ahead of the other candidates who have held elected office, he'll win the nomination. That's because the candidates who haven't held office, led by Trump and Ben Carson, don't have the sanity or skill to endure. Carson is being vetted for the first time, and it shows. Trump, who likes to call other people ""low-energy,"" delivered his flattest performance of the year. It's possible that, having run out of gas in the polls, Trump is losing enthusiasm for the campaign. But the more worrisome sign is that the audience seemed tired of him. He was booed for dismissing Kasich and for belittling Carly Fiorina. The crowd applauded Fiorina as she mocked Trump's boast about appearing on a TV show with Vladimir Putin. When Trump denounced the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a scheme to help China, Sen. Rand Paul embarrassed him by pointing out, ""China is not part of this deal."" Against this background, Rubio looked good. It started with the debate's first question, about the minimum wage. Trump botched it, shrugging that people ""have to work really hard"" instead of expecting a better entry wage. Carson wandered into a sermon about how the government fosters dependency. Rubio, the next man up, rejected Trump's answer, insisting that people are ""working as hard as ever."" He summarized his humble upbringing, pivoted to his generational pitch about emerging economic challenges, and crisply explained the dilemma: ""If you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine."" The debate's moderators might as well have been on Rubio's payroll. Their next question to him was a carbon copy of his first answer: ""How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines?"" This was essentially an invitation to deliver his stump speech, and he nailed it. The third question he got was about his tax plan. Rubio followed Bush this time, which gave him an opportunity to demonstrate his superiority as a speaker. The question, which focused on Rubio's proposal to expand the child tax credit, also allowed him to turn a dry economic subject into a cultural-values pitch. ""Yes, I have a child tax credit increase, and I'm proud of it,"" he replied. ""The pro-family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the country: the family."" Then Rubio got another break. Rand Paul attacked him for extending the tax credit, as an outright payment, to people who don't earn enough money to owe income taxes. Rubio jumped at the opportunity to be the champion of struggling parents. ""If you invest that money in a piece of equipment, if you invest that money in a business, you get to write it off your taxes,"" he fumed. ""But if you invest it in your children, in the future of America and strengthening your family, we're not going to recognize that in our tax code?"" Paul also went after Rubio for military spending. Thanks to Paul's attack, Rubio got to be the guy who rebuked isolationism and spoke up for American strength against China, Iran, and ""radical jihadists."" Later, in another rebuttal to Paul, Rubio showed off his fluency in global affairs, discussing Ukraine, Georgia, Libya, Pakistan, Turkey, and Jordan. And nearly 90 minutes into the debate, Rubio got in the first words of praise for Israel. The moderators' final pitch was an egregious softball:"	Marco Rubio's Impressive Debate Performance Solidified Him as the GOP Nominee in Waiting
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/the_fourth_gop_presidential_debate_offered_many_candidates_a_strong_moment.html	"It was a tough night for philosophers at the fourth GOP debate. To make a point about skills training, Sen. Marco Rubio said the world needed more welders than philosophers. Sen. Ted Cruz attacked ""philosopher kings"" for trying to figure out what was happening in the economy. And Gov. John Kasich, who tried at times to get philosophical and even quoted one--Michael Novak on the ethical duties of Wall Street--was clobbered by Donald Trump. ""I don't have to hear from this man,"" Trump said after Kasich labeled him as untruthful. There were no gimmicky or silly questions this time around. The Fox Business moderators stuck to talking about wages, fiscal issues, and national security, and the candidates offered a lot of loose economic bravado and gunplay. But if you are in the camp that thinks the GOP race will ultimately come down to Rubio and Cruz, then you were given more support for that theory. Both had good moments on issues that GOP voters care about, and neither was bested by the others. Rubio's moment came in a back-and-forth with Sen. Rand Paul over the size of the budget--a moment where actual differences between the men illuminated policy choices. Paul criticized Rubio's plan for a refundable child tax credit and increased defense spending. That gave Rubio a chance to play the family and the strong military cards. He argued that if you don't spend the money America will be in danger, and the crowd seemed to love it. It was the second debate in which he got the better of an exchange aimed at him. Unlike the last debate where Rubio's attacker (Jeb Bush) was left diminished, Paul didn't lose ground. In the age of ISIS, Paul isn't going to win the GOP nomination by pledging national security restraint, but he was more clear and vital in support of his standards than he has been in the previous debates. (Indeed, one of the evening's most interesting exchanges revolved around the philosophical question of what it means to be a conservative.) Cruz's moment came during a debate over immigration. Bush, who was attempting to be more assertive, criticized Trump and others who were promoting deportation. Bush spoke up for a pathway to citizenship. Cruz replied with a hammer, saying, ""It's offensive that people who oppose amnesty are labeled anti-immigrant."" He had another strong moment when he refused to bail out any large failing banks--a crowd-pleaser that then led to a confusing back-and-forth over bank deposits that seemed to proceed as if the FDIC did not exist. Cruz had the night's finest little piece of embroidery. He rose to Rubio's defense on military spending but then talked about how that spending could be paid for through closing loopholes like the one for sugar subsidies--something Rubio, as a Florida senator, supports. You can learn something about a candidate from the moment when he chooses not to engage. Rubio didn't get in the middle of that immigration debate. He was once a champion of comprehensive immigration reform. He wasn't going to put on the Jeb Bush lead life jacket and sink with him. He knows how to pick his shots. What about the front-runners? Trump was on an autopilot of sorts. His numbers will presumably stay the same. Ben Carson seemed to be feeling his way through the material much of the time, but like Trump his support will be hard to shake. If Paul was trying to get the candidates to hew to conservative principles, Bush and Kasich tried to return the conversation to reality. Kasich called for responsibility in tax cutting and ridiculed Trump's immigrant-deportation plan: ""It's a silly argument. It's not an adult argument. It makes no sense."" Bush said Trump's idea that Russia should take care of ISIS was ""like a board game. That's like playing Monopoly or something. That's not how the real world works."" These were amusing moments, but they're not likely to elevate either man. Carly Fiorina was spirited and made her points like a jackhammer. The audience seemed to approve. There was a time when one might have guessed that would help her in the polls, but she's had trouble making something enduring after her strong turns on stage. In a season where the electorate has blessedly followed their own impulses, it's hard to determine how any series of exchanges will really play out until the voters speak their mind to pollsters. And even then, will we really know what role this debate played? It's enough to make you philosophical. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	The Fourth GOP Presidential Debate Got Downright Philosophical
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/rand_paul_had_his_best_debate_the_kentucky_senator_returned_to_the_ideas.html	"Prior to the fourth Republican presidential debate, Sen. Rand Paul hadn't made much noise in these melees. He had gotten into some interesting policy arguments about issues like medical marijuana but otherwise never seemed center stage. His most memorable moment came in the second debate when Donald Trump opened the night by calling Paul ugly. His performance in Tuesday's debate was inarguably his strongest. He was a main participant in some of the night's liveliest and most central topics, ably pitching both his tax plan and his foreign policy views. It was on the latter where he especially stood out, because let's face it: All of the candidates have roughly similar views on taxes, in that they think rates should all go way, way down. That's why you didn't see many arguments during that portion--just one guy saying, ""10 percent individual, 16 percent for business"" and another saying, ""no, 14 percent individual, 14 percent for business."" Whatever! On foreign policy, the candidates all roughly agree, too, on a more ""muscular"" use of American military power abroad and the need to ""stand up"" to various bogeymen. Except Paul. In adopting what we'll call a less interventionist foreign policy--not exactly the ""isolationist"" one that Sen. Marco Rubio, like many hawks before him, has ascribed to Paul--the Kentucky senator, really, was the only markedly different candidate on the stage in either domestic or international policy. This is not new for him. But in the months leading up to his campaign launch and the disappointing months that he's been an official candidate, Paul hedged in an unsuccessful effort to ditch the ""isolationist"" label. He is now low in both polls and funds, with little left to lose. His only move, really, is to make a showy display of what made him an interesting candidate in the first place. Maybe it will kill him off; maybe it won't. But he was going to be dead anyway. Any neutral observer would look at his exchange with Rubio (and, by proxy, every other candidate) over military spending and declare Rubio the winner. Rubio is a forceful debater, and he represents hawkish, mainstream Republican foreign policy thinking. According to a Pew survey earlier this year, to give just one example, 67 percent of Republican voters supported the deployment of American ground troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria--up 10 percentage points from a Pew survey conducted just a few months earlier. So it's no surprise that Rubio got the lion's share of the applause following this exchange:"	Rand Paul Is at His Best When He Has Nothing Left to Lose

Stop trying to capture conservatives with trap queries, and just let them explain their economic policies. Is this so much to ask? And so the Fox Business Network took them up on this and opened with a simple question Tuesday night: Whatcha think about the minimum wage? Higher? Keep where it is? Faced with this very, very simple question, the first two candidates to respond--the first two candidates to speak during the night!--both said that wages are too high. Donald Trump, you for a minimum wage increase? ""I can't be, [Moderator] Neil [Cavuto] ... There is nothing that we do now to win. We don't win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I've come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It's going to be a tremendous plan. I think it will make our country and our economy very dynamic. But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world."" Ben Carson. You liked increasing the minimum wage back in May. Still like it? ""As far as the minimum wage is concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/university_of_missouri_football_forced_the_resignation_of_president_tim.html	"On Saturday, black players on the University of Missouri's football team released a message to the school's administration. ""The athletes of color on the University of Missouri football team truly believe 'Injustice Anywhere is a threat to Justice Everywhere,' "" read the statement, published on Twitter. ""We will no longer paticipate in any football related activities until President Tim Wolfe resigns or is removed due to his negligence toward marginalized students' experiences. WE ARE UNITED!!!!!"" The players were referring to a series of racist incidents against black students, including slurs directed at Payton Head, the president of the Missouri Students Association, who is black. ""Last night as I walking through campus, some guys riding on the back of a pickup truck decided that it would be okay to continuously scream NIGGER at me,"" detailed Head in a Facebook post. Later, a group of black students--rehearsing for a part in the homecoming parade--were harassed by an intoxicated man yelling racial slurs. Students held anti-racism protests in response to both but saw little time or attention from the administration. Last week, in response to all of this--including an incident where campus police broke up a small demonstration against the school's president, as well as the discovery of a swastika, drawn with human feces, on a dorm wall--Jonathan Butler, a graduate student at the University of Missouri, began a hunger strike in an effort to oust Wolfe. ""We have reactionary, negligent individuals on all levels at the university level on our campus and at the university system level, and so their job descriptions explicitly say that they're supposed to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students,"" said Butler in an interview with the Washington Post. ""But when we have issues of sexual assault, when we have issues of racism, when we have issues of homophobia, the campus climate continues to deteriorate because we don't have strong leadership, willing to actually make change."" On Monday morning, following the Missouri players' strike, President Wolfe resigned. ""Use my resignation to heal and start talking again,"" he said in a statement to the university's governing board. It's important to note the extent to which this goes beyond campus racism. The past three months have seen campus fights over graduate student health care and Planned Parenthood. And just a week before Butler's hunger strike, Wolfe met with members of ""Concerned Student 1950""--an activist group named after the year the first black students attended Missouri--which ended in an impasse. ""Wolfe verbally acknowledged that he cared for Black students at the University of Missouri, however he also reported he was 'not completely' aware of systemic racism, sexism, and patriarchy on campus,"" said a statement from the group after the meeting. The football team didn't create the environment for Wolfe's resignation as much as it supercharged the issue and forced a confrontation that Wolfe was trying to avoid. That said, it's clear the immediate lesson from Wolfe's resignation is the incredible influence of football players in the ecosystem of university life. ""So much of the political and social economy of state universities is tied to football, espeecially in big-money conferences like Southeastern Conference, where Mizzou plays,"" writes Dave Zirin for the Nation. ""The multibillion-dollar college football playoff contracts, the multimillion-dollar coaching salaries ... don't happen without a group of young men willing to take the field."" This is tremendous power, and Monday's events were the first time we've seen it in action. And now that the seal has been broken, it also won't be the last. Politics have always been part of sports, and that's doubly true for the politics of civil rights. At the University of Missouri, you have a largely black football team in solidarity with a black minority on campus, many of whom witnessed--and in some cases, experienced--the events in Ferguson, Missouri, last year. ""A number of the black students come from Ferguson, where about two-thirds of the population is black, to Columbia, where nearly 80 percent of residents are white,"" notes the New York Times. You see this, for example, with Butler. ""I had never seen that many black people mobilized in that way,"" he said in reference to Ferguson. ""So, it really struck a chord with me, to really have a passion for inspiring and building up my black community."" Given the real extent to which Ferguson--and the subsequent ""Black Lives Matter"" movement--has energized and given new urgency to struggles against racism and discrimination, it's almost no surprise that black students--and black student athletes, in particular--have gotten involved. Especially since, for black students at predominantly white institutions, there is the real problem of racial hostility. Explicit actions like slurs or attacks are often just the tip of the iceberg of routine bias. A recent statement from black alumni of Mizzou is illustrative. ""While students at Mizzou, many of us found ourselves protesting similar incidents on campus and we find it highly unacceptable that many of these issues are not only continuing, but have become more pervasive."" In my first semester at the University of Virginia, the school was rocked by a series of similar incidents--several students of color were harassed with racial slurs. On that score, the first time someone called me a nigger was on campus. Complaints from UVA students then echo those from Mizzou students today:"	Why the Mizzou Football Team May Be Just the Beginning

Ted Cruz, the accomplished, theatrical avatar of grassroots conservatives, has a real shot at winning the presidency of the United States. In the sprawling race for the 2016 Republican nomination, just a few candidates stand as ""plausible"" nominees--people who could win the primary, and thus, could stand against the Democratic Party nominee in a general election. At the ""most plausible"" end are Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, who fit the mold of the kinds of people that parties, and the GOP in particular, nominate. After a series of poor, listless debate performances, Bush has almost collapsed, with shrinking support from voters and increasingly, donors. By contrast, Rubio--pushed along by his own skill as well as Bush's failure--is surging into pole position as the front-runner. He's moved forward in the polls, won new attention from GOP billionairies, and scored endorsements from fellow Republican lawmakers. At the other end are the vanity and factional candidates--people running to represent an interest group, a constituency, or just because they can. Celebrity mogul Donald Trump and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson are still leading the national Republican polls, but given their problems--everything from extreme views to scant political experience--it's difficult to see how they consolidate the GOP behind their campaigns for the nomination. Carly Fiorina, Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Rand Paul, Gov. Chris Christie, and Mike Huckabee have supporters, but in the face of stronger competitors with more cash and resources, it's hard to see how they pull to the front. And then there's Cruz, who was one of the first Republicans to announce his bid for the White House. A self-proclaimed ""outsider,"" he's been on the inside of national Republican politics for the past 15 years. He worked on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign as a domestic policy adviser and served in the Bush administration as associate deputy attorney general in the Justice Department and director of policy planning in the Federal Trade Commission. He spent five years as solicitor general of Texas, before winning his Senate seat in 2012. Since entering the public eye, Cruz has made a splash two ways. First, with his palpable intelligence. Any given Cruz bit is peppered with references to political philosophy (he likes to mention John Rawls), American history, and occasionally Russian revolutionary politics. And while it can sound contrived, conservative audiences seem to love the senator's erudite approach to political conflict. Second, and related, is his heated, almost bombastic rhetoric. ""I am convinced we are facing the epic battle of our generation,"" said Cruz on the stump in his 2011 primary fight against then-Texas Lt Gov. David Dewhurst. ""Which candidate is best prepared to stand up and lead the fight to stop the Obama agenda?"" He carried this style into the Senate. In his first year, he launched a marathon speech against the Affordable Care Act, condemning it as a scourge on the fabric of America. ""[Obamacare] is a job-killing, economy-destroying, health care ruining, debt-exploding, out of control government mess,"" he said at one point in the performance. ""Obamacare is all about socialistic control of we the people and nothing to do with fixing health care."" As per his rhetoric, Cruz has led grassroots conservatives to shut down the government and has stood on the outside of the Senate Republican caucus as a gadfly of sorts, burning bridges with powerful party figures--on one occasion, he denounced Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as a liar on the Senate floor. All of this has shaped Ted Cruz into an unusual national figure. With degrees from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, ties to the Bush administration, and a seat in the United States Senate, Cruz has the definition of an establishment resume. Indeed, to the extent that he relies on this inside knowledge to sell himself to grassroots voters--""Republican donors actively despise our base""--he wouldn't be Cruz without it. But he's also despised by GOP leaders and other Republican senators. ""Ted has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names, which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate, and as a consequence he can't get anything done legislatively,"" explained Sen. Paul last month, after he called Cruz ""pretty much done for"" in the Senate. Cruz was a self-proclaimed ""outsider."" Now, he really is outside the party. Given this, it's hard to look at Cruz and his presidential campaign and see a winner. The kinds of people who eventually stand for a general election aren't the people who oppose party leadership and stand far to the right of the median voter. But we shouldn't underestimate the junior senator from Texas. Yes, Cruz is disliked by fellow Republicans and seemingly eclipsed by rivals like Rubio. At the same time, he has a path to victory. To get a sense of what it could look like, it's worth a jump back to 2008, when Sen. Barack Obama was fighting a tough insurgent battle for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton. Heading into Super Tuesday, in the 2008 Democratic primary, Clinton and Obama were almost evenly matched. After a bruising loss in Iowa, Clinton had picked up New Hampshire and Nevada. Obama, on the other hand, matched his caucus victory with a huge win in South Carolina. The then-Illinois senator led with delegates, but not by much. A strong Super Tuesday would give Clinton an edge in votes, in delegates, and in the ephemeral advantage of ""momentum."" And given her place in the election--the ""establishment"" candidate of the race--observers assumed an edge for Clinton ahead of the Super Tuesday primaries, which were national in scope. ""It's now essentially a media war, with Obama and Clinton competing in sound bites and 30-second ads,"" wrote the New York Daily News ahead of the multistate contest. ""Polls show Clinton leading in the Feb. 5 states with the top prizes, most notably California and New York, which have about 30 percent of the convention votes needed to secure the nomination."" ""The sprawling nature of the Feb. 5 event will test the candidates' ability to draw votes under an array of different systems of voter participation,"" wrote Rhodes Cook for Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""In short, Super Tuesday will test the candidates' organizational ability, campaign skills, and most importantly, their vote-getting appeal, in far-flung settings unique in their scope and variety."" Super Tuesday came, and while Clinton won the most votes, Obama won the most states and scored the most delegates. It wasn't the beginning of the end for the Clinton effort--that would come with the subsequent contests in Washington, the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, where Obama expanded his delegate lead into something almost insurmountable--but more than Iowa or South Carolina, it marked the Illinois senator as a truly national competitor. Moreover, it established a strategy for overtaking a favored candidate with formidable resources and institutional support. Obama's Super Tuesday success was a function of organizing. While Team Clinton focused on polls and television ads, the Obama campaign made heavy investment in grassroots and local organizing in small (but critical) states. Months of finding supporters, recruiting volunteers, and building infrastructure paid off on election night, where Obama could maximize his gains in favorable (or otherwise neglected) territory and minimize his losses in the large states that backed Clinton. Obama wouldn't win a clean victory with this strategic, delegate-centered campaign--the 2008 race was a grind that lasted to the end of the primary calendar--but he would win. And that's what mattered. It's tempting to place Rubio in the Obama position, for obvious reasons. He's a young, non-white senator with a compelling story and a silver tongue. But Rubio isn't running an Obama-esque campaign. He doesn't draw large crowds; until recently, he hasn't had strong fundraising; and he spends relatively little time in Iowa and New Hampshire, in contrast to Obama, who devoted his early campaign to massive organizing in both states. The key difference is that Rubio isn't running an insurgent campaign. He's running, instead, to supplant Jeb Bush as the candidate of the Republican establishment. And if he can do that--and consolidate establishment support--he can stand as the most likely choice for the nomination. Cruz, on the other hand, is running an insurgent campaign, and it looks a lot like Obama's. The most serious obstacle to running outside the party establishment is cash. Absent huge sums to organize and build camp across multiple states, there's almost no way to turn popularity into votes. Obama solved this problem by merging unprecedented grassroots fundraising with traditonal big dollar donations. Cruz is doing the same. In the first half of this year, billionaires and other supporters put more than $37 million into his super PACs while Cruz raised $14 million through small donations to his campaign. The campaign, reports the Washington Post, has 219 ""bundlers"" who have raised $9 million, as well as 120,000 small donors. Together, this $51 million puts him ahead of everyone other than Bush. What has Cruz done with this hefty war chest of direct contributions? He's carefully managed it--at last count, he has $13.8 million ""on hand,"" more than any other GOP candidate--and invested in infrastructure. The Cruz campaign has invested much of its resources into ""high-tech fundraising efforts"" and building local organizations in states like Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee. There's a reason for this strategy. After the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the next contests are largely in the South. Called the ""SEC primary""--a nod to the collegiate Southeastern Conference--it begins on March 1 with Super Tuesday and ends two weeks later. During that time, Republicans will allocate more than two-thirds of all delegates, with a heavy portion from Southern and Western states, the geographic base of the conservative movement. Cruz has spent his entire career courting these voters. He captures their mood and speaks to their concerns in a way unmatched by anyone else on the Republican presidential stage. ""We need to stop surrendering and start standing for our principles,"" he said during the second Republican presidential debate. More concretely, he's also done the actual work of reaching out to them: hiring paid staff, making regular trips through Southern states, and strategically reaching out to core demographics like evangelicals. Cruz, remember, announced his campaign at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, and will hold a rally at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, later this month. What's more, he's reached out to key evangelical leaders, like Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. His overall message hits on issues central to these voters. If he's not attacking the Affordable Care Act, he's attacking Planned Parenthood. If he's not attacking Planned Parenthood, he's slamming Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage and defending ""religious liberty,"" and if he's not speaking on social issues, he's circling back to Washington as fundamentally hostile to their communities and their concerns. ""We got a Republican House, we've got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments,"" he said in the first GOP debate, echoing grassroots frustrations. ""I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do."" With all of that said, how does Cruz actually win? First, strong, or potentially strong, competitors need to continue to leave the stage. The end of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's presidential campaign was a tremendous boost for Cruz, who had one less opponent in his ""lane"" of the Republican primary. On the other hand, Donald Trump is dominating among voters who want an ""outsider"" while Ben Carson is grabbing a large share of evangelical voters, who are attracted to his strongly religious message. Cruz has been careful to defend and support both candidates, in hopes that--should they fall--their voters will move to his campaign. It's hard to say whether either Trump or Carson will leave before voting begins, but even if they don't, Cruz isn't lost. He's on track to do well in Iowa, where he's third behind Carson and Trump. If he can hold that position, or even move to second, he's in a good spot for the similarly conservative primaries in Nevada and South Carolina. Key to his strategy, again like Obama's in 2008, is surviving the rough spots and maximizing delegate wins. With campaign infrastructure in the South and momentum from Iowa, Nevada, and South Carolina, Cruz could finish the Super Tuesday and the ""SEC primary"" with a commanding plurality of delegates. In this scenario, he's strong enough to muscle out competing anti-establishment candidates like Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, assuming they haven't left the race already. And it's even possible that Trump and Carson will have left by this point, opening another pool of voters for Cruz to absorb. Of course, this also assumes that Cruz--or someone like him--is the second choice for those voters. And that's tough to say. Existing evidence suggests that a sizable portion of Trump and Carson voters would support Bush or Rubio if their candidates left the race. Which makes some sense; Cruz is an ideological candidate with supporters who see themselves, primarily, as conservatives. Both Trump and Carson, by contrast, tap into beliefs and frustrations that cut across ideology, and attract voters who might call themselves ""moderates"" relative to other candidates. Which is to say that the other major question of the post-Super Tuesday race is what the establishment ""lane"" is doing. If it's just Rubio or Bush, then it's possible that either of them could consolidate enough mainstream support to win outright, like Mitt Romney did in the 2012 primary. But if there's more than one establishment figure--most likely Rubio and Bush, but also possibly Christie and Kasich--then they could split the vote and give Cruz a path to the front. This is truer if they split the vote in Northeastern and Rust Belt states where GOP primary rules advantage moderates over conservatives--it takes fewer votes to win delegates in New York City (because of the paltry number of GOP voters) than it does in Birmingham, Alabama. As FiveThirtyEight notes, ""if a hard-right candidate like Cruz dominates deeply red Southern districts in the SEC primary, a more electable candidate like Rubio could quickly erase that deficit by quietly piling up smaller raw-vote wins in more liberal urban and coastal districts."" (Although, on that score, it's worth noting the degree to which Cruz is campaigning in territories and other places where it's easier to collect delegates.) There are a lot of ""ifs"" here. But you can say the same for Rubio, who has been dubbed the front-runner in the race. What's important is that Cruz is well positioned to take advantage of the ""ifs"" that go his way and survive the ones that don't. And there is a decent chance that, in three months, both Rubio and Cruz will stand as the strongest candidates from their sides of the Republican Party. In which case, we have a grinding, difficult Republican primary. And, like Obama was, it's one Cruz is prepared to win. I said, at the beginning, that Ted Cruz could become president. The calculation is straightforward: If Cruz can fight to a matchup with Rubio, he has a strong shot at the nomination. If he wins that, then--by definition--the White House is possible. And before you assure yourself that Cruz could never beat the eventual Democratic nominee, consider this: Only one candidate in 50 years has won a third consecutive term for their party. If the economy is a little weak, and people are unhappy, then yes: Ted Cruz could be president."	Why Ted Cruz Could Be the Next President of the United States
