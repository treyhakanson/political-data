The polygamy war is on. Social conservatives have warned about polygamy for years. They see it as the next step down the slippery slope of ""redefining marriage."" Friday's ruling in favor of same-sex marriage doesn't end the legal wrangling over the rights of religious objectors. It certainly doesn't end the political or cultural debate about homosexuality. But in their dissents, and in their questions during oral argument, the court's conservative justices have thrown their weight behind a new issue. They're demanding to know why, if gay marriage is a constitutional right, polygamy isn't. At Obergefell v. Hodges oral arguments on April 28, Justice Samuel Alito asked on what grounds a state could deny a marriage license to a foursome of two men and two women. Justice Antonin Scalia asked whether states should be required to recognize polygamous marriages performed in countries where the practice is legal. Then, in his dissent issued Friday, Chief Justice John Roberts contended that ""much of the majority's reasoning"" in support of same-sex marriage ""would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage"":"	John Roberts Says the Gay Marriage Ruling Will Pave the Way for Polygamy. He's Wrong.

He'd come to the White House press room to speak about the massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. The room, with its low ceiling and tight quarters, matched his mood. It's a venue for tiny political fights relentlessly pursued in circles. The president testified to that lack of progress, showing visible frustration with his impotence in the face of gun violence and racial hatred. A week later, the president's mood had been transformed--he was as expansive as his new venue, the College of Charleston's 5,000-seat arena. Out of the violence the president fashioned an argument for perseverance and found the spark for action that seemed to have been taken from him the week before. The spark was located in the life of Clementa Pinckney, the state senator and pastor of the Mother Emanuel Church, whom the president was there to eulogize. It was also found in the grace he saw in the family members of the victims who had forgiven the shooter during his bond hearing, and in the reaction of the people of Charleston. ""This whole week I have been reflecting on this idea of grace,"" the president said. He sure had. The speech wasn't just a testimony about grace, it was a demonstration of it. After talking about Pinckney, the president turned to the subject of grace and at that point, he stopped speaking sentences, but instead lines from the hymn ""Amazing Grace."" In his rhetoric and in his preacher's cadence, he was now praising Pinckney by channeling him. Then, for those not used to spending time in the pews, the president as professor returned. ""According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned, grace is not merited, it is not something we deserve ... grace is the free and benevolent favor of God."" Obama gave that Sunday school definition because he was preparing to make an argument. It was the preamble to the most religious speech of his presidency and one of the most overtly religious speeches from a president in a long while. How powerful was this grace, in the president's vision? It had acted through the killer, who the president portrayed as an unwitting instrument of the Almighty: ""He didn't know he was being used by God."" The president was no longer giving a speech about a tragedy; he was trying to leverage the grace displayed in the wake of that heinous act into a nation's purpose. ""As a nation out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us,"" he said. ""He has allowed us to see where we have been blind."" It was that grace, the president argued, that helped South Carolina lawmakers conclude that the Confederate flag should come down. But there was more power in grace than simply providing the impetus to lower a flag. ""He has given us the chance where we have been lost to find our best selves,"" the president said. ""We may not have earned grace, but we got it all the same. He gave it to us anyway."" And that means, he continued, that America has a duty: ""It is up to us now to make the most of it. To receive it with gratitude and prove ourselves worthy of this gift."" The president then outlined the worthy fights, from lessening gun violence to tackling poverty to improving race relations. If you were moved by the response to the shooting, he was arguing, then you have a commitment to be true to what inspired that moving response. If Americans make those commitments and stay focused on improving those injustices, the president said, ""by doing that, we express God's grace."" This was not a rhetorical exercise, or not merely one. It was a demonstration of the power the president had found in the example of the people of Charleston--both the living and the dead. He wasn't just telling. He was showing--the power he was trying to summon in this speech came from his own feeling of gratitude and obligation to serve as an example of grace. Even if you didn't agree with any of what the president said, the distance the president traveled in this one week was a kind of testimony of its own. By the end of his oration, the president was leading the congregation in an impromptu rendition of ""Amazing Grace."" It was the second time in the day, and the third time in two days, that the president had made testimonials to the power of keeping the faith. Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled on a legislative interpretation that allowed the Affordable Care Act to survive, enshrining the president's signature legislative achievement after years of pitched battle. Friday, the Supreme Court announced that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry, rooted in the 14th Amendment, written in the wake of the Civil War to grant citizenship to people once enslaved. Speaking in the Rose Garden on Friday morning the president said the same-sex marriage ruling was a testament to the power of perseverance in the struggle. ""Progress on this journey often comes in small increments, sometimes two steps forward, one step back, propelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes, there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt."" The thunderbolts of change that struck this week seem to have energized the president. He might have given the same eulogy had he not had his opinions affirmed by the Supreme Court. But given the sense of vindication that he feels, it was easy to see how those secular victories gave him the confidence to make that soaring religious speech and to wipe away the intimations toward capitulation and defeat from just a little more than a week ago."	How Obama Found Grace: The Remarkable Week That Transformed the President
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/barack_obama_s_eulogy_for_clementa_pinckney_president_takes_forceful_stand.html	"On Friday, as much of the country rejoiced at the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage, and Charleston, South Carolina, continued to mourn its dead, President Obama delivered what may go down as his most impassioned, biting, and unambiguous statement on race since being elected into office. This statement was, unfortunately, delivered by way of a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the South Carolina state senator and reverend who was murdered last week, along with eight others, at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church by Dylann Roof, a white supremacist. But what started out as a moving celebration of the life of Pinckney (""Preacher by 13. Pastor by 18. Public servant by 23--what a life [he] lived."") soon morphed into a rousing, mesmerizing political sermon, one in which Obama tackled pretty much all of the controversial angles that have intersected in the aftermath of the Charleston massacre: the confederate flag. Gun control. Systemic racism. Obama was in the zone. Bit by bit, he unfurled the long strands of history--""bombs, arson, shots fired at churches, not random, but as a means to control""--that have, in their own ways, led to the shooting: ""[Roof] sensed the meaning of his violent act,"" he said, emphatically. He spoke, in the eloquent and fervent nature of a preacher, about the emotional and symbolic resistance of the past week, even as families and friends of the deceased grieve. Roof couldn't fathom ""how the United States of America would respond not merely with repulsion at this act, but with generosity and more importantly, with a thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in the public eye."" He called out the Confederate flag for what it truly is, ""a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation."" He alluded to the Newtown, Connecticut, and the Colorado movie theater shootings, and reminded us of the ""30 precious lives cut short by gun violence in this country every day."" But most astounding was the way he talked about the less obvious, more pervasive aspects of racism in this country. ""Maybe we now realize the way a racial bias can infect us even when we don't realize,"" he said. ""So that we are guarding against not racial slurs but also going against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal. So that we search our hearts when we consider laws to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote."" As president, Obama has never been so frank when talking about race. In the wake of Trayvon Martin's death, he tiptoed--the catchy sound bite ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon"" was nice, but it was the only quote worth repeating from that statement. He was similarly careful and ambiguous when talking about race during the events in Ferguson, Missouri, almost a year ago and was cautious after the death of Freddie Gray. This time, though, he didn't mince words, finally saying what many people, including myself, have wished he would say for years, every time another unarmed black person was killed under suspicious circumstances, or politicians were trying to block minorities from voting, or whenever one of his own colleagues would openly and flagrantly disrespect him. If our first black president feels as though he can't talk openly and freely about how racism continues to plague the lives of people everywhere, both explicitly and subversively, what hope do we have of ever truly fixing these problems at all? I'll admit, I'm still doubtful that much will truly change following the Charleston murders--after all, Obama was probably only able to deliver such an unambiguous speech because this was such an unambiguous hate crime. Roof typed out his white supremacist ideology for all to see, whereas the George Zimmermans of the world are less obvious with their preconceived notions about black people as a group. But the speech did give me a little more hope in seeing real, actual progress today than I had yesterday. When this president finally says, as he did on Friday, ""We talk a lot about race. There is no shortcut, we don't need more talk,"" it's hard not to feel a little inspired."	Finally, Obama's Rallying Cry Against Racism

This ruling not only affirms an essential tool in combating racial discrimination, it upholds the view that racial disparities are a national problem that the government ought to combat. Disparate impact--the idea that, whether intentional or not, something is discriminatory and illegal if it has a disproportionate ""adverse impact"" on a particular group--is easy to understand, on account of its universal presence in the United States. Explicit racial bias is frowned on and most Americans strive for tolerance and fair treatment. Yet, there are vast racial gaps in almost every part of American life, from incarceration and the criminal justice system, to education, health care, and even air quality. While it's tempting to blame ""personal responsibility"" or a nebulous ""culture of poverty,"" neither can explain broad trends of racial inequality that snare minorities of all education and income levels. Put simply, racism is so embedded in the structure of American society--from how we distribute wealth to how we determine punishment--that neutral, ""colorblind"" actions can easily produce unequal, racist results. This is most apparent in housing, where cities and towns can create and bolster segregation through exclusionary zoning, and banks can target minorities for the worst, and most dangerous, mortgage loans. Both practices have disproportionately hurt blacks and Latinos, and both practices have been targeted for lawsuits and federal investigation. The main tool for this is the ""disparate impact claim,"" which identifies discrimination, connects it to a certain policy or practice, and ties it to real-life outcomes. Without the disparate impact portion of the Fair Housing Act, this wouldn't be possible, and the federal government would lose an essential method for combating the types of discrimination that still define the terms of our housing markets. ""Landlords, housing professionals, zoning and planning boards, have learned to stop talking about [discrimination],"" the head of enforcement for the Department of Housing and Urban Development said two years ago in describing the importance of the disparate impact standard. ""What they haven't learned is to stop doing it."" In Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. the Inclusive Communities Project, a nonprofit group that promotes racial and socioeconomic integration in the Dallas area sued the state of Texas for racial segregation in subsidized housing. Here's how Amy Howe described the dispute for SCOTUSblog:"	Why the Supreme Court Took a Stand Against Racist Housing Practices

Burwell ruling comes as a relief to Obamacare's defenders. But it should also come as a relief to those who want to see it repealed and replaced. I happen to believe that the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell were right on the merits. Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent makes more sense to me than Chief Justice John Roberts's majority opinion. As a political matter, however, King v. Burwell would have left Obamacare's opponents in an extremely precarious position for the simple reason that conservatives in Congress had failed to coalesce around a coherent post-King strategy in the months preceding the decision. Consider what might have happened had King v. Burwell turned out differently. To many of those cheering Thursday's decision, the answer is straightforward: More than 6 million people in the 34 states served by the federal health insurance exchange would have lost the federal tax credits that helped them afford insurance, and the individual insurance markets in these states would have gone haywire as a direct result. This is the nightmare scenario that liberals feared most in the weeks and months leading up to the decision, and it would have galvanized the Democratic base had it come to pass. But there were other possibilities. Many states that have been making use of the federal exchange had been thinking through possible shortcuts to establishing their own state exchanges. State legislators in New Hampshire, for example, floated the rather clever idea of enacting a state law that would simply declare the federal exchange to be New Hampshire's state exchange for the purposes of collecting federal tax credits. Governors of other states might have issued executive orders to the same effect. Might some enterprising lawyers have sued state governments that went down this road? Sure. But I doubt they would've gotten very far. Of course, not all states would have rushed to create state exchanges. There are 21 states that have yet to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, despite the fact that there are many constituencies, from low-income families to politically powerful medical providers, who would benefit from expansion. It could be that at least some conservative states would have resisted the political pressure to establish state exchanges on ideological grounds. But there is a big difference between choosing not to offer Medicaid to people who are currently uninsured and choosing to stand pat as hundreds of thousands of people in your state lose a benefit they currently enjoy. Back in February, Gov. Nikki Haley, R-South Carolina, by all accounts a staunch conservative, said that she'd at least consider backing a state exchange in the event that the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell. My guess is that Haley is not the only conservative Republican who would have moved in this direction. Thanks to the Supreme Court, she and other GOP governors won't actually have to bite the bullet. And of course it is also quite possible that Congress would have intervened to keep the Obamacare subsidies flowing. Why? As Ramesh Ponnuru has explained, congressional Republicans were divided into three camps on what to do if King v. Burwell went their way. First, there were those who would have refused to extend subsidies under any circumstances, even if it meant that millions of people would lose their health insurance, because extending subsidies would essentially mean aiding and abetting Obama. Second, there were those who feared the political fallout from a big decline in the insurance rolls, and who would have been willing to pass a quick fix to Obamacare to prevent it from happening. Third, there were those who sat uneasily between these two camps: They'd be willing to extend subsidies, but only if they could make other tweaks to Obamacare, like letting states opt out of some of Obamacare's more onerous regulations. Republicans in this third camp devised a number of different proposals, and they worked furiously to win over Republicans in the first and second camps. Furiously, and fruitlessly. Peter Suderman, writing in Politico Magazine, notes that in March, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the closest thing House Republicans have to an intellectual ringleader, pledged that he would have a detailed post-King contingency plan ready to go by late June. Instead, he had little more than a vague outline. If Ryan couldn't get Republicans to unite around a bill, it's not clear who could have. A conservative victory in King v. Burwell wouldn't have dealt Obamacare a deathblow. Rather, it would have drawn attention to the extent to which Republicans remain divided over what should come after Obamacare. Should conservatives advance their own plan for achieving universal access to affordable health coverage, as some Republican reformers insist? Or should they focus first and foremost on shrinking the size of the federal government, even if it means reducing the number of Americans with affordable coverage? My own view is that there is no going back to the pre-Obamacare status quo and that if conservatives fail to address the anxieties of the uninsured, liberals will be more than happy to do so in their own government-expanding, command-and-control fashion. No Supreme Court decision will spare the right from actually having to duke it out over which approach is best. But the court did, on Thursday, give conservatives an opportunity to think hard about how badly we've botched the fight against Obamacare, and what we need to do next.	Why Conservatives Should Be Happy About Losing the Obamacare Case
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/nikki_haley_confederate_flag_speech_how_the_charleston_attacks_forced_the.html	"Three days ago, Republicans were struggling to answer questions on the Confederate battle flag, which flies on the South Carolina state capitol grounds in Columbia. Even under ordinary circumstances, national Republicans have a hard time with the flag. To reject it is to rebuke the countless white Southerners who claim it as heritage, despite its historic meaning as a symbol of resistance to civil rights. But there's no victory in embracing it either--it opens you to national criticism of taking part in the worst forms of insensitivity and pandering. And so, for decades, most Republicans muddled around the issue in a not-so-subtle nod to white Southern identity politics. (To his credit, Mitt Romney refused to pander on the flag in 2007 during his first run for the White House, while John McCain called his decision to pander on the flag during his 2000 presidential campaign one of his greatest regrets.) But muddling wasn't an option this time. Republicans weren't just responding to the flag, they were responding to a brutal attack on a historic black church in Charleston. The attack, which killed nine people (including a state senator), was motivated by hate and allegedly carried out by a young white supremacist, Dylann Roof, who wanted to spark a ""race war"" against black Americans. No, Roof wasn't inspired to commit his crime by the Confederate flag, but in photos posted online he clearly used the imagery in its original meaning--as a symbol of anti-black animus and racial subjugation. In response to the attack, a bevy of activists--and ordinary South Carolinians--called on the state to remove the flag from the capitol. ""The flag has to come down,"" said Cornell Brooks, president of the NAACP. Desperate to deflect and avoid offending white South Carolinians but aware of the circumstances, Republicans tried to sidestep the issue or at least split the difference. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, and Rick Santorum labeled the flag a state issue. ""If the state government of South Carolina wishes to address an issue in their state, that's fine,"" said Huckabee, who took an even more aggressive ""states' rights"" stance in his first presidential run in 2008. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, meanwhile, tried a noncommittal approach that acknowledged emotions on both sides. ""I think a governor's job should be one to bring people together, not to divide them and I think the Confederate battle flag is clearly one of those that divides people,"" said Perry. Cruz's statement was a little more cognizant of the flag's true historic meaning. ""I understand the passions that this debate evokes on both sides,"" said Cruz. ""Both those who see a history of racial oppression and a history of slavery, which is the original sin of our nation."" Into all of this comes Nikki Haley, Republican governor of South Carolina, serving her second term after winning a nearly 15-point re-election victory last fall. On Friday, she was cautious, telling CBS that she hoped the state could have a conversation with ""thoughtful words to be exchanged,"" and adding ""I think the state will start talking about that again, and we'll see where it goes."" On Monday, however--pushed by public outrage--she had changed her tune. In an afternoon press conference with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, as well as Democratic Rep. James Clyburn, GOP Congressman and former Gov. Mark Sanford, and a whole host of state lawmakers from both parties, Haley urged South Carolina legislators to take down the flag. ""It's time to move the flag from the Capitol grounds,"" said the governor, stating that while residents have the right to show the flag on their property, ""the Statehouse is different, and the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way."" Removing the flag won't be easy. Rules limit an upcoming extended session of the General Assembly to just a few concerns--to add the flag to the agenda takes a two-thirds vote of the entire legislature. But with Graham and Scott behind Haley, the statewide GOP establishment seems to support to change. And Haley has pledged to take more direct action if the legislature doesn't move quickly. In all likelihood, however, they will. Ahead of Haley's press conference, South Carolina House Speaker Jay Lucas had urged his colleagues to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. ""The intense and difficult debate that took place in 2000 over the Confederate soldier flag was ultimately resolved by compromise,"" he said, in a statement. ""Wednesday's unspeakable tragedy has reignited a discussion on this sensitive issue that holds a long and complicated history in the Palmetto State. Moving South Carolina forward from this terrible tragedy requires a swift resolution of this issue."" Likewise, the Republican chair of the state Senate Judiciary Committee has said he wants a debate next week. ""I think conversations are going on as we speak,"" said state Sen. Larry Martin. ""Obviously the national view of this that has really spawned over the weekend an even greater understanding of how folks outside our state view us because of its presence on the grounds."" In her case for flag removal, Haley took an even hand. For many, she said, the flag was ""a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past."" But she also affirmed the ""heritage"" view of the Confederate battle flag, nodding to Southern identity politics by calling it a symbol of ""history"" and ""ancestry""--a memorial to the Confederate dead. Roof, she said, had a ""sick, twisted view of the flag"" and did not reflect the views of South Carolinians who ""respect and revere it."" There's no doubt that Roof was on the fringe of life in South Carolina. But Haley can't change the fact of the flag's actual heritage: The Confederacy was a project for the preservation and expansion of slavery, and the Confederate battle flag owes more to the struggle against integration and civil rights than it does to some nebulous--and effectively whites-only--Southern heritage. Indeed, this particular notion of ""heritage"" is tied to the anti-Reconstruction historiography of the late 19th century, where white supremacists extolled Confederate valor and painted an antebellum portrait of gentle masters and contented slaves. Racism is central to Confederate iconography in the same way that slavery is central to the Civil War, constant protests notwithstanding. Of course, Haley isn't a historian; she's a politician. And a press conference isn't the place to contest the deep-rooted views of her constituents. What's important is that she wants to remove the flag, and while it's tempting to wonder if she's sincere--she's made a complete turnaround from her position last year--it's also true that, in politics, sincerity isn't as important as results. What counts is getting it right, and on this issue, Haley has succeeded. As for the Republican presidential candidates, they now have an out. When anyone asks what they think of the Confederate flag, they can just point to Haley and say, I agree with her. By Monday evening, they had already begun to do that.

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/will_the_charleston_shooting_change_america_u_s_history_suggests_it_will.html	"On Wednesday night, a white man walked into a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. He sat with 12 congregants at a Bible study meeting for an hour. Then he stood up and shot nine of them to death. According to a survivor, the killer told his victims: ""You rape our women, and you're taking over our country, and you have to go."" The country is in shock. We're faced with demons we've repeatedly tried to bury: racism, gun violence, mental illness. There are cries for justice, reconciliation, and awakening. There's hope that something good, some change in our culture, can come out of this. Don't count on it. Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; and Sandy Hook didn't persuade Congress to require universal background checks for gun purchases.* And the long history of crimes against black churches has never aroused much concern among whites. Even the worst attack on a black congregation--the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama--didn't, by itself, measurably affect white public opinion. Twenty years ago, church arsons were a national plague. From January 1995 to September 1998, the National Church Arson Task Force reported 670 arsons, bombings, or bombing attempts at houses of worship. Of these incidents, 225 involved black churches. During this period, in 10 separate polls, Gallup asked Americans to name the most important problem facing the country. Not once did the percentage that named race relations rise above 5 percent. Gallup has been asking this question for two-thirds of a century. When you look at its graph of responses over the decades, a few spikes stand out. These are moments when race relations attracted the attention and concern of a lot of whites. The first spike marked with a number is in October 1957, just after the school integration showdown in Little Rock, Arkansas. In that poll, 29 percent of Americans said race was the top issue. The last spike marked on the graph is in May 1992, a week after the Rodney King verdict. You can see how quickly the public's concern, after that blip, sank back to its previous level. But the biggest spike, by far, occurred in a survey taken from Sept. 12-17, 1963. In that sample, 52 percent of respondents said race was the country's most important problem. What happened in September 1963? A fatal attack on a black church. On Sept. 15, a bomb planted by white racists exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church during Sunday school. It killed four girls. Later that day, two black boys died in Birmingham as violence erupted around the city. The nation was transfixed. A week after the tragedy, there were demonstrations in many cities. The estimated attendance was 1,500 in Miami, 7,000 in New York, 10,000 in Boston, and 10,000 in Washington. But did the bombing trigger an outbreak of reflection or conscience in America? I can't find much evidence that it did. Nobody seems to have surveyed the public about the incident. The best we can do is to look for changes in surveys taken before and afterward. And we can't use that big surge on Gallup's ""most important problem"" question, because the bombing didn't happen until the fourth day of Gallup's six-day survey. Gallup has no record of how many of the interviews had been done by then. It's much more likely that the main cause of the spike was the March on Washington, which took place on Aug. 28 of that year. Two pollsters can shed some light on the extent to which public opinion shifted, or didn't, in the latter months of 1963. One is Gallup. In a 1999 review, Gallup discussed three surveys it conducted during that period. In the first sample, taken in June 1963, the percentage of respondents who favored ""racial equality in public places"" (Gallup's review doesn't specify how the question was phrased) stood at 49 percent. In the next sample, taken in August 1963, it rose to 54 percent. In the third sample, taken in January 1964, it reached 61 percent. That's a big change in a short time. But it's not clear to what degree white-on-black violence--as opposed to the rally in Washington, the assassination of President Kennedy, or the emerging debate over the Civil Rights Act--drove the change. Another polling organization, the National Opinion Research Center, surveyed the public in May, November, and December 1963. The November poll is useful because it separates the events of that fall, including the Birmingham bombing, from Kennedy's assassination. Between May and November, the percentage of respondents who said that black and white students ""should go to the same schools"" increased slightly among people who had only a high school education. But it decreased among college-educated Southerners and among people who had less than a grade school education. When all education groups were combined, the data showed that from May to December, the percentage of respondents who favored the ""same schools"" option didn't change while the percentage who preferred ""separate schools"" increased by 3 points. NORC also asked whether ""there should be separate sections for Negroes in streetcars and buses."" More people said no than yes. But from May to December, the gap in favor of integration declined by 3 percentage points. NORC, like Gallup, asked one question that showed positive movement during this time. The question was: ""If a Negro with the same income and education as you have, moved into your block, would it make any difference to you?"" From May to December 1963, the percentage of white respondents who said it would make no difference increased among Southerners with a high school or college education. But it didn't change among Northerners or less educated Southerners. Polls aren't the only way to measure sentiment. In Mobilizing Public Opinion, a reassessment of the civil rights era, political scientist Taeku Lee analyzed a random sample of nearly 7,000 race-related letters that were mailed to the White House from 1948 to 1965. The letters, sent by ordinary citizens, were coded by position (for or against racial equality or civil rights) and date. Lee's graphs of the resulting data suggest that during the last two quarters of 1963, the volume of race-related mail subsided to less than half of what it had been earlier in the year, and the letters tilted overwhelmingly against civil rights. If these numbers depress you, cheer up. The scale of cultural progress during these decades was, by previous standards, spectacular. An analysis of polls from 1942 to 1983, compiled in the definitive volume Racial Attitudes in America, shows that white people's attitudes improved by 58 percentage points on school integration, 52 points on equal employment, and 49 points on openness to black neighbors. In 1958, only 37 percent of whites said they would vote for a ""well-qualified man for president"" if he were black and were nominated by their own party. Twenty years later, that number had doubled. Thirty years after that, a black man was elected president. But the change took time. It required more than the deaths of those four girls in Birmingham. It took Emmett Till, Medgar Evers, James Chaney, and Martin Luther King Jr. It took many more bombings and burnings of churches. It took fire hoses, batons, bullets, and blood. What happened in Charleston is a reminder that civil rights laws and a black president didn't make us angels. It's easy to hate, and when you have a gun and no conscience, it's easy to kill. And when the people who died don't look like you, it's easy to turn away and forget. You don't have to think about how these things happen, and what we can do to prevent them, until the next time. I hope we won't wait till the next time. But history says we will. Read more of Slate's coverage of the Charleston shooting. *Correction, June 20, 2015: I originally misstated that the mass shootings in Tucson, Aurora, and Sandy Hook hadn't persuaded Congress to require background checks for gun purchases. That was sloppy. Background checks are required for purchases from federally licensed firearm dealers. The legislation rejected by Congress would have extended the background-check requirement to sales at gun shows and over the Internet."	Will the Charleston Shooting Change America?

Or you can have no policing at all. That's the implied message from the Baltimore police officers engaged in a deliberate slowdown, which started after prosecutors charged six of their colleagues in the death of Freddie Gray. Across the city, resident say, there are fewer police on patrol, fewer cops on the corner, fewer people on the beat. ""They're not coming because they're afraid,"" said one man in an interview with NPR. He says police have ignored dozens of calls about drug dealers in his neighborhood. Other Baltimoreans echo his claims: ""People wake up with shots through their windows. Police used to sit on every corner, on the top of the block. These days? They're nowhere."" Evidence of the slowdown is in the arrest rate. From April to May, arrests declined 43 percent, bringing arrests down to their lowest point in three years. The year-over-year figures are striking: A force that arrested 3,801 people in May of 2014 arrested just 1,177 people in May of 2015. Less policing has meant more crime, especially in the violent neighborhoods of East and West Baltimore. There were 42 homicides and 100 shootings in May, making it the single deadliest month--in absolute and relative terms--since 1971. Shootings are up, as are assaults and other violent crimes. For their part, police leaders say officers are still at work but fear prosecution and public attack. ""What is happening, there is a lot of levels of confusion in the police organization,"" explained Commissioner Anthony Batts at a City Council meeting last month. ""There are people who have pain, there are people who are hurt, there are people who are frustrated, there are people who are angry. ... There are people, and they've said this to me, 'If I get out of my car and make a stop for a reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause but I make a mistake on it, will I be arrested?' "" On social media, President Gene Ryan of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 declared that police feel ""under siege."" ""The criminals are taking advantage of the situation in Baltimore since the unrest,"" Ryan wrote. ""[Police] are more afraid of going to jail for doing their jobs properly than they are of getting shot on duty."" If Baltimore police believe ""doing their jobs properly"" requires rough rides and other abusive behavior, then they should be in jail. Despite this, pundits--like Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute--have echoed this claim, decrying a ""crime wave"" sparked by protests against police brutality. The ""most plausible explanation of the current surge in lawlessness,"" she writes, ""is the intense agitation against American police departments over the past nine months."" Her argument, published last month, was debunked by a cadre of reporters and criminologists, who dinged her for specious reasoning--short-term blips in crime aren't a ""wave"" or ""surge""--and statistical malpractice. And a recent report from the Sentencing Project--using St. Louis as the case study--finds no evidence of a ""new crime wave"" and little evidence of a ""Ferguson effect"" tied to protests of police practices. To go back to Baltimore, it's not that criminals have taken advantage of protests, it's that police--in their virtual strike against the city--have exacerbated a real and serious crime problem, in service of a false choice between two kinds of lawlessness: One where violent, aggressive cops reign, and the other, where criminals do. The fact is there's a third option. In the wake of the April unrest, Baltimoreans demanded better, more humane policing. They wanted cops on the street, but didn't think that should come at the cost of their rights, or their lives. It's not just a reasonable request, it's the core idea behind ""community policing"" programs: That you can keep communities safe and hold bad police accountable for criminal behavior. In cities as different and diverse as Camden, New Jersey and Seattle, police have worked with communities to improve relationships, discipline bad actors, and--most importantly--reduce crime. There's no contradiction. A city where officers and citizens can work together is one where there's goodwill. Incidents still happen, but they're mediated by pre-existing relationships and open lines of communication. When Maryland state's attorney for Baltimore Marilyn Mosby charged the responsible officers with Freddie Gray's death--when she held them responsible--she helped create an opportunity for new, more constructive relationships between the city, the police, and the community. With the slowdown, police are squandering that opportunity. By treating the city and its residents as a force to be beaten, these officers are sowing anger and animosity among potential allies. The Baltimore riots--the despair, the violence, and the destruction--were tragic, but if the city can't learn from them--if it's stuck in this ill will and resentment--they'll become an actual tragedy."

The substance of her speech was unremarkable, but the style was unfortunate. Clinton tried to soar with inspirational rhetoric--""Yes, that long march to freedom that began here has carried us a mighty long way""--but it fell flat. And worse, the Chicago-raised Clinton adopted a strange Southern drawl that at times mimicked, poorly, the cadences and rhythms of a black preacher. Instead of connecting with her audience, Clinton--who has real allies in black political leadership and a genuine commitment to voting rights--looked fake. When we talk about Clinton, we often talk about this inauthenticity. ""Despite sharing her husband's poll-driven risk aversion,"" wrote columnist Damon Linker in a piece last year for the Week, ""Hillary Clinton has never played the game on his level, and her vulnerability to backlash against gratuitous displays of patent insincerity is already becoming glaringly apparent."" Linker's view is a version of former Clinton adviser Mark Penn's: ""Hillary is cold, removed, needs to be authentic,"" he said, suggesting she be ""as likable as possible"" but not ""reach too far."" And in turn, this reflects a more hostile assessment from conservative speechwriter Peggy Noonan in her 2000 book The Case Against Hillary Clinton, ""She lacks historical heft, is not a person of real size and authenticity."" Carl Bernstein, discussing his biography of Clinton, said it this way: ""This is a woman who led a camouflaged life and continues to."" But there's an obvious double standard here: What politician is utterly authentic? Who are the lawmakers who show their realest selves to the public? And what does it even mean to be ""authentic"" in a singular sense when all of us are authentic in different ways at different times? For Clinton in particular, this entire line of questioning and criticism is deeply unfair. After all, there was a time when Hillary Clinton was incredibly authentic, or, at least, gave us a glance at one of her authentic selves. ""One needn't approve of what she says or does (though often it is highly approvable) to recognize her as real,"" wrote journalist Paul Greenberg in 1992, during the Democratic primaries. At the New Republic, Elspeth Reeve uncovers a 1992 profile of Clinton in which observers and reporters praise her as ""charming,"" ""delightful,"" ""extraordinary,"" and ""unbelievably articulate."" This Hillary Clinton--still new on the national stage--was ambitious, driven, and feisty. She was as political, knowledgeable, and as fluent in the language of policy as her husband. And people liked her for it. Or they did, until she revealed too much. ""I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life,"" she said to reporters about her career, unleashing waves of criticism from angry and affronted Americans. Clinton was too real, and she paid a political price. Hillary and her allies would spend the next two decades, right up to the present, burying the tough, passionate Clinton and playing up the one who wouldn't raise hackles, who was her ""softer side"" more than she was a political partner. But even as Clinton has accommodated the backlash, she chafes against it. According to Gail Sheehy, who has profiled Clinton and been her biographer, the former first lady once confessed deep frustration with her public image. ""I just don't know what to do anymore, nothing I do works. ... I understand that I'm really threatening to men, that the velocity of change between men and women and the way the country is going and for one generation to the boomers is overwhelming, especially to men,"" she said. ""I'm threatening to them and I don't know what to do about it."" Clinton came back to this territory during her 2000 Senate campaign, during an unusually introspective press conference. "" 'Who are you?' and all of that. I don't know if that is the right question,"" she said. ""Even people you think you know extremely well, do you know their entire personality? Do they, at every point you're with them, reveal totally who they are? Of course not. We now expect people in the public arena to somehow do that. I don't understand the need behind that."" Hillary Clinton is running for president again, and it's clear she's still accommodating the backlash against her more authentic self. Unlike her Republican opponents who announced their campaigns with big rallies and elaborate staging, Clinton had a quieter initial rollout. She released a short video--focused entirely on her supporters--and embarked on a ""listening tour"" across early-primary and swing states. All of this was meant to diffuse the sense that Clinton is entitled--a ""coronated"" candidate foisted on an apathetic party. I don't know if that has worked, although I think the description is false. What I can say, however, is that these scripted events have made her seem more relatable and more real. Just not in the way you might expect. During her ""listening tour,"" Clinton spoke to Iowans about substance abuse, mental illness, and building treatment capacity for both; to Nevada high schoolers about immigration reform, vowing to ""do everything I possibly can"" to help immigrants; and to community college students about job training and education. And in speeches across the country, she's staked new and more liberal ground on criminal justice reform and voting rights, pushing an expansive plan for universal voter registration. What comes across in every instance is her enthusiasm for policy. When the discussion is concrete, when it involves problems and solutions, Clinton is clear and compelling. No, she doesn't have the effortless charm of her husband or the equally effortless cool of Barack Obama, but she's intense, devoted, and honestly interested in helping. Here's the New York Times on her stop in New Hampshire:"	Why Hillary Clinton Should Go Full Nerd

Over the years, she embraced black culture. Her parents adopted black children. She went to a black college. She became a civil rights advocate. She changed her appearance. Eventually, she claimed that she was black. On Monday, after her deception was exposed, Dolezal resigned as president of the NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington. Her story has triggered an awkward discussion about what it means to be black and whether, in the age of growing transgender awareness, it's possible to change your race or ethnicity. Most people welcome Dolezal's civil rights advocacy. But many are unnerved that Dolezal can pass as white when she chooses. In fact, on Monday, the Smoking Gun reported that Dolezal once sued her alma mater, Howard University, claiming unsuccessfully that it had discriminated against her in part because she was white. People who are born black, and who clearly look black, can't play that game. They can't simply switch races. ""To be racially black is to face discrimination and violence,"" my colleague Jamelle Bouie argued in a Slate article published before Dolezal's suit against Howard was discovered. He asked, presciently, whether Dolezal had sought an ""a la carte blackness, in which you take the best parts, and leave the pain aside."" That's a good way to assess the authenticity of anyone who claims membership in a disfavored group. And Dolezal's record suggests that she agreed with this standard. Once she decided to be black, she appears to have been committed to the decision. She devoted her career to civil rights advocacy, and she began to report incidents in which she had been targeted and harassed by racists. But did these incidents happen as she described them? Did she earn membership in the sisterhood of the oppressed? Or did she fake it? Many of Dolezal's misrepresentations are now well-known. She depicted a black man as her father. She recast her adopted black brother as her son. Contrary to her legend, she wasn't born in a tepee, and she never lived in South Africa. In several cases, she projected blackness when it may have been advantageous. Her portfolio of ""exclusively African-American portraiture"" helped her get a full scholarship to Howard University. According to colleagues, she got her two most recent jobs--education director at the Human Rights Education Institute (HREI) in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and president of the Spokane NAACP--after claiming to be black. She also designated herself as partly black in a successful application for appointment to a police advisory commission. But Dolezal's most disturbing claims weren't about advantage. They were about victimization. Last year, in a newspaper column, she implied that she could speak for descendants of slaves. She excoriated ""people who have not felt the lash of centuries of oppression beating down on their backs"" for daring to ""tell us to keep calm and carry on."" In an interview with the Easterner, she claimed that her parents had used a baboon whip, ""similar to what was used as whips during slavery,"" to ""punish us by skin complexion."" (Her parents and her adopted black brother say this isn't true.) In 2010, when HREI appointed a white man to be its executive director, Dolezal, who had wanted the job, told the press that she was resigning because she had been targeted for discrimination. Dolezal's bio at Eastern Washington University, where she has taught Africana Studies, says she and her children suffered ""at least eight documented hate crimes"" when she lived in Idaho. But police records show no such documentation, apart from Dolezal's statements and characterizations. For instance, the Easterner profile, based on Dolezal's account, says ""white supremacy groups burglarized every home she and her son lived in."" But according to a police spokeswoman who heads the task force overseeing HREI, the sole burglary report filed by Dolezal, involving a washer that was stolen from a storage shed in 2008, yielded no information about suspects. The spokeswoman says Dolezal ""never called back with any further info."" Dolezal says a ""violent hate group"" may have been involved in a ""home invasion"" at her residence. But the only home intrusion she reported, in April 2009, involved a man and woman who had walked in through an unlocked door and had told Dolezal's son they were there to take care of a dog. At the time, Dolezal claimed that ""two white adults broke into my home,"" and she said the incident ""scared my 13-year-old son to death."" But according to the police report, her son said that he wasn't scared and that the couple merely ""seemed confused."" Between April and August 2009, HREI installed security cameras to monitor potential hate crimes at its office. But in November 2009, after Dolezal reported a swastika sticker that had shown up on HREI's door overnight, police found that the cameras hadn't recorded the incident. Dolezal attributed the cameras' failure to a power surge that had taken place a week earlier. In June 2010, Dolezal told police that her brother had found a noose hanging from a carport behind her rented home. A week later, she repeated this account at a press conference. ""There have been hate crimes in the past two years that have been directed toward me,"" she told the assembled reporters. The owner of the home, when contacted by police, said he was nearly certain it was the same rope he had hung there a year earlier to string up a deer. The owner told police that after Dolezal filed her report, he had explained the situation to her. When the police left Dolezal a message to follow up, she didn't call back. She now denies that the rope was there before she filed the report or that she was told that it had been used for a deer. She also claims that ""my sons found the noose."" This year, Dolezal told police she had received hate mail at the Spokane NAACP's post office box. Nearly 200 people rallied outside the NAACP office to support her. But when police investigated the incident, they found that the envelope had no marks indicating that it gone through the mail. A postal inspector told police, ""The only way this letter could have ended up in this P.O. box would be if it was placed there by someone with a key to that box or a USPS employee."" The three employees who managed the boxes said they didn't remember seeing the envelope. The only other person with confirmed access to the box was Dolezal, who had a key. The Easterner profile says that white supremacists once threatened to kidnap Dolezal's son and that she reported this and other incidents to police. But despite requests from reporters for all police records related to Dolezal, no documents referring to such a claim have been produced. Kurt Neumaier, a former member of HREI's oversight board whose job was to investigate human rights violations, concludes that in every incident Dolezal has alleged, ""she was the sole witness to events that, when put under scrutiny, don't hold up."" It's possible that one or more of these incidents occurred as Dolezal described them. Hate crimes are a real problem, and they shouldn't be discounted just because police don't always verify them. But the troubling pattern in Dolezal's stories is that they don't check out. Either the evidence contradicts her, or it doesn't support her, or it's her word against the word of somebody else, often somebody who is black or who has worked in the same human rights organizations. The more plausible hypothesis, when you compare Dolezal's allegations with the evidence produced by investigators and reporters, is that she came to see herself as part of an oppressed group, even though she wasn't. Maybe she wanted everyone else to see her that way, too. Did she interpret incidents as racial, even when the evidence didn't point that way? Did she exaggerate or distort what happened? Did she stage or fabricate evidence? Those questions are for the police. But from what we know so far, I don't think Dolezal acted out of malice. I think she understood that to be accepted as black, she had to share the pain. She wanted the public to see her as a target of harassment and discrimination. And for six years, she succeeded."	Rachel Dolezal's Most Disturbing Claims Are Over Her Own Victimization
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/jeb_bush_announcing_his_presidential_campaign_the_former_florida_governor.html	"As Jeb Bush formally enters the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, allow me to make a humble request of the former Florida governor: Please drop out. I appreciate that my request is impertinent in the extreme. Bush is by all accounts one of the most creative, thoughtful, and disciplined minds in American politics, and if anyone has earned the right to weigh in on the future direction of the GOP, it is him. I also appreciate that my timing is awful. To drop out immediately after entering the race would seem capricious, and no one wants to look like a flighty weirdo, least of all an elder statesman who deserves to be taken seriously. Rather than drop out this week or next, perhaps Bush can do what he does best and spend the next few months developing a series of substantive policy ideas that any future GOP nominee might embrace. He can elevate these ideas by touting them as an official candidate before dropping out some time in the fall. Think of this as a bait-and-switch, in the most benign sense. By suggesting that he is fully committed to running a serious presidential campaign, Bush can get a hearing for any number of ambitious reform proposals that might be ignored if they came from a think tank or an obscure congressional backbencher. Perhaps this is exactly what's going on--Bush's supposed presidential ambitions are in fact part of an elaborate long con, in which he dupes us into engaging with the question of what Social Security ought to look like in the future, when today's young adults retire, or how we should finance medical care in the coming age of revolutionary yet budget-busting life extension therapies. I, for one, would welcome such a deception. My fear, however, is that Bush is sincere: He believes not just that he is well-qualified to be president, which is fair enough, but that he has a realistic strategy for winning an actual presidential election against Hillary Clinton. I just don't see it. You know the basic argument: Fairly or unfairly, the Bush brand is tarnished, and Jeb Bush will have little choice but to be seen as a stand-in for his still unpopular older brother. Bush is a figure who has been around for a long time, and it's possible that he's too stale for an electorate hungry for change. I buy the idea that Bush has unique liabilities that would hurt him badly in a general election. This wouldn't be a problem if I believed that Bush would fare so poorly in the GOP primary that he'd have to drop out early, a not uncommon view among conservatives. All that would happen in that case is that Bush would waste the money of some of his wealthy friends, and he'd leave the race with a bruised ego. No big whoop. But here's the thing--Bush can absolutely win the nomination. Despite the fact that he is in the same ballpark as Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Ben Carson in poll after poll, he is in a much stronger position to win the nomination than any of them. So what does it mean if Bush has a very good chance to win the GOP nomination but very little chance of winning a general election? It means that a scorched-earth Bush campaign will make it impossible for any Republican to win in 2016. To understand why Jeb Bush has the upper hand going into the primaries, consider Henry Olsen's analysis of the ""four faces of the GOP."" In a 2014 essay in the National Interest, Olsen, a scholar at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, offered a new framework for understanding the Republican coalition. Instead of dividing the party between a moderate ""establishment"" and conservative ""insurgents,"" a narrative that's long since outlived its usefulness, he identifies four broad clusters of GOP voters. Even if Bush is not the first choice of all of these blocs, he's not truly unacceptable to any of them. One of the strange puzzles of GOP presidential politics is that though the Republican Party is an overwhelmingly conservative party, centrists wield disproportionate influence over the party's presidential nomination process. Moderates and liberals (by Republican standards, mind you) represent 25-30 percent of GOP primary voters in presidential years, and even more in early states like New Hampshire, Florida, and Michigan. These voters gravitate toward Republican candidates who aren't overtly religious, and who are less committed to tax and spending cuts than more conservative voters. Back in 2012, moderates and liberals embraced Ron Paul and Jon Huntsman early on in the campaign. Over time, however, they settled on Mitt Romney. In 2016, there are a number of candidates competing for these voters. Sen. Rand Paul's civil libertarianism might appeal to them, despite his hard-right stances on other issues. Govs. Chris Christie and John Kasich often emphasize their ability to work with Democrats and their support for expanding Medicaid, positions tailor-made for the GOP's moderate-liberal bloc. And Rubio has a decent shot too, due to his support for immigration reform, his talk of fighting poverty, and his generally inclusive vibe. But it's Bush who has the inside track with the RINO vote, who see his support for Common Core and immigration reform as proof of his seriousness and integrity. If the Christie and Kasich campaigns fizzle out for lack of money--not an entirely implausible outcome, given the Bush family's talent for hoovering up donor dollars--Bush will be able to consolidate GOP moderates under his banner by painting Paul as an extremist and Rubio as a naif. Very conservative evangelicals represent roughly one-fifth of the GOP primary electorate, though they are overrepresented in Southern and border states. Naturally, conservative evangelicals care deeply about opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage, yet they tend to be open to more populist messages on economic issues. Mike Huckabee won these voters in large numbers in 2008, Rick Santorum won them in 2012, and Ben Carson, Gov. Bobby Jindal, and Sen. Ted Cruz will join in chasing after them in 2016. Bush won't bother courting these voters, which is sensible, as these voters are unlikely to ever support him. Yet they'll also be so divided among so many different candidates that their opposition is unlikely to prevent him from winning the GOP nomination. Only about 5-10 percent of Republicans are very conservative, secular voters, yet Olsen observes that this group is massively overrepresented in the GOP intelligentsia, and so its mood swings garner outsized attention. As of now, I'd say that Walker and Cruz are the favorites of this camp, though Paul and Rick Perry have a shot with them. Note that Walker, Cruz, Paul, and Perry have all lauded the idea of a flat tax, a quasi-religious touchstone for very conservative seculars. Rubio might appeal to these voters, too. In an address to the anti-tax Club for Growth, he talked up the virtues of his own tax reform proposal, which would slash taxes on capital gains, a cause dear to the hearts of very conservative seculars, while not being entirely flat. These hyper-ideological voters are very suspicious of Bush, as they worry that he's the second coming of his brother. Even so, they'd definitely favor him over Huckabee, Santorum, or Carson, if it came down to that. But the biggest and most influential of Olsen's blocs are the ""somewhat conservative"" voters, who represent 35-40 percent of the primary vote. Somewhat conservatives ""like even-keeled men with substantial governing experience,"" yet they're also resistant to candidates who call for radical change or who seem eager to wage culture wars. This is Bush's sweet spot, in theory. He is, after all, an even-keeled man with substantial governing experience. Bush's most realistic rivals for the affections of somewhat conservatives are Rubio and Walker. That is why Bush intends to destroy Rubio and Walker. Lest you think I'm making this up, last week, Ed O'Keefe and Robert Costa of the Washington Post reported that the Bush camp is gearing up to launch attacks on various other Republican candidates, including Rubio, a longtime Bush friend and protege, and Walker. They are the two candidates who are the most plausible beneficiaries of a Bush exit, as both are candidates who manage to straddle the GOP's ideological and cultural divides. They've both raised large sums from wealthy conservative donors, who appreciate their pragmatism, yet conservative activists generally consider them ideologically sound. With Rubio and Walker out of the way, the race would be Bush against various intemperate wackos who will terrify that key bloc of always-sober somewhat conservatives. According to Olsen, it is somewhat conservatives who always choose the winner of GOP nomination contests, and it is easy to see why. Very conservative evangelicals tend to lose, as the candidates they love the most tend to repel moderates and liberals and very conservative seculars. Very conservative seculars, meanwhile, rarely get their first-choice candidates, as somewhat conservatives are skeptical of doctrinaire libertarian types, particularly when they seem a bit too secular. Moderates and liberals, similarly, will tend to coalesce around the candidate who is most acceptable to the somewhat conservatives. So there you have it. Even now, as Bush's proto-campaign underwhelms donors and activists, he has at least a 50-50 shot at winning the GOP nomination, thanks to the fact that he can make just enough Republicans dislike his most plausible opponents more than they dislike him. But will brutal attacks on Marco Rubio's youth and inexperience inspire young people? Will months of tearing into Scott Walker encourage blue-collar Midwestern swing voters to back Bush? Could it be that condemning Rand Paul as a reckless isolationist will prove to skeptical moderates that he's learned from the failures of George W. Bush's foreign policy? The Republican candidate who can win in 2016 is the candidate who can fight the Democratic candidate to a draw on the question of which candidate ""cares about people like me."" The fact that voters found Barack Obama more attuned to their economic anxieties than Mitt Romney is a big part of the reason Obama won, despite the fact that voters found much to like in Romney. Jeb Bush has many virtues. Relatability is not one of them. He should do the right thing and clear the way for the next generation of Republicans."	Why Jeb Bush Should Drop Out of the Race. Now.
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/rachel_dolezal_claims_to_be_black_the_naacp_official_was_part_of_the_african.html	"Rachel Dolezal is president of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the NAACP. She chairs a city police oversight commission. She jokes about being watched for a ""black"" reaction at movie theaters, and she posts photos of her ""natural"" curls. In her world, and that of her friends and colleagues, she is a black woman. But to her family, she's white. On Thursday, reports BuzzFeed, her parents told local media outlets that their daughter's heritage was Czech, Swedish, and German, with possible traces of Native American. This was prompted after Dolezal reported a hate crime--someone had purportedly mailed a threatening package to the local NAACP--that was challenged by postal workers who ""told police the envelope was not timestamped or canceled."" The only way it could have been delivered there, notes BuzzFeed, is if it ""had been placed there by a post office employee or someone who had the P.O. Box key."" When the report of the hate crime hit local newscasts, her parents stepped in, challenging Dolezal's entire narrative. When asked why their daughter would construct this identity, her parents gave a guess: ""She has over the past 20 years assimilated herself into the African-American community through her various advocacy and social justice work, and so that may be part of the answer."" This is a bizarre story, made difficult by the fact that we don't have a language for this kind of white-to-black ""passing."" Many Americans, and especially blacks, are familiar with black-to-white ""passing,"" whereby black Americans with European features present and identify as white. In A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life, historian Allyson Hobbs describes men and women who left their black families to live in a white world. Elsie Roxborough, for example, was a black elite. Raised in Michigan, her father became the state's first black senator in 1930. She was the first black girl to live in a dorm at the University of Michigan, and after graduation, tried her hand as a playwright in Chicago and as an actor in California. But success eluded her, and in search of it, she decided to pass. In 1937, still a young woman, she dyed her hair auburn, learned enough Spanish to feign foreign origins, changed her name to Mona Manet, and moved to New York. It's here her story takes an even sadder turn. Her father refused to support her, and she eventually committed suicide. On her death certificate, her race was listed as white. Of course there were also black Americans who could pass but chose to stay in the black community. Walter Francis White led the national staff of the NAACP for nearly a quarter-century, from 1931 to 1955. The child of formerly enslaved people, White looked, well, white. And yet he chose blackness. ""I am a Negro,"" he wrote in his autobiography A Man Called White. ""My skin is white, my eyes are blue, my hair is blond. The traits of my race are nowhere visible upon me."" That description--or at least, the first part--would also fit Mordecai Wyatt Johnson, the first black president of Howard University, the historically black university in Washington, D.C. (and alma mater of Dolezal). Like White, Johnson was the son of two former slaves. And like White, he didn't look black. Both phenomena, of blacks who chose to pass and of blacks who could but abstained, illustrate the porous reality of race, and more crucially, how it's distinct from ethnicity. On one hand, ""black"" is a statement of identity. It describes a certain culture and a certain history, tied to the lives and experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants. It's a fluid culture, with room for a huge variety of people, from whites, to blacks, to people of Latin American and Caribbean descent. On the other hand, however, it describes the bottom rung in the American racial hierarchy. It's a construct, but it was built from physical features, as colonial Americans took Africans, made them slaves, and made them ""black."" It designates the people who could be enslaved; the people who had to live under Jim Crow; the people who could be denied mortgage loans and crammed into ghettos; the people who can be plundered by petty municipal authorities. The two are separate but related. I am a descendent of slaves with strong African features. This makes me culturally black--I identify with the American national group--and racially black; I'm more likely to face overt discrimination than my white friends. And in all likelihood, this would also be true if my mother (or father) were white. I would still have African features, I would still have a connection to black American history, and I would still occupy the bottom rung of the racial hierarchy. But if I were born with lighter skin and more European features, I might be able to escape the stigma of blackness. I would still have the cultural connection, but I wouldn't occupy the same place in the hierarchy. What's key is that you can't choose your position in the hierarchy. The political designation of race is a function of power--or, put differently, you are whatever the dominant group says you are. A Nigerian immigrant might not identify with black Americans, but she's still ""black,"" regardless of what she says, and if she gets pulled over by the police, that identity will matter most. And on the other end, a black American with dark skin and African features could identify as white with her friends, but in society, she's black, regardless of how she feels. Which brings us back to Rachel Dolezal. Is she black just because she says she is? In her favor are key parts of her life. Dolezal has identified as black for almost 10 years. She's been heavily involved in the local black community, and a leader on issues important to black people. She has no apparent black ancestry--a real difference from blacks who pass--but she's adopted a kind of black culture almost wholesale. If Walter Francis White is black, and Mordecai Wyatt Johnson is black, then why can't Rachel Dolezal be black, even if her connections were manufactured? Then again, her story involves lies and misrepresentations. She passed off a darker-skinned stranger as her father, and an adopted sibling as her son. There's a chance she faked a hate crime against her, and she falsely claimed she was born in a tepee with a family that hunted for its food. She says she's black, but we don't know if she's always black. Is she black when she's purchasing a home? Talking to the police? Or is she black only when vying for a role where lived experience would help her odds? To belong to the black community is to inherit a rich and important culture; to be racially black is to face discrimination and violence. And that has often gone for whites who identify with blacks, or for blacks who appear to be white. When investigating a lynching in Arkansas, White had to flee when locals learned he was a black man ""masquerading"" as a white one. Viola Liuzzo, a civil rights activist, was shot dead by Klansmen for assisting other activists. She was white. We don't know the entirety of Dolezal's story, and we will likely learn more. If it's troubling, it's at least partly because it feels like Dolezal is adopting the culture without carrying the burdens. And with the fake father and the fake children, it seems like she's deceiving people for the sake of an a la carte blackness, in which you take the best parts, and leave the pain aside."

Consider the chief justice's voting record. From 2005--the year he was appointed--until 2012--the year of the first Affordable Care Act decision--Roberts was a reliable vote on the court's staunch conservative wing. In controversies from abortion to campaign finance to guns, Roberts sided with Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Anthony Kennedy. The 2012 health care case was only the second time Roberts had ever voted with the liberal side of the court in a 5-4 decision.* Lately, however, we're seeing a very different Roberts. Last term Roberts surprised many by breaking left on a few major cases. And so far this term, Roberts has voted with Stephen Breyer (90 percent), Ruth Bader Ginsburg (85 percent), and Sonia Sotomayor (83 percent) more often than he has joined Thomas (66 percent), Kennedy (74 percent), and Alito (77 percent). And that isn't just on minor cases. He's recently sided with the liberals in cases on issues that typically divide the court along ideological lines, including campaign finance and anti-discrimination law. Little wonder then that some conservatives ask if Roberts is ""going wobbly."" While court watchers have recognized and speculated over Roberts' shift to the left, the reason for the shift remains obscure. Beyond amorphous notions of Roberts' special concerns for his ""legacy"" or the court's ""legitimacy,"" what accounts for Roberts' recent move to moderation? Only he truly knows the answer, but one possibility is that Roberts has learned something from his time on the bench. In particular, his transformation might have been influenced by two specific cases: one high-profile, the other largely forgotten. Few Supreme Court decisions have sparked more controversy and subjected the court to more widespread criticism than its 2010 ruling in the campaign finance reform case Citizens United. The court's 5-4 decision, with Roberts in the majority, held that corporations and unions have a First Amendment right to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. The decision put the court at the very epicenter of political debate--precisely the place Roberts said he wanted to avoid during his confirmation hearings. The ruling, which many believe benefits the GOP, has been seen as partisan; almost no one sees Citizens United as simply a matter of balls and strikes. It was also anything but the kind of small, incremental steps Roberts claimed to prefer when altering existing doctrine. If one wanted an explanation for why Roberts changed his vote in the first Affordable Care Act case in 2012, Citizens United would be a good place to start. According to Jeffrey Toobin, Citizens United was ""orchestrated"" by Roberts. Yet the opposite is likely true. Roberts preferred a narrow ruling in Citizens United but was persuaded by his conservative colleagues to join a very broad, precedent-reversing decision that radically shifted the terrain of campaign finance law. The country, across political lines, was angry. And two years later the Affordable Care Act case looked like a repeat performance: The chief justice sought a narrow ruling voiding the individual mandate while his conservative colleagues pushed for a more aggressive ruling that would overturn the whole law, including the hundreds of provisions on issues that didn't relate in any way to the constitutionality of the mandate. As reporting at the time revealed, on the eve of a presidential election that promised to make the court's decision the biggest issue in the campaign, Roberts seemingly balked. He wasn't following his friends down the rabbit hole again. Roberts may also have learned a similar, valuable lesson from a far less familiar ruling: House v. Bell, from Roberts' very first term on the court. Few remember the facts of this case--Paul House, a man sentenced to death, won the right to file a habeas petition in federal court--but you can bet Roberts will never forget it. Joined by Scalia and Thomas, Roberts wrote a partial dissent that contemptuously dismissed House's claims of innocence.* To House's contention that his scratches and bruises were from his construction work and a cat's claws, Roberts derisively replied, ""Scratches from a cat, indeed."" Several years later, however, prosecutors dropped all charges against House, who was exonerated by DNA evidence. House is the type of case that should cause any justice to second-guess his or her own intuitions and judgments. Certainly it offered Roberts an object lesson in the perils of judicial overconfidence: Don't be so certain you are right even when you are certain you are right. On some issues, like voting rights, Roberts' views may be so longstanding and firmly held as to be immune to moderation. And some of his seemingly liberal votes may be strategic, part of what legal scholar and Slate contributor Richard Hasen calls Roberts' ""long game."" Yet somehow the spirit of compromise, if not the ghost of Paul House, haunts the chief justice's chambers. No one doubts that Roberts leans right jurisprudentially. Yet over the past two terms, we've seen evidence that Roberts has become a bit more circumspect of his own jurisprudential views and perhaps more wary of those of his conservative colleagues. Carrie Severino of the right-leaning Judicial Crisis Network says, ""There certainly seems like a more consistent pattern on the part of Scalia, Thomas, and Alito of being really conservative to the core."" In this way, we might see the conservative wing of the court in a similar light as the intramural wars plaguing the Republican party in general: Mainstream conservatives find themselves trying to fight off the more radical, burn-down-the-house Tea Partiers. Some on the court seem less interested in incremental steps than infernos. Of course, there are two major decisions yet to come this term that will color any analysis of Roberts for years, if not decades, to come: King v. Burwell, on the availability of subsidies on the federally created health care exchanges, and Obergefell v. Hodges, on the right of same-sex couples to marry. No one outside the court knows how those cases will come out, but don't be surprised if once again Roberts defects from the Scalia/Thomas/Alito wing. By now he's learned to watch out for where his friends might take him. Correction, June 26, 2015: This article originally misstated that the 2012 health care case was the first time Roberts had ever voted with the liberal side of the court in a 5-4 decision. It was the second time. This article originally stated that Scalia, Thomas, and Alito joined Roberts in a partial dissent in House v. Bell. Alito did not participate in that decision. (Return.)"

Marco Rubio is bad with money. When he entered public life in 2000, he had little to his name and a mountain of debt. ""[H]e reported a net worth of zero, about $150,000 in student loan debt, and $30,000 in what he called assorted credit and retail debt,"" notes the New York Times in a much-read story on his financial troubles. Despite this, however, he's been profligate with money. In 2003, after a brief period of ""belt-tightening,"" he purchased his mother-in-law's home for $175,000 with no money down. Two years later, after earning a six-figure salary with a high-profile law firm, he purchased a $135,000 home in Tallahassee, Florida, again, with no money down. And then, by the end of 2005, ""the Rubios completed the purchase of a new home, twice the size of their previous one, for $550,000.""

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/mckinney_texas_police_misconduct_at_swimming_pool_party_america_s_ugly_history.html	"On Friday a group of black teenagers went to a community pool in McKinney, Texas. They were there for a pool party, advertised on social media. At some point, not long after they arrived, nearby residents--who were white--began to harass the swimmers. When one woman told the teens to ""go back to Section 8 housing,"" a fight broke out. Another resident called the police, who--according to one witness--began to arrest the black teenagers, ignoring the white swimmers in the group. When one bystander--a 15-year-old black girl--wouldn't leave, an officer handcuffed her, threw her to the ground, and pinned her with his knee. And when two of her friends approached the officer struggling with the teenage girl, he drew his gun to scare them off. All of this is on video, and it's drawn millions of views as another example of police abuse against black Americans. The officer has been put on administrative leave, and the department is investigating the incident. It's easy to just focus on the police misconduct and excessive use of force at what was an end-of-the-school-year party for teens. But the fact that it took place at a community pool in a largely white area gives it additional weight, in that it echoes the long and violent struggles over integrated swimming in the middle of the 20th century, struggles that changed the residential landscape and redefined civil society for a generation--and now, generations--of Americans. For a time, swimming was America's national pastime. Between 1920 and 1940, local, state, and federal authorities built nearly 2,000 municipal pools in towns and cities across the United States. You could find them in metropolises like Chicago and Philadelphia or small Kansas towns with fewer people than city tenements. These were communal, public spaces, and Americans loved them. In 1937, St. Louis, Missouri, counted 1.4 million swimmers in its municipal pools, writes historian Jeff Wiltse in Contested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America, who also points to a 1934 article in Fortune magazine that estimated that upwards of 30 million Americans swam in pools a total of 350 million times each year. By the 1960s, however, the millions of Americans who had previously spent their summer days at public pools had abandoned them. The era of the municipal pool was over. The reason, explains Wiltse, was desegregation. The rise of public swimming had coincided with the Great Migration and the hardening of the racial caste system, North and South. Middle-class whites who were willing to swim with working-class immigrants--a major shift from the early 20th century, when pools were segregated by class--refused to share water with blacks. They didn't just fear racial contamination--citing well-worn statistics about black mortality rates in Northern cities--they feared miscegenation. ""They feared,"" writes Wiltse, ""that black men would act upon their supposedly untamed sexual desire for white women by touching them in the water and assaulting them with romantic advances."" And so whites segregated the pools. But in the 1950s, this barrier fell apart as civil rights activists launched assault after assault on Jim Crow swimming. In 1949 after a city official said he ""could see no basis for keeping Negroes out of the pool,"" a group of black Americans--mostly boys and girls--tried to integrate the Fairground Park pool in St. Louis. In retaliation, a crowd of 200 whites--armed with bats, clubs, bricks, and knives--tried to chase blacks out of the pool. They were soon joined by thousands of other white St. Louisians, who beat black swimmers and chased others away, attacking any black American who came in view. But eventually in St. Louis and other cities, black Americans and their allies prevailed. In a series of rulings beginning in 1950, federal courts ended segregation in municipal pools, inching toward an attack on the ""separate but equal"" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson. The white reaction was predictable. In the summer of 1948, the Fairground Park pool recorded 313,000 swims. The city closed the pool after the riots, but in 1950--the first summer of interracial swimming in St. Louis--the number of recorded swims in public pools plunged to 60,000. ""The attendance statistics for subsequent summers reveal the full effect of desegregation,"" writes Wiltse. ""[Ten thousand] swims in 1951, 20,000 in 1952, 20,000 in 1953, and 25,000 in 1954."" Likewise, at another city pool, attendance dropped from an average of 300,000 swims per summer to 24,000. And at both pools, most of the patrons were black. As integration came to the United States, municipal pools were closed, filled in, or left in disrepair. Americans still swam, of course. But they honed their skills in private pools. As the civil rights movement gained steam, millions of mostly white Americans built residential pools or joined private pool clubs, organized by suburban associations. Here's Wiltse:"	Our Ugly History of Segregated Swimming

Clementa Pinckney, the slain pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, President Obama spoke on the Confederate flag, which still flew at the state Capitol in Columbia. ""Removing the flag from this state's Capitol would not be an act of political correctness; it would not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers. It would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought--the cause of slavery--was wrong. The imposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War, the resistance to civil rights for all people was wrong,"" he said. ""It would be one step in an honest accounting of America's history, a modest but meaningful balm for so many unhealed wounds."" The next morning, on Saturday, Bree Newsome--a North Carolina-based artist and activist--scaled the flagpole outside the South Carolina Statehouse to remove the flag herself, in an outsized act of civil disobedience. She was arrested, but not before she made a national impression with the latest--and most dramatic--act against the Confederate flag. Per Obama, the truth of the Confederate flag shift is that, after a century of this distorted remembrance, the South--and the country at large--is making an overdue correction. And although it comes out of tragedy--a racist allegedly killed nine black people with the flag as a backdrop to his hate--it also reflects the fact of the modern South, a growing, more cosmopolitan place, with vibrant cities, Latino immigration, Northern transplants, and a ""reverse migration"" of black Americans from around the country. If the past is a place we construct--one that says as much about us as it does the people we remember--then this South isn't erasing history; it's working to build a more truthful narrative of the Civil War for a broader, more diverse generation of Southerners. And the push against Confederate flags is just the beginning. With a vast landscape of monuments and plantations, Southerners of all colors will have to place this constructed past in its honest context before they try to build a more usable history for themselves and their descendants. It's no surprise that, even as the dead had lain in wake, there was a backlash to the transformation. ""It's our own mini-French Revolution, expunging history in a frenzy of self-righteousness. Luckily, so far: 1st time tragedy, 2nd time farce,"" wrote the Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol on Twitter. ""With all due deference to hatred for a Confederate flag on a pole at the statehouse, this seems like an almost childlike attempt to miss the seriousness of the situation,"" wrote Mollie Hemingway at the Federalist, comparing anti-flag journalists to the Taliban militants who destroyed sixth-century Buddhist statues in 2001. And in an essay for National Review, Kevin Williamson blasted liberals for alleged hypocrisy: ""It is strange and ironic that adherents of the Democratic party--which was, for about 140 years, not only the South's but the world's leading white-supremacist organization--should work themselves up over one flag, raised by their fellow partisans, at this late a date; but, well, welcome to the party."" To call the backlash to the flag opportunism, though, is to miss the decades of anti-flag activism from ordinary Southerners that coalesced in the present moment. Each critic opposes the flag and wants it to come down. What they dislike is the perceived disdain and disrespect in the sudden push against Confederate paraphernalia, as well as a touch of the totalitarian--a drive to ""purge"" public memory of unhappy, inconvenient history. ""We're, in a way, blowing up parts of history,"" said conservative radio host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday. ""[They're] moving on from the flag to statues, memorials, perhaps Civil War re-enactments, until what else? What else becomes an untouchable or unshowable in our society?"" Underneath this hyperbole are real concerns, shared by those Southerners who see heritage, not hatred, in the Confederate battle flag. ""This is an emotional time and we all need to think through these issues with a care that recognizes the need for change but also respects the complicated history of the Civil War,"" wrote former Virginia senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Jim Webb in a call for nuance and understanding. Webb, like Ingraham, Williamson, Hemingway, and Kristol, is right that Americans need nuance, that we shouldn't ignore or erase history out of offense or discomfort. But they go wrong when they tie this notion of honest history to the Confederate battle flag. Far from an authentic symbol of Southern heritage and ancestry, the flag is a propaganda coup, the end point of 150 years of myth-making. The same goes for the countless Confederate monuments that mark the Southern landscape, from equestrian statues of Robert E. Lee and mountain carvings of Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, to highways named for Jefferson Davis and schools named for Nathan Bedford Forrest, father of the Ku Klux Klan. Each calls back to a pre- and post-war romanticism, where the Civil War was a gentlemen's conflict of dueling ideals--autonomy versus central authority, agrarian democracy versus industrial capitalism--between brilliant, honorable Southerners and their determined, better-equipped opponents in the North. But this story is a lie. Far from the peaceful society of a young Scarlett O'Hara, the antebellum South was a brutal archipelago of slave labor camps governed by an aristocracy of planters and slave traders. Those men fought the Civil War to preserve slavery and expand it in a vast empire of bondage. ""Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery--the greatest material interest of the world,"" wrote the Mississippi secessionists. ""The people of the slave holding States are bound together by the same necessity and determination to preserve African slavery,"" echoed their counterparts in Louisiana. Far from glorious, this war for slavery was savage. At the Battle of Fort Pillow in Tennessee, Confederate troops under Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest massacred a surrendering Union force of free-born blacks and former slaves. Likewise, in Centralia, Missouri, Confederate guerrillas executed almost two-dozen Union soldiers after looting a passenger train. And during the Gettysburg campaign, the Army of Northern Virginia--led by Gen. Robert E. Lee--commenced a kidnapping campaign, raiding Pennsylvania towns, capturing free blacks, and sending them South into slavery. After the war, however, former Confederate leaders would work to obscure the causes and the conduct of the war, building a new narrative of the conflict. Slavery, wrote Jefferson Davis in his defense of the Southern cause, ""was in no wise the cause of the conflict, but only an incident."" The South, instead, was fighting against the ""unlimited, despotic power"" of the federal government and its ""tremendous and sweeping usurpation"" of states' rights. ""It is a postulate, with many writers of this day, that the late War was the result of two opposing ideas, or principles, upon the subject of African Slavery. ... Those who assume this postulate, and so theorize upon it, are but superficial observers,"" wrote former Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, just three years after the war had ended and seven years after he gave his Cornerstone Speech defending slavery as the foundation of Southern life. ""[T]he conflict,"" he continued, ""arose from different and opposing ideas as to the nature of what is known as the General Government."" Concurrent with this whitewash of the causes of the war was a push to enshrine Confederate military leadership as the standard of Southern bravery and valor. Throughout the South, ex-Confederates built and erected monuments to Lee, to Forrest, and to Jackson. It's here that Lee attains his still-high stature as a gentleman and military genius, despite his slave-holding, his defense of slavery, and a mixed generalship that failed to achieve Confederate war aims, even when odds were with him. But it's in the wake of Reconstruction and the white Southern victory over black and Northern political power, notes historian David Blight in Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, that these monuments became part of a narrative of restoration and victory, and an antecedent to today's nostalgia:"	Obama Called for an Honest Accounting of America's History. Here's How to Do It.
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/supreme_court_gay_marriage_decision_why_politicians_and_judges_moved_so.html	"Over a remarkably brief period of time, same-sex civil marriage has gone from being a cause advanced by a small handful of activists to one that's been embraced by 60 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans under the age of 30. As we contemplate the monumental Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, it's worth stopping to consider why support for same-sex marriage has grown so rapidly. One possibility is that there is a network externality effect at work, as the sociologist Gabriel Rossman suggested back in 2009. Rossman argued that same-sex marriage gained ground in part because influential policymakers were desperate not to be on the wrong side of history. While policymakers shift their stances on all kinds of issues, some of them take on greater weight than others. When we look back at defenders of segregation, for example, we look upon them differently than we do on those who argued that Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System was going to be a colossal flop. Precisely because same-sex marriage is such a morally charged issue, the stakes for getting it wrong are high. The louder, more definitive the position you take against same-sex marriage, the more embarrassed you might be in the future. While I'm sure that many of the politicians who have had a sudden conversion on the subject of same-sex marriage in the last few years are entirely sincere in their change of heart, and would have shifted on the issue even if doing so came at great personal cost, I imagine that rather a lot of them are as calculating and self-interested as the rest of us: They saw where the young and influential were heading, and they didn't want to get left behind. Hunter Schwarz of the Fix reminds us that while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton often tout their support for same-sex marriage, they embraced the issue only when it was overwhelmingly popular among Democrats. Barack Obama famously told Rick Warren of Saddleback Church that he opposed it on biblical grounds, though supporters of same-sex marriage didn't seem to believe him. Among liberal politicians, it is entirely plausible there has long been a great deal of secret support for same-sex marriage, but as liberal candidates in the 2008 cycle, Obama and Clinton felt they had to defer to opposition to same-sex marriage among voters, at least for a time. As public opinion shifted, more liberal politicians felt that they could show their true colors. My sense is that something similar is at work among conservative politicians, albeit on a delayed timetable. Conservatives are far more likely to oppose same-sex marriage than liberals, yet opinion among conservative voters is shifting, and I'd be shocked if conservative politicians didn't shift with it. Public opinion matters for candidates for office, but it also matters for judges. Support for same-sex marriage is even more overwhelming among the highly educated, particularly in America's larger cities, than it is among the general public, and to oppose same-sex marriage is increasingly to invite opprobrium in these circles. The justices of the Supreme Court are certainly familiar with this social milieu, and several of them are very much a part of it. As Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School, has put it, ""[a] judge or Justice who is asked to preside over the same-sex wedding of a former law clerk cannot help finding the experience relevant to how he or she views the constitutionality of a law forbidding such a ceremony."" When we consider the justices through this lens, it should come as no surprise that the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. But there is a bit more to it than that. Back in 2005, Peter Berkowitz, a conservative political theorist, made the case that the triumph of same-sex civil marriage was all but inevitable. The reason he gave was that arguments that can be made in the language of individual freedom almost always win out in the constitutional realm over those grounded in other considerations. One could argue that the debate over abortion is a clash between two interpretations of what individual freedom demands. Do we protect the autonomy of women or do we protect the rights of unborn children? The fact that both sides of the abortion debate can be rooted in the language of individual freedom has kept the debate alive. But the debate over same-sex marriage is different. Advocates of same-sex marriage insist that the organization of intimate relations should be left up to the individuals in question, an idea that has become an article of faith among modern Americans. Proponents alone are rooting their arguments in individual freedoms. Critics of same-sex marriage, in contrast, tend to emphasize the potential harms children might experience as society moves away from traditional marriage. The problem is that this is a line of argument that might also apply to permitting premarital cohabitation, promiscuity, no-fault divorce, and a permissive attitude toward adultery, among other behaviors that the state chooses not to regulate on grounds of personal freedom. ""Because it is more difficult to translate arguments against same-sex marriage into the language of freedom,"" Berkowitz observed, ""there is a good chance that should the issue come before the Supreme Court, some majority of the justices will hold that the Constitution requires it."" He was right, though even he was probably surprised at how quickly his prediction came true. Read more of Slate's coverage of same-sex marriage at the Supreme Court."	Why Politicians--on Both Sides of the Aisle--Moved So Swiftly to Embrace Same-Sex Marriage
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/gay_marriage_votes_and_andrew_sullivan_his_landmark_1989_essay_making_a.html	"In 1989, most Americans had never even heard of gay marriage, and certainly couldn't conceive that it would one day be legalized by popular vote. That year, Andrew Sullivan wrote a landmark essay for the New Republic, ""Here Comes the Groom: A (Conservative) Case for Gay Marriage."" Sullivan's essay is one of the most important magazine articles of recent decades. His argument, which he went on to elaborate in his books Virtually Normal and Same-Sex Marriage and in later essays, is that marriage for gays would ""foster social cohesion, emotional security, and economic prudence."" Sullivan's conservative case would eventually become the intellectual and moral foundation of the campaigns to legalize gay marriage. Sullivan gave Slate permission to reprint his New Republic essay in full. Last month in New York, a court ruled that a gay lover had the right to stay in his deceased partner's rent-control apartment because the lover qualified as a member of the deceased's family. The ruling deftly annoyed almost everybody. Conservatives saw judicial activism in favor of gay rent control: three reasons to be appalled. Chastened liberals (such as the New York Times editorial page), while endorsing the recognition of gay relationships, also worried about the abuse of already stretched entitlements that the ruling threatened. What neither side quite contemplated is that they both might be right, and that the way to tackle the issue of unconventional relationships in conventional society is to try something both more radical and more conservative than putting courts in the business of deciding what is and is not a family. That alternative is the legalization of civil gay marriage. The New York rent-control case did not go anywhere near that far, which is the problem. The rent-control regulations merely stipulated that a ""family"" member had the right to remain in the apartment. The judge ruled that to all intents and purposes a gay lover is part of his lover's family, inasmuch as a ""family"" merely means an interwoven social life, emotional commitment, and some level of financial interdependence. It's principle now well established around the country. Several cities have ""domestic partnership"" laws, which allow relationships that do not fit into the category of heterosexual marriage to be registered with the city and qualify for benefits that up till now have been reserved for straight married couples. San Francisco, Berkeley, Madison, and Los Angeles all have legislation, as does the politically correct Washington, D.C., suburb, Takoma Park. In these cities, a variety of interpersonal arrangements qualify for health insurance, bereavement leave, insurance, annuity and pension rights, housing rights (such as rent-control apartments), adoption and inheritance rights. Eventually, accordng to gay lobby groups, the aim is to include federal income tax and veterans' benefits as well. A recent case even involved the right to use a family member's accumulated frequent-flier points. Gays are not the only beneficiaries; heterosexual ""live-togethers"" also qualify. There's an argument, of course, that the current legal advantages extended to married people unfairly discriminate against people who've shaped their lives in less conventional arrangements. But it doesn't take a genius to see that enshrining in the law a vague principle like ""domestic partnership"" is an invitation to qualify at little personal cost for a vast array of entitlements otherwise kept crudely under control. To be sure, potential DPs have to prove financial interdependence, shared living arrangements, and a commitment to mutual caring. But they don't need to have a sexual relationship or even closely mirror old-style marriage. In principle, an elderly woman and her live-in nurse could qualify. A couple of uneuphemistically confirmed bachelors could be DPs. So could two close college students, a pair of seminarians, or a couple of frat buddies. Left as it is, the concept of domestic partnership could open a Pandora's box of litigation and subjective judicial decision-making about who qualifies. You either are or are not married; it's not a complex question. Whether you are in a ""domestic partnership"" is not so clear. More important, the concept of domestic partnership chips away at the prestige of traditional relationships and undermines the priority we give them. This priority is not necessarily a product of heterosexism. Consider heterosexual couples. Society has good reason to extend legal advantages to heterosexuals who choose the formal sanction of marriage over simply living together. They make a deeper commitment to one another and to society; in exchange, society extends certain benefits to them. Marriage provides an anchor, if an arbitrary and weak one, in the chaos of sex and relationships to which we are all prone. It provides a mechanism for emotional stability, economic security, and the healthy rearing of the next generation. We rig the law in its favor not because we disparage all forms of relationship other than the nuclear family, but because we recognize that not to promote marriage would be to ask too much of human virtue. In the context of the weakened family's effect upon the poor, it might also invite social disintegration. One of the worst products of the New Right's ""family values"" campaign is that its extremism and hatred of diversity has disguised this more measured and more convincing case for the importance of the marital bond. The concept of domestic partnership ignores these concerns, indeed directly attacks them. This is a pity, since one of its most important objectives--providing some civil recognition for gay relationships--is a noble cause and one completely compatible with the defense of the family. But the way to go about it is not to undermine straight marriage; it is to legalize old-style marriage for gays. The gay movement has ducked this issue primarily out of fear of division. Much of the gay leadership clings to notions of gay life as essentially outsider, anti-bourgeois, radical. Marriage, for them, is co-optation into straight society. For the Stonewall generation, it is hard to see how this vision of conflict will ever fundamentally change. But for many other gays--my guess, a majority--while they don't deny the importance of rebellion 20 years ago and are grateful for what was done, there's now the sense of a new opportunity. A need to rebel has quietly ceded to a desire to belong. To be gay and to be bourgeois no longer seems such an absurd proposition. Certainly since AIDS, to be gay and to be responsible has become a necessity. Gay marriage squares several circles at the heart of the domestic partnership debate. Unlike domestic partnership, it allows for recognition of gay relationships, while casting no aspersions on traditional marriage. It merely asks that gays be allowed to join in. Unlike domestic partnership, it doesn't open up avenues for heterosexuals to get benefits without the responsibilities of marriage, or a nightmare of definitional litigation. And unlike domestic partnership, it harnesses to an already established social convention the yearnings for stability and acceptance among a fast-maturing gay community. Gay marriage also places more responsibilities upon gays; it says for the first time that gay relationships are not better or worse than straight relationships, and that the same is expected of them. And it's clear and dignified. There's a legal benefit to a clear, common symbol of commitment. There's also a personal benefit. One of the ironies of domestic partnership is that it's not only more complicated than marriage, it's more demanding, requiring an elaborate statement of intent to qualify. It amounts to a substantial invasion of privacy. Why, after all, should gays be required to prove commitment before they get married in a way we would never dream of asking of straights? Legalizing gay marriage would offer homosexuals the same deal society now offers heterosexuals: general social approval and specific legal advantages in exchange for a deeper and harder-to-extract-yourself-from commitment to another human being. Like straight marriage, it would foster social cohesion, emotional security, and economic prudence. Since there's no reason gays should not be allowed to adopt or be foster parents, it could also help nurture children. And its introduction would not be some sort of radical break with social custom. As it has become more acceptable for gay people to acknowledge their loves publicly, more and more have committed themselves to one another for life in full view of their families and their friends. A law institutionalizing gay marriage would merely reinforce a healthy social trend. It would also, in the wake of AIDS, qualify as a genuine public health measure. Those conservatives who deplore promiscuity among some homosexuals should be among the first to support it. Burke could have written a powerful case for it. The argument that gay marriage would subtly undermine the unique legitimacy of straight marriage is based upon a fallacy. For heterosexuals, straight marriage would remain the most significant--and only legal social bond. Gay marriage could only delegitimize straight marriage if it were a real alternative to it, and this is clearly not true. To put it bluntly, there's precious little evidence that straights could be persuaded by any law to have sex with-let alone marry--someone of their own sex. The only possible effect of this sort would be to persuade gay men and women who force themselves into heterosexual marriage (often at appalling cost to themselves and their families) to find a focus for their family instincts in a more personally positive environment. But this is clearly a plus, not a minus: gay marriage could both avoid a lot of tortured families and create the possibility for many happier ones. It is not, in short, a denial of family values. It's an extension of them. Of course, some would claim that any legal recognition of homosexuality is a de facto attack upon heterosexuality. But even the most hardened conservatives recognize that gays are a permanent minority and aren't likely to go away. Since persecution is not an option in a civilized society, why not coax gays into traditional values rather than rail incoherently against them? There's a less elaborate argument for gay marriage: it's good for gays. It provides role models for young gay people who, after the exhilaration of coming out, can easily lapse into short-term relationships and insecurity with no tangible goal in sight. My own guess is that most gays would embrace such a goal with as much (if not more) commitment as straights. Even in our society as it is, many lesbian relationships are virtual textbook cases of monogamous commitment. Legal gay marriage could also help bridge the gulf often found between gays and their parents. It could bring the essence of gay life-a gay couple--into the heart of the traditional straight family in a way the family can most understand and the gay offspring can most easily acknowledge. It could do as much to heal the gay-straight rift as any amount of gay rights legislation. If these arguments sound socially conservative, that's no accident. It's one of the richest ironies of our society's blind spot toward gays that essentially conservative social goals should have the appearance of being so radical. But gay marriage is not a radical step. It avoids the mess of domestic partnership; it is humane; it is conservative in the best sense of the word. It's also about relationships. Given that gay relationships will always exist, what possible social goal is advanced by framing the law to encourage those relationships to be unfaithful, undeveloped, and insecure?

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/obama_s_king_v_burwell_win_how_the_president_s_health_care_victory_affects.html	"When President Obama heralded the Supreme Court victory for the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, he circled back to his fundamental vision of politics. ""That's when America soars, when we look out for one another, when we take care of each other,"" he said. ""That's why we do what we do. That's the whole point of public service."" President Obama has faced a series of existential threats to his health care law, from the original votes, to the elections of 2010, 2012, and 2014, to the two Supreme Court cases. Whenever he's found himself in one of these moments, he's returned to the wellspring of his public service, to the idea that Americans are at their finest when they're protecting one another. Perhaps his most compelling expression of the idea came in the pitch he made five years ago on the eve of the ACA vote, in what remains the most emotional pitch the president has ever made for the legislation. He quoted Lincoln: ""I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true."" In other words, it might be politically risky, but politicians had to be true to themselves, and to the people they'd pledged to serve. But listening to Obama talk Thursday, I was reminded of a different speech, given at one of the first presidential rallies of his that I covered, just a week after he announced he was running. ""There has always been another tradition in politics,"" he told the crowd of 3,000 in Columbia, South Carolina. ""This idea that says we are connected as a people. Just because the world as it is is unjust and just because the world as it is is full of strife and violence and poverty ... just because that's the world we see in front of us now doesn't mean it is the world as it has to be, and politics can close that gap."" Eight years later the rhetoric about caring and connection is still there, even if the idea that politics can close the gap between our ideals and our reality has been shredded and stepped on. The health care fight has been bitter, and on the eve of this victory, the White House was prepared for defeat. The speechwriter Cody Keenan had written two versions of the speech, to be ready for both outcomes. The one written in case of defeat has been filed in Keenan's ""Concession Speeches"" folder and is signed by the president: ""Didn't need this one, brother!"" Still: This was a triumph for the president. His signature domestic achievement has survived yet another assault and almost certainly one of the last ones. ""The Affordable Care Act is here to stay,"" said the president. It is ""woven into the fabric of America."" The president has solidified a portion of his legislative legacy, and in his remarks, he clearly had history on his mind. ""Someday our grandkids will ask us if there was really a time when America discriminated against people who get sick."" This was not just a victory for his vision for how health care should be delivered. The court also affirmed a key part of his economic legacy. The president and his staff have long pointed out that in a period when household income has plateaued and wages stagnated, what voters most often say is that they are working harder and falling behind. When you ask them what that means to them in practical terms, they often talk about the cost of health care and the fear that their health care might disappear if they were to lose their job. Middle-class economic security, in other words, isn't just tied to having a job and getting good pay. That security is tied to whether you will lose coverage or be bankrupted by the cost of coverage if you get sick. Obama made that economic link explicit in the Rose Garden on Thursday: ""We chose to write a new chapter where, in a new economy, Americans are free to change their jobs or start a business, chase a new idea, raise a family free from fear, secure in the knowledge that portable, affordable health care is there for us and always will be and that if we get sick, we're not going to lose our home, that if we get sick, that we're going to be able to still look after our families."" Last week Obama seemed exhausted by the tragedy in Charleston and by a gun debate he couldn't budge. This week he has enjoyed a battered, tattered success in a battle that has been going on for nearly a decade. He also won the passage of his trade bill, which had looked imperiled just a week before. The president has one more task ahead of him this week, a solemn speech in Charleston at the funeral of Mother Emanuel pastor Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the racist rampage. Race was also a topic in that first rally I watched shortly after Obama became a presidential candidate. He was in Columbia days after the black state senator Robert Ford announced he was backing Hillary Clinton. ""Everybody else on the ballot is doomed,"" Ford said, explaining what would happen if Obama were nominated. ""Every Democratic candidate running on that ticket would lose because he's black and he's at the top of the ticket--we'd lose the House, the Senate, and the governors and everything."" Obama responded to Ford, though not by name. ""I've been reading the papers in South Carolina,"" Obama said before using a preacher's cadence to paraphrase Ford's remarks. ""Can't have a black man at the top of the ticket."" The crowd booed. ""But I know this: that when folks were saying, We're going to march for our freedom, they said, You can't do that."" The audience roared. ""When somebody said, You can't sit at the lunch counter. ... You can't do that. We did. And when somebody said, Women belong in the kitchen, not in the boardroom. You can't do that. Yes we can."" The crowd responded by chanting: ""Yes we can."" The crowd was right. Yes they could. Obama was elected. Now, the program he was elected to pass has stood up to what may prove to be its final test. But he would like to add other things to his legacy. His trip to South Carolina to mourn the victim of a racist attack, perpetrated with a handgun, reminds him that the America he referred to in his remarks Thursday, and eight years ago, still has challenges before it that he would like to address in the dwindling number of days he is in office. Perhaps mindful of those duties and that clock, Obama ended his otherwise triumphant remarks on a pragmatic note: ""Let's get back to work."""

Sometime after the pictures were taken, Roof allegedly shot dead nine parishioners at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, using a legally acquired 45-caliber Glock handgun after passing a background check. On Monday, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley announced that the Confederate flag would be removed from State House grounds, calling it ""a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally offensive past."" In the space of 24 hours, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and Walmart all stopped selling products featuring the Confederate banner. Google stated Tuesday that it would scrub the flag from ads and Google Shopping. Several flag makers say they will stop manufacturing the flag. Today, the governor of Alabama has ordered the removal of the flag from state Capitol grounds. Almost literally overnight, the chimera of consensus around the Confederate flag as a divisive but misunderstood symbol of ""heritage"" or ""Southern pride"" fell away, revealing the banner for what it is. The obscenity of the flag and the murderous racism it represents have dominated a national conversation about the American way of hate and violence for all the right reasons. The flag has also dominated the conversation for a single wrong reason, which is that most Americans have given up on achieving meaningful gun control in their lifetimes or in their grandchildren's lifetimes. Up to and including the December 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, Americans could be certain that every time a crazed man emptied a weapon inside a church or movie theater or first-grade classroom, the aftermath would produce a national conversation--just like the one we've been having about Confederate symbolism--about strengthening America's gun control laws. The conversation happened because we believed it would lead somewhere. After Newtown, we realized that the conversation would never lead anywhere, and so we found other things to talk about. In April 2007, when Seung-Hui Cho shot dead 32 people and injured 17 at Virginia Tech, we debated Virginia's faulty background-check requirements--Cho passed two checks despite a record of mental illness. In January 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner shot dead six people and wounded 13 at an event featuring Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona, the Cho debate effectively replicated itself, down to Loughner's mystifying ability to come up clean on a background check for his legally acquired weapon of choice, a Glock Model 19 9mm pistol. In July 2012, when James Eagan Holmes shot dead 12 people and injured 70 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, the debate expanded to interrogate the legal status of the AR-15 assault rifle and 100-round drum magazine that Holmes legally purchased and that had been previously prohibited under the assault-weapons ban, which Congress let expire in 2004. Five months after Aurora, in December 2012, Adam Lanza shot dead 26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-old children, at an elementary school in Newtown using a legally acquired Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle, a Glock 10mm, and a Sig Sauer 9mm. In the immediate aftermath of Newtown and with the memory of Aurora's carnage still fresh, the momentum behind securing stronger gun control laws in the United States felt more palpable than ever. Hours after the Newtown shooting, the website of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence crashed under the weight of new donations. Six states eventually adopted universal background checks. Colorado, site of the movie theater massacre, banned magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. Michael Bloomberg put $50 million of his own money behind the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. President Obama signed three executive orders on gun violence. In the U.S. Senate, Sens. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Patrick Toomey, a Republican, worked on a bipartisan measure to require background checks for online and gun-show sales. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein proposed reviving the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. A Washington Post-ABC News poll showed over 90 percent support among Americans for expanded background checks; even among National Rifle Association members, support came in at 74 percent. And then, nothing. Feinstein's proposal fell away before it could even come up for a vote. The watered-down Manchin-Toomey bill died in the Senate in April 2013. In September 2013, voters in Colorado recalled two of the Democratic state senators who supported Colorado's new gun control legislation. And in April 2015, as Holmes' trial got underway, the Associated Press cited the NRA's tally of ""35 bills expanding gun rights that have been signed into law nationwide this year,"" adding, ""No legislation the NRA has opposed has become law."" The AP headline read, ""As Theater Shooting Trial Opens, Gun Debate Dwindles."" When 20 dead first-graders cannot result in new and meaningful national measures on gun control or even in weak and largely symbolic national measures on gun control, then perhaps--if you are of a certain cast of mind--that is the moment to retreat on gun control. And we have. People will still talk about it. Michael Bloomberg will always have more money to spend on it. Karl Rove can propose the repeal of the Second Amendment. Manchin and Toomey can discuss reviving their push on background checks. Gabby Giffords can continue to fight, and when, say, North Carolina decides not to repeal permits for handgun purchases, she can treat this maintaining of the status quo as a victory--which, in its grotesque context, it is. Mostly, though, we find other things to talk about. In May 2014, when Elliot Rodger killed six people, three of them by gun, and wounded 14, seven of them by gun, in Isla Vista, California, we talked about misogyny, and we coined hashtags like #NotAllMen and #YesAllWomen.* Now, we're talking about the Confederate flag. And the next time a crazed man commits mass murder, and the next time, and the next time, we will talk about gun control a little, but we will also find a second conversation. Because those conversations are worthy and potentially fruitful, and also because we have given up. Correction, June 25, 2015: This article originally misstated that Elliot Rodger shot dead six people and wounded 14. Three of the fatalities were due to stabbing and seven of the injuries were by vehicular assault. (Return.) Read more of Slate's coverage of the Charleston shooting."

First, we must prioritize the fight. Second, we must challenge the teachings that motivate terror. Third, we must confront separatists who promote these ideas in our own country. Fourth, we must monitor networks that fund radicalization and violence. Unless, of course, the terrorism is committed by white nationalists. In that case, the rules don't apply. Last week's massacre at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina--to which an overt white racist has confessed--killed nine people. That puts it 15th on the list of worst terrorist incidents in the United States. It continues a long history of murders by white supremacists over the last 20 years. How are the 2016 Republican presidential candidates responding to this challenge? By setting aside the principles they normally apply to terrorism. Let's go through the list. 1. Make it a priority. Last month, Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, blasted President Obama for failing to monitor the self-radicalized jihadists who attacked a Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas. ""There were all kinds of indications that these two young men were being radicalized,"" Huckabee complained. ""Why didn't we see that coming? ... The sooner we realize that that level of religious fanaticism that is all about killing everybody, even other Muslims, the sooner we are going to be able to identify it, surround it, and, ultimately, defeat it."" Huckabee has expressed no such outrage, however, at being blindsided by the Charleston attack, even though the killer had detailed his radicalization online while posing with a pistol and the Confederate flag. On Sunday morning, Huckabee refused to say whether South Carolina should remove the flag from its state capitol grounds. He ridiculed the notion that the flag question ""has anything to do whatsoever with running for president,"" arguing, ""People want their president to be focused on the economy, keeping America safe, some really big issues for the nation. I don't think they want us to weigh in on every little issue in all 50 states."" 2. Target the teachings. Several months ago, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham accused Obama of ignoring the doctrines that inspire Islamic jihadists. ""Their way of life is motivated by religious teachings that require me and you to be killed, or enslaved, or converted,"" said Graham. ""Their religious teachings compel them to come after us ... If you don't admit that, you can't fight the war."" The Charleston shooter, too, was inspired by doctrines of enmity, enslavement, and extermination. But Graham isn't interested in these teachings. ""We're not going to give this guy an excuse about a book he might have read or a movie he watched or a song he listened to or a symbol out anywhere,"" Graham told CNN. ""It's not the book, it's not the movie, it's not the flags, it's him."" On Monday, after ducking the Confederate flag question for days, Graham finally agreed it should be taken down. But he hasn't changed his view that the flag and other Confederate symbols played no causal role: ""The problems we have in South Carolina and throughout the world are not because of a movie or symbols. It's because of what's in people's hearts."" 3. Stamp out separatism. Earlier this year, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal blamed the global spread of Islamic extremism on weak Western governments that allow parts of their countries ""to operate in an autonomous way."" He claimed that ""radical Islamists have been given too wide a berth to establish their own nation within a nation. ... We will never allow for any sect of people to set up their own areas where they establish their own set of laws."" So what does Jindal say now about the separatist flag that flies in South Carolina? On Saturday, he demurred: ""We'll let the states decide that."" The next day, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who has warned of creeping sharia in the United States, was even more obsequious:"	How Republicans Fight Terrorism, Unless It's Committed by Racists
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/juneteenth_the_black_american_holiday_everyone_should_celebrate_but_doesn.html	"Last year, Jamelle Bouie explained the significance of the underappreciated holiday of Juneteenth, which is celebrated today. The article is reprinted below. Officially, the Emancipation Proclamation freed ""all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State"" where the residents were ""in rebellion against the United States."" In practice, it applied only to those slaves who lived near Union lines, where they could make an easy escape or take advantage of the Northern advance. News of emancipation would move slowly, which would be compounded by the mass migration of slave owners, who fled their holdings in Louisiana and Mississippi--slaves in tow--following the Union victories at New Orleans in 1862 and Vicksburg in the spring and summer of 1863. Tens of thousands of slaves arrived in Texas, joining the hundreds of thousands in the interior of the state, where they were isolated from most fighting and any news of the war. Indeed, Union attempts to occupy Texas were limited to the coastlines--far from the densest slave populations--or repelled before they had a chance to succeed. As such, for the next two years, slaves and slave holders lived at a far remove from the events of the eastern United States, including the surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia in April 1865. Yes, it ended the war, but it didn't end the conflict, as fighting continued on the far borders of the Confederacy. And so, when Gen. Gordon Granger entered Galveston, Texas, on June 19 to lead the Union occupation force, he wasn't just faced with Confederate remnants (the Army of the Trans-Mississippi, for example, had surrendered only a month prior); he had to deal with ongoing slavery in defiance of the Emancipation Proclamation. To fix the situation, he issued an order:"	The Black American Holiday Everyone Should Celebrate but Doesn't
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/unions_help_defeat_president_obama_s_trade_bill_why_labor_wins_or_loses.html	"Last week, newspapers and news sites splashed headlines announcing labor's big victory blocking the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Obama's trade deal. It has been quite a while since words like win and labor appeared in the same headline. A few weeks back, even AFL-CIO leaders didn't expect they and their progressive allies could derail the fast-track trade authority that the Democratic president, most Republicans in Congress, and nearly every big corporation in the land urgently sought. But what did labor actually win? If the TPP bill does not pass, more manufacturing jobs will probably stay at home. Yet, by itself, that would do little to reverse the long decline of union membership in the private sector, which now stands at just above 6 percent. Few American employers are willing to sign a union contract when they can get away with offering lower wages and fewer benefits. The hard struggle the AFL-CIO just spearheaded could become yet another example of a long, ironic tradition in labor politics: When union activists fight for issues that clearly affect large numbers of ordinary people, they often win. But when they try to persuade voters and legislators to defend or expand the membership of their own organizations, they usually lose. Some of labor's gains on larger issues occurred when the movement itself had few rights employers or the courts felt bound to respect. The movement's earliest big triumph was one every good progressive would condemn today: a ban on the immigration of Chinese laborers that Congress passed in 1882.  Fledging, white-only unions in the West led the campaign to enact a measure to protect their fellow ""meat-eaters"" from the competition of underpaid ""rice-eaters"" from East Asia. Soon, labor had better causes to advocate. During the early 20th century, unions represented less than 10 percent of American workers. But the AFL, led by Samuel Gompers, still managed to get Congress to make Labor Day a federal holiday, to lobby states and cities to enact workplace safety laws, and, in 1916, to secure an eight-hour day for railroad employees--then the most essential group of wage-earners in the nation. Even many lawmakers who disliked unions understood these measures had the support of most of their constituents. But until the 1930s, unions failed to get Congress to enact laws to protect their organizers from being fired or boycotters from having to pay big fines for allegedly violating anti-trust laws. It was fairly easy for the National Association of Manufacturers and other employer groups to argue that unions existed only to protect the privileges of skilled workers and sometimes used coercion and violence to get their way. But the Great Depression badly sullied the image of big business, and a wave of massive strikes by non-union workers in 1934 ushered in a great, if one-time, legislative victory. The Wagner Act, passed in 1935, set up the federal machinery that enabled millions of wage earners who wanted union recognition to achieve it. Franklin D. Roosevelt and his allies in Congress justified the Wagner Act as essential to boosting purchasing power, not as a step toward industrial democracy (which it was). But labor's ""Magna Carta"" did help the AFL and the new CIO to quintuple their combined membership to 15 million by the end of the World War II. The unprecedented surge did not, however, protect labor from the attacks of its powerful, pro-corporate adversaries. After the Republicans won control of Congress in 1946, they quickly enacted the Taft-Hartley law, which allowed states to pass ""right-to-work"" legislation and made a variety of union organizing tactics illegal. As labor's numbers have dropped in recent decades, its officials have repeatedly tried and failed to persuade even Democratic presidents and legislators to shift the laws back in their favor or to enforce the Wagner Act with rigor. Despite its explicit provisions, thousands of workers get fired every year for trying to organize a union. Yet labor activists still kept pushing for major reforms that did little or nothing to boost their own ranks. Most of the black men and women who organized the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom were union activists. And AFL-CIO lobbyists made sure the Civil Rights Act of 1964 included Title VII--the landmark ban on employment discrimination. They were also a key part of the coalition that supported Medicare and Medicaid--and decades later, the Affordable Care Act. More recently, at the urging of labor-heavy coalitions, Seattle, Los Angeles, and other big cities have enacted big boosts in the minimum wage. Around the country, the Service Employees International Union--the SEIU--has coordinated one-day strikes by fast-food workers demanding $15 an hour. These discontented burger-flippers may want to join a union, but there is scant pressure on McDonald's franchises to recognize one. Meanwhile, GOP legislators have passed ""right-to-work"" laws in Michigan and Wisconsin, imperiling existing unions in states where the power of the Teamsters and United Auto Workers once seemed impregnable. And without his union-busting triumphs, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker wouldn't be a serious candidate for the Republican Party's nomination. ""Standing up to big labor"" remains a winning strategy, even when unions represent just 11 percent of the public and private workforce and, in many places, are fighting to survive. In launching her campaign speech at Roosevelt Island last weekend, Hillary Clinton mentioned unions only twice, in passing. She said nothing about defending their right to organize. ""This is a significant day,"" declared AFL-CIO president Rich Trumka, rather hyperbolically, after last week's vote against the trade bill. ""American workers came together and spoke with one voice about the path their country and economy should follow."" But unless the day arrives soon when those workers speak as loudly about their need for representation on the job, that path will resemble Walker's Wisconsin more than Roosevelt's America."

The economy was weak, Americans were dissatisfied, and still Republicans lost to President Obama, unable to raise turnout or peel enough voters from the Democratic coalition. From the higher view of history, however, this was typical. Absent a disaster--war, recession, or preferably both--it's hard to beat an incumbent president. In 1948, Harry Truman had the turbulent aftermath of a war, but also a blistering economy. He won. In 1956, Dwight Eisenhower had steady growth and relative peace. He won with a landslide. Lyndon Johnson, running in Kennedy's stead, won on the strength of the president's memory and a healthy economy, and Richard Nixon's second term was a feat of strong growth, despite the war in Vietnam. Ronald Reagan, like Eisenhower, had growth and relative peace, as did Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. George W. Bush was mired in a souring war, but the economy was just strong enough to fill the sails of his presidency. Overall, between the end of the World War II era and the present, just three men--Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush--have failed to win a full eight years in the White House on their own feet as candidates. (Gerald Ford is a special case.) What's truly unusual in American politics is the threepeat. After two terms, voters tend to move on to the other party, either as a correction, or just to try something different. The three exceptions, in the 20th century, were the 1920s--when a presidential death and a presidential retirement gave us 12 years of Republican governance--the '30s and '40s--where Democrats held the White House through 20 years of depression and war--and the 1980s, when Republicans held it through the end of the Cold War and into the 1990s. As extremely novel events, those periods changed the political landscape. The moderate, more internationalist Republican Party that emerged out of five terms of Democratic leadership and New Deal economic policy was markedly different than the conservative one that governed through the 1920s, while the Democratic Party took a right turn after losing to Reagan and George H.W. Bush in three consecutive contests. Which brings us to the present. Writing for the Washington Examiner, Philip Klein says--with some hyperbole, but not much--that Republicans should just disband the party if they can't beat Hillary Clinton. ""All she has going for her,"" says Klein, after a negative review of her campaign speech on Saturday, ""is the hope that pushing the right buttons on identity politics and promising new government benefits, Americans will overlook what they don't like."" She's so bad, he says, that if Republicans can't ""nominate a formidable candidate to put against a Democrat with lots of baggage,"" they might as well ""throw in the towel."" Clearly, Klein is exaggerating. But he nods to something that's true: If Republicans lose in 2016--and give Democrats a rare and coveted third term--the party will have to change. Indeed, it will change, and the force will come from within the GOP, from groups and interests that would rather have power than purity. And that's especially true if a conservative candidate like Gov. Scott Walker loses, because then, conservatives can't lean on purity--""Mitt Romney/John McCain wasn't conservative enough""--to explain a loss. And a loss is a big deal. After all, what does 12 (or 16) years out of the White House mean for a political party? It means you can't reverse key policies--like the Affordable Care Act--without a huge backlash. It means you don't have a stamp on the federal bureaucracy--your hires have either left or retired--and you've lost your step on the federal judiciary. It means a less friendly Supreme Court--with consequences that stand for decades--and it means less influence on the international stage. In short, it's a disaster. Now, I sit on the left of American politics, and from here, it looks like Republicans have to move away from their base. Americans aren't liberal, but they don't want the hard conservatism of the past six years, and they aren't for the exclusion--of immigrants, of LGBT Americans--that's come from some of the loudest voices in the GOP coalition. But that's a self-interested diagnosis. Just as possible is a GOP that stays in its place on government and the economy--tax cuts and a smaller welfare state--but adopts a more cosmopolitan outlook that pulls right-leaning voters from emerging groups like Latinos and Asians. On the other end, there's a GOP that moves left on government--but becomes more culturally conservative--or one that stays where it is in most places but tries to outflank the Democratic Party on issues outside the left-right divide, like criminal justice reform. Whether or not you think these are plausible paths for the GOP--in one way or another, they reflect options on the table in this election cycle--is less important than the reality of the party's position; if it loses, it will buckle to pressure for reform. If there's a caveat--something to keep events from ""breaking the fever"" of the party's conservative movement--it's if Republicans nominate a more moderate candidate like Jeb Bush or Gov. John Kasich. Then, as with nominees past, conservatives could ignore the loss, and keep pressing for the same old losing formula."	Why a Clinton Victory Would Be Good News for Republican Moderates
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/jeb_bush_announces_his_presidential_campaign_the_former_florida_governor.html	"MIAMI--Jeb Bush likes to think of himself as a high-tech candidate, and his presidential announcement could have fit on Snapchat: ""I know we can fix this. Because I've done it."" He wrapped that message in a more-than-20-minute speech to raucous supporters packed in the Miami Dade College auditorium. It marked the official admission that he was running for president after six months of activity that looked remarkably similar to campaigning. Bush's message was about competence and compassion. He highlighted his time as governor and the results he achieved, and he said that was a template for how he would act as president. He also emphasized the skill set he thinks should shrink the field of contenders. ""As our whole nation has learned since 2008, executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that."" That was a shot at Sen. Marco Rubio and the other senators. ""There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd or filing an amendment and calling that success."" It was a one-two punch. ""We are not going to clean up the mess in Washington by electing the people who either helped create it or have proven incapable of fixing it."" That resonated with the audience who remembered him and the kinds of things that only governors could do. ""I'm all in for Jeb,"" said Elaine Lutz, an attendee. She explained that ""during the hurricane we were out of power for two weeks. In the dark he was the voice on the radio."" Vinicio Icabalceta, 24, said, ""I prefer Jeb over Marco. Obama showed us what an inexperienced president can do."" He went on to say that he was only attending the rally because his father was a Jeb Bush supporter. He actually preferred a different executive, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who he said was more conservative and who he thought had been a more active fighter in the conservative battles of the past few years. ""Bush didn't even endorse Romney,"" he said. At times Bush's announcement felt like an effort to blot out all of the mistakes Romney made. In a pre-speech video, a mother attested to Bush's compassion for those with disabilities, and he was seen hugging a young girl in a wheelchair. A young black woman said Bush's school-choice policies had allowed her to get an education and go on to college. (School choice was emphasized a lot during the event, a signal to conservatives that he was one of them, despite what they might have heard about his position on Common Core.) He was introduced by a black minister, and a Hispanic singing group warmed up the crowd. When Bush spoke fluently in Spanish, it was not the drive-by Spanish some candidates mangle. It was a fluent couple of paragraphs that seemed fitting given the constant sound of Spanish in conversation throughout the crowd. This is Jeb Bush's argument against the other governors. While they might be able to match his executive experience, he can attract minority voters while presenting a more compassionate and appealing image of the Republican Party. It was a nearly flawless execution of the indoor-rally form. Staffers moved elderly spectators to different seats when it looked like there might be a hole in the audience cameras might catch. Other staffers clapped like they were trying to break walnuts during moments of applause. It wasn't needed. When Bush announced that he was running for president--the least surprising news on the planet--the audience exploded. They clapped enthusiastically even for lines that offered no obvious reason why they would elicit such a response. Bush, who normally rivals Hillary Clinton in his wooden delivery, has clearly been practicing the set-piece speech, and the practice paid off. Not everything could be choreographed. At one point, a group of protestors stood up and tried to interrupt. Sitting in a row, their shirts spelled out ""Legal Status is Not Enough""--referring to Bush's immigration position. The crowd responded by trying to drown them out. Bush looked irritated and spoke to the protesters with a flash of anger. ""By the way, just so that our friends know, the next president of the United States will pass meaningful immigration reform, so that that will be solved--not by executive order!"" Bush also took care of some unfinished business in some of the best-delivered lines of the speech. He addressed the dynasty charge this way: ""Not a one of us deserves the job by right of resume, party, seniority, family, or family narrative. It's nobody's turn. It's everybody's test, and it's wide open--exactly as a contest for president should be."" In other words, he doesn't expect the nomination to come from anything other than hard work. He nodded to his father and brother in an oblique but charming way. ""In this country of ours, the most improbable things can happen. Take that from a guy who met his first president on the day he was born, and his second on the day he was brought home from the hospital."" The two men were not in attendance to see him make a go at the family business, though his mother was. She once opposed the campaign. She's on board now.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/hillary_clinton_s_roosevelt_island_speech_the_democratic_frontrunner_holds.html	"ROOSEVELT ISLAND, New York--Hillary Clinton's campaign held a grand opening on Roosevelt Island on Saturday. She reiterated that she wants to be a ""people's champion,"" fighting to rebalance an economy that has been tilted toward the ""billionaires and corporations."" She aligned herself with factory employees and food-service workers ""who stand on their feet all day,"" and said she was running ""for the nurses who work the night shift, for the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us. For the veterans who serve our country. For the small business owners who took a risk."" Her candidacy, she said, would be a fight ""for everyone who's been knocked down but refused to be knocked out."" The event had all the things we've come to expect in a modern political rally--a stage that allows the candidate to appear to be bathing in the crowds from all camera angles, vast screens showing the spectacle to those without choice seats, campaign videographers grabbing vignettes to deliver over social media, organizers signing up volunteers, and teleprompters rising before the candidate, who stares into trash-can-sized lights that bathe her in just the right kind of glow, even though it's a bright sunny day. This wasn't the start of Clinton's campaign, despite the confusing declaration that it was the ""official launch."" It was more like a restaurant that operates for two months before inviting everyone in the neighborhood with a great banner and free mimosas. Or perhaps it was like the distinction between preseason football and the regular season. Or, more appropriate for its New York setting, the event was the Broadway opening of a show that's been off-Broadway. I wasn't the only one rooting around for a metaphor. ""It's a hard launch,"" said Claire Lipschultz, who attended the rally. ""We had the social media launch, which connected with those that are attached to social media, we know she visited small tables of people in Iowa and New Hampshire, but this is really the announcement to America.""* The event was as choreographed as the ones that have defined the soft launch over the past two months. But campaign aides promise that once Clinton is in this new phase, she will be more accessible to the press, doing regular interviews, and making her policy case. Instead of the slow pace we've seen so far, where Clinton and her team were often on defense, they will now go into a higher gear. There will be policy speeches, events where she mixes it up more with the press and voters, and a greater attempt to try to drive the conversation. A campaign adviser says that the reason for the two stages was to give Clinton a chance to knock the rust off and find her comfort level. She does not groove on the fussy sweat and jostle of the campaign trail like some politicians. Also, they point out, because she is treated like royalty, the campaign had to start slow, or it would reinforce the image that she is running as royalty and not as a politician. With such a stunning background, the speech sounded at times like the State of the Union, with long passages devoted to listing policy goals (expansion of broadband!). Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just that if you're going to haul out the echo of Eleanor and Franklin and present such a tableau, it does tickle expectations for a more musical speech. We'd been told Clinton was going to tell her mother's story, but she didn't do it as well as she did in a speech in front of camp counselors in March. This matters because these speeches are an effort to show voters where she comes from, what keeps her going, and why they know her drive is felt in her bones, not simply asserted. There were occasions when the recitation of policy objectives flirted with becoming background music to the whistle of the wind in the small-leaf Linden trees and the dive-bombing dragonflies. But the State of the Union approach may be a feature and not a bug. An event like this is not about the audience. It isn't an argument of the kind Bill Clinton used to make. It is a buffalo that is cut up and passed around in social media. So anyone who cares about the environment will see her committed to that in a gorgeous setting. So too, those who are moved most by promises to provide paid family leave. In the age of precise narrowcasting, Clinton offered something that can be shipped to people of all interests. Plus, for a candidate who clearly loves policy and is running at a time when people are wary of high rhetoric, it probably doesn't hurt to be defined as obsessed with policy. The best rhetorical flourishes came near the end of her remarks. ""I've spent my life fighting for America--I'm not stopping now,"" she said. ""I've been called a lot of things, by many people, but quitter is not one of them."" In 2008, when Clinton dropped out of the race, she said that the 18 million votes she received were ""18 million cracks"" in the most durable glass ceiling. On Saturday, wearing a pantsuit as blue as the sky above, she said she was running ""with absolutely no ceilings."" It was one of several nods to her gender. ""I may not be the youngest candidate in this race, but I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States,"" she said, in one of the speech's best lines. At the end of her remarks, Clinton vowed to deliver an ""America where a father can tell his daughter: Yes, you can be anything you want to be--even president of the United States."" It was a sentiment I had heard before as I talked to supporters walking into the venue. George Blau brought his 3-year-old daughter with him. ""I have two older daughters and this young lady here,"" he said, ""and I want to show her, if she's determined, she can do anything. That's what Hillary Clinton means for her.""

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/hillary_clinton_s_first_big_campaign_speech_a_tough_mother_is_the_democratic.html	"Tough mother. That's both the theme of Hillary Clinton's big speech on Saturday and the emerging theme of her campaign. According to a preview of her remarks, Clinton will talk about her mother's struggles and how they guide her and her campaign, which the candidate has fashioned around four tough fights. Since announcing her campaign in April, at every stop Clinton has said she will advocate for families, remove money from politics, increase wages for the middle class, and protect America. How is she going to do these things? She's going to fight. The speech, like all campaign speeches, is an attempt to define the terms of the election in a way that highlights the candidate's attributes. (My presidential campaign, for example, would be founded on the obvious truth that the American dream can only be restored through asides and rejoinders made by blond, middle-aged fathers.) If Clinton is a scrappy fighter, why not define the election that way? It's not a stretch. This is what voters talk about when they describe what they want in a candidate. Does the candidate get my life and will she go to bat for me? Does she have my back? Political scientists will tell you that if voters forge that kind of connection with a candidate, they will then project all kinds of other favorable qualities on that person. Clinton's strategy is one her husband often employed. No matter what personal or political troubles Bill Clinton found himself in, he always presented himself as a tireless fighter, someone who'd go into pitched battle for voters. The blunt political calculation is that even if voters don't find Hillary Clinton trustworthy--and only 42 percent do in a recent CNN poll--they will support the person who they think will fight for their interests. As Ron Brownstein has argued, Hillary Clinton doesn't need Americans to trust her. Fight, fight, fight. Clinton rarely misses an opportunity to raise her gloves, even when she is making a joke about something else. ""I'm aware I may not be the youngest candidate in this race,"" Clinton told Democrats in South Carolina in May. ""But I have one big advantage: I've been coloring my hair for years. You're not going to see me turn white in the White House. And you're also not going to see me shrink from a fight."" Friday the campaign released a Web video titled ""Fighter."" (If by now you haven't gotten the message, the candidate may have to come over and beat you up.) There are other reasons the tough-mother pitch makes sense for Clinton. It establishes her genuine roots, which shows voters she is not distant from their concerns despite her newfound wealth. Bill Clinton did a version of this at the 1992 Democratic convention when the film The Man from Hope (a story also centered around a mother) helped upend the idea some voters had that he was a child of privilege. The message also allows Clinton to talk about her start in politics, which was founded around the kinds of fights she says she will wage now. She is not a newcomer to the fight for programs that help children and families. That display of continuity will help a candidate whose positions on aspects of immigration reform and same-sex marriage have changed since the last time she ran. Clinton's framing speech comes after a week of conversation--kicked off by a New York Times analysis--about whether Clinton is going to run to the left at the expense of voters in the middle or run a more centrist campaign. The Clinton team argues it's a false choice. She can appeal to Democrats by talking about immigration reform, campaign finance reform, and same-sex marriage while appealing to the majority of independent and swing voters who hold those views, too. ""It is a uniquely Acela corridor analysis to assume issues like paid medical leave or addressing corporate excess are 'base' issues,"" says David Axelrod, who is not associated with the Clinton campaign. ""The economic pressures people feel are real and broad."" On an issue like immigration, for example, a recent Pew poll showed that 72 percent of the public favors some legal status for undocumented workers, a position that is closer to Clinton's than the one held by the majority of GOP candidates. The Clinton team also argues that swing states like Ohio, Florida, and Iowa can't be won simply by turning out the Democratic base. Clinton is pushing for criminal justice reform, and so are several Republican candidates. She talks about the economic tilt toward Wall Street, and so does Rick Perry. Americans supported more government action to address the country's growing income gap by 57 percent to 39 percent in a recent CBS/New York Times poll. When she talks about portability of health care across state lines, she is consciously echoing a Republican position. If she were making a big pitch for the party's liberal wing, she would be advocating for a single-payer health care system as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sander is. If anyone would like a preview of Clinton's mother-based speech, watch this recording of her appearance before thousands of camp counselors in March. At roughly the 52-minute mark, she gives a long answer about her mother's qualities. One story she tells is of her mother's advice after Clinton came home crying after being bullied: ""There's no room for cowards in this house."" That's one tough mother."	Hillary Clinton's Emerging Campaign Message: One Tough Mother
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/jeb_bush_s_trip_to_europe_the_republican_candidate_traveled_to_berlin_to.html	"Every presidential candidate must perform certain compulsory exercises. One is that you must write a book. Another is that you must make a high-profile trip overseas, most likely to Europe or Israel. Candidates travel to foreign capitals so that they can look presidential. They wear their best suit, shake hands resolutely, and sit at long tables with good posture. We see the president shaking these hands and sitting at these tables a lot of the time, so if a candidate dresses up and plays president, we might think he's fit for the job. These trips also allow the candidates to claim greater foreign policy wisdom. So, for example, if you ask Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker about foreign policy, he will tell you about his recent trip to Israel. And it works for him. Here's the first paragraph of a Des Moines Register story: ""Fresh off a trip to Israel, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told a crowd in West Des Moines that what he saw there only reaffirms his belief that America should take a stronger stance against terrorism."" It's fine to travel and give a speech, but these foreign forays are an attempt to turn a trip through customs into competence. That should make us suspicious, but for Republicans it poses two additional challenges. First, it suggests that competence is related to the number of stamps in your passport, which enters you into a competition with Hillary Clinton, whose passport probably looks more like a phonebook. Second, it means you're following Sen. Barack Obama's strategy in 2008. Republicans criticized Obama's trip to Berlin that year as a meaningless show and complained his trip to Iraq told us nothing about his ability to understand foreign policy. Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina gets big applause at GOP gatherings when she punctures Clinton's boast about all the traveling she's done. ""Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike her, I have actually accomplished something."" The message is clear: Air miles are meaningless. If that's true, and travel in the service of your country tells us nothing, then it must certainly be true that trips conceived by candidates to foreign capitals for photo ops are even less meaningful. Obama took this practice of foreign circus shows to extravagant heights when he headed to Berlin in 2008. His message was that he would be the antidote to George W. Bush. He did not need to go to Europe to deliver this message. The point, however, was to show how much the world would adore an antidote to a president who at the time had a 30 percent approval rating on foreign policy. It was a particularly useful stunt when 200,000 people showed up to hear him speak. It showed that he might improve America's standing in the world, an idea that appealed to a lot of voters. This week Jeb Bush traveled to Berlin to present himself as the antidote to Obama. It too was a show (though nothing close to Obama's display) meant to convey that he would be strong and wouldn't let Vladimir Putin get away with any more shenanigans. It was destined to be a less convincing performance than Obama's because Bush doesn't have the clear shot that Obama had when he took his trip. The public doesn't overwhelmingly approve of President Obama's handling of foreign affairs--46 percent approve, and 49 percent disapprove--but that's nowhere near the condemnation George W. Bush faced. Also, Jeb Bush's message wasn't as attractive as what Sen. Obama was selling. When Obama promised to get America out of the wars it was fighting, people loved that idea. Bush preached toughness, but even his tough talk contained some of the same nuance he derided in Obama. While saying Putin was a bully, Bush also said it would be unwise to push Putin into a corner. It is almost certain that Bush will find lots of opportunities to refer to his European tour in the days ahead, especially after he officially announces next week that he's running for president. (Since he has been running for a while, it's really an admission more than an announcement.) But what do these trips really tell us about the candidates? In 2008, Obama traveled to Iraq, looked commanding in sunglasses and then didn't show any evidence that the trip had done anything other than confirm everything he believed before he got on the plane. That is the problem with putting too much weight on these candidate trips. They promote a Holiday Inn Express theory of presidential travel. Candidates take these trips, refer to them to give ballast to their foreign policy views, but then they don't talk about what they actually learned that gave them the expertise that they hope we see in them. Candidates want us to believe that they learned something--otherwise, why bother going?--but don't want to admit it because anything that seems too revelatory might be a fact you should already have known. If there's one thing that we've learned about presidential candidates who become presidents, it's that their foreign policy promises are the ones that get most shredded by contact with reality. President Clinton shamed George H.W. Bush for being too soft on China and then worked to grant China most-favored-nation status. George W. Bush promised a humble foreign policy and then launched two wars and tried to transform parts of the Middle East into a democracy. Barack Obama promised to get the United States out of wars in the Middle East. This week he announced more troops are going to Iraq to help in the fight against ISIS. Candidates have gotten very good at choreographed foreign policy displays. History has also shown that it is very good at undoing them."

Which Republican Presidential Candidate Is the Most Macho?
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/hillary_clinton_is_politicizing_voting_rights_the_democratic_frontrunner.html	"Hillary Clinton spoke at Texas Southern University last week, where she put forward some good and provocative ideas for improving our elections. She wants Congress to fix the part of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court gutted in 2013. She wants to expand early voting periods nationally to at least 20 days. And most provocatively, she advocates automatic universal voter registration across the country, including a program to automatically register high school students to vote before their 18th birthdays. But the partisan way she's framed the issue--by blaming Republicans for all the voting problems--makes it less likely these changes will actually be implemented should she be elected president. Instead, she's offering red meat to her supporters while alienating the allies she would need to get any reforms enacted. On substance, Clinton's ideas are excellent. Since the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby County decision, jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting, such as Texas and North Carolina, have passed or put into place new restrictive voting rules. Before Shelby County, these laws could not go into effect unless these jurisdictions proved that the changes would not make minority voters worse off--something Texas could not prove and North Carolina likely would have failed to prove had it been put to the test. Early voting, especially in-person voting, can be done in ways that both make voting more convenient and take the pressure off the polls on Election Day, assuring that more people who want to vote will be able to do so. I have been pushing for automatic voter registration for a long time--I advocated for it in a 2008 Slate piece--as a way of both easing the greatest barrier to voting and rationalizing and reducing fraud in our election system by having national, single voter-registration identification numbers that people would keep their entire voting lives. Not only is Clinton proposing good policies but, as Jamelle Bouie argues, it is also good politics for her to talk about these issues before enthusiastic Democratic crowds. The New York Times revealed this weekend that Clinton's political strategy is going to focus less on convincing undecided voters and more on getting voters who support her to get to the polls and vote. James Carville, a key advisor to Bill Clinton in his 1992 race for president, told the Times: ""The highest-premium voter in '92 was a voter who would vote for one party some and for another party some. ... Now the highest-premium voter is somebody with a high probability to vote for you and low probability to turn out. That's the golden list. And that's a humongous change in basic strategic doctrine."" However, talking about election reform so provocatively may also doom the chances for meaningful election reform. Clinton used her speech not only to advance these ideas but to bash Republican opponents, including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, both of whom passed restrictive voting laws in the last few years. ""What part of democracy are they afraid of?"" she asked. Sure, partisan Democrats lapped it up, but Clinton is politicizing election reform in the process. While Republicans are responsible for most of the recent efforts to suppress voting, Clinton is accusing all Republicans of acting in bad faith. That message will likely alienate moderate Republicans who could be her natural partners for reforms in the future. Slate readers may welcome Clinton calling out Republicans who are acting in bad faith. I understand that impulse, because I agree that Walker and Perry support restrictive voter ID laws not because they believe voter fraud is a real problem but to help get Republicans elected through suppressing the Democratic vote. However, there are moderate Republicans who are willing to work with Democrats on election reform when the issue is less politicized. Consider the work of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration, headed by President Obama's former head lawyer Robert Bauer and former Mitt Romney campaign head lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg. They proposed common-sense election reforms to improve our election processes--work that is being carried forward on a bipartisan basis by groups like the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Pew Charitable Trust's election reform project. Doug Chapin's Election Academy brings professionalism, not partisanship, to the field. And with a newly functioning Election Assistance Commission, moderate technocratic steps to improve our elections are possible. Or consider how Republicans and Democrats have come together in many places to support online voter registration, a great move to aid the convenience of voters who are new or who have moved since last voting. The Florida legislature passed this reform with great bipartisan majorities, and Gov. Rick Scott reluctantly signed the law, even after his handpicked Secretary of State Ken Detzner fought against its passage. The Republican Ohio Secretary of State, Jon Husted, is pushing hard for online voter registration, despite opposition from Republicans state legislators. Movement to get meaningful and good election reform requires that the issue be depoliticized when possible. Yet the New York Times reports that Clinton is focusing on the voting wars as part of her political strategy: ""By emphatically staking out liberal positions on gay rights, immigration, criminal justice, voting rights and pay equity for women, Mrs. Clinton is showing core Democratic constituencies that she intends to give them a reason to support her."" The issue became even more politicized when the New York Times revealed this weekend that liberal billionaire George Soros, a favorite boogeyman of the right, is bankrolling the effort to litigate challenges to restrictive election rules in North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Hillary Clinton's lawyer, Marc Elias, is bringing these cases not on behalf of the campaign but apparently with the campaign's blessing. The lawsuits are especially infuriating to Republicans because the Ohio one attacks the state's cutback in early voting periods to 27 days. Not only is that still more than the number of days Clinton supports but it is 27 more days than the zero days of early voting offered in Clinton's home state of New York. On Twitter I complained that a campaign is the last place to have a rational conversation about our dysfunctional election system. Clinton's lawyer Elias responded: ""Wrong--it's the best place to expose voter suppression for what it is. Worst place is in academic papers no one reads."" That may be a great position to take in the campaign. But it's not the kind of talk that is going to get Republicans in Congress to go along with a Voting Rights Act fix proposed by a President Hillary Clinton or any other meaningful reforms that will require bipartisan support. Clinton would do the country a service by leaving election reform to sober policy discussions and not campaign rallies."	Is Hillary Clinton Dooming Real Election Reform?
